The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:36,955
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,999
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,559
- What happened?
- Hey.

5
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,813
If it's suicide, it's probably because
he kidnapped Kang. If it's murder...

6
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:05,609
Who could it have been?

7
00:01:05,692 --> 00:01:08,987
Someone who wanted Jeong Seonho to die.

8
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,406
Stating the obvious, don't you think?

9
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:16,202
The body is mutilated
beyond visual identification.

10
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:18,496
Let's wait for the autopsy results.

11
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:22,959
- We found this near the scene.
- Okay.

12
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:28,506
"My father and brother killed me."

13
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,102
EPISODE 12

14
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,355
I...

15
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,524
did not kill my brother.

16
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,276
Then why would your brother

17
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,696
leave a note like this?

18
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,781
I'm curious, too.

19
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:55,158
The day your brother supposedly died,

20
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:56,993
what were you doing?

21
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,203
I was home.

22
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:00,538
All security cameras
at your home were destroyed,

23
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,499
so we can't verify who came and went.

24
00:02:02,582 --> 00:02:05,877
On the day
Judge Kang was held captive at my house,

25
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:08,380
they were destroyed in the morning.

26
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:10,549
My brother likely did it.

27
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,134
Is that why you wanted
to kill your brother?

28
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:15,971
Because he kept causing trouble?

29
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,598
Why would I do that?

30
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,770
It's not worth killing him myself.

31
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,731
I killed him.

32
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:30,485
I raised him wrong
and set him on the wrong path.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,989
No matter what anyone says,

34
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,909
he was precious to me.

35
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,619
Was he so precious to you

36
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:44,207
that you had to hold his funeral
even before the DNA results came out?

37
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:47,794
He's already gone.

38
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,095
Will they fall for it?

39
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,263
Of course.

40
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,473
Right, Justitia?

41
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,393
Oh, blue!

42
00:03:03,476 --> 00:03:04,686
It's so pretty.

43
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,104
You're wrinkling them.

44
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,899
The day Judge Kang
was held captive,

45
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:11,318
Jeong Taegyu met
with an assemblyman at a golf course.

46
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:15,697
The one preparing to propose legislation
on the redevelopment of Hwangcheon.

47
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:19,200
- Let's go.
-  All right.

48
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:20,994
- Seems shady.
- Yes.

49
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,288
When do we get
the DNA results?

50
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:24,664
In three days.

51
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,041
The burial day.

52
00:03:26,124 --> 00:03:28,168
There's something fishy going on here.

53
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,545
Why are you so quiet?

54
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:31,755
What's bothering you?

55
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:33,215
I just have things to think about.

56
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:37,802
We have time before the burial.
Let's wait for the DNA results.

57
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:39,679
Keep an eye on Jaegeol and Taegyu.

58
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:41,640
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

59
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,686
PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE
JEONG SEONHO

60
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:12,420
Must I express...

61
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:15,549
my condolences?

62
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,133
How dare you!

63
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:19,135
She's a guest.

64
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:22,597
Thank you for coming.

65
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,559
Congratulations.
The thorn in your side is gone.

66
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:26,893
Hey!

67
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:29,729
No need to pretend in front of me.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,565
I know

69
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,233
you're not sad at all.

70
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,820
You're moving
the body tomorrow?

71
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:39,406
Good luck.

72
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:43,994
What a bitch.

73
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,162
How amusing.

74
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,720
How could you?

75
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:08,602
Why did you have to go before me?

76
00:05:08,685 --> 00:05:10,687
The body found in the car
is not Jeong Seonho's.

77
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,772
What? What do you mean?

78
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:14,482
The results from the NFS.

79
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,610
Then who was in the car?

80
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:21,072
The DNA matches a wanted fugitive
who disappeared ten years ago.

81
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,240
What?

82
00:05:23,158 --> 00:05:24,576
That doesn't make sense.

83
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:26,661
That means Jeong Seonho is alive.

84
00:05:29,456 --> 00:05:32,667
Jeong Seonho was last seen
by a motel in Gangwon-do.

85
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,756
He got into an unregistered car there
and vanished.

86
00:05:40,258 --> 00:05:42,177
- I'll go back to Gangwon-do.
- Okay.

87
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,678
There's no need.

88
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,519
I'm...

89
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:53,980
turning myself in.

90
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,941
Seonho!

91
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:57,275
Sir.

92
00:05:57,359 --> 00:06:00,028
Seonho is apparently
at the police station.

93
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,118
- He's alive?
- Yes.

94
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:20,090
4 DAYS AGO

95
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,509
VIP
PATIENT: KANG BITNA

96
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,720
- Hello.
- You're here.

97
00:06:25,804 --> 00:06:27,222
- Yes.
- Hello.

98
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,306
Hey.

99
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:29,975
Where is she?

100
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,686
We heard she was being discharged
and came to help,

101
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:34,187
but she's not here.

102
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:45,198
At 10 tonight at the café
in front of the villa.

103
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,664
Where were you? I was worried.

104
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:54,374
Sit down so we can talk.

105
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,964
I was going to handle it myself,

106
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:04,134
but I thought it'd be better
to let you know in advance.

107
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,510
What is it?

108
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:07,679
Jeong Seonho is in Gangwon-do.

109
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:11,099
He has evidence of the J serial killings.

110
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:17,105
I'm from reception.

111
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,107
Can you open the door for a moment?

112
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,192
The police called.

113
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:36,041
You should have just died then.

114
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,008
We're going to use
Jeong Seonho to catch J.

115
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:53,683
I found it!

116
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,155
You got this, Justitia.

117
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,284
Hey.

118
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,036
I'm going to clean up a bit.

119
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:14,120
Hurry up.

120
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:16,122
Come on.

121
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,879
Whose axe is that?

122
00:08:23,505 --> 00:08:24,631
Why do you want to know?

123
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,261
Is it your brother's or father's?

124
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,180
I don't know. I can't say.

125
00:08:32,264 --> 00:08:34,140
Why? Are you scared?

126
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,310
That you might die
in the basement like your mom?

127
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:38,395
Shut up.

128
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:41,398
Why did you run away
with an axe that isn't yours?

129
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:46,236
You were planning to call home.

130
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,572
"I have proof of the serial killings."

131
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,616
"So help me escape."

132
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,909
Right?

133
00:08:57,914 --> 00:09:00,375
Take that to the police station
and turn yourself in.

134
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,420
And tell them who J is.
Your father or brother.

135
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:05,171
Why should I do that?

136
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,382
Don't you want revenge
on your mom's killer?

137
00:09:09,593 --> 00:09:10,844
I'll help you.

138
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,971
I don't trust you.

139
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,973
You should.

140
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:19,060
Because your brother and father
will kill you.

141
00:09:22,856 --> 00:09:25,233
Fine. Then let's make a bet.

142
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:34,451
Shouldn't we just take the ax?

143
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:37,454
No. He has to turn himself in

144
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:39,497
so we can use him as a witness later.

145
00:09:39,581 --> 00:09:42,542
But do you think he'll do it?

146
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:44,753
We'll find out.

147
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:52,886
Call home as you planned to.

148
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:55,347
If your father and brother help you,

149
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,598
I'll walk away.

150
00:09:57,349 --> 00:10:00,268
But if I'm right,
you have to cooperate with me.

151
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:01,978
What do you say?

152
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,078
Hello?

153
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:21,039
Taegyu. It's me.

154
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,374
Help me.

155
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:24,542
Where are you?
I'll send someone now.

156
00:10:24,626 --> 00:10:26,127
You won't report me, will you?

157
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:29,506
I won't. Don't worry.

158
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,384
Okay. I won't.

159
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,650
We should have killed him
along with his mom.

160
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:55,156
Well, it's better late than never.

161
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:25,061
PHOENIX INN

162
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:53,798
Where are we going?

163
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,137
Stop the car. Stop!

164
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:12,776
What the...

165
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:15,904
Who are you? Get out of the way!

166
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,199
-We are...
-Who?

167
00:12:19,282 --> 00:12:21,910
Demons.

168
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,610
-Let them go after a few days.
-Okay!

169
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,321
-How much of their memories do we erase?
-Just enough.

170
00:12:58,989 --> 00:12:59,990
Okay.

171
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:10,959
I won.

172
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:16,256
Are you really going to take revenge
on the guy that killed my mom?

173
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:17,340
Of course.

174
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,470
What are you doing?

175
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:25,223
I'm recalling what you did to me
in the basement.

176
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:26,850
Pisses me off.

177
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,186
Let's end this bad blood between us.

178
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,397
What do I need to do?

179
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:37,360
The Judge from Hell

180
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,740
Where did you get that?

181
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:45,327
He's a sinner who died ten years ago.
For perfect evidence destruction,

182
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,872
we're often asked to declare
the bodies of sinners as missing.

183
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:51,750
Our special
preservation technology

184
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,543
keeps the body fresh as if they died

185
00:13:53,627 --> 00:13:55,045
-just yesterday--
-The note.

186
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,882
I wrote what you told me to.

187
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:00,217
MY FATHER AND BROTHER KILLED ME

188
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,676
But why are we doing this?

189
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,262
To trick your father and brother
to buy time.

190
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,556
So you can live and turn yourself in.

191
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,216
Clean up the scene.

192
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,426
Yes, ma'am!

193
00:15:25,343 --> 00:15:26,928
Protect him until he hands himself over.

194
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,179
Don't worry.

195
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,141
And you. Don't hit him.

196
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:33,727
I'll try.

197
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:38,106
Over here.

198
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,361
- You called the police?
- I'm not here as an officer.

199
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:46,406
But as a family member of a victim
waiting for you to turn yourself in.

200
00:15:58,877 --> 00:15:59,878
I'm...

201
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:01,755
turning myself in.

202
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:06,259
What's your relationship

203
00:16:06,343 --> 00:16:08,094
with the person
who was found dead in your car?

204
00:16:08,178 --> 00:16:09,971
I don't know him.

205
00:16:10,055 --> 00:16:13,141
Why did you confine
and assault Kang Bitna?

206
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:14,684
I don't remember.

207
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,895
Hey, asshole.

208
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,314
You attacked Kang Bitna last year.

209
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:21,733
You were trying to kill her again
because you failed then!

210
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:25,570
Can you lower your voice?

211
00:16:25,654 --> 00:16:28,323
I'll exercise my right
to remain silent until he leaves.

212
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:29,783
What? Your right?

213
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,118
You've heard that somewhere, haven't you?

214
00:16:32,202 --> 00:16:33,245
I ought to...

215
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:53,848
I'll keep your secret
about killing Kang Bitna forever.

216
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:56,268
Nor will I punish

217
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:58,603
or legally sentence you.

218
00:16:58,687 --> 00:16:59,980
And revenge for your mother,

219
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,399
you will get it for sure.

220
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,248
My father and brother

221
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,542
starved my mother to death.

222
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,670
-Do you have proof of that?
-The camcorder.

223
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:25,839
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

224
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,801
It was in the basement, but it's gone now.

225
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,308
Is Jeong Taegyu J?

226
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:39,477
Or is it Jeong Jaegeol?

227
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,731
That's...

228
00:17:45,984 --> 00:17:49,821
You've turned yourself in,
but why won't you tell the truth?

229
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:53,950
I won't say more.

230
00:17:54,868 --> 00:17:59,039
For confining and assaulting Kang Bitna,
I will accept punishment.

231
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:02,042
So please make sure my mother's killers

232
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,252
get what they deserve, too.

233
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:07,797
Daon.

234
00:18:09,216 --> 00:18:11,051
We sent the ax to NFS for testing.

235
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,595
It's been expedited,
so we'll hear back in three days.

236
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,933
I shouldn't have said that here.

237
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,102
-I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

238
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:31,071
DETENTION

239
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:33,698
Thanks for cooperating with us.

240
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,371
Damn it!

241
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,957
God damn it!

242
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,251
I should've killed him.

243
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:47,754
Sir.

244
00:18:47,837 --> 00:18:50,549
What did that asshole say to the police?

245
00:18:50,632 --> 00:18:52,133
We don't know yet.

246
00:18:53,593 --> 00:18:56,888
Also, we suspect the redevelopment project
will be suspended.

247
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:59,099
I think the assemblyman got cold feet.

248
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,643
It doesn't matter. What I want to know is

249
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,396
what Jeong Seonho said
and when he's being released.

250
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:08,358
Because he held captive
an incumbent judge, he'll--

251
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,068
God damn it!

252
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,696
Make sure you bring him to me, okay?

253
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:13,947
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:20,412 --> 00:19:24,082
Sir, we got this information
from Nobong Police Station.

255
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,711
When Seonho turned himself in,
he handed over a weapon

256
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,256
saying it was proof of the serial murders.

257
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,301
A weapon?

258
00:19:35,176 --> 00:19:37,053
-What weapon?
-Well, it's...

259
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:45,562
Tell me now.

260
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:47,939
Sir, it's a hand ax.

261
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:53,069
An ax...

262
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,082
Hey, this is big!

263
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:09,336
Jeong Taegyu bribed an assemblyman

264
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,339
to smooth over
the redevelopment of Hwangcheon.

265
00:20:12,422 --> 00:20:13,840
Is there proof?

266
00:20:13,924 --> 00:20:16,051
A clip was deleted
from the golf course camera.

267
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:17,928
But I restored all of it.

268
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,680
They're saying the redevelopment
of that area is illegal.

269
00:20:20,764 --> 00:20:21,890
Could it be suspended?

270
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:24,392
-Of course.
-Get ready to question Jeong Taegyu.

271
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:25,810
I will, damn it...

272
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:30,315
I'm sorry, sir.

273
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:31,816
I'm just so excited.

274
00:20:32,317 --> 00:20:34,194
And as you instructed,

275
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,863
we leaked information
about the ax Jeong Seonho turned in

276
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,156
so Jeong Taegyu finds out.

277
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,491
Okay, good.

278
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:41,993
Now explain, Daon.

279
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:43,954
Why did you suggest we leak that?

280
00:20:45,872 --> 00:20:47,624
Jeong Jaegeol and Jeong Taegyu,

281
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,794
we'll make
the real criminal make his move.

282
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:53,880
That way, you can take care of him

283
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:55,924
before the results on the ax come out.

284
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:01,054
Because I think
that will help us find J faster.

285
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:13,024
You're back late.

286
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:17,779
Damn it!

287
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,453
I remember the first day I met you.

288
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:28,957
You had that same look in your eyes then.

289
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,421
Jeong Seonho has evidence.

290
00:21:34,504 --> 00:21:36,089
That's impossible.

291
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:38,842
Go check right now.

292
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,510
There's no need.

293
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:43,179
Really? We're accomplices.

294
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:44,806
No, Taegyu.

295
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:48,643
You did those things.

296
00:21:49,311 --> 00:21:51,104
You told me to, asshole!

297
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:54,482
I only made suggestions.
You made the choice.

298
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,986
Now you must take responsibility
for that choice.

299
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:12,918
Do you know why

300
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,129
I moved slowly on redeveloping Hwangcheon?

301
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:21,134
The Kylum, which you dropped in Hwangcheon
when you escaped from Hell,

302
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,678
I already found it.

303
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:26,556
In the building next to Hwangcheon Villa.

304
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,393
Where is the Kylum?

305
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:35,023
Go down and check
if the ax is there first.

306
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:42,822
Hurry up!

307
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:49,746
The candles are still burning.

308
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:53,041
Which means no one's been inside.

309
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:54,918
Shut up and check it.

310
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:41,381
Jeong Seonho can't come in here.

311
00:23:42,716 --> 00:23:43,925
Who was it?

312
00:24:05,989 --> 00:24:07,949
My hunch was right.

313
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:10,368
Kang Bitna.

314
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,343
Hello, dear.

315
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,304
I'm sure it's been stifling in there.

316
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:32,098
I'll let you out soon.

317
00:24:48,657 --> 00:24:50,617
-Is it there?
-No.

318
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:01,211
Who did this?

319
00:25:01,294 --> 00:25:02,629
Kang Bitna.

320
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:05,006
She's a demon?

321
00:25:06,466 --> 00:25:08,343
That damn bitch!

322
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:11,263
I'm going to kill her.

323
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,764
You can't kill her.

324
00:25:12,847 --> 00:25:14,558
Then what am I supposed to do?

325
00:25:15,642 --> 00:25:16,893
Give me the Kylum.

326
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:21,273
Then I'll send you abroad
along with all my assets.

327
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:23,191
How can I trust you?

328
00:25:23,275 --> 00:25:25,443
Just now you tried to abandon me.

329
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:28,905
Fine. Then hand over
the Kylum at the airport.

330
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:31,491
Give it to the person I send to you.

331
00:25:32,242 --> 00:25:34,452
And you can leave the country right away.

332
00:25:45,213 --> 00:25:46,798
Call me when you're ready.

333
00:25:47,674 --> 00:25:49,050
You'll have to

334
00:25:49,676 --> 00:25:51,386
move quicker than the police.

335
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,564
By the way, how did you do that?

336
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:23,418
Wow.

337
00:26:23,501 --> 00:26:26,254
You're so smart.

338
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:32,344
You've been writing
Jeong Jaegeol and Jeong Taegyu all day.

339
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,346
You'll wear off your fingerprint.

340
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:36,139
There's no other way.

341
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:39,893
JEONG TAEGYU

342
00:26:39,976 --> 00:26:42,771
TAEOK INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

343
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:10,882
DEMON BASTARD

344
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,468
It's all ready.
Come to the house.

345
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:32,362
HWANGCHEON VILLA

346
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,335
- That's...
- The Kylum!

347
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:55,802
- I'll come, too.
- You two stay here.

348
00:27:55,886 --> 00:27:56,887
But...

349
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,850
If we knew we'd find it this easily,
we only would've stared into this thing.

350
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,145
Shut it.

351
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:20,160
It's a forged passport.

352
00:28:21,703 --> 00:28:24,706
You'll be able to withdraw the money
as soon as you arrive.

353
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:28,418
The Kylum.

354
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:32,088
Can you show it to me?

355
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:59,199
"When a demon lives in a human,

356
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:01,284
once the human body dies,

357
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:05,413
the demon dies with it."

358
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:08,124
That's what you told me
the first time we met.

359
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:09,876
You can't kill me.

360
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,586
I'm your father.

361
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:22,806
No.

362
00:29:22,889 --> 00:29:25,183
My father died 26 years ago.

363
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:53,962
Mr. Jeong Taegyu?

364
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:57,257
-Yes.
-Please follow me. This way.

365
00:30:12,147 --> 00:30:14,107
I will check your ticket and passport.

366
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:23,450
I was told you have something for me.

367
00:30:23,533 --> 00:30:25,368
No, I don't.

368
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:28,872
Get it.

369
00:30:30,957 --> 00:30:32,584
Who are you?

370
00:30:37,297 --> 00:30:38,298
Give it.

371
00:30:57,484 --> 00:30:59,945
I killed you.

372
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:03,031
You did, in the illusion I created.

373
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:13,041
I use desires hidden deep
within humans' hearts to lure them.

374
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:18,213
What you've seen is nothing but
what your heart desires.

375
00:31:19,381 --> 00:31:21,675
You wanted to kill me, Taegyu!

376
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:29,057
Do you know why I'm sparing your life?

377
00:31:30,725 --> 00:31:33,436
Because spending the rest
of your life in prison

378
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:37,232
will be a harsher punishment than death.

379
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,486
I'm sorry I won't be able to
send you any care packages.

380
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:43,488
Come here.

381
00:31:43,989 --> 00:31:45,615
Come here, damn it.

382
00:31:45,782 --> 00:31:46,783
Where are you going?

383
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,744
Come here, you bastard!

384
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:51,204
I'll kill you!

385
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:53,248
Hey! Damn it!

386
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,960
Jeong Taegyu is J?

387
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,169
Yes.

388
00:31:58,253 --> 00:32:00,338
The forensic results are in from NFS.

389
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:02,007
"The blood on the ax blade

390
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,676
contained the DNA
of serial killer J's victims

391
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:07,178
and Inspector Kim Soyeong."

392
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:08,680
"And on the ax handle,

393
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:12,809
Jeong Taegyu's fingerprints were found."

394
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,188
- Let's go get him.
- Yes, sir.

395
00:32:17,272 --> 00:32:18,273
Yes, sir.

396
00:32:21,818 --> 00:32:23,445
Forensic results of the ax are in.

397
00:32:24,112 --> 00:32:25,363
Jeong Taegyu is J.

398
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,865
And also Satan.

399
00:32:26,948 --> 00:32:28,909
We're on our way
to Jeong Taegyu's house.

400
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:31,369
I'll get there first. See you there.

401
00:33:25,423 --> 00:33:28,009
Finally, I'll be immortal.

402
00:34:07,424 --> 00:34:09,467
It was you?

403
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:17,642
You have ten seconds
to tell me what happened.

404
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:19,853
Ten, seven, three...

405
00:34:19,936 --> 00:34:21,313
Let me go, and let's talk.

406
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:24,149
We hail from the same place.

407
00:34:24,232 --> 00:34:26,276
I'm in no mood to chat with you.

408
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:30,405
Go to Hell.

409
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,327
You're Justitia.

410
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,871
Don't you dare say my name
with that filthy mouth.

411
00:34:38,538 --> 00:34:41,541
Don't you want to know
how Jeong Taegyu became serial killer J?

412
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,627
No. Just die.

413
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,128
Han Daon!

414
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:48,381
It's related
to his deceased parents as well.

415
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:55,972
Twenty-six years ago,

416
00:34:56,556 --> 00:34:59,684
my rebellion failed,
and I escaped from Hell.

417
00:35:01,811 --> 00:35:03,855
I was injured during the escape

418
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,152
and had lost the Kylum, too.
I wandered aimlessly when I met him.

419
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:20,830
And I could sense it right away.

420
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:23,833
His bloodthirstiness would save me.

421
00:35:25,835 --> 00:35:29,422
Are you here to beg
just because you got into university?

422
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:30,549
I...

423
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:37,639
I studied really hard even after Mom died

424
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:40,725
because I wanted to be
a son you'd be proud of.

425
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:42,769
I got into Seoul National University,

426
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:45,522
Father.

427
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:47,023
Don't call me Father.

428
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,484
Your birth was a mistake.

429
00:35:49,568 --> 00:35:51,111
My one mistake.

430
00:35:51,945 --> 00:35:54,406
My wife and Seonho will be home soon.

431
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,535
Don't tell anyone you're my son.

432
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:02,205
Live quietly.

433
00:36:03,957 --> 00:36:05,000
There.

434
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,471
A mistake?

435
00:36:19,055 --> 00:36:20,432
A mistake?

436
00:36:34,738 --> 00:36:35,906
Father.

437
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,881
Damn it!

438
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:55,091
All humans make mistakes.

439
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:58,011
Who are you?

440
00:36:58,094 --> 00:37:01,181
One who will turn your mistake
into an opportunity.

441
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:03,183
A demon.

442
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:07,687
What?

443
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:10,523
You just wanted him
to acknowledge you as his son.

444
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,569
But he treated you like dirt,
and it made you angry.

445
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:17,239
I understand your desire to kill him.

446
00:37:22,244 --> 00:37:23,787
What do you know?

447
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:30,877
I'm a demon.

448
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:33,296
I know how far people can fall.

449
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:36,800
You must kill people for me

450
00:37:37,384 --> 00:37:40,011
and bring me different body parts
from their bodies.

451
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:42,305
And when all the parts are collected,

452
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,600
you'll help me find the Kylum.

453
00:37:45,684 --> 00:37:46,685
Easy, right?

454
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:49,980
I don't understand what you're saying.

455
00:37:51,064 --> 00:37:54,025
Why should I kill for you?

456
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,405
Because it needs to look like
murder committed by a human.

457
00:37:59,072 --> 00:38:01,741
I'm actually on the run.

458
00:38:07,163 --> 00:38:09,958
Fine. Let's say you're a demon.

459
00:38:12,168 --> 00:38:14,671
If I kill for you,

460
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:16,882
what do I get?

461
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:27,017
I will remove the stench from your body.

462
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:31,688
The stench of poverty
you've spent your life loathing

463
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,231
but couldn't shake off.

464
00:38:39,654 --> 00:38:40,989
If you work with me,

465
00:38:41,072 --> 00:38:44,826
you'll no longer have to beg
for money, honor, or your father's love.

466
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:46,786
You'll have everything

467
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,414
and rise above
everybody else in this world.

468
00:38:49,998 --> 00:38:53,168
Who are you to be offering me that?

469
00:38:54,878 --> 00:38:55,879
Wander in your desires.

470
00:39:39,506 --> 00:39:40,757
My son.

471
00:39:55,397 --> 00:39:57,315
I picked a good one.

472
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,360
Even from his first killing,
he was flawless.

473
00:40:26,761 --> 00:40:28,430
Your bastard son

474
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:29,764
has killed someone!

475
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:36,021
Of course, there were obstacles.

476
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:38,773
Water.

477
00:40:38,857 --> 00:40:41,026
But they were easily handled.

478
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:46,865
As if enjoying the hunt,
Taegyu expertly selected his targets.

479
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:49,409
I'm here to inspect your gas.

480
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,119
Of course, hello.

481
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:52,454
Please come in this way.

482
00:40:57,709 --> 00:40:59,920
The last one
was also perfectly executed.

483
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:03,632
Just for that reason,
you killed innocent people

484
00:41:03,715 --> 00:41:06,051
and Han Daon's family?

485
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:08,970
It's worth it. Immortality is a blessing.

486
00:41:09,054 --> 00:41:11,264
A blessing I have given myself.

487
00:41:11,348 --> 00:41:12,515
The Kylum!

488
00:41:13,892 --> 00:41:15,477
I'll give it to you.

489
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,728
I don't need it.

490
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,522
I promised I'd bring it and you to Bael.

491
00:41:19,606 --> 00:41:22,442
Don't you want to stay with Han Daon
forever in human form?

492
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:24,527
The body's already prepared.

493
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:26,988
All you need is the Kylum
to enter that body.

494
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:29,532
You can live on forever
in the way you want to.

495
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:31,660
And by your lover's side.

496
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:49,636
You are so beautiful!

497
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,929
Congratulations!

498
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,184
Gosh, the groom is so handsome!

499
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:00,397
So beautiful!

500
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:07,696
Look how gorgeous!

501
00:42:12,158 --> 00:42:13,827
So pretty!

502
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:53,575
You whom I have resurrected,

503
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:56,745
rise from the death and obey.

504
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,373
Awaken from the darkness

505
00:43:00,457 --> 00:43:05,670
and slay your enemies.

506
00:43:56,596 --> 00:43:59,599
I didn't even imagine
you had such a desire.

507
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:01,643
You've become a human.

508
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:03,186
You don't repent, do you?

509
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,604
Nor do I regret.

510
00:44:04,688 --> 00:44:06,690
Carry out
your remaining punishment in Hell.

511
00:44:06,773 --> 00:44:08,525
Don't trust Bael.

512
00:44:08,608 --> 00:44:10,527
He's the demon of all demons!

513
00:44:15,156 --> 00:44:17,784
You're wrong. The demon of all demons

514
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,494
is me.

515
00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:15,717
Now that I'm no longer
in that old man's body...

516
00:45:20,305 --> 00:45:21,973
I can put up a good fight.

517
00:45:22,807 --> 00:45:24,017
You wish.

518
00:45:49,042 --> 00:45:51,628
There are ranks even among demonic powers.

519
00:45:52,504 --> 00:45:54,256
I may be hurt,

520
00:45:55,006 --> 00:45:56,800
but you can't beat me.

521
00:45:58,426 --> 00:45:59,678
Wander in your nightmares.

522
00:46:40,302 --> 00:46:41,303
Damn it.

523
00:46:54,566 --> 00:46:57,068
I'll kill you.

524
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:25,555
Go to Hell.

525
00:47:50,705 --> 00:47:51,706
geenna

526
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:54,376
No.

527
00:47:58,213 --> 00:47:59,297
Please, no!

528
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:06,596
No!

529
00:48:33,957 --> 00:48:34,958
There.

530
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:38,295
Over there.

531
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:46,845
Incheon Port.
Jeong Taegyu got away.

532
00:48:46,928 --> 00:48:47,971
Incheon Port?

533
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:54,913
What the...

534
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,960
Why did it suddenly stop?

535
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:02,170
Seriously? God damn it.

536
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,556
Just a second. I'll fix it right away.

537
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:14,558
Damn it.

538
00:50:16,726 --> 00:50:18,436
Jeong Taegyu, you son of a bitch!

539
00:50:19,312 --> 00:50:21,273
Die! Die, you bastard!

540
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:28,905
-Who are you?
-Let's go together.

541
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:30,574
To Hell.

542
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:33,326
-Are you a detective?
-No.

543
00:50:33,868 --> 00:50:35,203
I'm the son of your victims.

544
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:43,712
When did he get on?

545
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,843
What?

546
00:50:50,343 --> 00:50:51,720
Damn it.

547
00:51:11,531 --> 00:51:12,908
It's been a while.

548
00:51:12,991 --> 00:51:16,244
Have we... met?

549
00:51:16,328 --> 00:51:17,996
The last murders you committed.

550
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,373
I'm the only survivor
of the Yeonju-dong murder.

551
00:51:21,416 --> 00:51:22,667
Ah.

552
00:51:24,002 --> 00:51:25,629
You were that kid?

553
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:29,466
It's so nice to see you.

554
00:51:29,716 --> 00:51:31,676
Yeah, you too.

555
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:33,887
I've waited 25 years.

556
00:51:38,016 --> 00:51:40,769
That's exactly what she said.

557
00:51:43,188 --> 00:51:44,189
Kim...

558
00:51:45,106 --> 00:51:46,107
So...

559
00:51:47,067 --> 00:51:48,068
yeong.

560
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:57,202
Don't move! I'll shoot!

561
00:51:59,663 --> 00:52:01,998
It's you.

562
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:08,129
I've waited for 25 years.

563
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,094
We finally meet.

564
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,575
You shouldn't have tried so hard.

565
00:53:18,658 --> 00:53:22,120
Why did you follow me? Now look at you.

566
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:31,922
Goodbye.

567
00:53:38,553 --> 00:53:39,638
Shit!

568
00:53:41,306 --> 00:53:44,017
Jeong Taegyu, you're under arrest

569
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,561
for the J serial killings

570
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,272
and for harming a police officer.

571
00:53:50,357 --> 00:53:52,442
Wait. I'll turn myself in.

572
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:56,404
Here. Cuff me.

573
00:54:36,653 --> 00:54:38,947
Does it hurt? Beg for your life.

574
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,407
You're pathetic.

575
00:54:41,241 --> 00:54:42,242
And pitiful.

576
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:45,161
-I feel sorry for you.
-What?

577
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:49,124
People like you
who don't know how to repent,

578
00:54:49,207 --> 00:54:52,294
are the most pitiful in the world.

579
00:54:53,253 --> 00:54:56,089
I'll make sure you regret saying that.

580
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:16,651
JEONG TAEGYU

581
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:29,372
This is your last chance.

582
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:31,625
Beg for your life.

583
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:33,460
You beg for forgiveness!

584
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:35,879
From all those you've killed.

585
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:38,381
Beg before I kill you!

586
00:55:39,049 --> 00:55:40,217
Even if I die,

587
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:43,345
my colleagues will catch you.

588
00:55:43,428 --> 00:55:47,224
You'll be put on trial
and punished for your crimes.

589
00:55:48,225 --> 00:55:50,435
In life, you'll rot in jail.

590
00:55:50,518 --> 00:55:52,938
In death, you'll burn in Hell,
Jeong Taegyu!

591
00:55:54,522 --> 00:55:55,649
You little...

592
00:56:06,576 --> 00:56:08,370
Is this why you were so cocky?

593
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:09,663
They'll get you...

594
00:56:12,332 --> 00:56:13,583
no matter what.

595
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:40,318
I usually...

596
00:56:41,069 --> 00:56:42,904
dismember them after I kill them.

597
00:56:43,405 --> 00:56:47,325
But I didn't want to
show that officer any mercy.

598
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:52,747
I was so angry, you know?

599
00:56:53,582 --> 00:56:54,958
So...

600
00:56:58,336 --> 00:57:00,171
I cut it off when she was still alive.

601
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:05,093
Chop, chop.

602
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:08,680
Chop!

603
00:57:08,847 --> 00:57:10,307
You asshole!

604
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,656
Damn it.

605
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:34,497
You bastard.

606
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:36,541
Die!

607
00:57:48,803 --> 00:57:50,180
Die, you bastard!

608
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:09,115
Say what you did was wrong.

609
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:10,784
Beg for forgiveness!

610
00:58:11,826 --> 00:58:13,787
From all those
you've killed.

611
00:58:17,249 --> 00:58:18,416
And from me.

612
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:22,170
I'm sorry.

613
00:58:25,632 --> 00:58:27,551
Please forgive me.

614
00:58:32,514 --> 00:58:33,723
Like this?

615
00:58:44,693 --> 00:58:47,445
The boat Jeong Taegyu's on
leaves in an hour.

616
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:49,906
I'm going to kill him.

617
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:51,491
If you kill him,

618
00:58:52,033 --> 00:58:55,829
I will give everything as a demon
to protect you in Hell.

619
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:58,164
But if you let him live,

620
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:01,751
I will give everything as a judge
to make sure he's punished.

621
00:59:02,252 --> 00:59:03,253
Legally.

622
00:59:04,337 --> 00:59:07,382
Whatever you choose, I trust you.

623
00:59:08,008 --> 00:59:09,467
So you should trust me, too,

624
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,012
and do what you want.

625
00:59:12,596 --> 00:59:16,182
The duty of a police officer
is to reveal the crime, not punish.

626
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,768
We investigate according to procedure,

627
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,770
and judges punish with verdicts.

628
00:59:20,854 --> 00:59:22,272
Legally and fairly.

629
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:24,691
Promise me.

630
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:27,694
Wherever you are and whatever you do,

631
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,988
don't ever forget that you're a detective.

632
00:59:37,412 --> 00:59:41,166
You idiot.

633
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,186
Jeong Taegyu.

634
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:04,481
You're under arrest for killing
the J serial murder victims

635
01:00:04,564 --> 01:00:07,234
and Inspector Kim Soyeong.

636
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:09,361
You have the right
to remain silent!

637
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:11,071
And the right
to an attorney.

638
01:00:13,323 --> 01:00:15,408
You may refuse any unfair statement.

639
01:00:18,828 --> 01:00:20,038
What the...

640
01:00:25,585 --> 01:00:27,379
Damn it!

641
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:31,383
What an idiot.

642
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,721
Damn it.

643
01:00:36,805 --> 01:00:38,223
- My leg hurts!
- Asshole.

644
01:00:45,063 --> 01:00:47,399
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

645
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:51,194
Detective. You were so cool back there.

646
01:00:51,278 --> 01:00:53,238
Had your parents seen you,

647
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:56,658
they would have said,
"Our son has grown up so well."

648
01:00:56,741 --> 01:00:59,536
"We're so proud of our son."

649
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:04,249
- Well, then...
- Of course.

650
01:01:20,181 --> 01:01:22,267
OLD HAG

651
01:01:23,977 --> 01:01:25,270
What?

652
01:01:26,104 --> 01:01:29,399
SOON-TO-BE-DEAD

653
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:31,610
Why is a soon-to-be-dead woman calling me?

654
01:01:31,693 --> 01:01:33,278
Can I ask a favor?

655
01:01:33,361 --> 01:01:35,697
To get Han Daon on the boat?

656
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,408
How did you know?

657
01:01:38,491 --> 01:01:40,368
I know everything you do.

658
01:01:42,996 --> 01:01:45,957
You said you couldn't protect him.
That it's up to me now.

659
01:01:46,041 --> 01:01:49,586
I was bluffing to see what you'd do.

660
01:01:51,588 --> 01:01:52,589
What?

661
01:01:54,341 --> 01:01:55,967
The boat can be stopped,

662
01:01:56,468 --> 01:01:59,095
but I can't stop Han Daon
from going to Hell.

663
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:06,436
Don't worry. Even if he goes to Hell,
I'll protect him.

664
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:53,168
COURT

665
01:03:59,883 --> 01:04:01,092
KICK KANG BITNA OUT!

666
01:04:01,176 --> 01:04:02,594
WHERE'S A JUDGE'S CONSCIENCE?

667
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:04,638
THE JUDICIARY IS DEAD
THERE IS NO JUSTICE

668
01:04:04,721 --> 01:04:07,098
KANG BITNA OUT
WE DON'T NEED TRASH

669
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:16,274
Judge Kang!
Stop handing down

670
01:04:16,358 --> 01:04:17,943
unjust rulings!

671
01:04:18,026 --> 01:04:20,028
Stop!

672
01:04:20,111 --> 01:04:22,155
While Assemblyman Jeong remains missing,

673
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:24,699
Jeong Taegyu, CEO of
Taeok Industrial Development,

674
01:04:24,783 --> 01:04:26,910
who's been revealed to be serial killer J,

675
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:29,871
will face his first trial
for murdering an officer.

676
01:04:29,955 --> 01:04:32,749
However, Judge Kang Bitna,
who's provoked outrage

677
01:04:32,832 --> 01:04:35,335
for her controversial rulings,
will be presiding.

678
01:04:35,418 --> 01:04:39,464
Thus, there are strong doubts
as to whether a fair trial is possible.

679
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:40,966
Yes, Assemblyman.

680
01:04:41,049 --> 01:04:43,843
Judge Kang will make sure
everything goes well.

681
01:04:43,927 --> 01:04:45,804
Yes, sir. Goodbye, sir.

682
01:04:49,641 --> 01:04:52,978
Yes, this is Na Yeongjin...

683
01:04:53,061 --> 01:04:55,313
Goodness, Assemblyman Jang.

684
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:57,899
Don't worry.

685
01:04:57,983 --> 01:05:01,069
As you requested, Judge Kang
will be presiding over this case.

686
01:05:01,152 --> 01:05:03,405
Yes, sir. Yes.

687
01:05:03,488 --> 01:05:07,576
Sounds like Jeong Taegyu's made deals
with many assembly members.

688
01:05:07,659 --> 01:05:09,911
It does. And now
they're all getting anxious.

689
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:11,663
The phone's ringing off the hook.

690
01:05:13,832 --> 01:05:16,585
Gosh, that's bitter.

691
01:05:19,254 --> 01:05:21,006
Hello, Minister.

692
01:05:41,568 --> 01:05:43,403
I'm sure she couldn't come for a reason.

693
01:05:43,486 --> 01:05:45,864
Think of me as your daughter today.

694
01:05:47,532 --> 01:05:49,284
And I'll be your grandson.

695
01:05:59,085 --> 01:06:00,211
DEFENDANT

696
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:21,066
You can stop playing judge now.

697
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:26,947
Bael.

698
01:06:29,908 --> 01:06:33,411
For finding the Kylum
and sending Satan back to Hell,

699
01:06:34,412 --> 01:06:36,414
I forgive all your sins.

700
01:06:37,749 --> 01:06:40,669
I have one last mission for you.
Release Jeong Taegyu,

701
01:06:40,752 --> 01:06:43,296
punish him, and send him directly to Hell.

702
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:44,673
If you refuse,

703
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:47,968
you will be dragged to Hell...

704
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:52,556
and face a terrible death.

705
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:03,149
Isn't she late?

706
01:07:10,824 --> 01:07:11,992
All rise.

707
01:07:24,129 --> 01:07:25,130
There will be...

708
01:07:29,509 --> 01:07:30,635
no trial.

709
01:07:51,615 --> 01:07:55,160
The Judge from Hell

710
01:07:55,243 --> 01:07:56,453
♪ Lost ♪

711
01:07:57,245 --> 01:07:59,581
♪ In the dark alone ♪

712
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:07,172
♪ What is the aim of justice ♪

713
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,174
♪ Justice, justice ♪

714
01:08:16,514 --> 01:08:18,266
If you don't release Jeong Taegyu,
you'll die.

715
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,935
Just wrap up the trial and let him go.

716
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:22,729
-I'm a judge.
-You're a demon first.

717
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:24,481
Let him go.

718
01:08:24,564 --> 01:08:27,776
Taeok Industrial Development building
basement level 5 wasn't searched.

719
01:08:27,859 --> 01:08:29,527
- Let's go.
- Freeze!

720
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:32,197
What is this?

721
01:08:32,280 --> 01:08:34,950
Let's make a trade.
I'll have you released.

722
01:08:35,033 --> 01:08:37,702
We need to play our parts.

723
01:08:38,161 --> 01:08:40,997
If I give Jeong Taegyu a light sentence,

724
01:08:41,081 --> 01:08:42,457
will you hate me?

725
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,792
I trust you.

726
01:08:44,292 --> 01:08:46,294
It's only right
that a criminal must be punished.

727
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:48,505
Let that be a reality, not a miracle.

728
01:08:48,588 --> 01:08:49,881
However, regarding these crimes,

729
01:08:49,965 --> 01:08:52,801
the statute of limitations
has already ended in 2014.

730
01:08:52,884 --> 01:08:54,970
That crime was not considered.

731
01:08:55,554 --> 01:08:58,181
Han Daon. She's going to die!

732
01:08:58,265 --> 01:09:00,767
-  You really won't regret this?
- Kang Bitna!

733
01:09:02,727 --> 01:09:04,396
I wouldn't have started
if I was going to.

734
01:09:04,938 --> 01:09:07,524
Don't die, please!
Please, Kang Bitna!
