Are you here to measure my blood pressure?

56
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,866
[Judge Kang] No, I'm here to treat you.

57
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,451
[Seungbin] Treat me?

Physical therapy.

Have you gotten it?

00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,587

191
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,270
[spectator 1] He's a murderer.

192
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,649
[spectator 2] I feel so bad for them.

193
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,235
Yang Seungbin clearly knew who he was

194
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,903
when he murdered his family.

195
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,615
Please accept this recording,
which disproves his claim

196
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,701
that another personality
committed the murders,

197
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,870
as evidence, Your Honor.

198
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,081
We'll take a recess.

Before the verdict is pronounced,

204
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,918
we will hear the defendant's
final statement again.

205
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,756
Defendant.

206
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,759
How do you feel having heard
your own brutal acts?

207
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:51,974
Assaulting your wife in the elevator
and repeated child abuse. God...

208
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,268
All this must have been true.

209
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,770
[Eunjoo yelps]

210
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,660
Until now,

211
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,414
I've lived for my family.

212
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,374
What the hell is he saying?

213

[people whispering]

214
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,182
I can't really hear you. Speak up.

215
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,516
Yes.

216
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:39,229
I don't remember killing my family--

217
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,357
I said, speak up.

218
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,816
Is that so hard?

219
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,529
I did not--

220
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,157
I said, I can't hear you!

Why must you cut me off and ignore me?

224
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:08,258
[Seoyul] Dowan, please don't do this.

225
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,345
The judge might get mad.

226
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,223
[Dowan] Shut up! You think
I won't kill a judge?

227
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,600
Die! I'll kill you!

228
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,186
-Sit him down.
-[guard] Sit down.

229
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:20,729
Sit down!

230
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,618
Case number 2024GoHap237.

231
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,204
The verdict on defendant Yang Seungbin
is as follows.

232
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,626
Defendant Yang Seungbin brutally murdered
his innocent wife and two young children.

233
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,421
This is a serious crime.

234
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,258
Thus, it is inevitable that the defendant
shall be given a heavy sentence.

235
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,178
However,
before the defendant lost his job,

236
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,181
he lived diligently
as the head of his family

237
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,851
and is a first-time offender
with no prior convictions.

238
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,770
These are mitigating circumstances
in the defendant's favor.

239
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,398
As for the evidence submitted
during the trial,

240
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,608
since it hadn't been submitted in advance,

241
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,321
it is inadmissible as evidence
in this trial.

242
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,323
Thus, the defendant

243
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,119
is still considered
to have committed the offense

244
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,165
in a state of insanity due to amnesia
and multiple personality disorder.

245
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,626
Thus, the court,

246
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,880
taking all of this into consideration,
shall rule as follows.

247
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,548
We pronounce...

248
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,176
defendant Yang Seungbin

249
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,928
not guilty.

250
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,013
[people gasping]

251
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,352
However, considering
the defendant's mental disability,

252
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,813
we order two years of treatment
under custody.

253
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,442
[people exclaiming]

254
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,488
[spectator 1] What kind of trial is this?

255
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,533
[spectator 2] How can he be not guilty?

256
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
[spectator 3] Let's go. This is absurd.

257
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,369
[spectator 4] Let's leave.

259
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,465
How could you do this?

260
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,385
He killed three people.

261
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,679
How can he be not guilty?

262
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,185
If it were your beloved family
that was killed,

263
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,398
would you have made the same ruling?

[Seoyul] The judge might get mad.

[Dowan] Shut up! You think
I won't kill a judge?

Sit down!

272
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,678
There's proof he was of sound mind,
but you ordered treatment under custody?

273
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,804
Why?

274
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,349
The evidence is inadmissible.

275
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,561
So in this trial, he does have
a mental disability.

276
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,148
Still, with such a crappy ruling--

277
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,316
Then what?

Where is Yang Seungbin?

How would I know that?

343
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,806
You let him walk
and kidnapped him to kill him yourself.

let him be tried again.

Donghun, what is it?

546
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,714
This seal again on the forehead.

547
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:07,882
It's the same person.

548
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,181
A passing truck found him around 5 a.m.

549
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,349
He's been stabbed all over.

550
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,186
Gosh.

551
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,022
Are you listening to me?

552
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,483
NOBONG DISTRICT

553
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,567
[scoffs]

554
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,279
They left the body
in our jurisdiction on purpose.

555
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,531
[Eunseop] This is the third time.

556
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,825
[Soyeong] What's the motive behind this?

557
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,745
Good work so far.

558
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,872
-We didn't really do anything.
-Yes.

559
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,333
That's why I said good work.

560
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,128
-[chuckles] Eat up.
-Okay.

561
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,256
[anchor on TV] The body of Yang,
who murdered his family,

562
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,258
was found a day after his kidnapping.

563
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,011
The police are on the case.
Reporter Ahn Jeongho has more.

564
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,473
Mr. Yang was kidnapped while being
transported to a treatment cell.

565
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,683
His body was found at 5 a.m. today.

566
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:03,229
The police have requested an autopsy,
but as the body is severely damaged,

567
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,357
it will take considerable time
to determine the exact cause of death.

568
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,900
-Ahn Jeongho, SBC News.
-[Judge Kang chuckling]

569
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,904
You have to break up
beef blood like this...

570
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,494
To enjoy it properly. [chuckles]

571
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878
[chuckles]

572
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:46,564
Why aren't you having more?

573
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,233
To live longer.

574
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,528
[both laughing]

575
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:56,282
Of course. A great man like you
must live as long as possible.

576
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,745
About the thing with Judge Kang,

577
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,415
I'm a bit late, but thank you.

578
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,125
Please, don't mention it.

579
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:11,171
I think of Judge Kang
as my adopted daughter.

580
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,299
[both laughing]

581
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,925
Anyway, sir,

582
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,930
may I ask why you're so generous
to Judge Kang...

583
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,934
-If not, I won't.
-[Jaegeol chuckles]

584
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,312
It's all right.

585
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,856
Judge Kang...

586
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,026
is very special to me.

587
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,864
Oh. From now on,
I will be better to her...

588
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,116
I mean, I'll look after her more.

589
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,703
-[chuckles]
-Good.

590
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:45,914
By the way, why is Judge Kang

591
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,960
living in a place like Hwangcheon?

592
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,670
Is that where she's living?

593
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,716
I'm sure it's because
she spends all her money on clothes.

594
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,635
The way she dresses is so...

595
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,472
Oh... Excuse me.

596
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,848
-Apologies.
-[chuckles]

597
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:05,059
It's all right. Please, eat.

598
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,143
Yes, sir.

599
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,937
Who did the job this time?

600
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:13,817
Some guys I'm close with in Busan.
Why do you ask?

601
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,945
I told you to make sure no one got hurt.

602
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,573
They moved people away
so they wouldn't get hurt.

603
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,659
Han Daon got hurt.

604
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,494
Why did they beat him like that?

605
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,413
I'm sorry.

606
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,415
It's ready.

607
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,211
Hey.

608
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,254
Who uses that kind of font
for a presentation?

609
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,298
What are you thinking?

610
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,426
It's fine.
At least he can write Korean. Begin.

611
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,595
It was my first time, so...

612
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,805
All right.

613
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,848
"Who is Kang Bitna? I'd like to know."

614
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,809
First, her name is Kang Bitna.

615
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,268
-Age--
-Wait.

616
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,062
Is it all like that?

617
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:51,897
There are ten slides in total.

618
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,565
[Judge Kang and Arong sigh]

619
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,442
I just need the main points.

620
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:59,613
Right. Then you can read this later.

621
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:04,076
I went to the high school Kang Bitna
graduated from to do some research.

622
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,661
She had no friends.

623
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,621
She was a serious student
who only studied.

624
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,708
And after her family sent her to college,

625
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,084
they all moved abroad.

626
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,337
No friends or family?

627
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,047
What was her reputation as a judge?

628
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,425
It wasn't bad when she was a judge.

629
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,177
But she wasn't that just either.
She was just...

630
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,140
Oh, right.
This was a photo of her before she died.

631
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,853
Why are her clothes so drab?

632
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,396
That's just how judges dress.

633
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,523
-Only you put on a fashion show.
-What?

634
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,942
-Question.
-[Mando] Okay.

635
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,362
Who stabbed Kang Bitna?

636
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,823
That's classified as a cold case.

637
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,450
And the investigation is closed.

638
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:45,826
Another question.

639
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,538
Why did she break off her engagement
to Assemblyman Jeong's son?

640
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:52,833
Well, that's...

641
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:56,378
I had no way to find that out.
There was no one I could ask.

642
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,172
Hey.

643
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,216
You couldn't even find that out
as a TV producer?

644
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,678
It's not that surprising.

645
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,513
Stop picking on me.

646
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,475
Did you just talk back to me, punk?

647
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:11,518
I'm going to rip that mouth off.

648
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,353
Rip it out?

649
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,563
This explains the rumors.

650
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,066
Justitia, do you know
what the other demons are saying?

651
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,277
They think Arong is Satan.

652
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,196
She got a bad temper and a foul mouth.

653
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,405
What did you say?

654
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,115
Satan, be gone!

655
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,950
-[screaming]
-Stop it. Stop it!

656
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,036
Both of you, sit.

657
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,554
[Eunseop] The first autopsy report is out.

658
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,807
He likely died from excessive blood loss.

659
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,185
And that marking
is the same as the others, right?

660
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,686
Yes.

661
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,772
How can there be no trace?

662
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,149
Should we go to a fortune teller?

663
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,026
That could work. Back in the day,

664
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:05,364
when officers got really stuck,
they went to shamans and used talismans.

665
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,451
[Soyeong] Do you really think shamanism
is appropriate in this day and age?

666
00:47:10,035 --> 00:47:11,995
I'm just so frustrated.

667
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,582
SOCIAL WORKER KO YUNSEONG

668
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:23,298
[Yunseong's colleague]
Yunseong took his own life not long ago.

669
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,134
He was a good person.

670
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,011
ELDERLY SUPPORT

671
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,267
You saw me cry. What are you going to do?

672
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,978
Are you going to tell on me?

673
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,022
That you saw me cry,
so I should be killed?

674
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,443
It can't be.

675
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,720
Who is it?

676
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:14,016
[Arong] Mr. Ko.

677
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,269
It's me, Uijeongbu.

678
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,025
It's so rude of you
to come into my house when I'm away.

679
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,321
You left me no choice.

680
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:33,452
You've been together for three years.

681
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,663
How is it? Is it nice to date a human?

682
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,541
Is it more thrilling than killing sinners?

683
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,043
How did you know?

684
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,796
I followed Han Daon to keep an eye on him.

685
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,799
You saw me cry. What are you going to do?

686
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,804
Are you going to tell on me?

687
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,015
And caught a bigger fish instead.

688
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,185
I've been watching you.

689
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,230
And you were having the best time

690
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,066
of your life.

691
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,776
Uijeongbu, you...

692
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:07,861
I'm not Uijeongbu.

693
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,075
Killing sinners in Uijeongbu...

694
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,411
is not my mission.

695
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,996
Secretly tracking down

696
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:21,750
pathetic demons who've become humanized
or fallen in love like you.

697
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,252
That's my mission.

698
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,716
Venato?

699
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,426
You've tricked me!

700
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,553
What if your lover becomes miserable?

701
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,723
It's easy to torture her
until she begs for death.

702
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,687
How about I tell her
that her boyfriend is a murderer

703
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,690
who secretly goes around
killing people with this blade?

704
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,820
There should be no secrets between lovers.

705
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,699
[crying]

706
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:58,662
[laughs] You don't even hide
your tears anymore.

707
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,792
Crawl quietly back to Hell and be tried.

708
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,877
Then your girlfriend will be safe.

709
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,381
Do you promise?

710
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,549
Yes.

711
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,943
[people gasping]

712
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,696
-[bystander 1] Oh, no.
-[bystander 2] Call 911!

713
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:33,947
[bystander 3] Oh, my goodness!

714
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,158
-[bystander 1] Please hurry!
-[bystander 2] Oh, no!

715
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:40,454
-[bystander 3] Oh, no.
-[bystander 4] Please come quick! Hurry!

716
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,499
Is anyone there?

717
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,089
-[devil 1] Hello, Gremory.
-[devil 2] Hello, Gremory.

718
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,467
What?

719
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,721
Good job cleaning up.
But why are you here?

720
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,973
While cleaning up this case,

721
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,183
there was...

722
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,310
There was something strange--

723
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,270
School's out soon. I'm busy.

724
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,980
-Speed it up.
-Yes, ma'am.

725
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,651
We thought she'd be done by midnight,
but she kept going even when morning came.

726
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,737
We got hungry waiting,
so we ate some ramyeon.

727
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:14,946
Skip the boring parts.

728
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,364
Right, boring...

729
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,908
Which part is fun, then?

730
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:18,992
From around 4 a.m.

731
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,161
So we went in to work around four.

732
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,253

-Total pervert.

Right?

735
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,094
-He's a mess.
-[devil 1] The body was so messed up.

736
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,763
It was unusual.
It was very emotionally charged.

737
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,848
Wait. Say that again in normal speed.

738
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,645
It was very emotionally charged.

739
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,314
Emotional?

740
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:50,482
What emotion?

741
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,002

I don't know

746
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,908
why I'm not happy.

747

I wanted to see him

I heard the victims' family was
coming to pack up their things.

759
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:51,478
I was curious about their reaction.

760
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,649
They were so happy
that they were crying out loud.

761
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,858
Happy?

762
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,444
You thought those were happy tears?

763

Then are they sad?
When the bad guy is dead?

764
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:10,038
Why did you leave
Yang Seungbin's body in my jurisdiction?

765
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,707
Do you have proof I did that?

766

Why did you kill Yunseong?

[scoffs] Rude.
Going back without saying goodbye?

771
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,761
Did you kill him because he's a bad guy?

772
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:26,137
I never killed him.

773
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,014
I only just found out he died.

774
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,767
Stop lying. I know you killed him.

775
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,978
Did you make it
look like a suicide to cover it up?

776
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,730
What are you talking about? Suicide?

777
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,941
Why not pick up a different hobby?

778
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,985
One that doesn't involve murder.

779
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,112
Wait. You can't because you're a demon?

780
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,947
Because you can do all bad things

781
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:46,157
and rationalize it
by saying you're a demon.

to transfer you

Let me be honest.

00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,865
You make me uncomfortable.

How tacky.

telling to move, mentioning redevelopment?
