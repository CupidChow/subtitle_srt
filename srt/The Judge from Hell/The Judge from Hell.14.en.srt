00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,947
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,867
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,254
FUNERAL

00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,108
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE
FROM PIGEON WINGS CHURCH

6
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,313
THE LATE OH MIJA

7
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:26,938
Have you eaten?

8
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,024
Yes.

9
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,360
And Judge Kang?

10
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,117
FINAL EPISODE

11
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,396
Patient Kang Bitna,

12
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,482
time of death,

13
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,611
September 21, 2024,

14
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,987
11:47 p.m.

15
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,148
♪ How could I find a way from here? ♪

16
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,205
♪ Lost in the darkness, fading fast ♪

17
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,150
♪ Please don't pray no more ♪

18
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:41,322
♪ 'Cause I got a trouble to solve ♪

19
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,367
♪ Tell me the truth ♪

20
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,174
She's alive.

21
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,635
You're alive!

22
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,138
Doctor!

23
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,198
Are you ready to pay the price?

24
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,249
The moment you disobeyed my orders,

25
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,460
you lost all your rights

26
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,961
as my heir

27
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,838
and as a demon.

28
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,673
Explain yourself.

29
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,301
I ruled in good conscience as a judge.

30
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:44,969
I have no regrets.

31
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,098
Beyond that door...

32
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,728
awaits eternal death.

33
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,190
That is the price for your choice.

34
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,943
Go.

35
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,413
Stop!

36
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,548
I have come here on God's behalf.

37
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,511
I am God's messenger, Gabriel.

38
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:35,436
God is merciful
to the good and unfortunate.

39
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,314
Demon Justitia is good.

40
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,901
By handing down
a death sentence to Jeong Taegyu,

41
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:47,073
she has comforted
numerous people struggling with grief.

42
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,283
And she is unfortunate

43
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,912
because she will lose her life
for having made that choice.

44
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,747
Thus,

45
00:06:54,831 --> 00:07:00,128
God has granted Demon Justitia
life once more.

46
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:06,384
You will obey God's commands
as your master, Lucifer,

47
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,970
the King of Hell, does.

48
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,196
If you're here...

49
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,826
Did you die?

50
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,662
To save me?

51
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:01,397
You are the last
good and unfortunate person I must save.

52
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,732
That is all.

53
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,028
So when you told me
to let Jeong Taegyu go...

54
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,572
It was my last test.

55
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,701
To see if you are really good.

56
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,037
Aren't you an angel?

57
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,580
Go back now.

58
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,750
You have unfinished business.

59
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,045
I guess we won't see each other again.

60
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,696
The Judge from Hell

61
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,872
Do you recognize me?

62
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,711
Gosh, how can I not?

63
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,214
Lie down. You just had emergency surgery.

64
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,841
What? But I'm not in any pain.

65
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:16,847
Wow, she really healed me.

66
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,891
Look. I'm completely fine.

67
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,354
-I'm sorry, but can you lower your shirt?
-Ah.

68
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,153
EUNSEOP

69
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,197
Yeah, what is it?

70
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,284
Jeong Taegyu's missing?

71
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,373
Medic!

72
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,708
Medic!

73
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,090
SPECIAL LEAVE

74
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,176
I heard my brother is dead.

75
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,261
And?

76
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,887
I'd like to apply for a leave.

77
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:58,806
A special leave.

78
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:00,725
Special leave?

79
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,478
What the...

80
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,814
He's gone!

81
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,232
Hey, call for backup.

82
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:09,900
Damn it!

83
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,330
The fake passport and money
you asked for during our meeting.

84
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,415
PASSPORT
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

85
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,919
The Taeok shares you promised...

86
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,215
Who else knows you're helping me?

87
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,134
Only the fake passport dealer.

88
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,595
And no one knows we're meeting here.

89
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,930
Good.

90
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,557
Can I use your cell phone?

91
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,851
Just a moment.

92
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,740
Shares?

93
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,202
What a piece of shit...

94
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,842
Are you going to kill Jeong Taegyu?

95
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,263
I'm an officer.

96
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,100
So, are you going to stop me?

97
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,644
You told me then

98
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,564
that it was up to me
to arrest or kill J when I met him.

99
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,651
I will leave the choice to you as well.

100
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:37,321
Because I'm an officer,
I'm going to track him down now.

101
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,532
It won't be long until we arrest him, so--

102
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,159
Don't worry. It'll be over before then.

103
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,578
Be careful.

104
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,718
THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE PASSPORT.
IT'S URGENT!

105
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,511
Damn it.

106
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,971
CALL

107
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,351
Hello? There's a problem with
the passport. It'll have to be made again.

108
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,437
-I will call you tomorrow.
-Damn it!

109
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,314
Shit.

110
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,663
-We got him!
-Yes!

111
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,967
We got Jeong Taegyu!
He'll be at his vacation home in an hour.

112
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,969
Good work.

113
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,599
Justitia, your battle outfit right now
is the best one yet.

114
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,018
My battle capabilities, too.

115
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,271
-And what I asked for?
-It's done.

116
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:55,983
Our advanced technology made it look
as if they just died yesterday--

117
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,359
Don't be late.

118
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
See you.

119
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,450
Drive safe!

120
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,786
Go get him, Justitia!

121
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,870
You got this!

122
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,586
I think Jeong Taegyu hit him from behind.

123
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,882
He got stabbed in the back
trying to help him.

124
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,635
It seems he fled
in the car the lawyer came in.

125
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,553
Run the plate to track him down

126
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,263
-and call backup.
-Yes, sir.

127
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,601
We worked our asses off
to lock him up, but he's already escaped.

128
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,186
We'll get him again soon.

129
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,288
Long time no see.

130
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,627
Shit.

131
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,892
Damn. You betrayed me.

132
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:54,560
And you're smiling?

133
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,146
You see, demons are cunning,
just like you.

134
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,189
Is that so?

135
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,859
But too bad for you,

136
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,403
I can't just let it go.

137
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,113
Put it down.

138
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,670
I told you to put it down.

139
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,047
Damn you!

140
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,965
I will begin your final trial.

141
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:28,052
You've already admitted
that you killed them.

142
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,846
And you definitely haven't been forgiven.

143
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,182
Have you repented at all?

144
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,808
Repent what?

145
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,269
This is going to be good.

146
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,694
I'm going to invite you to my world.

147
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,823
You will experience
what you've done to your victims.

148
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:54,244
It'll be like you're in a dream

149
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,497
that's all too real.

150
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
What is this place?

151
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,934
You killed a total of 14 people.

152
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,937
If we exclude Jeong Seonho's mother
and Inspector Kim Soyeong,

153
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,731
there are 12 victims
of the J serial killings.

154
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,941
Shit.

155
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,109
Jeong Jaegeol told me

156
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,278
that you enjoyed the hunt.

157
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:31,949
So I'm going to hunt you now.

158
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,158
Hunt?

159
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,618
Killing a person is murder.

160
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,454
Killing a monster like you is hunting.

161
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,502
But this is too boring, isn't it?

162
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,546
It will end too soon.

163
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,923
So I've prepared something special.

164
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,467
What the...

165
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,636
You have 10 seconds to run.

166
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,263
-Ten, nine...
-Damn it!

167
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,640
One.

168
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,693
Damn it!

169
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,821
He's fast.

170
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,247
Shit!

171
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,286
Psycho bitch!

172
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:12,341
See? You should have just died earlier.

173
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,177
Don't worry.
I'm actually quite a humanitarian.

174
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,930
I'll get you this time.

175
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,015
Stop, please.

176
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,898
Damn you.

177
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,008
How does it feel
being in Hell?

178
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,022
Father?

179
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,317
Welcome.

180
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,238
Now that's a cold father-son reunion.

181
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,364
How have you been?

182
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,827
Stop glaring.
I called you here to give you a gift.

183
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,004
You trusted him, but he betrayed you,
and now you're in Hell.

184
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,589
You must have been so angry.

185
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,883
You probably vowed to kill him

186
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,634
if you ever saw him again.

187
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,225
I'll give you a chance for revenge.
There's only one rule.

188
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:48,604
Whoever kills the other first, wins.

189
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,688
What? Revenge?

190
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,940
Seriously?

191
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,612
Do you think this old man can beat me?

192
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,282
Well, what do you think, old man?

193
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,926
Father, just think of it

194
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,762
as sacrificing yourself for your child.

195
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,889
Don't feel too bad.

196
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,849
I won't.

197
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,727
Because I'm not your father.

198
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,008
Get it together.

199
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,719
There's one more place you have to go.

200
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,566
What the...

201
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,196
I'm going to...

202
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,907
I'm going to kill her...

203
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,435
Are you up?

204
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,481
What is this? How are you here?

205
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,691
Do you remember?

206
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,526
Han Daon's house.

207
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,991
You shit!

208
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,472
God damn it!

209
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,102
You severed Han Daon's family members'
left hand, arm, and foot.

210
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,730
When they were still alive.

211
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,820
-So I chopped off your left hand, too.
-Damn you!

212
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:26,988
How does it feel?

213
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:31,827
My hand! Damn you!

214
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,207
You killed the people
dearest to the one I love most.

215
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,628
An innocent young couple
and their little child.

216
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,880
My hand!

217
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,507
So were
all your other victims.

218
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,092
Damn you!

219
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,511
They were ordinary people

220
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,681
working hard every day.

221
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,769
I only exterminated pests.

222
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:03,400
Disgusting pests who leeched off others
because they were poor.

223
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,737
Poor people even the state could not save!

224
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,241
I, Jeong Taegyu, solved their problem!

225
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,374
The statute of limitations
expired a long time ago.

226
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,461
Nobody cares.

227
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,255
You're the only one talking.

228
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,050
It's boring and dull, damn it!

229
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,055
That's why I will remember it
for a long time.

230
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:38,935
It's my way of comforting those
who unfairly lost their lives.

231
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,647
And the real comforting...

232
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:45,275
starts now.

233
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,779
What's left are your arm and foot, right?

234
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:52,532
No, I didn't mean what I said.

235
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,617
No.

236
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,993
Don't do it.

237
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,328
Please!

238
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,205
Don't, please!

239
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,679
No, please! Please...

240
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,056
Please stop!

241
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,099
Please stop. It hurts too much.

242
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,518
It does?

243
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,270
Your victims hurt, too, just like you.

244
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,231
They desperately wanted to live.

245
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,649
And their families

246
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,276
have been in pain for decades.

247
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,903
Don't be a crybaby.

248
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:33,198
What?
Then what can I do?

249
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,784
What can I do so you'll spare me?

250
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,540
Get changed.

251
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:42,624
What?

252
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,001
Okay.

253
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,304
I...

254
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,266
I changed. Now what do I do?

255
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:04,020
Really? Then let's beat you up a little.

256
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,001
What?

257
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,294
No...

258
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,795
No, don't...

259
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,588
That's enough. Stop...

260
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,964
Stop.

261
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,600
Stop, my foot.

262
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,952
Please spare me.

263
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:45,747
Please.

264
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,793
Apologize to the innocent victims
whose lives you took.

265
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,546
To their families
who have lived in pain their entire lives.

266
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,057
I'm sorry...

267
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,184
Mean it.

268
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,729
I'm sorry!

269
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,357
Please forgive me!

270
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,658
Apologizing is an obligation,
but forgiveness is not.

271
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,868
I hope you learn that in Hell.

272
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,249
There is no death penalty in Hell,

273
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,584
so you should prepare yourself.

274
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,879
Damn you!

275
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,551
Are you messing with me?

276
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:49,978
Sinner Jeong Taegyu has killed people
but not repented or been forgiven.

277
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,066
I, Justitia, as a demon and a judge,

278
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,403
will kill the sinner and send him to Hell.

279
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:02,615
Go to Hell.

280
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,659
geenna

281
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,535
Gehenna.

282
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,698
JEONG TAEGYU

283
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:04,756
KIM EUNYEONG, HAN JION, KIM SOYEONG

284
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:09,052
JU INYOUNG
PARK OKSUN, CHOI HUIYEON, JEONG YECHAN

285
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:14,474
HA JUNGHO, KO YEONGSIM, KWON SUJEONG
HAN SANGHYEOK, KIM EUNYEONG

286
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:17,685
LEE BORA, LEE SORA

287
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:23,608
JEONG YECHAN

288
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,612
KIM EUNYEONG

289
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:32,992
HAN JION

290
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,129
KIM SOYEONG

291
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,727
Rest in peace now.

292
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,216
LEE NARA

293
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,427
HAN SANGHYEOK

294
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,947
And Judge Kang?

295
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,245
Does she like the soup?

296
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,374
-Mmm.
-Gosh.

297
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:07,462
Why are you stuffing yourself with
funeral food as if it's your last meal?

298
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,963
Are you on death row?

299
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,593
Shut up and get me
some more meat and sweet rice cakes.

300
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,346
Meat and sweet rice cakes.

301
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,641
-There you go.
-What are you doing here?

302
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,562
The person who saved your life is dead.

303
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,481
Of course I should help out.

304
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,529
-Hello.
-Hey.

305
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,659
Congratulations. You've made it
on the news again.

306
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,744
Here.

307
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,246
While
Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol

308
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,831
still remains missing,

309
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,667
CEO Jeong Taegyu,
who escaped while on special leave,

310
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,713
was found dead
in his vacation home this morning.

311
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:51,964
Furthermore, body parts

312
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,551
presumed to belong to the victims
of the J serial murders

313
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,013
committed by Jeong Taegyu
were also found on the scene.

314
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,599
Did you destroy the evidence?

315
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,809
-Yes, of course.
-Yes.

316
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,102
Good work.

317
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,146
And as you requested,
we used the best caskets,

318
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:10,399
and our advanced tech made it look
as if they just died yesterday--

319
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:11,692
I didn't ask.

320
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:14,821
-Here.
-Right, you didn't.

321
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:31,295
The soup was a bit salty.

322
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:34,048
But the meat was good.

323
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,594
If we ever see each other again,

324
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,347
come say hello. I'll buy you dinner.

325
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,141
And...

326
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,436
thank you, friend.

327
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,739
You said you must return to Hell
once the mission was complete.

328
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,659
Don't go.

329
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:06,080
Or, let's go together.

330
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,002
I don't have to go. For now.

331
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,516
I had no idea
you'd drag an angel into all this.

332
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,355
So are you here for revenge?

333
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,858
I still have enough strength to fight you.

334
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,067
I was upset,

335
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,944
but you lived

336
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,238
and completed your mission.

337
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,283
Congratulations.

338
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:48,414
You may return to Hell immediately
and remain loyal to me.

339
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,459
Am I still your heir?

340
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,506
You are.

341
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,302
And always will be.

342
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,182
I have a favor to ask. If you allow it,

343
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,604
I will return to Hell
and become your loyal heir.

344
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,197
I got a vacation. Three years.

345
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,699
Then after three years...

346
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,371
Han Daon.

347
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,541
Humans promise forever,
though they know nothing of the future.

348
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,170
But I'm sure they are genuine
when they make the promise.

349
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,340
I can't promise you forever,
but I will promise you this.

350
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,801
The memories we build together

351
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,804
will sustain me for eons to come.

352
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,514
So,

353
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,934
be happy for the next three years,
even if it's just for me.

354
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,103
Okay?

355
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,314
Okay.

356
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,068
Gosh, my dear Daon.

357
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,737
You're too kind to catch the criminals.

358
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,974
You'll still love me though, right?

359
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,475
I will, you demon.

360
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:53,247
I'm sad, Judge Kang.

361
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,167
I'm sure it was a pain
to work with a judge like me.

362
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,793
It must have been tough

363
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,629
working with someone like me
who always cut you off.

364
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,758
-So you were aware--
-Hello?

365
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,010
Yeah, why?

366
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,516
Let's go.
I'll carry it for you.

367
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,685
I can go alone. I'll see you later.

368
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,770
All right.

369
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,531
JUDGE KANG BITNA

370
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,699
Judge Kang?

371
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,869
Leaving without a goodbye?

372
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,081
It's not like we were that close.

373
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,792
I know you two don't like me.

374
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,380
You're right. I didn't like you
because you were arrogant.

375
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,049
And I was jealous
because you were a hotshot.

376
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,219
I posted malicious comments
on articles about you.

377
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,845
I deleted all of them though.

378
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,639
And your final verdict?

379
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:54,642
Your last trial was something to see.

380
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,812
I'm sorry for misjudging you, Judge Kang.

381
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,233
There are so many lawyers these days.

382
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,319
People like you won't be competitive.

383
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,572
You think you'll be able to
deal with the annoying clients?

384
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,574
Not a chance.

385
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,537
So don't think about
opening your own law practice,

386
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,163
and just continue

387
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,374
being a judge as you have.

388
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,085
Until retirement.

389
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:26,841
By the way, are you sure
you're not dating? You're always together.

390
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,259
We said no!

391
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,095
You never know what will happen.

392
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,599
I should get going.

393
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,237
I will always pray for you.

394
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,364
Thank you.

395
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,450
There are many churches along the coast.

396
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,911
-I'm not going.
-Gosh.

397
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,915
You need to get your ticket into Heaven
and charge full speed ahead.

398
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,001
I'll make a U-turn.

399
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,669
Goodness!

400
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:06,088
I just can't get to you.
You're unreachable.

401
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:07,465
I...

402
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:09,758
I want to become a great judge like you.

403
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,136
Are your grades good?

404
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,429
Well, not yet...

405
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,556
Gosh, don't discourage him.

406
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,725
It's okay if you don't get good grades.

407
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,143
It's totally not okay.

408
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,770
If you want to become a judge,
you have to study hard.

409
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,647
-Study hard.
-You heard her, right?

410
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,567
-Yes.
-Ah.

411
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,402
You're just trying to make it less sad.

412
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,821
And you're trying to get me to smack you.

413
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,491
Don't worry.

414
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:37,369
I'll move in and make sure
to discipline him.

415
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,413
What?

416
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:43,417
But are you sure
you don't want me to come?

417
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,462
You've asked me that too many times.

418
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,550
I should go.

419
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,763
Bye.

420
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,153
Goodbye.

421
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,616
Thank you, Judge Kang.

422
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,917
2 YEARS LATER

423
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,381
I told you I'd pay you back!
How could you sue me?

424
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:34,301
Hey. Let's be honest.
You were never going to pay me back!

425
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:38,055
All right.
Please calm down, both of you.

426
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,558
-You stay out of this, Judge!
-Stay out of this, Judge!

427
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,227
Hey! Did I say I'd pay you back or not?

428
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,271
Yeah, you've been saying that
for 12 months!

429
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,398
I said
I'd pay you back this month!

430
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,816
And pick up your phone!

431
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,154
Judge Kang!

432
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,281
Oh, no.

433
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:57,741
Look at those bags under your eyes.

434
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,035
They must be weighing you down.

435
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,370
Goodness.

436
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,539
How are they now?

437
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,332
A bit better.

438
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,918
You're still pretty anyway.

439
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,503
I know.

440
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,132
Oh, right. Judge Kang,
that man is here again.

441
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,259
What was his name again?

442
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,760
Right, fabric softener!

443
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,178
Ah.

444
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,888
See you.

445
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,649
Did you wait long?

446
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,943
I fell asleep waiting for you.

447
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,195
What?

448
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,574
Should I apply
to be transferred here?

449
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,535
There's only one year left now.

450
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:45,914
Sorry, I should've requested time off.

451
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,793
You said you wanted to live
the life of a real judge.

452
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,546
That's cool. I respect you for it.

453
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,423
Still...

454
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,885
I'm being too selfish, aren't I?

455
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,596
It's all right. You were always selfish.

456
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,436
Control your strength. Please.

457
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,021
I thought my arm fell off.

458
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,106
Goodness! Do you want me to blow on it?

459
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,027
Not here, but...

460
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,695
here.

461
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,824
It's too crowded here.

462
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,202
But I don't care about that.

463
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:40,052
Seriously? Talk about timing.

464
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,721
I'm busy. Get to it.

465
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,184
So suddenly?

466
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,563
All right.

467
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,484
Oh, my.

468
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,319
What is it?

469
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,073
I've been transferred back
to Seoul Central Court.

470
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,408
Really?

471
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,244
Is there anyone you've missed?

472
00:45:05,744 --> 00:45:07,788
Not me. That's obvious.

473
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,499
I'm not sure if I miss them.

474
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,960
But I have been curious
about how they're doing.

475
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,798
I have to pack again.

476
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,966
I'll help you.

477
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,723
CHA MINJEONG

478
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,646
Ms. Cha. Let's go eat, too.

479
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,399
Right. Should we?

480
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,483
Yes.

481
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,609
Just a moment.

482
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,820
MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TEAM
MANAGER CHA MINJEONG

483
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:40,904
Let's go.

484
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,823
-Really?
-Eat loads there.

485
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,450
-It's all so good.
-Excuse me.

486
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,952
We didn't order this.

487
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,954
A woman over there sent it over.

488
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,707
She paid for your meal, too.

489
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:53,876
What?

490
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,002
She left.

491
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,088
Enjoy.

492
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,224
Mm!

493
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,602
They say you lose your taste as you age.

494
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,104
But you still got it.
It's seasoned just right.

495
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,064
What a ridiculous thing to say.

496
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,941
Do you ever stop yakking?

497
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,735
Here. Take these side dishes with you.

498
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:23,655
You have to eat well if you're going
to be a judge until you drop dead.

499
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,909
You punk!
Don't toss your cigarette butt there!

500
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,494
Come back here!

501
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,295
Ms. Kang.

502
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,590
This time, it looks just like you.

503
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,509
Really?

504
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,764
JUDGE, I MISSED YOU

505
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,561
Hey, kid.

506
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:58,315
Can you promise me
you'll only draw as a hobby?

507
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,361
Okay. I will draw you again
as a hobby next time!

508
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,572
Again?

509
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,657
Okay!

510
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,119
If you're asking
if I've put it all behind me,

511
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,789
I have not.

512
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,710
When you lose your child
and grandchildren,

513
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,757
you're just never the same again.

514
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,970
Mom...

515
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,599
But these days, I laugh when I watch TV

516
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,520
and go out with my friends.

517
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:37,938
At first,

518
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:43,235
every breath I took
was weighed with guilt.

519
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:49,449
But you have gotten better
in the last two years.

520
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,827
And you'll continue to get better.

521
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,413
I hope so.

522
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,164
CRIME VICTIM ASSISTANCE CENTER

523
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,583
My daughter

524
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:02,504
would want me to live
a normal life like everyone else.

525
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,589
Of course.

526
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,141
SERGEANT CLEANING

527
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,727
Yugyeong!

528
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,771
-Hello.
-Hello.

529
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,189
Here, let me.

530
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,941
No, it's all right.

531
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,235
-It's not too heavy today.
-Still.

532
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,906
-Yours, too.
-Gosh, I'm fine.

533
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,449
-Let's go.
-But...

534
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,452
Gosh, I feel bad.

535
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,540
That seems dangerous.

536
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,083
What should we do about him?

537
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,210
What did he say?

538
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:47,215
"I want to enjoy the little things in life
with the person I love," he said.

539
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,550
He must be crazy.

540
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,429
Mando's the one you should
really be worried about.

541
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,681
-What's wrong with him?
-Well...

542
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,791
Venerable, I heard your nose bled
while preparing for the service.

543
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,711
Even a nosebleed is Buddha's blessing.

544
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,548
I admire your valiant devotion.

545
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,052
Wait, Venerable.

546
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:37,099
If I keep this up,
I will go to Paradise, right?

547
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,604
Will I?

548
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:44,189
Venerable!

549
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:45,565
I really want to go...

550
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:47,651
HWANGCHEON VILLA

551
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:49,361
Green light, red light!

552
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,948
Green light, red light.

553
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,201
Green light, red light...

554
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,580
Whoever loses
has to buy the bread!

555
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,957
-No!
-Okay!

556
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:05,669
-Come on.
-All right.

557
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,923
-Green light, red light!
-Hey, wait for me!

558
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,842
Green light, red light.

559
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,552
Hey, do it again.

560
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,431
Everyone, fill your glasses.

561
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,349
Who's going to pour me a glass?

562
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:21,977
-Wait a moment.
-Thank you.

563
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,603
In case we run out.

564
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,358
All right.
Let's raise our glasses.

565
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,737
Judge Kang Bitna,

566
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,741
-many happy returns!
-Cheers!

567
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,167
You haven't changed.

568
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,544
But you have, I see.

569
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,795
I haven't.

570
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,590
Ta-da.

571
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,592
I tried these last time.

572
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,761
They're spicy and perfect for drinking.

573
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:58,221
-Try them.
-Okay.

574
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,682
This one is mala-flavored.

575
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,434
Let's try it.

576
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,769
You too. Here.

577
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,604
Try it.

578
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:06,688
Thank you.

579
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:11,902
-Mmm.
-Good, right?

580
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:32,631
-Should I go get some more cola?
-I'm fine.

581
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,759
You're in high school now, right?
Are your grades better now?

582
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,178
Well... yes.

583
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,554
That's a no, then.

584
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:44,434
But Detective Han helps him every week,
so he's doing much better.

585
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,977
And he'll continue to improve.

586
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,105
Yeah. Right.

587
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,775
Goodness, you're scaring him, boss.

588
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,735
Are you a boss now?

589
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,695
Well, I opened a small restaurant.

590
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,241
Everyone here gets to eat for free.
Come anytime.

591
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,034
-Wow!
-That's great!

592
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,453
Don't just give food away for free.

593
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:06,123
You'll never make enough money
and get rich.

594
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,000
I just need enough to live comfortably.

595
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,502
Gosh, of course.

596
00:52:10,585 --> 00:52:11,711
She's right.

597
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:13,839
Right, Mother?

598
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,675
Yes, you're right.

599
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,971
My mom really missed you, Judge Kang.

600
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,055
Really?

601
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,975
I know this is overdue,

602
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:28,228
but thank you. For everything.

603
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,669
The landlady hasn't changed.

604
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,463
It's good to see them, right?

605
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,008
Yes, it's been a while.

606
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,843
But the thought of seeing them every day

607
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,636
gives me chills.

608
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,556
What about me?

609
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,101
What about the thought
of seeing me every day?

610
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,688
Mmm...

611
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,321
Does that answer your question?

612
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,573
Yes, it does.

613
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,622
I really missed you.

614
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,000
A lot.

615
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,090
I missed you too.

616
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,906
That's it?

617
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,699
What?

618
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,077
How much longer do you want?

619
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,415
As much as you love me.

Okay, eat just one more.

634
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,993
I had five already.

635
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:15,246
I'll be too busy to feed you
from next week on.

636
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,414
Eat while I still can.

637
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,708
I can buy my meals at the cafeteria.

638
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,253
Oh, right! Wait.

639
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:25,882
I'm going to school, Mom.

640
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,717
Bye! For real this time!

641
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,474
Gosh.

COURT

643
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,777
WELCOME BACK TO SEOUL CENTRAL COURT,
JUDGE KANG BITNA! BEST OF LUCK!

644
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,779
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO US!

645
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:50,240
OUR PRIDE! STAR! HOT ISSUE!
JUDGE KANG BITNA!

646
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,117
WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK!

647
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,493
It's Judge Kang.

648
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:54,869
Welcome back, Judge Kang!

649
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,996
-Welcome back!
-It's great to see you again.

650
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,415
I'm your fan now.

651
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:01,709
-Welcome back, Judge Kang.
-I'm a huge fan.

652
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,128
-Good luck!
-Thank you.

KANG BITNA
COURT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

654
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,685
COURT

655
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,619
THE CENTRAL COURT'S PRIDE
WELCOME BACK!

656
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,748
Welcome back, Judge Kang.

657
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,883
I was against this.

658
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,554
Your assassination attempt has failed.

659
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,767
That reporter who's always criticized you
just published another article.

660
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:01,936
What did they say? More slander?

661
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,480
They praised you this time.

662
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:08,943
"Judge Kang Bitna, who handed
down a death sentence to Jeong Taegyu,

663
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,613
is soon to return to Seoul Central Court."

664
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,991
"She has transformed
from a terrible judge whose rulings

665
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:18,661
could make even a demon cry
into the Joker who protects Gotham City."

666
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,038
"What will she do next?"

667
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:23,374
What? Why would the Joker
protect Gotham City?

668
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,921
Wait. I'm Joker? Not Batman?

669
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:31,549
Your previous rulings
were a bit too...

670
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,263
REPORTER JO ARAN

671
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,849
Reporter Jo Aran?

672
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,351
Just you wait.

673
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:45,021
Smile. She called you the Joker.

674
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,731
Like this.

675
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,408
Namo Amitabhaya...

676
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,512
18TH CRIMINAL DIVISION SINGLE JUDGE

677
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,298
My channel, The Grandfather of Law has...

678
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,425
Bang, bang!

679
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,761
Finally reached 100,000 viewers!

680
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:01,347
If anyone objects, sue me!

681
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,225
I'm ready to take you on!

682
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,185
"The Grandfather of Law"?

683
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,938
He gives very useful advice.

684
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,773
The comments are quite respectable.

685
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,485
No one would dare leave
a negative comment on a former judge.

686
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,113
But he was a corrupt judge.

687
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,698
And you were his accomplice.

688
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:22,910
Then, I'll subscribe.

689
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,704
But I don't want to see his face.

690
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:28,499
We're getting married next month.

691
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,168
You're coming, right?

692
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:31,878
Yes...

693
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:35,256
But... how did it happen?

694
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,258
I saw him presiding over a case,

695
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,135
and he was glowing.

696
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,887
Gosh.

697
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,180
This is why they invited me out.

698
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,599
-This is why.
-It's embarrassing.

699
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:51,522
Bitna!

700
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,525
Hey! It's been a while, Dahui!

701
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,737
-Who's this?
-She's soon to be my sister-in-law.

702
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,364
Oh, her.

703
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,532
Are you rich since you're a judge?

704
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,368
Can you buy us burgers?

705
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,703
What?

706
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,914
We became close
when we started high school.

707
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,833
He gives me advice
when I'm having a hard time.

708
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:14,128
And when my classes end late,
he takes me home saying it's dangerous.

709
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,548
I got it, so go get the ice cream.

710
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:18,633
Okay.

711
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,524
You're a bit rude, aren't you?

712
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,609
Who said you could do that?

713
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,779
This is how friends eat.

714
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,074
Friends?
Since when are we friends...

715
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,754
Can I put it in one pile now?

716
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,590
Of course.

717
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,503
I think we're seeing each other too often.

718
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,380
It's been two years.

719
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,217
And this is the greeting I get?

720
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:47,263
I still have a year left before I go back.

721
01:02:54,687 --> 01:02:56,022
Is it fun playing judge?

722
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,359
Yes, it's quite fun.

723
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:04,030
There's something even more fun.

724
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:09,327
Lucifer has made you an offer.

725
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:11,287
In your final year,

726
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:14,373
if you kill 10 sinners
and send them to Hell,

727
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,585
he'll let you live as a human.

728
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,966
I hope you refuse, of course.

729
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,010
You're still...

730
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,472
my heir.

731
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,980
Make your decision quickly.

732
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:40,983
Lucifer is...

733
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,153
impatient.

734
01:04:06,425 --> 01:04:08,135
SEOUL NOBONG POLICE

735
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,138
JEONG TAEGYU

736
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,186
From Moon Jeongjun's case
to Jeong Taegyu's case,

737
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,564
we know it's the same culprit,

738
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,985
but we haven't even
been able to identify them for two years.

739
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,238
It's shameful to admit as an officer.

740
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:30,658
I hope you feel the shame, too.

741
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:36,789
From tomorrow on,
make sure not to lose another criminal.

742
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,960
Chin up, shoulders back.

743
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,756
Yes, sir.

744
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:47,341
Yes, sir.

745
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:52,346
We haven't caught them yet,
but we will no matter what. Okay?

746
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,723
Especially this one.

747
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:56,642
I will get them for sure. Don't stop me.

748
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,936
We won't, punk. Let's go!

749
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,062
Yes, sir.

750
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:03,608
I will show you. The new me.

751
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:06,444
Goodness.

752
01:05:06,527 --> 01:05:07,904
Just become the new you already.

753
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,030
-Let's go.
-Gosh.

754
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:11,782
Goodness.

755
01:05:13,951 --> 01:05:15,036
BITNA

756
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,913
See you tonight.

757
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,334
I have to talk to you
about something.

758
01:05:31,218 --> 01:05:32,386
What do you want to do?

759
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,891
If I become human, I can live with you
for the rest of my life.

760
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:37,975
But...

761
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,228
I have to kill people.

762
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:43,731
Ten in a year.

763
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:50,404
I'm not afraid
that the police will catch me.

764
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:52,365
I won't be caught anyway.

765
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,742
Then what's troubling you?

766
01:05:58,412 --> 01:06:00,331
To kill sinners,

767
01:06:00,414 --> 01:06:03,417
I have to hand down light sentences
and let them go.

768
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:07,129
Then the victims and their families
will hurt again.

769
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:10,257
Doing that when I know
how they will feel is...

770
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,220
That's not what a judge should do.

771
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,640
You told me once

772
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:20,226
that if I killed Jeong Taegyu,

773
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:24,146
you would free me from jail
with everything you had as a demon

774
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,440
and if I let Jeong Taegyu live,

775
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:28,526
you'd give everything as a judge

776
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,319
to lock him up.

777
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,325
That no matter what choice I made,
you trusted me.

778
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,369
So no matter what choice you make,

779
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:39,954
I trust you.

780
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:44,375
I know you will make a wise decision.

781
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,839
You're such a good person.

782
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,386
It's all thanks to you, Kang Bitna.

783
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:05,938
Your hand.

784
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:47,396
COUNSEL

785
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,274
Let's continue.

786
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:51,734
Excuse me, Judge.

787
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:54,653
When will the trial end?

788
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:56,739
I have a drinking appointment after this.

789
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:02,119
Defendant. Is that
the attitude of a repentant person?

790
01:08:02,703 --> 01:08:05,081
Because you assaulted
and stalked the victim,

791
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:09,126
she is badly injured
and still in the hospital.

792
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:14,006
Still alive, though.

793
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,761
What?

794
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,679
She's still alive.

795
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,225
-"Still"?
-Yes.

796
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:26,769
For now.

797
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,380
Let's end the trial here for today.

798
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,933
COURT

799
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,894
Everyone,
this is the Goddess of Justice.

800
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,897
Teacher! But why is she holding a sword?

801
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,441
And why are her eyes covered?
Is she playing hide-and-seek?

802
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,862
Don't cry.

803
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,031
Tell me everything
the defendant did to you.

804
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,659
-So I can judge properly.
-Why are her eyes covered?

805
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,910
Should we ask the judge?

806
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,496
Yes!

807
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:30,583
I'm a bit busy right now, bye.

808
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,501
Judge. Please.

809
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,295
Me too, please.

810
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,964
But are you really a judge?

811
01:09:37,047 --> 01:09:39,008
-I don't think so.
-What?

812
01:09:39,091 --> 01:09:40,926
I am a judge. Look.

813
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,095
I'm wearing a judge's robes.

814
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,391
This is a secret...

815
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,939
but I'm actually a demon.

816
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,737
Liar! No demon's that pretty.

817
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:00,905
What?

818
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:02,364
Yeah. You're very pretty.

819
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:03,490
You're like a celeb.

820
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:05,910
You're prettier than my mom.

821
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,454
You all have discerning eyes.

822
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,498
Fine. What are you curious about?

823
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:15,211
Why are her eyes covered
and why is she holding a sword?

824
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:18,172
Only when her eyes are covered
can she make a fair judgement.

825
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:21,759
She weighs the person's sins
on the scale to see how heavy they are.

826
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:25,095
And she uses the sword
to punish them justly.

827
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:27,056
But what is justice?

828
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,976
When good people live happily
and bad people are punished,

829
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,728
that is justice.

830
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:36,357
Then are you a good judge or a bad judge?

831
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,402
I am...

832
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,786
a judge from Hell.

833
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:03,133
The Judge from Hell
