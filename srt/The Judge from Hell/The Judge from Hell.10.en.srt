CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,771
I give my life
to summon the Demon of Death.

5
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,190
Bael.

6
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,408
Bael.

7
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,702
A lowly demon like you

8
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,497
has dared to summon me.

9
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,876
A lowly demon...

10
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,963
Venato.

11
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,381
Venato.

12
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,219
A human is interfering with Justitia.

13
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:59,930
Please kill that man.

14
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,598
What is his name?

15
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,184
Han Daon.

16
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,854
Paimon.

EPISODE 10

18
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,254
Damn it. My knees hurt, you bastard!

19
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,347
I told you my knees hurt, you punk.

20
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,768
No use in running away
in this small county. Okay?

21
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,478
Be quiet, asshole!

22
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,404
We have a new transfer
from another station.

23
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,490
I requested he be assigned to our team.

24
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,825
He should be here any moment.
There he comes.

25
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,912
Hello, I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

26
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,373
Lieutenant Han Daon.

27
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,292
I've heard a lot about you.

28
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,502
Chin up.

29
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,093
Judge Kang tries over 200 cases a month.

30
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,886
Have all those 200 died?

31
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,971
My apologies.

32
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,017
Kang...

33
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,269
Banjjak?

34
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,187
No, that's not it.

35
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,522
Kang Bitna.

36
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,107
Kang Bitna.

37
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,109
What kind of person is she?

38
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:21,613
She doesn't let the strong push her around
or walk over the weak.

39
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,159
She may seem cold from a distance,
but up close she's very warm.

40
00:05:26,243 --> 00:05:29,246
She sounds very humane,

41
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,291
this Kang Bitna.

42
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:37,796
I saw you.

43
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,590
You deleted it on purpose.

44
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,801
You're an officer
but destroyed evidence for her.

45
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:47,055
You must really like
this Judge Kang Bitna.

46
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,360
I'll keep this a secret for now.

47
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,821
If you do what I say.

48
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,328
I'm sorry.

49
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,039
I made a mistake.
I'll watch him, and if I can't--

50
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,374
If you can't? Will you kill him?

51
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,876
If I need to.

52
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,211
Give me his number.

53
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,214
What are you going to do?

54
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:23,342
He wants to meet me. I should.

55
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,764
Nice to meet you.

56
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,850
I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

57
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:27,447
The Judge from Hell

58
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,326
You like cola, I see.

59
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,371
And you like threats, I see.

60
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
It's a request.

61
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,750
If you want to use the video
to question me, go ahead.

62
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,586
But you won't get anything.

63
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,547
My alibi for that day is perfect.

64
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,091
Do you like Detective Han Daon?

65
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:50,012
He seemed to like you.

66
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,930
What does that have to do with the case?

67
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,599
How much do you love him?

68
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,727
-Listen here...
-Enough to give up everything?

69
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,439
Including your life?

70
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,486
Do whatever you want with that footage.

71
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,905
Except one thing.

72
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,783
Don't threaten
Detective Han Daon with it again.

73
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:16,788
This is also a request.

74
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,632
You were right.

75
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,967
Han Daon knows everything.

76
00:08:29,635 --> 00:08:31,136
And yet he's covering for her.

77
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,347
Then as Bael ordered,

78
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,308
please kill Han Daon.

79
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,310
Of course.

80
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:43,065
In the most painful...

81
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,108
and brutal way possible.

82
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,829
On July 8, 2024,
the defendant, Jeong Seonho,

83
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,374
drove under the influence of drugs
and crashed his car

84
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:03,335
into a transformer
in front of Hwangcheon Middle School.

85
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,796
This is not
the defendant's first time using drugs.

86
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,674
And the incident occurred
in a school zone.

87
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:11,802
Considering this,
the punishment must be severe.

88
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,847
However, the defendant
is deeply remorseful

89
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,642
and has repeatedly stated
that he will not use drugs again.

90
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,728
Also, he's paid for all damages
caused by the incident.

91
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,690
And there were no casualties
in the accident.

92
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,401
These are mitigating circumstances
in the defendant's favor.

93
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,820
Taking all of these points
into consideration,

94
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,531
the court shall rule as follows.

95
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,033
The defendant, Jeong Seonho,

96
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,913
shall be sentenced to two years in prison
and four years' probation.

97
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,374
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

98
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,336
Are you worried about something?

99
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,548
What? Me? Why do you ask?

100
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,884
You look off these days.

101
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,844
He always looks off.

102
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,305
That's true.

103
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:43,185
He's been released.
Now you just have to hunt him down.

104
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,563
When will you kill him?

105
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,608
Should I go first this time too
and make him unconscious?

106
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,237
This one's on hold for now.

107
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,405
What? Why?

108
00:10:56,073 --> 00:11:00,118
He's serial killer J. And you saw him
killing the police officer.

109
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:04,331
To be exact, not killing her
but standing there before she died.

110
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,541
That means

111
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,793
he probably killed her.

112
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,503
No.

113
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,923
J has never killed with a gun before.

114
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,926
Then we should torture him to find out.

115
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,887
Even if it's not true,
he's still a killer. So you can kill him.

116
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,639
There's nothing for you to lose.

117
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,224
In any case, I will be

118
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:25,561
more cautious with this case.

119
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,482
Because the dead officer
was close to Han Daon?

120
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,573
Is that why you want to be more certain?

121
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,200
It's not that.

122
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,370
Oh, right.

123
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,206
I'm saying this just in case.

124
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,166
Leave Han Daon alone.

125
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,919
Of course. Why wouldn't we?

126
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,629
Good, then.

127
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,888
Gremory...

128
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,265
-Aren't you going with her?
-Oh, right.

129
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:19,781
Moon Jeongjun, one. Bae Jayeong, two.
Yang Seungbin, three.

130
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,909
Choi Wonjoong, one.

131
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,494
J, 13.

132
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:28,874
That's 20.

133
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,797
RETURN TO HELL

134
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,516
What will you do
about Hwangcheon?

135
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:48,393
The landlady won't meet with me,
so I'll approach her daughter.

136
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,437
This is taking longer than I thought.

137
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,279
I'm sorry. I'll move quickly.

138
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,953
Anyway, it seems something is going on
with Judge Kang Bitna.

139
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:15,254
Hey.

140
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,548
Hey! What the...

141
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,092
If you feel upset, sue me.
I'm Judge Kang Bitna...

142
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,972
So? Are you going to help her again?

143
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:28,725
She helped with Seonho's case,
so I should.

144
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:39,278
What exactly do you mean
I should protect Han Daon?

145
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:44,867
Stop eating and tell me, damn it.

146
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:51,248
How you protect Han Daon,
that's for you to figure out.

147
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,751
What's certain is, either you or Han Daon

148
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:57,004
will die.

149
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,385
Wait.

150
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,681
If I complete my mission
and go back to Hell,

151
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,808
the Kang Bitna here will become a corpse.

152
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:12,936
Which means she dies and Han Daon lives.

153
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,062
Right? Is that it?

154
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:16,690
You are slow indeed.

155
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,650
Are all demons stupid like you?

156
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,611
Fine, I'm stupid.

157
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:23,363
If you know that, just tell me what to do.

158
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,410
Fine. Let's say I'm stupid.

159
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,829
If I go back to Hell,
what happens to Han Daon?

160
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:32,789
Does he die?

161
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,708
But why? He's innocent.

162
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,837
If you're curious, go back.

163
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,088
Damn it.

164
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,798
You little... Follow me out.

165
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,676
Follow me out! Now!

166
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:46,720
Excuse me. You should

167
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,388
watch your tone with your elders.

168
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,809
Do you know me? Or this hag?

169
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:54,561
Mind your own business.

170
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,732
Are you okay, ma'am?

171
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,985
You should die when you're too old.

172
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:06,907
Maybe I've lived too long.

173
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,786
If you know that, just die. Die now!

174
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,371
That's enough.

175
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:14,873
Ma'am. Where's your home?
Shall I take you there?

176
00:15:14,957 --> 00:15:17,042
What a nice young man.

177
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,877
You will be blessed.

178
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,005
Can you just take me down
to the first floor?

179
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:31,765
My, my. Look at that fake
putting on a show.

180
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,686
Damn it.

181
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,104
Goodness.

182
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,571
"It was found
that Judge Kang,

183
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,490
who recently sparked controversy
at a restaurant

184
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:51,618
for misconduct involving
young men in their 20s,

185
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,871
is the same judge who handed down

186
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:58,041
an overly lenient sentence to
Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol's second son."

187
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,550
Judge Kang. Do you owe this reporter
money or something?

188
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,343
Their last article was like this, too.

189
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:11,471
All the other reporters are quiet,
but why just this one?

190
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,348
What a true reporter.

191
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:16,894
I'm on your side, Judge Kang.

192
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,439
Don't be. I don't want
to be on the same side as you.

193
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:24,193
You know the men you humiliated in public
have sued you, right?

194
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:27,279
-Yes.
-But they withdrew.

195
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:30,908
And they promised to take down
the video and comments. Do you know why?

196
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,367
Do I need to know?

197
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:36,872
Assemblyman Jeong gave them a lot of money

198
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,540
and took care of the situation.

199
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,710
Because he was grateful for your help
on his son's case.

200
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,794
And?

201
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,842
With this article out there,
we can't just ignore the situation.

202
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,802
Take a month off.

203
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,804
Wow.

204
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,517
So even if you take a stranger's phone
and break it, all you get

205
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,352
is a one-month suspension?

206
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:00,854
Being a judge is the best.

207
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,983
But can I take a longer break?

208
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,693
- I have lots to do.
- Get out.

209
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,072
Okay.

210
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:19,540
I'm suspended for a month.

211
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:22,000
-What? A month?
-Yes.

212
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,127
I knew this day would come.

213
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,212
You must be upset.

214
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,589
-What will you do on your break?
-I have important--

215
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:28,674
This is
18th Criminal Division.

216
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:32,052
Our judge is suspended.
Do I have to come to work?

217
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,137
Oh, is that so?

218
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,933
All right.

219
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:41,311
She's gone.

220
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:46,900
Oh. We heard the news. That's terrible.

221
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:48,485
Don't pretend to feel bad for me.

222
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,362
Well, all right then.

223
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:52,781
Use this opportunity
to really take a break.

224
00:17:52,865 --> 00:17:55,492
Look into Seocho-dong offices
when you have time.

225
00:17:55,576 --> 00:17:57,619
Why? No one will want to hire her.

226
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:59,788
Goodness. I'm just too honest.

227
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:01,832
But no hard feelings, right?

228
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:03,667
Of course.

229
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,254
By the way, you two are always together.
Are you dating?

230
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,715
I didn't become a judge
to hear such nonsense!

231
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,009
What's wrong with me?

232
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:16,138
My mother thinks
I look like DiCaprio in Titanic.

233
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:18,307
How insulting to DiCaprio.

234
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,641
Do you want to be sued?

235
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,435
What would I be sued for?

236
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,853
Defamation?

237
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,320
So, in sum,

238
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,655
Anyone who saw the killer was murdered.

239
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,534
Except for one 10-year-old child.

240
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:42,372
"And from each victim,
he dismembered different body parts."

241
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,124
Wait.

242
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,794
He dismembered different body parts

243
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:51,048
-of each victim. Then...
-Then what?

244
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,302
Satan.

245
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:58,889
Why are we realizing
this crucial thing now?

246
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,017
Satan? What do you mean?

247
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,435
Do you remember that story

248
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,521
-about Satan escaping Hell?
-Yes.

249
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,108
Satan, the second-in-command
of Hell, rose in revolt 26 years ago.

250
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:14,238
And he stole the Kylum, Lucifer's
treasure, and fled to Earth.

251
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:19,034
Since then, Satan and the Kylum
have disappeared.

252
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,288
I'm sure he's hiding in
someone's body now.

253
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,583
But what does that have to do with J?

254
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,169
What she means is, in the human world,

255
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:31,338
even Satan must live in a human body.

256
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,674
But humans age and die.

257
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,634
And Satan would die with it.

258
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,179
But there is a way he can live forever.

259
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,389
He only needs two things.

260
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:42,975
Different body parts
of good people.

261
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,142
And the Kylum.

262
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:46,395
I appreciate the detailed explanation,

263
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:48,939
but I can't really wrap my head around it.

264
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,942
To put it simply, Satan may have

265
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,695
entered the body of serial killer J

266
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,322
and committed the murders.

267
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,574
Ah.

268
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,577
Let's meet the victims' families first.

269
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,787
Let's see if they forgave the criminal.

270
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,456
It's not too late
to find out if he's Satan after that.

271
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,375
It's unlikely,

272
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,545
but if there is any of them
who's forgiven him, what then?

273
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:14,173
Do you think you can forgive?

274
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,427
I guess I asked a silly question.

275
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,433
That's taking a while to heal.

276
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,269
It'll heal soon.

277
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:33,066
Do we know where Kang Bitna was
right before the attack last December?

278
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,446
Yes. She left the court
at around 8 p.m. and got in a taxi.

279
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:41,283
In half an hour, she got off near
the park where the incident occurred.

280
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:45,454
Then she was stabbed. But there were
no witnesses or security footage?

281
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,414
Is there a chance that the attack

282
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,000
was somehow connected
with Jeong Jaegeol's family?

283
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:54,129
We can't rule it out. The last person
she contacted was Jeong Taegyu.

284
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,635
There's a reporter
who frequently writes about Judge Kang.

285
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,928
What if we meet with them?

286
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,680
- Right. Make an appointment.
- Okay.

287
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:06,558
REPORTER JO ARAN

288
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,519
Why are you working so hard now?

289
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,396
And you don't use your headphones anymore.

290
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:16,860
I want to become a great detective.

291
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:18,654
Punk.

292
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,123
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing yet.

293
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,670
I heard the restaurant by
Haeseo River where Bae was found called.

294
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:37,756
-Anything on the security footage?
-No, nothing.

295
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,384
Keep digging
until you get something.

296
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,094
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

297
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,573
The night Judge Kang was caught
going towards Haeseo River,

298
00:22:03,407 --> 00:22:04,783
Bae Jayeong was killed.

299
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,702
This is very suspicious.

300
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:10,706
What are you doing?

301
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:20,591
It works.

302
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,222
I've always been curious.

303
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:29,808
About how evil humans can become

304
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:31,935
to get what they want.

305
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,647
Do you want me to show you?

306
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,108
This makes me even more curious.

307
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:42,654
I wonder what you'd be willing to do
to protect that woman.

308
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:45,199
Stop messing around.

309
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,409
Before I kill you.

310
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:54,541
A death threat from a detective.

311
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,184
I didn't upload this security footage
anywhere else.

312
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,562
It's only here.

313
00:23:15,646 --> 00:23:17,064
For 10 points,

314
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:20,567
how will you keep me quiet
and take this from me?

315
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,361
Go.

316
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,036
If you find the answer, call me.

317
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,435
Mr. Ha Yeongseok?

318
00:23:56,395 --> 00:24:00,148
They didn't tell me the civil servant
in charge would be replaced.

319
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:04,528
I'm here because
I want to hear about your parents.

320
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,613
They passed away in 1998, correct?

321
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:10,242
Who the hell do you think you are
to ask after my parents

322
00:24:10,325 --> 00:24:12,286
who were stabbed to death decades ago?

323
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,122
I'm reinvestigating
the serial killings of J.

324
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:18,625
Could I come in to speak with you?

325
00:24:18,709 --> 00:24:20,878
About what?

326
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,173
About how much of a bastard I am
who found their bodies

327
00:24:24,256 --> 00:24:28,427
covered in maggots three days
after they were stabbed to death?

328
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,596
I waited for the day that killer

329
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,016
would be punished
for murdering my parents.

330
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,730
Or do you want to hear about how I became
an alcoholic after the statutes expired?

331
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,857
Hearing you makes me think

332
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,278
you haven't forgiven him
for killing your parents.

333
00:24:46,361 --> 00:24:47,362
Forgive him?

334
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,656
How dare you!

335
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,867
Do you think you could forgive?

336
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:53,702
Get lost!

337
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,540
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

338
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:02,002
That poor man.

339
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:04,755
They had three sweet daughters.

340
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:06,965
But their mother was sick.

341
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,594
So the husband went down
to another city to earn money.

342
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,095
That's when it happened.

343
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,056
Do you have his contact information?

344
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,682
Or do you know where he moved?

345
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,518
He's dead.

346
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:20,103
In May of 2014.

347
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:22,981
That's when
the statute of limitations expired

348
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:25,692
for the killer who did that to his family.

349
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:27,778
He wrote on his prescription bag

350
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:31,740
that he could not forgive the killer,
but he had no hope left to go on.

351
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:35,536
Then he didn't forgive...

352
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:36,954
Of course I can't.

353
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,539
But...

354
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,626
hasn't the state already forgiven him?

355
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,504
When we heard
the statute of limitations expired,

356
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,383
we hugged each other
and cried for a long time.

357
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:52,469
Saying the state deemed it was over,
so we should forget...

358
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,430
and live our lives.

359
00:25:55,514 --> 00:25:59,393
I'm sorry to tell you this
when you're trying to reinvestigate,

360
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,313
but I don't have any hope
that he'll be caught.

361
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,941
But thank you very much

362
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,819
for not forgetting
our daughter and mother, and us.

363
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,613
For still remembering.

364
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,833
Makes me angry the more I think about it.

365
00:26:27,504 --> 00:26:28,839
Have a drink.

366
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:41,185
Gosh, that burns.

367
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,271
Why abolish the statute of limitations?
Why not finish it?

368
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,565
Are killings before August 1, 2000
not crimes?

369
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,066
Damn it.

370
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,696
Why aren't you drinking cola today?

371
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:57,826
I saw on TV that when someone's sad,
they drink alcohol at places like this.

372
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,703
So...

373
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,873
Applying ointment on me,
did you see it on TV, too?

374
00:27:02,956 --> 00:27:06,293
Yes. They do that a lot on TV.

375
00:27:06,376 --> 00:27:10,339
You said, "We can't be doing this."
Did you get that from a TV show too?

376
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:13,175
No. That's from me.

377
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,469
Stop teasing me.

378
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:18,305
Thank you.

379
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:20,933
For being sad and upset...

380
00:27:23,018 --> 00:27:24,311
along with me.

381
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,980
That's already a great comfort to me.

382
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:39,326
I have information
on the deceased Detective Kim.

383
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,620
I will tell you in person.

384
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:57,177
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

385
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,264
SERGEANT CLEANING

386
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,643
Goodness.

387
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,228
-Give it.
-Yes.

388
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,983
It was nice to be back home for a bit.

389
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,276
I didn't ask.

390
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,610
We should get going.

391
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,362
Good work. You can go.

392
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,742
Gosh. I can't even walk.

393
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,828
Such a crybaby.

394
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,680
Who is this person I have to meet?
Why are we at a place like...

395
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,624
I don't think there's anyone here.

396
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,083
Sorry we're late, Paimon.

397
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:11,168
Paimon?

398
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:27,851
Paimon?

399
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:30,646
I heard you've done a great deed.

400
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,730
Me?

401
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,482
No, I don't think so.

402
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,485
Whatever I say,

403
00:29:37,653 --> 00:29:39,738
just reply "yes."

404
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:40,948
Yes.

405
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,622
I'll be giving you an important task soon.

406
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,250
If you fail or betray me,

407
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,087
what you're imagining right now,
it will happen to you.

408
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,171
Yes.

409
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,298
When will you kill Han Daon?

410
00:29:58,382 --> 00:30:01,093
You saw for yourself.
Why aren't you killing him?

411
00:30:03,804 --> 00:30:07,099
Be patient. I'm preparing something
very interesting.

412
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:13,689
No matter what happens,
Justitia can't get hurt.

413
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:16,942
Only Han Daon.

414
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,194
You are to kill only Han Daon.

415
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,788
We must kill anyone
who gets in our way.

416
00:30:29,872 --> 00:30:31,665
Find out if what she says is true.

417
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:35,127
Then kill the human named Han Daon
and send him to Hell.

418
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:36,628
If he's not a sinner,

419
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,089
I cannot kill him.

420
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:40,382
Then make him...

421
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,052
a sinner.

422
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,723
And Justitia...

423
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:48,849
You can kill her.

424
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:53,896
That is if you, Paimon,

425
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,940
can beat her.

426
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,743
I will make sure
it was worth summoning Bael.

427
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,204
Don't worry.

428
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:34,353
Move. I'm late for work.

429
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,858
Why is Paimon here?

430
00:31:39,942 --> 00:31:41,652
I just reported to Bael.

431
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,196
Paimon wasn't in my plan.

432
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,533
If you order a burger,
of course it comes with fries.

433
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,536
Don't you know the history
between Paimon and Justitia?

434
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:52,621
They've been enemies for 400 years.

435
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,957
They're rivals,
both eyeing to succeed Bael.

436
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,250
I know that.

437
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,795
So I'm regretting it.
But what's the use now?

438
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:04,508
Nothing will happen to Justitia.

439
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,970
He promised to leave
after killing just Han Daon.

440
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,847
How can you believe a demon's promise?

441
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,059
Why did you have to report this
and make it come to be such a mess?

442
00:32:16,645 --> 00:32:18,772
Because he ruined Justitia.

443
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:20,899
Such a noble demon.

444
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,570
He corrupted her,
turning her into a dirty human.

445
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:27,948
This is all because of Han Daon.

446
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,075
We just need him to die.

447
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,327
This is betrayal.

448
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,080
I'm going to tell Justitia.

449
00:32:35,706 --> 00:32:38,417
Then I will tell her
that you go to church.

450
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:42,171
And I will also tell Bael that...

451
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:45,257
you're a Jesus-believing traitor.

452
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,970
What I'm doing now

453
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:54,808
is not betrayal, it's loyalty.
I've risked my life for the one I serve.

454
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:57,060
If you want it your way,

455
00:32:58,145 --> 00:32:59,813
stake your life on it first.

456
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,130
You're here. Please have a seat.

457
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,719
Congratulations on your pregnancy.

458
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:33,055
When are you due?

459
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:37,851
I know my mother
turned it down again.

460
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:42,022
It's her choice whether to sell that villa
to your company.

461
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,734
So please stop pestering me
to persuade her.

462
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:48,028
With the compensation we can provide,

463
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:51,740
your child in your belly
will lack nothing when they're born.

464
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:55,035
We can raise our child
with the money my husband and I earn.

465
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,621
And I'm not interested
in my mother's money.

466
00:33:58,997 --> 00:34:00,249
Please don't call me again.

467
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:05,128
Do you know there's been
a murder in that neighborhood recently?

468
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:10,467
Isn't it dangerous to leave your mother
in that neighborhood alone?

469
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,596
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!

470
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,974
My daughter's coming today,

471
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,309
and I made some extra for you, too.

472
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:21,228
You didn't need to make all this for us.

473
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:22,521
You're family.

474
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:25,482
Are you excited to see your daughter?

475
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:29,778
Yes. I haven't seen her in so long.

476
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:39,621
Jueun. Come in.

477
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:50,382
- I should get going.
- Okay.

478
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:52,467
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

479
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:56,346
- No need to see me out.
- It's okay.

480
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,931
Bye.

481
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,018
Jueun, I made japchae.

482
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:02,769
It's your favorite.

483
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,230
Sign here.

484
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:07,774
What's this?

485
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:09,943
REDEVELOPMENT CONSENT FORM

486
00:35:10,819 --> 00:35:12,404
The redevelopment consent form.

487
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:15,282
If you sign and leave,
they'll give you a lot of money.

488
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:18,744
We can use half of it
to pay back my housing loan.

489
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,787
And you can move in with us.

490
00:35:21,872 --> 00:35:22,873
Well...

491
00:35:23,457 --> 00:35:26,919
But I have to stay here.

492
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,172
- I have to meet someone.
- Who?

493
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,217
Do you think Yechan
is going to come see you as a ghost?

494
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,011
No, it's not like that.

495
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:37,846
How can a Christian believe in ghosts?

496
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:40,265
Listen to me and sign!

497
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,185
Can't you be a mom to me just once?

498
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:47,314
Stop it. If you shout,
it's not good for the baby.

499
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:52,277
Don't pretend to be worried about me.
You don't care about me.

500
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:55,531
You only ever cared
about Yechan and church.

501
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:57,241
Even now.

502
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,368
No, it's not like that.

503
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,497
I'm sorry.

504
00:36:05,082 --> 00:36:06,166
I'm sorry.

505
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:08,627
I'm tired of this.

506
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:14,132
I'm tired of you apologizing.

507
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:15,300
Wait.

508
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,053
Jueun.

509
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,137
Jueun.

510
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,602
I'm sorry.

511
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,157
Be careful.

512
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:41,159
You almost hurt me.

513
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,828
I'm so sorry.

514
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:45,372
Thank you.

515
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,221
Jueun.

516
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:10,814
It's you.

517
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:15,485
Are you Jeong Yechan's mother?

518
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,728
JEONG YECHAN

519
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:53,190
CERTIFICATE OF AWARD
JEONG YECHAN

520
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,768
Yechan, I'm leaving!

521
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,145
Hurry up!

522
00:38:32,229 --> 00:38:33,272
Coming!

523
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:37,651
Can you wake Jueun up?
She can't be late on the first day.

524
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,988
Get some bread with Jueun
on the way to school.

525
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:44,199
There's food in the fridge.
Make sure your sister eats dinner.

526
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,534
Okay.

527
00:38:45,617 --> 00:38:47,035
- Mom.
- Yeah?

528
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,371
Let's talk later tonight.

529
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:00,799
More kimchi, please!

530
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,009
Coming!

531
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:03,510
More soup over here.

532
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,345
- Can we have more anchovies?
- Anchovies.

533
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,222
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

534
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:08,724
Wait a moment.

535
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:10,434
Gosh, I haven't seen you in a while.

536
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,978
I heard you bought a villa recently.

537
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:14,062
Well...

538
00:39:14,146 --> 00:39:16,899
You're a building owner now.
Don't work so hard.

539
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,985
Gosh. I have to send
both my kids to college.

540
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:21,612
I still have a long way to go.

541
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,779
Come on.

542
00:39:22,863 --> 00:39:24,031
Enjoy.

543
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:25,532
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

544
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,367
Hello?

545
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,078
Yes, I'm Yechan's mother.

546
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,583
LATE JEONG YECHAN

547
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,838
♪ All unworthy though I be ♪

548
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:47,262
♪ There is welcome there for me ♪

549
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:53,894
♪ For the King is our own Jesus ♪

550
00:39:53,977 --> 00:40:00,943
♪ Lord and Savior of His own ♪

551
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,371
Myeongsuk, don't be so sad.

552
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:17,042
God must have called upon Yechan because
there aren't enough angels in Heaven.

553
00:40:17,125 --> 00:40:19,503
If it's because
there aren't enough angels,

554
00:40:21,338 --> 00:40:24,383
then your son should die now
and go to Heaven, too.

555
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,843
How could you...

556
00:40:29,638 --> 00:40:30,681
Pastor.

557
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:35,352
Pastor... I have a question, Pastor.

558
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,603
Pastor.

559
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,731
Pastor!

560
00:40:39,815 --> 00:40:42,818
Did I not give enough offerings?

561
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:47,281
Why did the Lord take my Yechan?

562
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,076
It's all part of His big plan--

563
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:52,494
What plan?

564
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:53,954
Oh, Lord...

565
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:55,122
My son...

566
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:02,588
He believed in God from the moment
he was conceived in my belly.

567
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:06,133
But where was God
when my Yechan was dying?

568
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:07,467
Where was He?

569
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,303
Why him?

570
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,015
My sweet baby!

571
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,435
Why did he have to die so brutally?

572
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:20,397
What is this big plan?

573
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,776
Why did He have to take a son
from a single mother?

574
00:41:32,868 --> 00:41:36,038
- I don't need this!
- Myeongsuk!

575
00:41:36,121 --> 00:41:38,248
- My goodness.
- I don't need this anymore!

576
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:39,625
- Myeongsuk!
- Go! Leave!

577
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,918
Get out!

578
00:41:41,001 --> 00:41:45,005
Myeongsuk!

579
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:14,868
Did you go to the academy?

580
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:20,999
What are you wearing?

581
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,043
Did they tell you to wear uniforms now?

582
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:25,546
Mom, I'm in middle school now.

583
00:42:26,171 --> 00:42:27,172
I'm in eighth grade.

584
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,882
What are you talking about?

585
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:32,386
Your brother's in middle school,
and you're in fifth grade.

586
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,058
Mom!

587
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,350
Lord...

588
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,524
Please hear my prayer.

589
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,361
I will always be your servant.

590
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:36,033
Please answer my one prayer.

591
00:43:36,617 --> 00:43:37,868
Please.

592
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:41,914
I've been going to church every day
since that day.

593
00:43:42,497 --> 00:43:44,333
I don't know
what you prayed for,

594
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:47,419
but it hasn't been answered
for 20 years. That's...

595
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,590
Isn't this negligence?

596
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:52,674
Damn it.

597
00:43:54,218 --> 00:43:57,012
I saw on the news. He's back.

598
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:02,184
I've waited here for 25 years to meet him.

599
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:04,645
I have to meet him.

600
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:07,314
Are you not leaving this villa because...

601
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:10,609
I'm waiting for him.

602
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:11,902
What for?

603
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:16,281
Isn't it better for trash like him
to die quietly and alone?

604
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:17,366
No.

605
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,452
He can't die without me knowing.

606
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:24,081
I have to meet him.
I have a question for him.

607
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:30,003
Only then will I get the closure I need.

608
00:44:40,347 --> 00:44:43,141
Are you okay?
You don't look so good since earlier.

609
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,686
I should be asking if you're okay.

610
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:48,397
The most important place is left.

611
00:45:10,878 --> 00:45:12,379
YEONJU-RO

612
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:37,112
It was just a regular morning.

613
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:41,200
A day like any other.

614
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:44,286
It felt like tomorrow
and the day after that...

615
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:47,539
would always be the same.

616
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:51,835
We didn't know
how happy our ordinary days were.

617
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:13,857
Mom.

618
00:46:27,037 --> 00:46:29,831
Daon, run away!

619
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:31,458
Hurry!

620
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,716
Don't open the door.

621
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:42,469
Don't.

622
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:59,820
Please protect
my son, Daon.

623
00:47:21,925 --> 00:47:23,635
-Are you okay?
-I'm not.

624
00:47:24,636 --> 00:47:27,181
Why aren't you crying? Aren't you sad?

625
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:29,933
How can you be so calm?

626
00:47:31,435 --> 00:47:35,397
If I cry, I'm scared I'll revert back
to being the coward that I was.

627
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,527
You're so annoying, Han Daon.

628
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:43,906
You're the worst.

629
00:47:46,909 --> 00:47:47,951
I looked.

630
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:51,121
Your family and Detective Kim

631
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,915
aren't in Hell.

632
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,209
They're all in Heaven.

633
00:47:57,753 --> 00:47:59,338
Then I'll never see them again.

634
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:00,631
Because I'm going to Hell.

635
00:48:00,714 --> 00:48:02,549
No, you're not going to Hell.

636
00:48:03,592 --> 00:48:05,469
Now that I've heard all your stories...

637
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,307
I will find him and kill him.

638
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:40,754
Will you really be fine going alone?

639
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,548
Don't act like you're worried.

640
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:44,967
I'm sorry.

641
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,470
Don't be weird. Go.

642
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:54,601
I'm really sorry.

643
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:08,031
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

644
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,367
The customer service is terrible. This...

645
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:13,871
- Sit up straight.
- What the...

646
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:16,915
You can't talk to me like that.

647
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:21,211
Did that sober you up?

648
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:25,716
Look who it is.

649
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,051
It's the judge.

650
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:29,136
Satan.

651
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:30,637
What... What?

652
00:49:30,721 --> 00:49:33,849
You escaped from Hell 26 years ago
and possessed a human body.

653
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:38,395
Now, you're serial killer J.
The demon of all demons.

654
00:49:38,478 --> 00:49:41,815
Gosh, this is crazy.
A judge shows up out of nowhere

655
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,734
and talks shit. What are you...

656
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,652
Be honest.

657
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:47,654
You're Satan, right?

658
00:49:48,864 --> 00:49:50,199
You're J, aren't you?

659
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:53,202
I don't know what you're saying.

660
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:56,163
What the...

661
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:59,208
I thought I'd softened a bit recently,
but no.

662
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,419
Stop testing my patience
and tell me the truth.

663
00:50:02,502 --> 00:50:03,754
What are you?

664
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:05,297
I don't know anything.

665
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,468
I swear on my mother who's in Heaven.

666
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:12,513
I don't know what Satan is or who J is.

667
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:14,181
I don't know anything.

668
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,642
How am I supposed
to believe a bastard like you?

669
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:19,228
Then keep thinking I'm Satan and kill me!

670
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:22,022
My life's ruined already anyways.

671
00:50:43,627 --> 00:50:44,753
Do I need to feed you?

672
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:46,296
Ah.

673
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:48,674
Ah.

674
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:52,803
What's with the face?

675
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:55,889
Has a pretty girl never nursed you before?

676
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:59,184
You're so annoying, Han Daon.

677
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:01,603
You're the worst.

678
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,408
This makes me even more curious.

679
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,996
I wonder what you'd be willing to do
to protect that woman.

680
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,770
Detective Jang, I found the answer.
Let's meet now.

681
00:51:47,482 --> 00:51:48,483
JUDGE KANG BITNA

682
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:52,821
You're calling late.

683
00:51:52,905 --> 00:51:54,031
Help me.

684
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,282
Judge Kang, where are you?

685
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:57,075
I'll text you the location.

686
00:51:57,659 --> 00:51:59,995
Don't call the police and come alone.

687
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,080
Come quickly!

688
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:21,850
The phone you called
is turned off. After the beep...

689
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,202
Pastor, I'm...

690
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:44,623
I'm a liar, thief, and traitor.

691
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:48,293
I wonder what's the use in being forgiven.

692
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,004
I just realized today.

693
00:52:51,797 --> 00:52:53,423
That this is the real me.

694
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:58,095
I'll just confidently go to Hell.

695
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,472
Thank you for everything, Pastor.

696
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:08,230
Mando.

697
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:13,068
The door to our church
is always wide open.

698
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,821
Just close it.

699
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:19,116
An evil demon might come in.

700
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:27,040
Did you ask for forgiveness
for stealing a cell phone?

701
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:32,713
-I'm not going to church anymore.
-Why not?

702
00:53:33,297 --> 00:53:35,257
Did they kick you out
for not donating enough?

703
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,928
Stop. Our pastor's not like that.

704
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,681
"Our pastor"?

705
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:47,352
I bet even your pastor is vulnerable
when it comes to money.

706
00:53:47,436 --> 00:53:49,730
-I said stop.
-Are you crazy?

707
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,358
Do you want to die?
Do you think God's on your side now?

708
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:54,735
Is that why you're acting out?

709
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:57,446
No. God isn't on my side.

710
00:53:58,322 --> 00:54:00,574
But going to church

711
00:54:00,657 --> 00:54:02,701
made me realize one thing for sure.

712
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,579
What's that, Brother Mando?

713
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,377
That I'm a demon, too.

714
00:54:13,837 --> 00:54:16,423
You son of a bitch!

715
00:54:16,507 --> 00:54:19,051
Damn it! I'm going to kill you!

716
00:54:21,678 --> 00:54:25,599
Not now though.

717
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:30,646
My gosh!
I thought I was having a heart attack!

718
00:54:31,605 --> 00:54:34,733
Two hours! I have two hours left
to save him! Two hours!

719
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:38,987
Justitia!

720
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:41,031
Justitia!

721
00:54:41,114 --> 00:54:43,408
Justitia? She's not here.

722
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,869
Oh, no. What do I do?

723
00:54:46,745 --> 00:54:49,540
Detective!

724
00:54:49,623 --> 00:54:52,125
He probably left. Of course he's not here.

725
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:53,335
I'm a fool!

726
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,379
What's all this noise this late?

727
00:55:06,932 --> 00:55:09,268
Let go. Damn it!

728
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:11,144
Are you crazy?

729
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:25,450
You...

730
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:28,287
Justitia.

731
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,752
It was obvious
we weren't going to be let in.

732
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:38,630
By the way, Justitia, I was so surprised.

733
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:42,384
She suddenly spread out
her white wings and...

734
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:45,345
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, you were an angel?"

735
00:55:45,429 --> 00:55:46,930
He's a demon.

736
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,308
You're working with a demon.

737
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:50,392
I only

738
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:54,229
help the good and poor.

739
00:55:58,775 --> 00:56:01,737
I've done my part. I'm leaving.

740
00:56:07,868 --> 00:56:10,287
She only says her piece. So rude.

741
00:56:11,371 --> 00:56:12,497
What the...

742
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,502
I'm sorry, Justitia.

743
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,254
What happened?

744
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:21,381
I'm a traitor.

745
00:56:21,465 --> 00:56:23,592
I know. You're going to church.

746
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,552
How did you...

747
00:56:25,636 --> 00:56:28,013
I heard your prayers.
How could I not know?

748
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:29,515
If you knew, then why...

749
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:32,976
I was curious
how far your treachery would go.

750
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,438
The end is a bit disappointing.
But this was a great betrayal.

751
00:56:36,522 --> 00:56:40,692
Remember that betrayal and lying
are prerequisites for being a demon.

752
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:41,860
So keep it up.

753
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:44,238
Good job, get up.

754
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:47,241
Oh, right. Listen, Justitia.

755
00:56:47,324 --> 00:56:49,535
-There's one more thing.
-What?

756
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:55,040
Detective Han is in danger right now.

757
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:56,833
You need to hurry and change your clothes.

758
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,266
Kang Bitna.

759
00:57:12,349 --> 00:57:14,768
Judge Kang!

760
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:18,146
Looking for Kang Bitna?

761
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:24,736
How are you here?

762
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:27,990
What are you doing?

763
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,658
Where's Judge Kang?

764
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:38,083
I killed her.

765
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:43,463
That's a lie.

766
00:57:44,256 --> 00:57:47,050
Right. How did I kill a demon?

767
00:57:47,134 --> 00:57:50,012
A demon can kill another demon.

768
00:57:53,348 --> 00:57:54,391
Wow.

769
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,187
Are you going to kill me
and go to Hell to see her?

770
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,730
You really liked her, didn't you?

771
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:03,525
Die, asshole!

772
00:58:06,653 --> 00:58:09,406
Die!

773
00:58:13,869 --> 00:58:14,912
Die!

774
00:58:20,209 --> 00:58:21,543
That's enough.

775
00:59:28,527 --> 00:59:31,947
You can't beat Kang Bitna anyway.

776
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:54,428
Han Daon.

777
00:59:54,511 --> 00:59:56,972
Are you okay? You're still alive, right?

778
00:59:57,556 --> 00:59:59,183
Worry about yourself!

779
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,899
Stay put.

780
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:11,987
Kang Bitna.

781
01:00:42,935 --> 01:00:45,437
You haven't changed in 400 years.

782
01:00:49,441 --> 01:00:50,734
Of course not.

783
01:00:52,986 --> 01:00:57,908
Because I've endured the past 400 years
trying to come up with ways...

784
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:03,539
to make you feel the exact pain I felt.

785
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:09,878
Han Daon is innocent.

786
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:11,630
You're right. He is.

787
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:13,090
That's why I'm killing him.

788
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:18,428
I want you to see
an innocent person you love

789
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,681
die in front of you.

790
01:02:20,991 --> 01:02:24,578
Be lost in nightmares.

791
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,573
Stop messing around.

792
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,158
I know you're not Han Daon.

793
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,745
Judge Kang. You love me.

794
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,331
Please die.

795
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,042
I'm begging you.

796
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,139
Die!

797
01:04:24,323 --> 01:04:25,324
Kang Bitna!

798
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,313
I can finally pay you back.

799
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:57,898
I won't go easy on you now.

800
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,320
Han Daon.

801
01:05:45,404 --> 01:05:47,489
Han Daon!

802
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,910
Gosh, that hurts.

803
01:05:56,248 --> 01:05:57,708
I told you not to come down!

804
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:15,726
From now on,

805
01:06:17,603 --> 01:06:18,896
rely on and trust only me.

806
01:06:20,439 --> 01:06:22,232
I will protect you.

807
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:38,332
Let's go.

808
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:53,388
No!

809
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:14,201
The Judge from Hell

810
01:07:14,284 --> 01:07:17,204
SPECIAL THANKS TO ACTOR CHOI DAE-HOON

811
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:41,687
Han Daon is nothing.

812
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:44,982
Justitia will lose all her powers.

813
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:49,361
Father. Please let me marry your son.

814
01:07:49,444 --> 01:07:52,114
Are you out of your mind?
You'll die.

815
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,074
Did you kill my son? Did you?

816
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:55,993
Let go! Let go.

817
01:07:58,203 --> 01:07:59,997
What is this place?

818
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:08,338
Did your mother die here?

819
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:09,923
Tell me who killed her.

820
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:12,509
She's lost her powers and is vulnerable.

821
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:14,178
Die!

822
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:20,726
You should have just died then.

823
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,032
