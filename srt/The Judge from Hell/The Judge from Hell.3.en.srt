00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:33,951
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,912
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,956
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,251
- Daon, hurry! Let's go together!
- Come on, Daon!

5
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,377
Daon!

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,462
Han Daon!

7
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,798
YEAR 1999, YEONJU-DONG

8
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,552
- Daon!
- Daon, come on! Let's play.

9
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:52,636
Daon.

10
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,434
Dear Mom and Dad.

11
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,271
Thank you for being my parents.

12
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,189
Good.

13
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,020
Mom.

14
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,885
Daon, run away!

15
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,137
Hurry!

16
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,682
To Hell.

17
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,089
Right.

18
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,635
Go to Hell.

19
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,835
That man

20
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,129
is not a sinner.

21
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,801
As you have punished the wrong man,

22
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,970
he will live again.

23
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,847
And you

24
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,433
will be punished for the wrong judgement.

25
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,852
Justitia

26
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,230
shall kill ten more than initially asked.

27
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:53,483
Kill a total of 20 sinners in one year

28
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,110
and send them to Hell.

29
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,571
But, Bael, that's too many--

30
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,072
If you disobey...

31
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,243
I will kill you.

32
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,034
What is this?

33
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,167
What was that?

34
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,099
EPISODE 3

35
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,018
Blow on it. Quickly.

36
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,813
- Really?
- Blow.

37
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,109
Harder.

38
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,656
Harder.

39
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,950
More, more.

40
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,955
You punk. You're still drunk!

41
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,457
I swear, this woman stabbed and killed me.

42
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,127
I mean, if she stabbed and killed you,

43
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,713
how on earth are you still alive?

44
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,715
Here, you can see where the knife...

45
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,759
It's clean.

46
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,219
There's nothing.

47
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,597
There's nothing now, but...

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,850
I mean, when she did something like this
after she stabbed me,

49
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,101
the knife was gone.

50
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,024
If you look into this,

51
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,360
you'll see I had no heartbeat
for ten minutes after I was stabbed.

52
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,653
Hey.

53
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,781
Fix your watch or quit drinking.
Do something!

54
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,408
Judge Kang.

55
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,951
You did nothing wrong.

56
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,287
Why didn't you resist when being cuffed?

57
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,164
Well...

58
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,835
I thought maybe
Daon liked things like this.

59
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,255
No. I don't.

60
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:22,549
You know I'm not that kind of person.

61
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,261
He didn't go as far as to leash me
when we went for a walk, though.

62
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,597
Is that what turns you on?

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,350
No. It's not true!

64
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,518
That's not uncommon.

65
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:34,436
It's fine to like cuffs and leashes.

66
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,396
But the moment you force it on someone,

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,483
you just become a pervert. You pervert!

68
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:43,529
Well...

69
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,824
I think Detective Han was very drunk.

70
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,826
Could you just let this one go

71
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,079
and not think too much of it?

72
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,622
Of course.

73
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,041
- Uncuff her now.
- Yes, ma'am.

74
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,709
No, I...

75
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,212
- Our apologies.
- You can't just let her go.

76
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,172
This woman stabbed me.

77
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,925
-That's enough.
-And thank you for acquitting Daon

78
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,510
for the direct assault.

79
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,303
Don't mention it.

80
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,643
I hope you recover
from your hangover soon, Detective Han.

81
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,705
Ten was already too many,
but twenty in a year?

82
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,960
So why didn't you make sure
before you did it?

83
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,628
This is all your fault.

84
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,464
If you hadn't told me
to look for sinners at the station,

85
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,800
I never would've gone to him with pork.

86
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,929
Why are you blaming me for that
all of a sudden?

87
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,516
Stop whining
and think about what we should do now.

88
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,979
I'm going to die before I reach a hundred.
I'm sure of it.

89
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:03,901
Here's the cola you ordered.
Do you need anything else?

90
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,028
Can you pound him into cutlets
and fry them?

91
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,156
Oh, would you like it packed up to go?

92
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,283
What?

93
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:14,119
I'm only joking. Enjoy your meal.

94
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:18,332
This place is weird.
Let's go somewhere else next time.

95
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:21,877
Well, there might not be a next time
for you. No, there won't be.

96
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,172
If you keep this up, I'm going to--

97
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,596
Don't we know each other?

98
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,808
How is someone who was killed
and sent to Hell still alive?

99
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,769
Who are you?

100
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,105
Me? I'm serving pork cutlets here
because of you.

101
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,482
I'm Gremory.

102
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,359
You're Kang Bitna.

103
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,611
The human who escaped.

104
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,996
Shit, I'm screwed.

105
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,290
What do I do?

106
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,500
Does it ring a bell?

107
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,253
If you don't want him
to find out who you are,

108
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,046
quietly follow me out.

109
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,844
Justitia.

110
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:13,303
What are you saying?

111
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:16,431
Justi...

112
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,516
JUSTITIA

113
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,476
Justitia.

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,644
What?

115
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,406
Justitia?

116
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,660
Don't call me that here.
It's embarrassing.

117
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,040
I never imagined
I'd meet my hero Justitia here.

118
00:09:42,124 --> 00:09:44,334
Wow, it's such an honor.

119
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,046
Let me give you a deep bow.

120
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,510
Hey, don't do that twice.

121
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,429
-I'm not dead.
-Right.

122
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,265
Could you scooch over?

123
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,437
That ass Bael threatened me, too.

124
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,272
If you don't complete your mission,

125
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,481
you will die.

126
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:08,692
"You will die." Gosh.

127
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,986
He's always being so dramatic by himself.

128
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,279
That spider ass.

129
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:16,700
Still, we shouldn't be referring
to our superior as "ass," should we?

130
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,789
Had I not let that sinner slip away,

131
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,875
-my hero wouldn't be--
-Don't call me that.

132
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,462
You wouldn't be suffering like this.

133
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:32,424
It's all my fault.

134
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,887
Don't be so dramatic.

135
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,515
Okay.

136
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,767
Anyway, you don't have to worry now.

137
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,561
I, Gremory... I mean, Lee Arong,

138
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:49,983
will do my best to make sure
you complete your mission and return.

139
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,319
Don't you also
have to kill two in Uijeongbu?

140
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,446
And you don't have an assistant like me.

141
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,989
It's a piece of cake.

142
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:01,161
Besides, an assistant like this
might not be all that helpful.

143
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,498
Can I go home now?

144
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,958
I'm not feeling so good.

145
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,751
Want me to prick your finger?

146
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:12,005
It's really okay.
I'm feeling better now.

147
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:15,467
You can go.

148
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:19,680
Excuse me, ma'am. Hey.

149
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,684
Aren't you only 60?

150
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,228
How dare you
turn your back on your elders?

151
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:28,564
Head on the ground.

152
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,573
Hands behind your back.

153
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,825
-Do it properly.
-Get up.

154
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:43,287
Just leave him.
Kids these days don't know anything.

155
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,081
Hey, just go.

156
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,421
By the way,

157
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,965
what will you do about that detective?

158
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,009
I just won't see him again.

159
00:11:57,092 --> 00:12:00,387
But wouldn't it be good
to make sure he keeps his mouth shut?

160
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,056
Once and for all.

161
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,766
Once and for all?

162
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,727
Yes.

163
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:16,236
The Judge from Hell

164
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,363
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

165
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:20,532
Why, hello there!

166
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,243
Why are you coming home alone today?

167
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,204
I should get going...

168
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:28,248
Hey, you look like a smart guy.
Do you like books?

169
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,461
THE HOLY BIBLE

170
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:35,130
Do you think...

171
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,258
God will accept even someone like me?

172
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,135
Of course.

173
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,554
God doesn't discriminate based on looks.

174
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:45,432
He loves everyone.
Want to come to church with me?

175
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,353
If I go to church,

176
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,688
are you sure I'll go to Heaven, not Hell?

177
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:53,774
Of course.

178
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,567
Oh, my goodness!

179
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,986
I think He spoke to me! Oh, my!

180
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,532
It's not far.
Maybe three? No, two minutes.

181
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,742
Our church is just a two-minute walk away.

182
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:10,666

HWANGCHEON-DONG DISTRICT
HWANGCHEON VILLA

184
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:15,546
Kang Bitna.

185
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,343
PETITION

186
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,804
Yes?

187
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,225
Sir, Assemblyman Jeong is here.

188
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:30,727
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

189
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,397
I stopped by under the pretense
of bringing you a snack.

190
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,731
Because I missed my son.

191
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:36,400
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,860
It's all right.

193
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,697
Parents must endure
a one-sided love with their children.

194
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,290
Is Hwangcheon Villa still not sorted?

195
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,709
Even with the promise
of high compensation,

196
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:56,003
the villa owner won't budge.

197
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,798
Why not try and persuade the tenants?

198
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:03,802
Actually, we contacted
all tenants but one,

199
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,887
but it's no use.

200
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,180
Why leave out one person?

201
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,557
It's Judge Kang Bitna.

202
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,021
Judge Kang lives at Hwangcheon Villa?

203
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,774
It seems she incurred a lot of debt
after the incident somehow.

204
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:22,988
TAEOK INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT

205
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,241
Why don't you meet with her soon?

206
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,455
I understand.

207
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,125
It'll be awkward to meet
just the two of you.

208
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,712
So Judge Kang lives there?

209
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,089
HWANGCHEON VILLA

210
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,677
Analysis results of the wound
on Moon Jeongjun's forehead are out.

211
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:51,308
Looks like it was stamped
with iron heated to at least 200 degrees.

212
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,394
That iron must've been custom ordered.

213
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:57,105
-Contact and ask related companies.
-Yes, ma'am.

214
00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,401
By the way, do you guys
really believe that woman over Daon?

215
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,697
What can we do?

216
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:08,408
How can we trust
the words of a perverted drunk?

217
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:11,870
Of course, I don't believe
he died and came back to life too.

218
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:14,122
But there was definitely something off

219
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,833
about that woman Kang Bitna.

220
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,465
She didn't...

221
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,969
seem like an ordinary person.

222
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:30,389
Then why did you
just apologize and let her go?

223
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,640
If I didn't do that,

224
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,310
I thought she might
make things more difficult for Daon.

225
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,857
-Daon called in sick.
-What?

226
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,026
He's not sick.
He wants to look into something.

227
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,653
What is it?

228
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:52,160
The test shows
you're very healthy.

229
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,789
Could you have been mistaken
because you were drunk or asleep?

230
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:59,459
No, it was all too vivid
for that to have been the case.

231
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,211
I clearly died that day.

232
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,048
So you mean
you died and came back to life?

233
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,135
-Yes.
-I see. I got it.

234
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,720
DELUSIONAL DISORDER

235
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,638
Seriously? This is crazy.

236
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:15,851
See?

237
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,270
I told you that doctor was a quack.

238
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,606
Let me guess.

239
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,858
Your diagnosis starts with a "D."

240
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:26,820
Judge Kang.

241
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,947
Who are you really?

242
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,158
This might sound odd,
but listen carefully.

243
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:32,868
I came from Hell.

244
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:37,497
I possessed the body of Judge Kang Bitna
who died three months ago.

245
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:39,082
But I'm a demon.

246
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,043
Do you expect me to believe that?

247
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:44,505
It's true. You did die early this morning.

248
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,810
I stabbed you to death with this.

249
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:04,900
There are no cameras.

250
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,778
Or witnesses.

251
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,409
I removed the memory card from my dashcam.

252
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,710
And you can't secretly record me.

253
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,592
Then, why did you kill me?

254
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:33,262
How did you bring me back and why?

255
00:17:33,345 --> 00:17:35,514
And that knife and those eyes?

256
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:38,809
No. How did you do that
to the camera just now?

257
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,478
Calm down. One step at a time.

258
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:46,358
Tell me. Were you planning to kill me
when you came to see me last night?

259
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:49,820
It wasn't planned. It was accidental.

260
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,030
I was under the influence of alcohol.

261
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,699
Cut the bullshit!

262
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:57,786
You're adorable, Detective Han.

263
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,625
Listen to me carefully.

264
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,087
Live quietly as if nothing happened.

265
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:10,799
If I ever hear you've been
saying Kang Bitna killed you,

266
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,303
I will really kill you then.

267
00:18:17,973 --> 00:18:19,933
No one will believe you anyways.

268
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:21,476
Don't waste your energy.

269
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,438
It's been fun,

270
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:26,732
Detective Han Daon.

271
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:42,122
Damn it!

272
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:01,808
JUDGE KANG BITNA

273
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,105
DEMON

274
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,658
No one will believe you anyways.

275
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,409
Don't waste your energy.

276
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:25,582
Kid, that's not what you said last time.

277
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,502
I couldn't remember well then.

278
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,922
But I remember a bit now.

279
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,174
So how much is "a bit"?

280
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,054
How can we trust a kid
who changes his story every time?

281
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:42,015
Just wrap it up and send him home.

282
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,018
I have to start over.

283
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,688
Darn it.

284
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,739
Under sudden intense stress,
one may develop

285
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,450
temporary delusional disorder.

286
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:28,896
It stinks.

287
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:32,441
It must be Dad's alcohol.
Should we open the sunroof?

288
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:40,657
It'll be better soon.

289
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,513
-Jiho. Are you okay?
-Get out.

290
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,432
-Jiho!
-Hurry! Jiho and you get out first.

291
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:07,518
Hurry up. You and Jiho first.

292
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,977
Dad!

293
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,146
- I'll go after you.
- I'll go with you, Dad.

294
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,356
Go with Mom first. Hurry.

295
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,275
-Dad.
-It's all right. Go. Now!

296
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,111
- I want to go with you.
- Quickly! Get out!

297
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,239
Get up quickly!

298
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,448
Come with us, dad!

299
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:24,576
Dad...

300
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,620
Hurry. Climb up!

301
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,207
- Climb up, Jiho! Hurry!
- Jiho, get up now! Hold my hand.

302
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:33,210
Jiho, hurry!

303
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,712
- Dad.
- Good.

304
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,800
- Hyeonsu!
- Dad!

305
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,093
Come out quickly!

306
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,054
Hyeonsu!

307
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,932
Take Jiho and go. Come on!

308
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,518
- Hurry up!
- Dad!

309
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,359
- Dad.
- Go now!

310
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:59,862
Dad.

311
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,446
- Dad.
- Go!

312
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,048
Jiho.

313
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:25,429
Jiho.

314
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,847
Jiho, are you okay?

315
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:30,934
Jiho... Are you okay, Jiho?

316
00:22:36,273 --> 00:22:40,027
Jiho. Stay here and don't move, okay?

317
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,236
Wait here.

318
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:46,658
- Dad!
- Hyeonsu.

319
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,076
Hyeonsu!

320
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,662
- Hyeonsu!
- Dad!

321
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,253
Help! Over here!

322
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:44,091
Please help my husband!

323
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,760
Please help my husband!

324
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:50,138
My husband, please!

325
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:53,433
Please save my husband!

326
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,186
My husband...

327
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:58,522
Please save him.

328
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:07,114
You killed my Hyeonsu!
You murderer!

329
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:09,700
You bitch! Bring back my son!

330
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:11,618
Bring me back my son!

331
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:13,829
- Calm down.
- Damn you!

332
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,292
- Let's go.
- Let's go with Grandma.

333
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:22,713
Not Jiho. I'll give you
all the money you want.

334
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:26,717
But not Jiho. Not my Jiho. He's my son.

335
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,261
Why? Isn't it enough you killed my son?

336
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,722
You want to kill my grandson, too?

337
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,849
Give him to me!

338
00:24:33,932 --> 00:24:35,434
Let go of me!

339
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,311
Let go!

340
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,605
You murderer!

341
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:42,274
Why aren't you coming? Put your shoes on!

342
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,318
- Please calm down.
- Calm down.

343
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,321
On February 19, 2024,
the defendant, without the permission

344
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,199
of Bae Jayeong,
the guardian of victim Yoo Jiho,

345
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:54,328
took him out of Bae Jayeong's home
and has still not returned him to her.

346
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,746
Are you aware

347
00:24:55,829 --> 00:25:00,000
that is kidnapping a minor
under Article 287 of the Criminal Act?

348
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,211
Do you have a grandchild, Prosecutor?

349
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,087
Probably not.

350
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:08,008
That's why you're talking nonsense
accusing me of a crime.

351
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,136
Your Honor,
it's the defendant's first time on trial.

352
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,472
She's a bit worked up.
May we have some time--

353
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:14,640
I'm not worked up.

354
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm saying what needs to be said.

355
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,893
Hey, Ms. Lawyer.

356
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,686
You should be taking my side.

357
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,355
Why are you trying to silence me?

358
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,815
Then give me back my money!

359
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,361
Defendant. If you keep causing a scene,
I'll remove you from the courtroom.

360
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,154
Oh, I see.

361
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:32,241
The judge, prosecutor, lawyer and teacher

362
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:35,410
are all ganging up on me, right?

363
00:25:35,953 --> 00:25:37,287
Look here, Judge.

364
00:25:37,371 --> 00:25:38,914
Let me ask you.

365
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:41,208
My poor grandson is living

366
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:44,545
with a mean stepmother after his father,
my son, passed away.

367
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,672
So I'm trying to raise him!

368
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,007
Is that something to be sued over?

369
00:25:49,091 --> 00:25:51,593
You must be smart, Judge. So tell me.

370
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:53,971
Legally, yes.

371
00:25:54,763 --> 00:25:56,974
What kind of law is that?

372
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,142
How could you treat me like a criminal?

373
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:03,355
So, we are here trying to decide
if you, the defendant, are guilty or not--

374
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:04,481
Can't you tell?

375
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:06,441
Are you a fraud of a judge?

376
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:09,987
Or are you too high up that you can't see
what it's like in my shoes?

377
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:14,283
Why don't you come down here
and take a closer look, then?

378
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:17,661
Defendant, do you want to be punished
for contempt of court?

379
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,871
Punish me!

380
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:21,582
I outlived my son. I'm afraid of nothing!

381
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:24,376
You young people don't know anything.

382
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,795
How dare you so boldly threaten me!

383
00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:28,630
Are all judges like that?

384
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,885
That's all for the defense.

385
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:34,052
Please get her out.

386
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,221
What? What's this?

387
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:37,973
Let me go. What are you doing?

388
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:41,476
I will walk out of here myself.
Get your hands off me.

389
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,561
Let go.

390
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:44,188
Let me go!

391
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:46,523
You killed your husband.

392
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,609
How dare you crawl in here?

393
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,277
Just die, you bitch!

394
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,446
You go and die, too!

395
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:54,656
- Goodness, calm down.
- You bitch...

396
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,910
You got that insurance money
after my son died.

397
00:26:57,993 --> 00:27:00,579
And the man you were with before him

398
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:03,290
died suddenly, and you got his apartment.

399
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:05,375
You'll burn in Hell!

400
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,045
You killed my Hyeonsu, you murderer!

401
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:10,506
Let me go! Let go!

402
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,508
-You murderer!
-Please.

403
00:27:12,591 --> 00:27:13,717
Let go!

404
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:24,311
This is incredible.

405
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,021
Her ex-husband died too!

406
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,105
What?

407
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:28,982
There was insurance money.

408
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:30,817
Seriously?

409
00:27:35,072 --> 00:27:37,074
BAE JAYEONG

410
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,587
I doubt she's the type to kill her husband
for insurance money.

411
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,882
And I have "Demon" written on my forehead?

412
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,884
Look at me. I look so good-hearted.

413
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,100
We can't afford to be picky right now.

414
00:28:04,017 --> 00:28:06,061
We have to explore all leads.

415
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,145
DETECTIVE HAN

416
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,114
I should meet with Bae Jayeong myself.

417
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,118
I'll be back.

418
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,136
Judge Kang!

419
00:28:40,512 --> 00:28:42,639
This is Detective Han Daon, Nobong Police.

420
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:46,476
Can you hear me?

421
00:28:47,019 --> 00:28:48,687
It's Han Daon!

422
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:51,982
Let's talk!

423
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:53,692
Judge Kang Bitna!

424
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,444
What the hell?

425
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:58,363
We need to talk!

426
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,326
-We should just eat here, why eat out?
-It's braised pollock today.

427
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:03,994
Oh, gosh, let's eat out.

428
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,204
What?

429
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:08,332
Judge Kang
must not like braised fish, too.

430
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:10,459
I don't think that's it.

431
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:15,214
What do you feel like for lunch?
What do you like?

432
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,841
I told you to keep quiet,
but you came with a megaphone.

433
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,384
You ignored my calls.

434
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:22,304
Why are you so bold?

435
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,056
Do you have several lives?

436
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,976
Only one. But I got a refill, apparently.

437
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:33,565
Get it together. I'm a demon.

438
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:36,193
-Did you forget what you saw?
-No, I didn't.

439
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,407
Give me a chance to find out

440
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:45,452
who you really are
and why you did that to me.

441
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:48,580
Let's see each other for just a week.

442
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,417
Stop that ridiculous nonsense
and get lost.

443
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,045
My patience, sadly, cannot be refilled.

444
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:04,763
A stranger on the street
gives you candy.

445
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,557
They look like a nice person,

446
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,642
but should you go with them?

447
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:11,061
-No.
-No.

448
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,981
That's right.
Don't go anywhere with strangers, okay?

449
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,899
-Okay.
-Okay.

450
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,651
Ms. Bae!

451
00:30:19,152 --> 00:30:21,822
A stranger keeps staring.

452
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:29,830
WHEN DOES YOUR CLASS END?

453
00:30:31,206 --> 00:30:34,084
Why do you not sue her
for hitting you like that?

454
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,919
You saw how she was.

455
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,715
The more my mother-in-law is provoked,
the scarier she becomes.

456
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,510
And such a person took your child.
Why do you let him stay with her?

457
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,431
I want to give her time to say goodbye.

458
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,933
I will bring him back
when the trial's over.

459
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:56,481
Hmm. I guess you must be so tolerant
to teach first grade.

460
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:59,735
Can you kick the ball here?

461
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:12,956
Goal!

462
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:20,422
By the way, why have you come to see me?

463
00:31:20,506 --> 00:31:23,383
Right. At the trial,
your mother-in-law said

464
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,970
that you killed your husbands
for insurance money.

465
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,812
Jiho was a student in my class last year.

466
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:40,484
When I learned that his mother passed away
from an illness when he was two,

467
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,070
I started paying
a little more attention to him

468
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,572
and started speaking with his father...

469
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,032
I guess you fell in love.

470
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:48,951
Yes.

471
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:51,578
It was a much happier marriage

472
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:53,872
than I'd ever imagined.

473
00:31:53,956 --> 00:31:56,083
At least before the accident.

474
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,544
It happened six months
after the marriage, right?

475
00:32:02,005 --> 00:32:06,677
I wonder what I did so wrong
to experience something like this again.

476
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,596
I didn't want to live anymore.

477
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,140
Why do you insist on raising the child?

478
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,143
My mother-in-law

479
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,855
left her son, my husband,
when he was five.

480
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,774
She abandoned her child?

481
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:24,403
And she showed up
over 30 years later

482
00:32:24,486 --> 00:32:27,155
and asked him for money often.

483
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:32,661
And now, she's demanding she have
the death benefit under Jiho's name.

484
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:37,833
She took him for the insurance money.
I can't let her raise him.

485
00:32:39,126 --> 00:32:41,336
I didn't give birth to him,

486
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,796
but Jiho is my son.

487
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:48,510
Please help me have Jiho back, Judge Kang.

488
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:00,564
How did it go with Ms. Bae Jayeong?

489
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,150
Are you a stalker?

490
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,652
If I'm a stalker, are you a murderer?

491
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:12,534
I let it go when you came to court
and used that megaphone.

492
00:33:12,618 --> 00:33:17,122
I thought, "He came back from the dead,
so maybe he has nothing to fear."

493
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,418
But my patience ends here. Just die.

494
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,593
You can't kill me, right?

495
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,806
When we met at Moon Jeongjun's house,

496
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,100
you grabbed my wrist like this.

497
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,853
But your grip was much stronger then.

498
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:44,233
I was going easy on you just now.

499
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:47,152
No, there's a reason you can't kill me.

500
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:49,112
No. You're wrong.

501
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,240
I think I'm right. You're flustered.

502
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:55,118
Do you want to be flustered for real?

503
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,037
It's her.

504
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,757
Those kids just saved your life.

505
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,009
Get in. I'll drive you home.

506
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,803
Don't talk to me. I'm tired.

507
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:15,389
And yet you always get the last word.

508
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,104
-I told you, I'm tired.
-That's why I'm escorting you home.

509
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,566
As a detective,
I will make sure you get home safely.

510
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:36,326
I looked into Bae Jayeong.

511
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,288
Don't you think
you're abusing your power here?

512
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:43,000
Her first husband suddenly went blind
and fell to his death in the mountains.

513
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:46,545
Ms. Bae inherited an apartment and
got 500 million won in death benefits.

514
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:50,090
Benefits from Yoo Hyeonsu's recent death
are three billion won.

515
00:34:50,174 --> 00:34:52,176
Ms. Bae and his son Yoo Jiho are set

516
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,803
to receive
1.8 billion and 1.2 billion won each.

517
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:56,889
Why are you telling me that?

518
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:02,060
I have to prove myself useful
so you'll give me your time.

519
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,439
Don't you have work to do?

520
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:08,650
Someone stabbed me to death,
so I called in sick.

521
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:18,744
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!
FROM ALL HWANGCHEON VILLA RESIDENTS

522
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:23,207
HWANGCHEON VILLA

523
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,876
You're going to meet with
Jang Sunhui, right? When?

524
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,377
I'm not. Why would I?

525
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:28,879
During Moon Jeongjun's case,

526
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,673
you met with the parents
of both the victim and defendant.

527
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:34,510
Though you met
with his parents after the trial.

528
00:35:34,593 --> 00:35:36,261
In this case, is the defendant claiming

529
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,889
that Bae Jayeong killed her husband
for insurance money

530
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:41,350
because she simply hates Bae Jayeong

531
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:45,103
or because there's evidence
not found in the investigation?

532
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:46,563
I imagine you'd be curious.

533
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:49,107
Nope. I'm not curious at all.

534
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:52,277
I think we both want to know the truth.

535
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:54,947
You want to know
the truth behind the case,

536
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,407
and I want to know the truth behind

537
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,701
who you are and why you killed me.

538
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:02,788
Stop whining about truth already.

539
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:32,651
Goodness.

540
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:34,695
Seriously...

541
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:36,697
Oh, my shoulder.

542
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:41,702
Will we find anything
if we go talk to the grandmother tomorrow?

543
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,413
To me, she's the stranger one.

544
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,334
The Bible says this.

545
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:51,169
In Matthew 7:7,

546
00:36:51,253 --> 00:36:53,714
"Ask and it will be given to you."

547
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:56,800
"Seek and you will find."

548
00:36:56,884 --> 00:37:00,679
"Knock and the door
will be opened to you."

549
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,182
It's too early to give up.

550
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,934
If we knock on the grandmother,
we'll find something.

551
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:11,190
But was Bible study
mandatory for you, too?

552
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,278
Probably.

553
00:37:21,158 --> 00:37:23,243
I had a really tough time back then.

554
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,871
The Bible was so hot and blinding.

555
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,917
I had to wear firefighter gloves
and welding goggles to read it.

556
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,253
Welding goggles?

557
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:34,838
Why did I not think of that?

558
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,256
But why are your eyes so red?

559
00:37:37,049 --> 00:37:38,550
What have you been looking at?

560
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:39,843
Nothing.

561
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,346
I have a bad eye inflammation.

562
00:37:43,013 --> 00:37:44,640
A few days of rest, and I'll be fine.

563
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:47,935
Right, I have to go with you tomorrow,
so no rest.

564
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,771
Don't come. You won't be helpful anyways.

565
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:52,147
Really? But...

566
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,108
what if Detective Han follows you again?

567
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,904
He won't be able to tomorrow.

568
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,092
Judge Kang.

569
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,182
Why are you so late?

570
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:29,893
-Should we get going?
-How long have you been waiting?

571
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,354
Since last night.

572
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,982
Do you know The Screwtape Letters?

573
00:38:35,524 --> 00:38:37,276
I hear he's a demon. Demon!

574
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:41,697
Get in.

575
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:44,366
Are you crazy? I'm being serious.

576
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,954
Even if you don't get in my car,
I'll follow you.

577
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:52,541
So just consider me your driver
and let's go together.

578
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:57,754
-Fine. Let's go together.
-Good.

579
00:38:58,297 --> 00:38:59,423
But before we go...

580
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:02,926
I'll take care of this first.

581
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,178
That's...

582
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:07,181
A secret recorder? So uncool.

583
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,183
Why so sloppy, Detective?

584
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:12,895
Snacks, gas, and toll fees.

585
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,688
You'll be paying, right?

586
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:20,861
This is so weird.

587
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,416
WALNUT PASTRIES

588
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,044
You got rid of the cross.

589
00:39:37,878 --> 00:39:40,547
I remembered you couldn't
look at it straight.

590
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,425
Don't pretend you care.

591
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,136
Aren't you scared of me?

592
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,764
Nope. Not at all.

593
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,600
You don't get it, do you?

594
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,228
Did your parents
scold you a lot as a child?

595
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:57,648
What about you?

596
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,650
Never.

597
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:01,610
Demons don't have parents.

598
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:05,697
What? You don't believe me?

599
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:08,075
Faith is not only for church.

600
00:40:08,158 --> 00:40:10,536
You need faith when you meet a demon, too.

601
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:12,996
But there's no proof you're a demon.

602
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,166
Believing only when there's
proof isn't faith. It's confirmation.

603
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,878
I want confirmation,
which is why I'm following you around.

604
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:22,923
Look at me.

605
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:34,393
My God!

606
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,564
What...

607
00:40:39,982 --> 00:40:41,400
Did you get confirmation?

608
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,612
Do you believe now?

609
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:48,240
I did get confirmation, but...

610
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:50,534
I don't want to believe.

611
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:52,953
But you can't help but believe
I'm a demon, right?

612
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:57,374
I don't want to, but I have no choice.

613
00:40:57,457 --> 00:40:58,458
Happy now?

614
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:03,005
"Blessed are those who believe."

615
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:13,223
SUNHUI'S PORT WAGON

616
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:20,981
But did you tell her you were coming?

617
00:41:21,064 --> 00:41:22,983
She'll be surprised if you didn't.

618
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,986
I have to show up unannounced
to get the truth.

619
00:41:26,904 --> 00:41:28,906
How did you even become a detective?

620
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:31,658
What?

621
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,496
Well, take your seats.

622
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,207
Do you remember me?

623
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:44,129
I'm Detective Han Daon,
Violent Crimes, Nobong Police.

624
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:48,717
Are you here to arrest me
for contempt of court or whatever?

625
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,803
Of course not. He's just my driver.

626
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,765
Where's the boy?

627
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,726
He's at an orphanage
because they said I can't raise him.

628
00:41:58,477 --> 00:42:01,188
You abandoned your son,
and now your grandson, too.

629
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,027
I should go see for myself
whether you really abandoned him or not.

630
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,529
And what if he's not home?

631
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,532
Then you can hit me.
I saw in court you're a good hitter.

632
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:19,581
Everyone, leave now!

633
00:42:19,665 --> 00:42:21,208
We're closed for the day!

634
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:24,127
Why? We're not done yet.

635
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,296
- I'm still eating.
- What is this?

636
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,428
Can you walk any faster?

637
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:39,017
It's the blue door up ahead.

638
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:40,894
Driver Han?

639
00:42:41,478 --> 00:42:43,063
It's the blue door up ahead.

640
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,275
Really?

641
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:06,128
Don't demons respect the elderly?

642
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,297
I'm at least 500 years older than her.

643
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,425
Stop nagging and open the lock.

644
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,439
Dear Mom and Dad.

645
00:43:25,522 --> 00:43:28,192
Thank you for being my parents.

646
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:31,486
Good.

647
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:42,456
Go in or step aside.

648
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:46,168
Go in.

649
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:03,352
He's really not here?

650
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:06,605
He's not here?

651
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:10,567
See? He's not here.

652
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,820
Stop that and get out.
Which one do you want?

653
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,132
You're keeping him there all day?

654
00:44:34,216 --> 00:44:35,801
This is child abuse, you know.

655
00:44:35,884 --> 00:44:37,636
Why would I abuse my grandson?

656
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,389
I just told him to hide for a bit.

657
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:42,850
No wonder you dawdled at the restaurant.

658
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,643
You were giving him a heads-up.

659
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,815
Were you afraid we'd take him away?

660
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:53,777
The judge came with a detective.
What was I supposed to think?

661
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,946
I'm not here because of the child.

662
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,155
Then why are you here?

663
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,574
To have some sashimi?

664
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,660
You said in court

665
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:04,204
that Ms. Bae killed
her ex-husband and your son

666
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:06,206
for the insurance money.

667
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:09,293
Is there any evidence
you haven't turned over to the police?

668
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:11,670
I'll make sure you get justice.

669
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,715
I do have evidence.

670
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,302
Where is it?

671
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,470
LATE YOO HYEONSU

672
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,222
On the day of my son's funeral...

673
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,314
she fooled around with another man,

674
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:33,233
still wearing her mourning clothes.

675
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,531
You wench!

676
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:41,366
And about three days later...

677
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,119
Why didn't you turn the lights on?

678
00:45:44,203 --> 00:45:46,121
It's so dark in here.

679
00:45:48,081 --> 00:45:51,376
She ordered in some food for him,
gave him 5,000 won,

680
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,212
and didn't come home for two days.

681
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:56,048
Why didn't you come to me?

682
00:45:56,131 --> 00:45:58,967
What is this? This place is a pigsty.

683
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,515
Put everything there in here.

684
00:46:04,598 --> 00:46:05,891
Things you want to take.

685
00:46:05,974 --> 00:46:07,976
I'll pack your clothes.

686
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,520
That wretched girl.

687
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,939
While she buys herself nice clothes,

688
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:14,274
she buys her son nothing decent.

689
00:46:15,067 --> 00:46:17,528
How can I leave my grandson
with such a wench?

690
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,154
Who knows what she might do?

691
00:46:19,738 --> 00:46:20,781
I'm sure

692
00:46:21,532 --> 00:46:23,450
she killed my son.

693
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:25,577
That's your evidence?

694
00:46:25,661 --> 00:46:27,746
What could be more damning than this?

695
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:37,172
There's nothing more to find out.
Let's go.

696
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:40,759
Could you tell us more
about your son's death benefit?

697
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,052
Hey.

698
00:46:44,137 --> 00:46:46,014
Then give me the car key, I'll go alone.

699
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:47,099
Take a taxi.

700
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,768
Are you crazy?
Do you know how much it'd cost?

701
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:53,564
What's wrong? Does your head hurt again?

702
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:54,815
Go and walk it off.

703
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,151
Jiho, you go with her.
She'll buy you snacks.

704
00:46:58,735 --> 00:46:59,736
Damn it.

705
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:01,280
Seriously?

706
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,088
Is it good?

707
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:19,673
Yes.

708
00:47:20,465 --> 00:47:22,259
Anything free is delicious.

709
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:27,055
By the way,
why is your grandma so bad-tempered?

710
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:28,974
My grandma is kind.

711
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,268
Yeah, right.

712
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:34,021
That only proves you're biased.

713
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:38,025
By the way,

714
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:42,279
do nice people really go to Heaven
when they die?

715
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:43,530
I'm not sure.

716
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:46,700
I've never been kind or dead,
so I don't know.

717
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,910
But why do you ask?

718
00:47:48,952 --> 00:47:51,288
I wonder where my dad is.

719
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,457
In the cemetery, of course.

720
00:47:58,253 --> 00:47:59,671
All humans die.

721
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:03,717
Even I could die anytime
while living in this human's body.

722
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,385
I'll be in pain if I get hurt

723
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:08,347
and when I die,
my soul in this body will cease to exist.

724
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,142
You don't know
what I'm talking about, do you?

725
00:48:14,186 --> 00:48:15,729
Anyway...

726
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,315
You asked earlier if there was proof

727
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:21,151
that my stepmom killed my dad.

728
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,822
If there is evidence,
what happens to my stepmom?

729
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:28,075
She will be punished.

730
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,494
But there's no evidence.

731
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:36,875
Would you like to see a drawing of mine?

732
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,127
No.

733
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:48,929
It's so bad.

734
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:54,518
It's because you're young.

735
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,644
Keep drawing.

736
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,250
Kid. Is this

737
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:20,294
you and your stepmom?

738
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,466
She told you not to tell anyone, right?

739
00:49:27,759 --> 00:49:30,429
Would you like to try this with me, too?

740
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,686
NO TRESPASSING

741
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:43,066
I don't care about
any of my son's death benefits.

742
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,527
I'm scared of that devil.

743
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:48,780
She's greedy for the money
and might hurt my grandson.

744
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:51,992
So I just asked

745
00:49:52,743 --> 00:49:54,745
for the money left under his name.

746
00:49:56,914 --> 00:49:59,124
I thought if I took my grandson

747
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,293
and kept her from spending the money,

748
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:04,463
the kid might be safe.
That's why I did it.

749
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,760
Jiho! Our guests have to go.

750
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:14,264
I'll pack you
some boiled eggs and potatoes.

751
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,266
Eat them on your way back.

752
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,228
No, it's all right.

753
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,697
Jiho, what are you doing?

754
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:32,783
Why are you doing it to her?

755
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,326
I asked to do it.

756
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:35,827
What?

757
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:46,672
Kid.

758
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:49,758
Can you tell me what happened on this day?

759
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:07,860
WATER SOLUBLE ADHESIVE

760
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,169
It stinks.

761
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,299
It must be Dad's alcohol.
Should we open the sunroof?

762
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:36,221
It'll be better soon.

763
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:46,106
Hey! Get up!

764
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,733
Get up, hurry!

765
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:50,235
Climb up, Jiho!

766
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:52,321
I'll go with you, Dad.

767
00:51:52,404 --> 00:51:54,907
I'll be up soon. You go first.

768
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:56,992
It's all right. Go.

769
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:59,578
- Dad.
- It's all right.

770
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,122
Leave your dad and come up, hurry.

771
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,665
Dad.

772
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:11,089
Damn it. There's water in my ears.

773
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,515
Dad!

774
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:31,735
Dad!

775
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,196
Dad!

776
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:40,369
My dad's not out yet.

777
00:52:40,452 --> 00:52:43,205
Please save him!

778
00:52:49,503 --> 00:52:52,089
You have to do as I say, okay?

779
00:52:52,172 --> 00:52:54,550
If you don't listen to me,

780
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:58,178
I will kill her.

781
00:53:23,912 --> 00:53:26,540
Dad!

782
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:28,375
Be quiet!

783
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,547
Save my dad, please!

784
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,842
Jiho, do you want to die, too?

785
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:45,058
Did your stepmom say

786
00:53:45,642 --> 00:53:48,228
she would kill you
if you didn't listen to her?

787
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,813
My grandma.

788
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:53,942
Dad.

789
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:02,242
Come here.

790
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,496
I miss my dad.

791
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:09,958
Uncle.

792
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,586
You'll report
the child abuse first, right?

793
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,922
And reinvestigate Yoo Hyeonsu's death.

794
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:18,008
I'll do everything I can, of course.

795
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,968
But it'll be useless.

796
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,433
If the only evidence to solve the case
is a child's testimony,

797
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:30,729
and if the child changes his statement
every time he's investigated,

798
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:33,148
who would believe him?

799
00:54:33,732 --> 00:54:35,025
I will.

800
00:54:39,071 --> 00:54:41,698
You kept pestering me and I was annoyed,

801
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,994
but if you were to show up before me
as a child,

802
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:48,455
I would believe everything you say.

803
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,791
Why? Because you're a child.

804
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:54,127
Children may be unruly,
but they're not sneaky.

805
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,421
So I believe everything children say.

806
00:54:57,297 --> 00:54:59,007
Even if it's you.

807
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:09,142
Why are you looking at me like that?

808
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:28,954
You should be ashamed.

809
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:32,165
You're a detective.
You shouldn't ignore children.

810
00:55:47,806 --> 00:55:50,559
Case number 2024GoDan174.

811
00:55:50,642 --> 00:55:52,144
I'll pronounce the verdict.

812
00:55:53,145 --> 00:55:56,190
The defendant, Jang Sunhui,
has committed the crime of

813
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,818
kidnapping a minor
under Article 287 of the Criminal Act.

814
00:55:59,902 --> 00:56:02,571
However, the victim contacted
the defendant first

815
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:04,740
and requested to visit the defendant,

816
00:56:04,823 --> 00:56:08,327
later expressing his desire
to live with the defendant.

817
00:56:08,410 --> 00:56:11,330
Taking this into consideration,
the court has decided as follows.

818
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,456
PROSECUTION

819
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,416
The defendant

820
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:17,461
Jang Sunhui's sentence

821
00:56:19,588 --> 00:56:21,298
shall be suspended.

822
00:56:29,181 --> 00:56:30,933
Then what happens to me?

823
00:56:31,517 --> 00:56:33,393
-Am I going to jail?
-No.

824
00:56:33,477 --> 00:56:36,396
If you commit
no more crimes for the next two years,

825
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,025
you won't be punished for this offense.
That's what it means.

826
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:43,278
It's the lightest sentence
the judge could give.

827
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:44,571
Really?

828
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,783
Thank you!

829
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,076
Thank you!

830
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:52,162
However, parental and custody rights
of the victim

831
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:54,164
still lie with the protection supervisor.

832
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,668
You must consult with Ms. Bae Jayeong

833
00:56:57,751 --> 00:57:00,170
about who will raise the child.

834
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,256
But that's...

835
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:14,268
Go! Get lost!

836
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:16,436
This is bullshit!

837
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,274
Go back.
I'm never giving my Jiho to her. I won't!

838
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:24,862
I will just go back for now.
I don't want to scare him.

839
00:57:24,945 --> 00:57:27,406
Yes, go, you murderer!

840
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:29,741
I don't ever want to see your face.

841
00:57:29,825 --> 00:57:32,411
You two-faced wench!

842
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:48,135
RED GINSENG

843
00:57:50,804 --> 00:57:53,098
Why didn't you listen to me and lie?

844
00:57:53,682 --> 00:57:55,392
I'm sorry.

845
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:57,811
Lying makes you a bad child.

846
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:00,522
And bad children should get punished.

847
00:58:20,834 --> 00:58:22,586
The pillow game is boring now,
right?

848
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,713
Should we play a new game?

849
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,966
I want to see how long you can
hold your breath underwater.

850
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,553
You can't come up until I say so, okay?

851
00:58:32,137 --> 00:58:33,305
Sounds fun, right?

852
00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:45,067
YOO JIHO

853
00:58:48,278 --> 00:58:51,698
If you don't listen to me,
I will kill you.

854
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,041
Ms. Bae?

855
00:59:02,084 --> 00:59:03,544
Ms. Bae, are you in there?

856
00:59:04,503 --> 00:59:07,130
Ms. Bae! This is Detective Han Daon.

857
00:59:07,214 --> 00:59:09,007
Jiho, are you in there?

858
00:59:19,351 --> 00:59:20,352
He's dead.

859
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,909
What are you doing?

860
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,042
Where's Jiho?

861
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:49,006
He's safe at home.

862
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:54,344
Lying makes you a bad adult.

863
00:59:55,971 --> 00:59:57,264
And bad adults

864
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:00,142
must be punished.

865
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:11,570

If you don't listen to me,
I will kill your grandma.

873
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,513
Jiho! Yoo Jiho!

874
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:40,933
Do you admit to your crimes?

875
01:00:41,016 --> 01:00:44,645
-Crimes? What crimes?
-Smile. I'm just playing with you, too.

876
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:46,438
I'll go first. You follow me.

877
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:47,773
Please! Please help me!

878
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:52,110
-Gehenna.
-That's what Moon had on his forehead.

879
01:00:52,194 --> 01:00:54,738
There's one more link
between these two cases.

880
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,406
A detective's here to see me?

881
01:00:56,490 --> 01:00:57,741
I won't bother you anymore.

882
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:02,037
Why? Go back to being
curious about me and annoying me.

883
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:05,832
If a demon falls in love, what happens?

884
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:07,251
There's only death.

885
01:01:07,334 --> 01:01:09,753
You will face a fate
even worse than death.

886
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,881
You're glad Bae Jayeong's dead, right?

887
01:01:12,965 --> 01:01:15,175
You didn't do it, did you?

888
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:17,094
Goodbye.
