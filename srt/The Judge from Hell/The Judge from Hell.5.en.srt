1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,951
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,912
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,956
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,889
You said we'd never see each other again.

5
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,267
I changed my mind.

6
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,893
I'm curious again.

7
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,729
About you, Kang Bitna.

8
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,984
Unbelievable...
You're so bothersome.

9
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,369
Are you messing around again?

10
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,954
You won't fool me this time.

11
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,134
Judge Kang.

12
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,106
Judge Kang. Judge Kang!

13
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,191
Judge Kang!

14
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,694
Goodness,
what happened to her? Be careful!

15
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,493
EPISODE 5

16
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,923
Excuse me.

17
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,633
Oh, no.

18
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,843
My goodness, what happened?

19
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,679
What do we do? What if she dies?

20
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,015
Darn it.

21
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,066
Are you okay?

22
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,696
Excuse me. The patient's awake.

23
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,781
Okay.

24
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,548
Are you all right?

25
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,183
Isn't it problematic that nothing's wrong?

26
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,186
Test results show
there's nothing physically wrong.

27
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,565
But why would I faint
if there's nothing wrong?

28
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,818
My heart was beating so fast,
as if it'd jump out of my chest.

29
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,987
Have you experienced stress lately?

30
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,782
Living among people
is stressful in itself.

31
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:22,744
It's highly likely
that you experienced severe stress

32
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,289
due to external stimuli
right before you fainted.

33
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,333
Do you remember
what situation you were in?

34
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,673
I'm curious again.

35
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,968
About you, Kang Bitna.

36
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,473
There actually was great external stimuli.

37
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,934
Then it's best you avoid it.

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,062
What if I can't?

39
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,689
You have to eliminate it.

40
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,358
And if I can't do that either?

41
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,235
Then...

42
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,655
is there any way for you to like it?

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,089
What did the doctor say?

44
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,510
- Is she ill enough to need a wheelchair?
- No, it's not that.

45
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,553
She's only pretending to be a patient.

46
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,601
How dare you come here?

47
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,063
She's being discharged.
I wanted to drive her home.

48
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,398
-Since I live next door anyways.
-Next door?

49
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,777
-Fine.
-Justitia.

50
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,861
It's fine.

51
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,989
I have to ask you
something anyways. Let's go.

52
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,337
How are you feeling?

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,550
Don't pretend to be all nice.

54
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,390
Just leave it. I'll take care of it.

55
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,853
What you said yesterday.
What did you mean?

56
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,689
You said you weren't
going to bother me anymore.

57
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,568
And you didn't seem to care
when I told you things about Kang Bitna.

58
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,361
So why are you curious about me again?

59
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,321
I want to confirm something.

60
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,615
You've already confirmed that I'm a demon.

61
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,200
What more do you need to know?

62
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,786
What kind of person Kang Bitna is.

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,204
Everything.

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,921
Ma'am!

65
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,257
-Ma'am.
-You're back.

66
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,842
Minjun, help her.

67
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,468
No, stop.

68
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,597
Never go anywhere alone.

69
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,183
Make sure
you're always together like this.

70
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,436
You'll regret it
if you don't listen to me.

71
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,314
Well, let us help you.

72
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,151
All right.

73
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,777
I'll do it.

74
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,200
How are your knees?

75
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,244
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT OF HWANGCHEON-DONG!
FROM ALL HWANGCHEON VILLA RESIDENTS

76
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,134
Are you back home from the hospital?

77
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,011
How are you feeling?

78
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,346
I'm fine.

79
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,434
She has knee pain.

80
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,686
We ran into her
on her way back from the clinic.

81
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,607
I see.
That's TMI I don't care to know. Thanks.

82
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:39,942
Okay.

83
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,904
Did they not fix
that foul mouth of yours at the hospital?

84
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:48,116
Seems they didn't fix
your temper at the clinic either.

85
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:56,375
You should have just died
and gone to the morgue in the hospital.

86
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,293
Why are you back here?

87
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,840
I can't miss out
on your funeral when you go.

88
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,593
That'll be a fun day.

89
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:14,476
Why, you little...

90
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:18,897
I've seen this before.

91
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,400
It's like a UFC match.

92
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:24,611
Judge Kang, I think that's enough. Please.

93
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:26,822
Consider yourself lucky.

94
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,657
How can I?

95
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,659
When I'm looking right at your face?

96
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,080
What the...

97
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,915
Take care. Ma'am.

98
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:39,126
Has that old hag gone senile?

99
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,919
Hello, ma'am.

100
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,004
HWANGCHEON VILLA

101
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,088
How are you?

102
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,054
Oh, my! Hey!

103
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,974
Hallelujah!

104
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,559
Honey.

105
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,769
Do you know how long I've waited for you?

106
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:01,440
As a state employee,
you must stay healthy in body and spirit.

107
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,192
And how can we do that?

108
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,402
You must believe in Christ.

109
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,780
Let's go to church right now.

110
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,992
The Lord's words

111
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,870
will cleanse your entire body.

112
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:19,416
And His grace will wash your soul, okay?

113
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,713
I don't mind being dirty.

114
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,965
Hey, wait! Gosh!

115
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:28,967
- Goodbye.
- Hey.

116
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,305
-Yes?
-And what's your religion?

117
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,308
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Next time...

118
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,559
Hey, wait!

119
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,401
Just recycle this. You're going to
bug me again tomorrow anyways.

120
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:56,680
The Judge from Hell

121
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,031
Oh, gosh.

122
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:17,159
The dust from his moving boxes
is all the way over here.

123
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,245
Justitia.

124
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,457
Just tell him who you are.

125
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,252
I don't know either.

126
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,922
-How can I tell him when I don't know?
-What?

127
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:31,215
Ah.

128
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:33,509
I know.

129
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,179
Find out in detail
who Kang Bitna was and report to me.

130
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,556
- Maybe he'll move out then.
- But...

131
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,974
By the way, Justitia,

132
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,144
do you hate the detective
living next door that much?

133
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:45,687
Who said I did?

134
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,690
-Then do you like it?
-I didn't say that.

135
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,318
Then why do you want him to go?

136
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,903
Do you have to ask?

137
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,364
-Han Daon is suspecting me right now.
-Hmm.

138
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,617
What would happen
if he secretly saw what I was doing?

139
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:00,369
You'd be arrested.

140
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:02,829
And get at least life imprisonment.

141
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,290
No one can catch me.

142
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,669
Of course not. Then what's the problem
with him living next door?

143
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,090
Just find it out as I say!
I need a reason to kick him out.

144
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,217
I see, a reason.

145
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,346
Then I should find out about Kang Bitna.

146
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,806
How should I do it?

147
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,808
Figure it out yourself. Now!

148
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,227
Okay, got it. I will.

149
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,779
Justitia. Are you free tonight?
I have something I must tell you.

150
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,234
Where did she go?

151
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,810
How did you lose that detective?

152
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:52,189
With my innate agility and athleticism.

153
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,444
But that Han Daon
keeps getting on my nerves.

154
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,238
Should I teach him a lesson?

155
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:02,908
Not too harshly. Just enough for him
to be bed-ridden for months.

156
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,078
It's fine. Just do your job.

157
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,372
You need to kill two in Uijeongbu, too.

158
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,581
Justitia.

159
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,209
Can you go somewhere with me this weekend?

160
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:14,211
No, I'm tired.

161
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,296
Come on, come with me.

162
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,965
It's a very important meeting.

163
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:20,884
What is it?

164
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:26,557
A group is hunting down Satan who escaped
from Hell after stealing the Kylum.

165
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,933
What?

166
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,187
Demons dispatched to Seoul and Gyeonggi
meet regularly to exchange information.

167
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,441
To find out if anyone's seen
a suspicious human who might be Satan.

168
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,778
What's the point of finding them now?

169
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,405
There is a point.

170
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:44,700
If you can offer Satan and the Kylum
to Lucifer and Bael,

171
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,453
you'll be handsomely rewarded
and won't have to suffer here.

172
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,101
I called earlier...

173
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:12,186
I'm Kim Okgyu.

174
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,898
"SBC, Producer Lee Okgyu."

175
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,399
Kim Okgyu...

176
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,113
I'm working on a program
in secret right now, so... Shh!

177
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,617
I'll take this back.

178
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,745
But what brings you here to our school?

179
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:32,331
I'm secretly

180
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,792
working on a program about the judiciary.

181
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,589
I hear there's a very famous judge
who graduated from this school.

182
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:44,009
Oh, Kang Bitna?

183
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,679
The pretty woman who graduated from
SNU School of Law and is now a judge?

184
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:49,139
That's right.

185
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:52,309
You seem to know her well.

186
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:56,605
Anyone who's worked at our school
for a long time knows her well.

187
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,899
She was very smart and studious.

188
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,025
She was the best.

189
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,573
I'd like to know

190
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,076
everything about Judge Kang Bitna.

191
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:17,292
Justitia! Gosh, I'm just in time.

192
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:18,752
Get it together.

193
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,672
You're a whole minute late! Damn it.

194
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,175
I was busy looking into Kang Bitna.

195
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,510
It's all right. Let's go.

196
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,220
Okay.

197
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:29,930
You little...

198
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,780
Who are you?

199
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,783
What jurisdiction are you in?

200
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,703
-Nobong.
-Current occupation?

201
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,122
Detective, violent crime investigation.

202
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:39,917
HAN DAON
POLICE

203
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,086
How did you end up here?

204
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,256
She...

205
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:50,511
Hey, Gremory.

206
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:53,096
-It's not that--
-He's my driver.

207
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:58,018
His name is...

208
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,312
Ppoppi.

209
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,567
Ppoppi.

210
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,781
I haven't seen you before either.

211
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,908
Of course not. This is my first time.

212
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,285
You're a bit rude.

213
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,454
I think I can be.

214
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,089
- It's Justitia!
- Justitia!

215
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,173
Justitia...

216
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,800
She's so cool!

217
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,926
Justitia.

218
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:32,845
I'm so honored...

219
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,972
It's such an honor to meet you.

220
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:36,807
It's an honor.

221
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,102
Are you honored? But I'm displeased.

222
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,149
Everyone's a demon here. Get out now.

223
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,347
Do you want to die?

224
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,016
Get out now.

225
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:22,144
Hey, Ppoppi.

226
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:24,688
Have you heard anything about Satan?

227
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,357
What about the Kylum?

228
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,193
Satan? Kylum?

229
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:34,656
-Don't you know what we're doing here?
-It's my first time, so I'm not so sure.

230
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,201
He was born not that long ago,
so he doesn't know.

231
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,204
Fine. Listen up,
I'm only saying this once.

232
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,043
Everything began 26 years ago.

233
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:57,721
Lucifer, who was originally an angel,
fell and became a demon

234
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,223
and ruled over Hell.

235
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,685
Then one day,

236
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,024
Satan, who was second-in-command
along with Bael, rebelled.

237
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,739
Satan, of course,
could not defeat Lucifer.

238
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,159
Outnumbered, Satan
abandoned all his underlings

239
00:19:19,243 --> 00:19:21,161
and decided to escape from Hell.

240
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,628
But with Lucifer's treasure, the Kylum.

241
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,049
Because with the Kylum,

242
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,010
even on Earth, you can enjoy
eternal life in a human body.

243
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:43,225
But one other condition must be met.

244
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,483
Satan, who escaped from Hell
with the Kylum,

245
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:54,570
hid himself in lightning
to evade the demons

246
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,613
sent by Lucifer to pursue him,

247
00:19:57,573 --> 00:19:59,616
but dropped the Kylum while fleeing.

248
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,204
Both Satan and the Kylum...

249
00:20:05,122 --> 00:20:06,623
disappeared.

250
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:16,675
It sounds like a fairy tale, but I don't
quite understand what it means.

251
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:21,305
A demon called Satan stole a treasure
of Hell and escaped 26 years ago.

252
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:24,516
He still hasn't been caught.
Nobody knows where the treasure is.

253
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,601
Ah.

254
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,437
It's such a simple story.
Why make it so lengthy?

255
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,646
It makes it boring.

256
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,565
My apologies.

257
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,319
What you just told me and the people here,
how are they related?

258
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,905
We are all demons sent to Earth.

259
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,658
We meet here once a month
to share information

260
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,204
about Satan and the Kylum while
carrying out our respective missions.

261
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:47,664
And we volunteer as cooks

262
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:50,834
so no one suspects we're demons.

263
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:53,253
It's a kind of disguise.

264
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,511
Do you want to get yourself killed?

265
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,679
No. I believed you are a demon

266
00:21:02,763 --> 00:21:04,515
because I saw it for myself.

267
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:06,767
But there are other demons? And this many?

268
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,102
Don't change the subject, and leave now.

269
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:11,813
So, are Koo Mando
and Lee Arong demons too?

270
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,692
They can't kill you,
but they can beat you almost to death.

271
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,611
This is unbelievable.

272
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:23,075
Judging by everyone's reaction earlier,
you seem to be quite high up.

273
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,994
Are you the next most powerful
after Bael and Satan?

274
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,247
So, you're the third-in-command?

275
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,166
That's right. I'm number three in Hell.

276
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,292
Happy?

277
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,507
They are all demons sent to Earth
to carry out their missions.

278
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:40,968
What's your mission then?

279
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,970
If I tell you, will you help me?

280
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,930
I'll have to hear it first.

281
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:51,311
Do you know how dangerous
this place is for you?

282
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:54,773
If you want to live until retirement
and cash out your pension,

283
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,066
get out of here right now.

284
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,528
Let's go deliver the lunchboxes.

285
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,534
Yes, sir.

286
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,335
That lunatic...

287
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:23,427
TOGETHER WITH OUR NEIGHBORS

288
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,680
I can't go any further.
I'm not going.

289
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,860
Gosh, it hurts.

290
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:51,455
- Here you go.
- Why, thank you.

291
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,165
No problem. We'll be back.

292
00:22:53,248 --> 00:22:54,499
- Enjoy your day.
- Thank you.

293
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,585
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

294
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:57,836
I will.

295
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,050
Damn it.

296
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,135
- Goodness. Hey.
- Hello.

297
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,934
-Have you been well?
-Goodness, yes.

298
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:13,852
You're too kind.

299
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:16,230
Checking in on me so often.

300
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,524
And bringing me food every now and then.

301
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:21,193
If you keep crying, I'll stop coming.
Why always cry?

302
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:24,780
I'm just so grateful. That's why.

303
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,031
Don't cry.

304
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:28,534
Why would you cry?

305
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:43,549
What are you going to do now?

306
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:44,842
What do you mean?

307
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:47,845
You saw me cry. What are you going to do?

308
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,349
Are you going to tell on me?

309
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,892
What are you talking about?

310
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:57,271
That you saw me cry,
so I should be killed?

311
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,315
But you know what?

312
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,819
I know what you are.

313
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,905
You're not a demon.

314
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,366
You're a human.

315
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:15,247
If you don't want
anyone to know you cried,

316
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,082
I'll keep your secret.

317
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,209
How can I believe you?

318
00:24:19,293 --> 00:24:22,004
It's up to you to believe me.

319
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,136
What's your real name?

320
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:30,512
Han Daon.

321
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,850
Call me if you need my help.

322
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:43,942
Wait...

323
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,403
The demon called Justitia,

324
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,447
why is she living as Judge Kang Bitna?

325
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,490
To achieve what?

326
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,037
Is she doing something criminal?

327
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,916
Like killing people.

328
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,125
Justitia...

329
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,003
I mean, get away from Judge Kang
right now.

330
00:25:14,223 --> 00:25:15,933
We'll wait for you down there.

331
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,476
-Are you nervous?
-Yes.

332
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,272
I had a terrible time with you.

333
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,691
Hope this is goodbye forever.

334
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,693
Judge Kang.

335
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:29,738
Can't you speak
as beautifully as you look?

336
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:39,498
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

337
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:41,333
I'm fine.

338
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:48,799
I should get going, then.

339
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,393
He seems like a kind person.

340
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,520
He's a demon. Kind?

341
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,024
That's just as ridiculous
as wearing socks with sandals.

342
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,530
We'll part ways here.

343
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:15,117
I'm going straight home. Don't follow me.

344
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:18,579
We live next door. Let me take you.
Besides, you're not well.

345
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:20,998
I'm only unwell because I'm with you.

346
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,042
So let's just go our separate ways, okay?

347
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:37,598
Judge Kang?

348
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,392
I'm fine. Don't touch me.

349
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,560
I can go on my own.

350
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:43,562
Damn it.

351
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,524
-Let's go together.
-No, I'm fine. I said don't touch me!

♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪

359
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:32,694

360
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:36,573
Thank you for the gracious hymn.

361
00:27:38,242 --> 00:27:40,202
THE HOLY BIBLE

362
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,578
Damn it.

363
00:27:41,662 --> 00:27:43,038
Today's scripture

364
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:46,041
is Matthew 4:10.

365
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:49,294
"Then Jesus said to him,

366
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,588
'Be gone, Satan!'"

367
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,761
- What's he doing?
- What's going on?

368
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:06,436
-The goggles.
-Here.

369
00:28:07,646 --> 00:28:08,814
What?

370
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,781
Amen.

371
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:20,367
-It's all right.
-Be gone. Amen.

372
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,952
- It's his first day.
- Amen.

373
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:26,957
"You shall worship the Lord
your God and Him only shall you serve."

374
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,041
Thanks.

375
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,168
"Then the devil left him,
and behold,

376
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,462
angels came and were ministering to him."

377
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:33,881
- Amen.
- Mando.

378
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:35,507
-Yeah?
-Why do you

379
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:37,843
need to wear goggles and gloves in church?

380
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,721
Well...

381
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:45,475
Because I have dry eyes and cold hands.

382
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,769
What did you pray for, Minjun?

383
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,733
For Mom and I to be happy.

384
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,194
Me too!

385
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,487
-Really?
-Of course.

386
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:58,655
You're the best.

387
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:02,075
What a beautiful sight.

388
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,913
I'm reminded of a lonely soul
who hasn't joined us today.

389
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,415
I mean the judge in apartment 201.

390
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,585
Should I have it out with her
in the name of Christ?

391
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,341
Can you proselytize her?

392
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:25,182
I'm back.

393
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,184
What is it?

394
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,354
You look kind of strange.

395
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:31,522
Did something happen?

396
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:34,191
Well... I'm not sure how to explain it.

397
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:37,945
Judge Kang Bitna is a demon.

398
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,489
And there are many demons on Earth.

399
00:29:41,031 --> 00:29:43,784
No kidding. What about angels?

400
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,203
Daon.

401
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,706
It's a bit suspicious that
you're following her around.

402
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,043
-What?
-Will you keep following Judge Kang?

403
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes, for now.

404
00:29:56,338 --> 00:29:58,048
That's all well and good.

405
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:01,093
But if you're a detective
looking for a prime suspect,

406
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:04,805
you'll need to bring evidence
to back up your claims, right?

407
00:30:05,389 --> 00:30:09,768
Proof that Kang Bitna
is a demon who kills people.

408
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,321
Hello, this is the NFS.

409
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:24,825
Fingerprint analysis shows
yours are the only ones on the cola can.

410
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:31,039
EVIDENCE

411
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,958
This is driving me crazy.

412
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,590
119 EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER

413
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:41,341
119 Emergency Dispatch Center.

414
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,343
Please help.

415
00:30:44,052 --> 00:30:46,388
My wife, my son.

416
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,724
and my daughter...

417
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,393
Please help them!

418
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:00,360
Please help them.

419
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:01,987
My baby's not breathing.

420
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,573
I tried to do CPR,

421
00:31:04,656 --> 00:31:07,201
but it's no use. They're all dead.

422
00:31:17,544 --> 00:31:19,588
The killer, please catch him.

423
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,173
Look. Look at this.

424
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:22,883
It's still warm.

425
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,218
They can't have gone far.

426
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:30,724
Who...

427
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:32,226
Who could have done this?

428
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,022
Sir, please calm down.

429
00:31:40,025 --> 00:31:41,818
I think I know who did it.

430
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,780
Is there someone you suspect?

431
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,285
Me.

432
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,585
There's been a homicide
in Nobong.

433
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,128
Please send support.

434
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,054
KCSI
POLICE

435
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:11,974
Goodness. They're all dead.

436
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:13,058
Oh, dear!

437
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:17,563
How terrible.

438
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,191
The whole family?

439
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:32,452
DO NOT CROSS - POLICE LINE - INVESTIGATION

440
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,349
I think you should sit this one out.

441
00:33:37,142 --> 00:33:39,770
No, I'll do both.

442
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,356
I'm going to catch them both.

443
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,441
-Daon.
-The man.

444
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,276
Where is he?

445
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,782
EVIDENCE

446
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,576
Me?

447
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,205
Why would I kill my wife and kids?

448
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,832
I never did that.

449
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,209
Yang Seungbin.

450
00:34:02,876 --> 00:34:04,503
You can deny it all you want.

451
00:34:04,586 --> 00:34:06,463
There were no signs of forced entry.

452
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:08,382
Your prints were found on the weapon.

453
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:10,884
You even confessed that you did it.

454
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:12,135
I...

455
00:34:13,512 --> 00:34:17,766
I don't know why my prints
are on the kitchen knife.

456
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,226
I didn't kill them.

457
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:20,978
Nor did I say I did.

458
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,355
Why won't you believe me?

459
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,065
I really didn't do it.

460
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,276
What's the last thing you remember?

461
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,740
My son's a teenager
and we weren't getting along.

462
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:34,867
So...

463
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:38,620
I called him out to the living room

464
00:34:39,496 --> 00:34:41,039
thinking to talk things out.

465
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,291
And?

466
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:45,002
What did you two talk about?

467
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:51,300
I don't remember from there.

468
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:53,343
What do I do?

469
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,390
What do I do?

470
00:35:01,977 --> 00:35:04,980
Eunjoo... What do I do?

471
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:09,568
How could I...

472
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,737
My kids.

473
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,906
Please save my kids.

474
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,825
They're saying I killed my family.

475
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,624
But I don't remember anything, Detective.

476
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:27,920
Let me ask one more time.
Why did you kill your wife and children?

477
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:31,548
For God's sake.

478
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:33,926
Goodness.

479
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,519
Who are you?

480
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:47,481
Where am I?

481
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,443
What's he doing?

482
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:54,947
Yang Seungbin.

483
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,115
My name is Kim Seoyul.

484
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,910
What are you doing?

485
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:03,163
I'm a fifth grader at Namyeong Elementary.

486
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,544
Hey, asshole.

487
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,712
Who told you to introduce yourself?

488
00:36:15,384 --> 00:36:16,468
Sorry, sir.

489
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:20,722
Dowan is kind of a scary guy.

490
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,309
Shut up, you idiot.

491
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:28,564
Sorry.

492
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,774
Kim Seoyul?

493
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,237
You're not Yang Seungbin?
Then how are you related to Yang Seungbin?

494
00:36:35,571 --> 00:36:39,992
Mm... Yang Seungbin is...

495
00:36:43,662 --> 00:36:45,497
Why do you need to know that?

496
00:36:48,917 --> 00:36:49,918
Who are you?

497
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:52,588
Me? I'm Koo Dowan.

498
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:57,342
A long-time friend of Yang Seungbin.

499
00:36:59,011 --> 00:37:00,512
Okay, Koo Dowan.

500
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:06,810
Yang Seungbin says he has no memory
of killing his wife and children.

501
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,646
Then did you, Koo Dowan,

502
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,607
kill Yang Seungbin's family?

503
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,196
I did.

504
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:21,617
Why did you kill
your close friend's family?

505
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,912
Because they looked down on Seungbin.

506
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,538
That day, too.

507
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,958
As always, Seungbin was...

508
00:37:30,042 --> 00:37:32,336
Is he pretending or for real?

509
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:37,466
She looked down on her husband
for not making enough money.

510
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:39,551
His children are the same.

511
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:42,846
Their dad should be able to hit them
if he gets angry.

512
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,431
"Don't hit me."

513
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,309
Who are they to order him around?

514
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,393
So...

515
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:52,481
You brutally murdered
your friend's wife and young children?

516
00:37:52,564 --> 00:37:55,442
I'm sure Seungbin was a bit surprised.

517
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:57,152
Seungbin.

518
00:37:57,236 --> 00:38:01,532
He was crying like a fool.

519
00:38:04,076 --> 00:38:06,912
But he'll thank me in the end.

520
00:38:09,164 --> 00:38:12,918
If I hadn't done what I did,
he'd have been a doormat his whole life.

521
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,506
Did you say Kim Seoyul?

522
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,424
Can you tell me about Seoyul?

523
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,931
Was he there when Koo Dowan killed
Yang Seungbin's family?

524
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,433
You don't need to listen to him.

525
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:35,983
Yes, I...

526
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,694
I was there, too.

527
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:42,322
You were there,
so why didn't you stop Koo Dowan?

528
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:48,203
I told him not to.

529
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,498
But...

530
00:38:52,457 --> 00:38:55,168
But he was so angry.

531
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:57,421
And I was so scared.

532
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,591
But I still should have stopped him.

533
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:07,181
Shut up.

534
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,642
I'm sorry.

535
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,603
Koo Dowan.

536
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:15,230
Get Yang Seungbin.

537
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,074
What do you want with that coward?

538
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:31,246
Yang Seungbin's deceased wife and children
had suffered domestic violence.

539
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,416
The police were called several times.

540
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,127
Did you do all of that too?

541
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:39,296
Yes, I hit them a few times.

542
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:41,715
Is that so wrong?

543
00:39:42,758 --> 00:39:44,885
Dowan.

544
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:46,803
Don't do that.

545
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,097
Haven't had enough?

546
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:51,808
No, I...

547
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,687
For your sake and mine...

548
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:57,481
Stay quiet.

549
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,983
Dowan, please...

550
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,152
This is insane.

551
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:06,490
Tell the officer you're sorry now.

552
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,534
He might forgive you.

553
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,618
Damn it!

554
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:12,621
- Sit down.
- I told you to shut up.

555
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:13,705
Shut up.

556
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:16,875
Dowan.

557
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,961
-Koo Dowan, stop.
-You asshole...

558
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,464
Shut the hell up!

559
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,590
You asshole.

560
00:40:23,674 --> 00:40:25,384
Koo Dowan.

561
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,428
I said shut up!

562
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:30,138
Asshole!

563
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:31,932
Koo Dowan!

564
00:40:37,688 --> 00:40:38,689
Yang Seungbin.

565
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:46,989
Why...

566
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,158
Why am I lying here?

567
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:02,337
If he's acting,
that's terrifying.

568
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,257
But it's also hard to believe he's not.

569
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:07,009
Ma'am.

570
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,887
I got the results
of Yang Seungbin's psych evaluation.

571
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:15,934
"The possibility of amnesia
and multiple personality disorder

572
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:18,645
cannot be completely ruled out
requiring a full examination."

573
00:41:18,729 --> 00:41:19,771
What does that mean?

574
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,692
If that's acting,

575
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:25,944
he should head straight to Hollywood.

576
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:29,239
He'll win an Oscar in no time.

577
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:31,116
Let's go.

578
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:50,177
You don't remember at all
what just happened?

579
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:51,845
I...

580
00:41:52,346 --> 00:41:54,306
I don't remember anything.

581
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:58,435
Why was I lying down
in the middle of the investigation?

582
00:42:02,314 --> 00:42:03,315
You don't remember?

583
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:08,237
I do remember telling you I didn't do it.

584
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,446
Then...

585
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,949
All right. You might not know this,

586
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,201
but there are other personalities in you.

587
00:42:14,284 --> 00:42:17,371
-What?
-Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul.

588
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,791
Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul?

589
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:21,917
Yes.

590
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,335
But it's strange.

591
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:26,839
I never told Koo Seoyul I was an officer.

592
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:29,049
Or that this is a police station.

593
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:32,052
But Koo Seoyul called me "officer."

594
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,888
Oh...

595
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:36,890
That's...

596
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:42,312
I don't know who Kim Seoyul is.

597
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,357
But we see rooms like this a lot on TV.

598
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,277
So he must have assumed
this was a police station.

599
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:52,573
And because this is a police station,
you must be an officer.

600
00:42:54,032 --> 00:42:56,869
Right, I guess so.

601
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,802
I wonder what they're serving
for lunch.

602
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:14,887
Hey.

603
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,181
Judge Kang.

604
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,141
We saw you. You can't ignore us.

605
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:24,271
I heard you fainted
and went to the ER.

606
00:43:24,354 --> 00:43:26,773
You should quit given your health and all.

607
00:43:26,857 --> 00:43:29,443
Thank you for your well-wishes
early in the morning.

608
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,279
Right. Did you meet with that man?

609
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:35,199
The man you were waiting to hear from.

610
00:43:37,034 --> 00:43:39,077
I did and we met.

611
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,831
You confessed, but he said no.

612
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:46,126
So you were embarrassed
and pretended to faint?

613
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,671
Goodness, sorry.

614
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,632
My voice just projects so well.

615
00:43:51,715 --> 00:43:54,301
"The defendant, in this trial..."

616
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,721
I'm not surprised.

617
00:43:58,639 --> 00:43:59,640
Oh, right.

618
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:04,686
When I'm with a certain someone,
my heart races. Why do you think that is?

619
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,021
Heart arrhythmia.

620
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:09,691
Quit now and get some rest, Judge Kang.

621
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:12,653
Goodbye.

622
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,658
It's one-sided love for sure.

623
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:29,920
Let me brief you on recent incidents
where the perpetrator is still at large.

624
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,007
First is the motiveless assault
at Daeyoung Station.

625
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,677
And the victim? Are they dead?

626
00:44:38,262 --> 00:44:40,514
Luckily, it was just a small scratch...

627
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,725
-Next.
-Right, next.

628
00:44:43,809 --> 00:44:44,893
JUDGE KANG BITNA

629
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,729
The king crab theft
at Noryangjin Fish Market.

630
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:49,523
Who died there?

631
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:52,317
Three of the ten king crabs
were found dead...

632
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,071
Hey. Are you kidding me?

633
00:44:56,154 --> 00:44:58,532
But you asked for unsolved cases.

634
00:44:59,116 --> 00:45:00,659
Are you doing this on purpose?

635
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,078
Wongyeong might hear you.

636
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,623
Next.

637
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,377
A family murder case in Changeun-dong.

638
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,046
Why didn't you start with that?

639
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,464
Get into the details.

640
00:45:14,548 --> 00:45:17,509
"A woman in her 40s, middle school son
and elementary school daughter

641
00:45:17,593 --> 00:45:18,635
were found dead."

642
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,054
And the father is the likely suspect.

643
00:45:21,138 --> 00:45:23,515
He's being interrogated
at the station now.

644
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,603
Get his personal information.

645
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,147
Can't you just search for it?

646
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:35,402
The precious human rights
of the perpetrator must be protected,

647
00:45:36,195 --> 00:45:38,405
so they're not revealing his identity.

648
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:40,532
That's inconvenient.

649
00:45:41,158 --> 00:45:43,076
Find out who it is as fast as you can.

650
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:46,872
Han Daon might be following you,
so be careful.

651
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:50,375
Don't worry. I will be discreet.

652
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,757
All three dead.

653
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,140
PRESS ROOM

654
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,401
Goodness! Who are you?

655
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:18,946
Who am I?

656
00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:21,698
This is me.

657
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:27,204
Lee Okgyu from SBC--

658
00:46:29,206 --> 00:46:30,374
How is everyone?

659
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:32,876
Are you here for that case, too?

660
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,628
The family murder case in Changeun?

661
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,297
Changeun? Yes.

662
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:40,634
The suspect's name...

663
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:42,553
What was it?

664
00:46:44,263 --> 00:46:45,347
It's Yang Seungbin.

665
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:47,558
Yang Seungbin.

666
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,184
My goodness.

667
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:50,978
Kids these days.

668
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:54,648
I can't watch that filth.

669
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,776
But what's taking him so long?

670
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,828
HAN DA...

671
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,130
Is that how you went?

672
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,174
Aren't I completely disguised?

673
00:47:20,257 --> 00:47:22,718
You look desperate for attention.

674
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,972
Darn it.

675
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:29,391
-Did you get his name?
-Yes.

676
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:32,603
Yang Seungbin.

677
00:47:42,571 --> 00:47:46,408
YANG SEUNGBIN

678
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:02,007
What's up with this guy?

679
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:07,679
I heard from a reporter at the station

680
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:10,057
that he has multiple personality disorder,

681
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,476
so he can't even remember
what he just said.

682
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,938
One moment he says he didn't do it,
and the next, he confesses he did.

683
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:17,022
In other words,

684
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:20,567
it might have happened
when he was in a state of insanity.

685
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:22,402
Can we kill him?

686
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,282
Insanity or idiocy, he's still a killer.

687
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:34,998
Seungbin.

688
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:39,795
You didn't do that to the children, right?

689
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,923
Something's gone wrong, right?

690
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:46,552
There's no way you could do that, right?

691
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:48,720
This is so unfair.

692
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:51,139
I really didn't do it.

693
00:48:54,768 --> 00:48:56,854
Bunch of wusses.

694
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:01,900
It's because you raised
your daughter terribly

695
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:03,527
that they grew up like that.

696
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,824
They died probably because
they deserved it, you old hag.

697
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,742
Seungbin.

698
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:13,579
What are you saying right now?

699
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:15,330
That bitch.

700
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:19,376
She kept nagging him
about not making enough money.

701
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:22,045
So I took the matter
into my own hands. Why?

702
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:26,300
Seungbin couldn't do it, so I did.

703
00:49:26,925 --> 00:49:28,677
What?

704
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:32,139
What on earth are you talking about?

705
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:36,935
This is all because
you were a terrible mother!

706
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,730
Hey, how could you call yourself a mother?

707
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:41,398
All those hospital visits.

708
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,400
You bled us dry.

709
00:49:44,234 --> 00:49:46,236
I should've killed you first!

710
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,363
As soon as I get out of here,

711
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,283
I'm killing you first, you old hag!

712
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,243
Let go!

713
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:55,454
Let go, you motherfucker!

714
00:49:58,624 --> 00:50:00,792
How could...

715
00:50:02,085 --> 00:50:03,587
Seungbin...

716
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:06,924
How could he do this?

717
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:09,426
Stop saying that.

718
00:50:10,052 --> 00:50:12,429
I told you
it was a bad idea to go see him.

719
00:50:12,513 --> 00:50:16,558
That crazy bastard fooled us all!

720
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,227
Didn't you hear the police?

721
00:50:20,646 --> 00:50:23,857
He habitually hit Eunjoo!

722
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:28,237
I had no idea.

723
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,743
"Just hold on," I said.

724
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:37,955
I...

725
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:42,876
I killed my daughter.

726
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,337
I...

727
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,382
I...

728
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:51,802
killed my daughter.

729
00:50:56,265 --> 00:50:57,432
Goodness.

730
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:03,272
I should be the one to die. Me.

731
00:51:03,355 --> 00:51:05,023
Me.

732
00:51:06,316 --> 00:51:09,695
Me...

733
00:51:15,284 --> 00:51:16,952
Mom.

734
00:51:17,035 --> 00:51:18,161
Mom!

735
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:21,206
Mom!

736
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,418
Please, help!

737
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,588
Help!

738
00:51:28,297 --> 00:51:31,633
The victims were hit
in the back of the head with a hammer.

739
00:51:31,717 --> 00:51:35,679
The cause of death was severe bleeding
from a severed neck vein in all three.

740
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,347
But autopsy results show

741
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,851
Yang Seungbin continued to stab them
even after they died.

742
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:42,644
On the wife and daughter's body,

743
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,314
five and three stab wounds
were found, respectively.

744
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,491
Mom.

745
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:22,017
Daon, run away!

746
00:52:23,101 --> 00:52:26,522
The damage to the son's body
was particularly severe.

747
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,857
There were 13 stab wounds in total.

748
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:31,235
I wouldn't even kill
my worst enemy that way.

749
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:35,697
And one thing stood out.

750
00:52:36,657 --> 00:52:38,492
His son's phone found on the scene

751
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:40,118
was severely damaged.

752
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,246
And only his son's phone.

753
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:43,622
Yes, it's here.

754
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:48,460
That may be the key to this case.

755
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:52,506
Maybe Yang Seungbin knew it
and broke his son's phone with a hammer.

756
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:53,841
Yang Seungbin is

757
00:52:53,924 --> 00:52:56,134
pretending to have multiple personalities.

758
00:52:56,218 --> 00:53:00,180
During the investigation, I mixed up
the last names of his personalities.

759
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:01,473
You might not know this,

760
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,809
but there are other personalities in you.

761
00:53:03,892 --> 00:53:06,270
Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul.

762
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:09,356
I don't know who Kim Seoyul is. But...

763
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:13,110
He claimed he had no idea,
but he corrected me and said "Kim Seoyul."

764
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,362
He made a mistake.

765
00:53:15,445 --> 00:53:17,114
Jeez.

766
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:21,368
COURT

767
00:53:21,451 --> 00:53:22,536
What?

768
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:23,871
Should I repeat myself?

769
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,832
Send me to collegiate court.

770
00:53:26,915 --> 00:53:31,670
It's not even the transfer season,
but you barge in here and say what?

771
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:33,964
"Send me to collegiate court"?

772
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:36,842
You arrogant little...

773
00:53:36,925 --> 00:53:38,218
Do you know where you are?

774
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,678
In your office.

775
00:53:39,761 --> 00:53:42,097
CHIEF JUDGE NA YEONGJIN

776
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,307
No, get out.

777
00:53:44,766 --> 00:53:46,101
That's too bad, then.

778
00:53:50,898 --> 00:53:52,399
Why, hello.

779
00:53:52,482 --> 00:53:55,068
Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol.

780
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:57,654
It's Kang Bitna.

781
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,704
She wants to be transferred
to collegiate court,

782
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,372
and on top of that,

783
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:11,043
she's demanding
to be assigned to specific cases?

784
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,130
How can a judge behave this way?

785
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:17,424
She can because she's a judge.

786
00:54:19,259 --> 00:54:22,012
Why did you grant
such a ridiculous request?

787
00:54:22,095 --> 00:54:25,766
Let's call it a solid investment
in an uncertain future.

788
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:31,355
The prosecutor filed charges.

789
00:54:31,438 --> 00:54:33,232
And it's been assigned to court.

790
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,109
Then why look so upset?

791
00:54:36,193 --> 00:54:38,028
Kang Bitna is the judge.

792
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:40,948
Doesn't she only preside
over single-judge courts?

793
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,492
She's been transferred
to collegiate court.

794
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:46,411
It's going to be another bullshit trial.

795
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,998
Who knows?
She might have come to her senses.

796
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,043
When's the trial?

797
00:54:53,126 --> 00:54:55,629
Judge Kang, the other judges
are here to say hello.

798
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:58,006
- Let them in...
- Come on.

799
00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,925
She never listens to the end.

800
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:03,428
JUDGE'S OFFICE

801
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:04,638
-Hello.
-Hello.

802
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:06,807
Hello. I'm glad you came.

803
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,141
You know me, right?

804
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:11,144
We've heard
so many great things about you.

805
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:16,024
As my right and left-hand judges,
I need you to do something for me.

806
00:55:16,108 --> 00:55:17,317
-Anything.
-Sure.

807
00:55:18,277 --> 00:55:19,486
Don't do anything.

808
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:21,780
Nothing.

809
00:55:22,573 --> 00:55:23,740
And don't say anything.

810
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,878
You seem busy.
I haven't seen you around.

811
00:55:38,964 --> 00:55:42,885
You were just following me around,
but I haven't heard from you lately.

812
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:45,053
Why did you even move, then?

813
00:55:45,637 --> 00:55:46,722
Were you waiting for me?

814
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:48,849
Of course not.

815
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:50,475
I was taking out the trash.

816
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,145
You're not holding anything.

817
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,064
I was on my way back.

818
00:55:56,148 --> 00:55:57,649
Never mind if nothing's wrong.

819
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:01,653
The trial tomorrow...

820
00:56:02,988 --> 00:56:04,198
Good luck.

821
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,367
I don't need luck.

822
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:27,763
COURT

823
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:28,972
JUDGE KANG, LEAVE!

824
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,432
STEP DOWN, JUDGE KANG!

825
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:32,476
Please take your seats.

826
00:56:33,143 --> 00:56:34,978
The trial will commence.

827
00:56:35,062 --> 00:56:36,146
Prosecutor?

828
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:41,944
"The defendant, Yang Seungbin,
mercilessly murdered

829
00:56:42,027 --> 00:56:43,654
his middle school son,

830
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:45,614
wife, and 11-year-old daughter

831
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,325
with a deadly weapon
in their own home in April 2024."

832
00:56:49,368 --> 00:56:53,664
"This is a heinous felony
that cannot be tolerated for any reason."

833
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:56,375
"Thus, the prosecution seeks
the death penalty,

834
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:59,586
the maximum sentence under the law,
for Defendant Yang Seungbin."

835
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,508
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

836
00:57:05,467 --> 00:57:07,469
Actually, I...

837
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:10,514
We do not admit them.

838
00:57:10,597 --> 00:57:14,476
Your Honor, the defendant
recently experienced amnesia,

839
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,478
and is showing symptoms of

840
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,815
dissociative identity disorder
or multiple personality disorder.

841
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,192
Please take this into consideration.

842
00:57:24,194 --> 00:57:27,781
Your Honor, the defendant is only
pretending to have a mental disorder

843
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:29,867
to have his sentence reduced.

844
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:32,244
I request a detailed
psychiatric evaluation

845
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:34,329
at the National Judicial Hospital.

846
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:37,207
Defendant,

847
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:41,670
do you really not remember
killing your wife and children?

848
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,135
I don't remember.

849
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:53,891
But I never killed--

850
00:57:53,974 --> 00:57:55,559
Just stay quiet.

851
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,269
Your Honor.

852
00:57:58,937 --> 00:58:01,273
The defendant currently
suffers from amnesia...

853
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:02,357
You bastard!

854
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:04,109
I'm talking!

855
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:05,402
- Damn it!
- What are you doing?

856
00:58:05,986 --> 00:58:08,447
Why did you cut me off?

857
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,990
Are you ignoring me?

858
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:11,074
Why?

859
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:14,411
Hey, why did you cut me off?

860
00:58:14,494 --> 00:58:15,829
Are you ignoring me?

861
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:22,002
Dowan, stop. We're in court.

862
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,962
I don't care!

863
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:25,756
Do you want me to kill you, too?

864
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:29,510
No, I'm sorry.

865
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,929
Sorry doesn't cut it.

866
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:36,016
You die too, you useless asshole!

867
00:58:36,808 --> 00:58:39,394
Dowan, please.

868
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,021
I was wrong.

869
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:46,735
How dare you, you little punk.

870
00:58:50,489 --> 00:58:51,573
Hey, bitch.

871
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,868
Are you having fun?

872
00:58:54,952 --> 00:58:57,412
Do you want to die, too?

873
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:58,705
Stop!

874
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:06,713
Why am I...

875
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:14,012
Wait.

876
00:59:14,096 --> 00:59:15,430
Wait...

877
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:16,974
Please...

878
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:18,267
Judge!

879
00:59:23,856 --> 00:59:25,649
Let's take a recess.

880
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:40,455
To determine if the defendant
Yang Seungbin is mentally incapacitated,

881
00:59:40,539 --> 00:59:43,667
a detailed psychiatric evaluation
will be requested.

882
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:47,254
Also, the sentencing date
shall be set separately

883
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,256
after the results are available.

884
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:53,802
All rise.

885
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,730
He's out!

886
01:00:06,773 --> 01:00:08,108
Yang Seungbin.

887
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:09,943
Anything to say to your family?

888
01:00:14,281 --> 01:00:17,659
I'm sorry
I couldn't protect you.

889
01:00:19,077 --> 01:00:21,121
I'm sorry, Hoyeong.

890
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:26,210
Mother, I didn't do it.

891
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,088
I really don't remember anything.

892
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:33,842
At least you

893
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,179
have to believe me, Mother.

894
01:00:38,931 --> 01:00:41,016
I didn't do it!

895
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:44,394
Mother!

896
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:47,439
I really didn't do it!

897
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:51,818
I didn't kill them. I don't remember.

898
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:54,029
Justitia.

899
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:56,323
Are you really doing it today?

900
01:00:56,406 --> 01:00:57,908
Justitia!

901
01:00:58,742 --> 01:00:59,743
You can't.

902
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:02,788
If you make another mistake
like with Detective Han,

903
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:05,832
Bael will kill us.

904
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:09,086
That won't happen.

905
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:12,422
But...

906
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,093
Damn it. What do I do?

907
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:24,852
What happened? Why did the lights
turn off all of a sudden?

908
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:30,357
Is it a blackout? Did someone turn it off?

909
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:50,586
Are you here to measure my blood pressure?

910
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:52,880
No, I'm here to treat you.

911
01:01:53,463 --> 01:01:54,464
Treat me?

912
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:56,884
So you can snap out of it.

913
01:01:58,135 --> 01:01:59,261
Physical therapy.

I'm going to catch you.

Yang Seungbin is a murderer!

926
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:39,319
We found evidence he doesn't have
multiple personality disorder.

927
01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:41,363
-It's inadmissible.
-Judge Kang!

928
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:42,698
Officer, remove him!

929
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:46,243
Now the real trial
will begin.

You murderer.

932
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:55,085
- Court is adjourned.
- It was all Judge Kang, right?

933
01:03:55,168 --> 01:03:56,920
Where is Yang Seungbin?
