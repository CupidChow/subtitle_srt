The Judge from Hell

00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,912
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:46,630
Please stop, Mr. Won!

5
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,550
It's dealing with the have-nots
that's most difficult.

6
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,926
The lowlifes.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,805
Is this emergency services?
There's someone...

8
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,184
Stop right there, you bastard!

9
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,477
It's you.

10
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:04,106
I've waited for 25 years.

11
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:10,863
EPISODE 8

12
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,323
The Judge from Hell

13
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,375
Did you change your shift?

14
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,046
They'll give me the day shift
as soon as they find my replacement.

15
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:13,133
Come home right after school
before it gets dark.

16
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,635
Okay, I will.

17
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,638
But he only attacked women.

18
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,098
I worry more about Ms. Jang, Ms. Oh,

19
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,518
Judge Kang and you than me.

20
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,062
Especially Ms. Jang.
She goes to church every night.

21
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,148
Thank you, Minjun.

22
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,153
Ms. Oh, you should
collect the recycling during the day.

23
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,279
It's dangerous at night.

24
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,989
Just take care of yourself.

25
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,950
You look even more dangerous.

26
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,745
You always work late.
I'm worried about you too.

27
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,455
Be careful.

28
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,459
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

29
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,503
What?

30
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:52,089
I said, you be careful too.
It's dangerous.

31
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,841
Right. I will.

32
00:02:54,967 --> 00:03:00,013
Now, let us all pray
that the missing detective

33
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,515
returns home safely.

34
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:16,280
Dear Father, thank you for allowing
our Hwangcheon Villa family

35
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,115
to gather here today.

36
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,828
Please watch over sister Kim Soyeong
so that she can return home safely.

37
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,912
Amen.

38
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,038
Amen.

39
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:28,584
As an active officer
went missing during an investigation,

40
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,919
the chief gave instructions
to solve the case

41
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,797
as quickly as possible
by mobilizing all personnel.

42
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,467
The forensics team
is currently examining the scene.

43
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,137
We won't know until we get
the exact forensic results,

44
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,472
but the blood found on the scene

45
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,559
is presumed to be Detective Kim's.

46
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,519
One more thing.

47
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,855
Violent Crime Team 2
will sit this one out.

48
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,939
What?

49
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,192
Look. We're looking for our team leader.

50
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,111
-Why would we sit it out?
-Look at the state you're all in.

51
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,947
You won't be objective.

52
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,657
-But--
-It's the chief's orders.

53
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,660
Violent Crime Team 2 will
focus on their case at hand.

54
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,502
Is it so terrible to miss one meal?

55
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,214
Why did you leave
Detective Kim alone there?

56
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,382
Stop it.

57
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,842
You know it's not his fault.

58
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,761
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,012
No.

60
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,015
Eunseop is right.

61
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,809
It's all my fault.

62
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,520
Because of me, Detective Kim...

63
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,189
We don't know what happened to her yet.

64
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,860
Don't you know what kind of person she is?

65
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,154
She will be back soon.

66
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,535
Where are you going?

67
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,329
To her home.

68
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,290
Take care of him.

69
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,341
It's okay, Dahui.

70
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,219
Mom will be back, don't worry.

71
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,349
It's all right.

72
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,355
Daon.

73
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,358
Mom's not picking up.

74
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,529
Can you hurry up and find her?

75
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,198
Find her now!

76
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,206
It's all right.

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,041
She'll be back soon.

78
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,381
When the statute expired
and records were discarded,

79
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,674
Soyeong made a copy.

80
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,758
J SERIAL KILLING CASE 5

81
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,306
Soyeong told me not long ago

82
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,099
that she thought he was back.

83
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,477
I'm showing you this for one reason.

84
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,858
As much as she tried to keep the promise
she made to you as an officer,

85
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,903
you should take responsibility

86
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,280
and do your job as an officer

87
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,782
without wavering.

88
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,038
Soyeong won't go down easily.

89
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,416
Let's trust that and wait.

90
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,004
Okay.

91
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,107
Are you back from work now?

92
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,109
Yes.

93
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:42,819
Did you find Detective Kim?

94
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,821
She'll be back.

95
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:46,740
Are you all right?

96
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,369
I'm fine. She'll be back soon.

97
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,053
JUDGE KANG BITNA

98
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:13,433
KIM SOYEO

99
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,481
She'll come back.

100
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,442
Because Han Daon believes she will.

101
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,449
But has he been eating?

102
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,493
I don't think he's sleeping much.

103
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,376
DETECTIVE HAN

104
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,803
Can you come with me
to meet someone?

105
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,805
Who?

106
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,519
Someone who will prove
the victim's innocence.

107
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,565
I don't care about
the victim's innocence...

108
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,617
When are you going?

109
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,499
Choi Wonjoong is arguing
that Won Changseon used the strike

110
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,336
to extort money
because of his gambling debts.

111
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,130
His daughter has cancer
and needs chemotherapy.

112
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,091
Insurance didn't cover it,
so it's true he needed money.

113
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:29,885
But gambling?

114
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,847
That's a lie
maliciously made up by the CEO.

115
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:36,975
I know it's a lot to ask,
but could you say in court

116
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,894
what you just told me?

117
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:45,859
I was thinking to find another job anyway
because I can't stand this company.

118
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,363
If it's for his honor,

119
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,448
I will gladly testify.

120
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,535
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,171
WITNESS STAND

122
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,673
Your Honor.

123
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,633
An hour has passed already.

124
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,927
At this point,

125
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,347
I think it's fair to say
that the witness is not coming.

126
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,143
Let's wait five more minutes.

127
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,314
DEFENDANT

128
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:27,860
Excuse me.

129
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,319
I'm a witness.

130
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,911
You were close
with the victim, correct?

131
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:41,957
-Yes.
-The victim had a huge amount of debt.

132
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,333
Do you know why?

133
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:48,088
I heard it was from gambling.

134
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,009
Did the victim tell
you anything else in relation to the debt?

135
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,264
He said, "I'm going to threaten
the CEO with a strike

136
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:00,058
and use the extorted money
to pay off my debts."

137
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,478
No more questions.

138
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,150
The victim had a large debt
due to gambling.

139
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,111
He had no way to pay it back,
so he used the strike

140
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,614
to threaten the defendant.

141
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,990
And the defendant

142
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,035
gave the victim money to end the strike.

143
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,496
But he couldn't contain his anger,
so he kidnapped and assaulted the victim.

144
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,999
And the victim,
who disappeared after that,

145
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,168
ended up taking his own life.

146
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,589
Is this the defendant's argument?

147
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:32,883
That is precise, Your Honor.

148
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,053
Does the prosecution
have more to say

149
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,638
about the defendant's claims?

150
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:39,681
No, Your Honor.

151
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:41,975
I see.

152
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,062
I will see you on sentencing day.

153
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,844
Sir, wait.

154
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:18,720
We need to talk.

155
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,805
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,307
I'm so sorry.

157
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,434
I'm sorry...

158
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,354
I'm sorry...

159
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,189
I'm sorry...

160
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:30,691
KICK JUDGE KANG OUT OF COURT

161
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:34,862
Thank you, Lord, for your grace
and for blessing us with this food.

162
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:40,158
Thank you for blessing everyone
who is gathered here today.

163
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:42,536
In the name of Jesus we pray.

164
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,204
-Amen.
-Amen.

165
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,832
Please, let's eat.

166
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,002
Good work, Judge Kang.

167
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:51,587
You really earned this.

168
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,589
I didn't do much.

169
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,716
I'm actually honored

170
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,095
to be dining with such a stellar line-up.

171
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,057
By the way, how did you fabricate
evidence related to gambling?

172
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,767
The documents were a work of art.

173
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,729
The lawyers did great work.

174
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:12,107
How did you get
the union's vice chairman on your side?

175
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,193
Throwing away all pride and conscience

176
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,445
when offered even a small sum

177
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,238
is what poor people do.

178
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,783
I'd rather die than live like that.

179
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,243
What a wretched life.

180
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:25,996
Pretending to know their life
without having been poor,

181
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,080
I don't care for that.

182
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,416
Everyone is vulnerable to money.

183
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,336
Judge Kang, my son is

184
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,964
praying hard in the lockup
and reflecting.

185
00:12:36,048 --> 00:12:38,967
Is he asking
the deceased victim for forgiveness?

186
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,553
No, the Lord.

187
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:45,265
The Lord has already forgiven him.

188
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:49,102
It's now your turn
to forgive him, Judge Kang.

189
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,606
Shall we toast?

190
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,818
To a successful trial.

191
00:12:57,361 --> 00:12:58,654
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

192
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,160
Here you go.

193
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,042
The only survivor of serial killer J,

194
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,002
-I found him.
-Really?

195
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:15,629
Who is it? Where is he now?

196
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,133
Actually, you know him quite well.

197
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:22,427
Here.

198
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:27,015
Who in my close-knit circle is it?

199
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,649
HAN DAON

200
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,985
The kid who lost his parents
and sibling

201
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,278
is Han Daon?

202
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,280
Yes.

203
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,326
Are you upset?

204
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,497
No, I'm really glad.

205
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:53,041
The thought of going back to Hell
makes me happy.

206
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:55,878
I feel like flying.

207
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,256
Welcome.

208
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,424
Excuse me.

209
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,485
Daon. What do you mean we
should protect Choi Wonjoong?

210
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:24,698
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong,
and Yang Seungbin who were murdered,

211
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:28,368
were all released after receiving
light sentences from Judge Kang.

212
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,830
If Choi Wonjoong is released
after this trial,

213
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:34,124
he would be the next target.

214
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,168
So you want us to protect that bastard?

215
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,046
When we haven't even found
Detective Kim yet?

216
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:41,590
-Who cares if that bastard dies?
-Hey.

217
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,050
You're an officer.

218
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,761
I know how you feel.

219
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,098
But before any more victims turn up,
we have to catch them.

220
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,851
Detective Kim would want that.

221
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,772
So what should we do?

222
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:10,619
You can't just let her go.
This woman stabbed me.

223
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,955
And thank you for acquitting Daon

224
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,623
for the direct assault.

225
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,048
What are you doing there?

226
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,893
You said you wanted to ask me something.

227
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:38,063
I had to hear it from you.

228
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,984
Only then can I believe it.

229
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,071
What is it?

230
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:53,704
What time is it now?

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,083
It's 10 p.m.

232
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,668
That wasn't the question, right?

233
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:01,503
Why not?

234
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:06,216
Officers know the exact time,
that's why I came.

235
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,845
And now that I know, I should go.

236
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:14,516
The sentencing hearing...

237
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:19,313
Whatever ruling you give,

238
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,647
do your best.

239
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:23,942
I will, too.

240
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,447
Okay, whatever.

241
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,080
COURT

242
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:39,625
Case number 2024GoDan235.

243
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,711
I'll pronounce the verdict
on the defendant Choi Wonjoong.

244
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,214
The defendant, CEO of KO Food,

245
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,757
was unhappy with the activities

246
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,551
of Won Changseon,
the chairman of his company's union.

247
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,222
Thus, he kidnapped, brutally assaulted,
and seriously injured the victim.

248
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,807
Eventually, the victim took his own life.

249
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,976
The shame and humiliation that the victim,

250
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,688
an ordinary family man,
felt during the assault by the defendant,

251
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:06,068
may have been more severe
than the physical pain he experienced.

252
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,780
Therefore, a heavy sentence
for the defendant is inevitable.

253
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,952
However, the defendant
paid a deposit to the court,

254
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:18,205
has actively promoted
the national economy as a businessman,

255
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,500
contributed to job creation,
and deeply regrets his actions.

256
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,377
Taking this into consideration,

257
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,964
it is questionable whether
giving the defendant a heavy sentence

258
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,007
is really in the public interest.

259
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,717
Also, though we can infer

260
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,471
that the defendant's assault
contributed to the victim's death,

261
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,766
there is no decisive evidence
confirming it was the cause.

262
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,394
And these are mitigating circumstances.

263
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:45,899
Criminal Act Article 281-1, Arrest,
Confinement Causing Bodily Harm applies.

264
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,443
Having considered all this, the court

265
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,571
shall rule as follows.

266
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,115
The defendant, Choi Wonjoong, is sentenced

267
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,702
to one year in prison,
two years of probation,

268
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,371
and 40 hours of community service.

269
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,221
All rise.

270
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,436
Your Honor!

271
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,272
Your Honor!

272
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:26,982
You can't do this.

273
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:28,317
Your Honor!

274
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,654
This isn't right.

275
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:36,742
He's never even apologized to us.

276
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:39,328
Why are you forgiving him as you please?

277
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,121
You have no right to!

278
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,207
What were you hoping for?

279
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,918
That he gets what he deserves.

280
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,546
I've always made my judgements that way.

281
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,175
This is ridiculous.

282
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,343
Hey.

283
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,345
- Are you okay?
- Yugyeong!

284
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,056
Hurry, call an ambulance!

285
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:02,017
- Yugyeong, wake up!
- Hurry, take her.

286
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,856
Yugyeong!
Oh, no, Yugyeong...

287
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,196
Yugyeong.

288
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,009
RUDE JUDGE'S ABSURD RULING

289
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,972
How dare a mere reporter
write about a judge like this?

290
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:41,598
They're not wrong.

291
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,183
How can you joke right now?

292
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:46,687
You're all over the Internet right now!

293
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:52,025
Those idiots don't even know the law.

294
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,779
Because they don't know the law,
you and I can make a living.

295
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,197
You should be grateful.

296
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:01,076
Anyway, congratulations.

297
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,245
Assemblyman Jeong will be happy with you.

298
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:17,718
Don't nag me.
I'm going to quit when I'm ready.

299
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,845
You can like
the malicious comments about me.

300
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,557
Wow, how did she know?

301
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,392
She might be a mind reader.

302
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,102
A mind reader?

303
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,814
Yes, but the ruling

304
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,442
-is at the judge's discretion...
-I understand you're upset,

305
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,653
but Judge Kang made the ruling
based on the law...

306
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,283
Yes, I understand, but...

307
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,577
Please stop yelling.

308
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,705
No need for you two to be yelled at
for my ruling.

309
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,415
JUDGE'S OFFICE

310
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,223
Why did he look at me like that?

311
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,267
Makes me feel bad.

312
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,149
Arong messaged me.
She's done checking the place out.

313
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,069
Tell her to stand by so she can come
as soon as I call her.

314
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,445
Okay.

315
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:23,408
They've been criticizing you harshly.
Are you upset?

316
00:21:23,492 --> 00:21:27,037
- When was I not criticized?
- That's true.

317
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,164
Where are the thugs
who kidnapped the victim?

318
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:32,167
They're criminals, too.
I should kill and send them to Hell.

319
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,962
Yes, Jaehyeon and Dongju
are asking around for them.

320
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,421
They'll report back.

321
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:41,552
By the way, Justitia,
are you going to keep working with Arong?

322
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:43,387
Yeah, why?

323
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,764
Just, she doesn't seem like a good demon.

324
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:48,684
Demons are supposed to be bad.

325
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,227
But she's not just bad.

326
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:54,982
I really do think she's Satan.

327
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,441
What are you talking about?

328
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,236
There's no way she'd betray me.
You might though.

329
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,574
Seriously, she might stab you
in the back, Justitia.

330
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,660
Gosh.

331
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,037
How is the victim's daughter?

332
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:13,250
She's in the hospice ward
because her condition is serious.

333
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,794
Are you... worried?

334
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,297
It's not my fault. Why would I worry?

335
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,257
Right?

336
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:25,679
By the way, is your terrible personality
innate?

337
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:28,390
-Do I need to beat you to make you leave?
-No.

338
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,865
She stopped her chemotherapy
for too long.

339
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,451
You should prepare yourself.

340
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:52,331
No, Doctor.

341
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,833
Please save my Yugyeong.

342
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:02,633
Yugyeong.

343
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,427
Yugyeong...

344
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:25,906
Mom.

345
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,824
I'm thirsty.

346
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,246
I'm right here.

347
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:36,041
I'm here.

348
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,252
I'm here.

349
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,964
The identities of four men who died

350
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:44,424
in a recent unexplained fire
have been revealed.

351
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:48,512
They were all organized crime figures
wanted for kidnapping

352
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,222
the head of the KO Food union.

353
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:51,932
- Park Hyeonggon.
- Why'd you do that?

354
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,725
Trash that cannot be recycled

355
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:55,727
has to be incinerated.

356
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:56,812
Are you nuts?

357
00:23:56,895 --> 00:24:00,566
We only clean up dead humans.

358
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,484
We don't interfere in their lives.

359
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,571
If Justitia finds out
you kept them from her

360
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,489
and killed them yourself,

361
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:09,616
you're dead.

362
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,535
I'm not.

363
00:24:12,452 --> 00:24:14,204
Because you'll keep it a secret.

364
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,914
Gosh.

365
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,876
It's become 1.5 cm smaller.

366
00:24:22,713 --> 00:24:25,257
Is that possible, Doctor?

367
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,136
Sometimes, there are miracles
that cannot be explained by medicine.

368
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,972
You don't have to
worry about the cost now.

369
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:33,932
So don't miss your appointments.

370
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:37,603
I'd like to thank the person
who sponsored my treatment.

371
00:24:37,686 --> 00:24:40,814
They don't want to reveal who they are.

372
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:42,774
Don't forget their kindness,

373
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:44,693
and continue with the treatment

374
00:24:44,776 --> 00:24:47,571
so you can live long, for your father.

375
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:49,656
Yes, Doctor.

376
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:52,826
Why did you donate
200 million to the hospital?

377
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,287
Don't you know
demons are prohibited from donating?

378
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,622
You knew about that?

379
00:24:56,705 --> 00:25:00,584
Goodness. If you don't like it,
report me to Hell.

380
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,878
I can't be bothered.

381
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,758
Isn't it amazing that Yugyeong woke up?

382
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:11,303
This must be one of those miracles
people talk about.

383
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:14,264
-Miracles?
-Yeah.

384
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,732
Who knows?

385
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:27,945
Maybe an angel visited her.

386
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,344
Let's go, run!

387
00:25:53,136 --> 00:25:54,888
Good dog!

388
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,564
Why did you refuse protection?

389
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,780
The trial's over.

390
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:13,866
And I'm out.

391
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,118
Nothing's happened so far.

392
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:18,370
No one knows what might happen.

393
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,374
It sounds like
you want something to happen.

394
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:23,709
I'm an officer.

395
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:27,671
It's my duty to protect you
in case something happens.

396
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:29,506
There's no need. You can go.

397
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,091
Nothing's going to happen.

398
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,635
But if anyone does attack me,

399
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,888
I'll win.

400
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:47,065
-Donghun.
-Yeah?

401
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,984
He's refusing protection.

402
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,487
He has no idea
he should be afraid right now.

403
00:26:52,571 --> 00:26:54,489
How can he be so cocky?

404
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,241
I think he's in danger.

405
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,287
Then let's move on to the next plan.

406
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,247
Okay. Let's get on it.

407
00:27:02,331 --> 00:27:03,540
-All right.
-Okay.

408
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:27,606
CHOI WONJOONG

409
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:30,442
Heavenly Father,
who has forgiven me all my sins,

410
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,528
thank you.

411
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:34,112
Thank you for being on my side

412
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,491
and with me always so I can enjoy

413
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,368
greater wealth,

414
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,664
health, and blessings compared to others.

415
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:45,541
I truly thank you.

416
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,136
ARONG

417
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:03,767
Start it.

418
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:09,773
RESTRICTED CALLER ID

419
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,733
Yes, this is Choi Wonjoong.

420
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:14,528
Mister, do you think
praying at church

421
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,781
means you can get away with murder?

422
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,951
Hey, kid.
You shouldn't prank call people like this.

423
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:24,079
You hired thugs

424
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:28,083
and hung a poor man on a tree to die.

425
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,086
I have proof that you ordered them

426
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,921
to kill him.

427
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,132
Can I post it online?

428
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:37,342
Who are you?

429
00:28:38,552 --> 00:28:40,262
Who told you to do this?

430
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,471
If you're curious,

431
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:45,851
come to the theme park
near your golfing range now.

432
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,769
Oh, right. Mister!

433
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:50,772
If you tell anyone or don't come alone,

434
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:54,151
I'm going to post everything online.

435
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:57,196
Hello!

436
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:07,873
Weren't they killed in the fire?
The guys we hired?

437
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:10,542
-That's what we heard.
-"That's what we heard"?

438
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,712
Are the officers still outside?

439
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,380
Yes, sir.

440
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,549
But do the police

441
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,761
really need to protect a scumbag like him?

442
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,055
Do you think I became an officer for this?

443
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:27,184
If Detective Kim were here,

444
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,396
she would have said we definitely need to.

445
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:33,899
Hey!

446
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,865
What's the license plate number?

447
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,450
- Three, five, two, nine.
- Three, five...

448
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:44,660
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

449
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:32,708
Let's talk.

450
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,962
-Tell me the truth.
-About what?

451
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,548
You know what I mean.

452
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:41,925
I know you're going to kill Choi Wonjoong.

453
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,178
Stop now.

454
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,598
I don't want to arrest you myself.

455
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:50,601
This is the last chance I can give you.

456
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:53,187
Why don't you be honest
with me first?

457
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:56,231
What you think about the serial killer J

458
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:59,193
who brutally murdered your family?

459
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,237
Don't you want to find him
and kill him now?

460
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,452
I do want to find him,

461
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,454
but I want him to be tried by the law.

462
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,498
I've never wanted to kill him.

463
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,837
The statute's expired.
How will you put him on trial?

464
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:23,467
Detective Han Daon.

465
00:31:24,635 --> 00:31:26,512
Don't chase me. Help me.

466
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:28,889
Then I will find him

467
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:31,266
and make him pay in your place

468
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:33,435
because the law can't.

469
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:39,274
Compared to what your family experienced,
it will be more horrible

470
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,109
and violent.

471
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,364
I'm an officer.

472
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,115
I can't do that.

473
00:31:54,081 --> 00:31:55,624
I gave you a chance, too.

474
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,668
You're the one who refused.

475
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:12,140
Let me just say this one last thing.

476
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:14,518
For believing in me

477
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,521
and telling me it wasn't my fault,

478
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:20,107
thank you.

479
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,324
Be grateful I didn't slap you.

480
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,453
It's my goodbye present.

481
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,267
Bang!

482
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,768
You scared me, damn it!

483
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,650
Who are you, asshole?

484
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:04,818
Damn it!

485
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:09,489
You really came.

486
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,315
It was so close.

487
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:44,483
-So close.
-Nice shot.

488
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:45,776
Not now.

489
00:33:57,037 --> 00:33:59,915
Nice shot, Justitia!

490
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:01,708
-Say it.
-Nice shot.

491
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:06,588
Where should I hit next?

492
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:28,235
You must be curious
why I'm doing this to you.

493
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:34,449
But don't ask. I'm too tired to answer.

494
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:39,162
If you move, you'll get hurt.

495
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,918
Well, you'll still get hurt if you don't.

496
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:50,424
-You guys can go home.
-Oh, okay.

497
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:51,925
Go take it off.

498
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,976
You damn judge!

499
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,437
Why are you doing this to me?

500
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,938
Why?

501
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:06,648
I told you...

502
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,195
don't ask.

503
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:14,281
I won't ask, I won't...

504
00:35:16,074 --> 00:35:17,242
Wow.

505
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,413
He fainted. He shouldn't faint already.

506
00:35:22,664 --> 00:35:24,374
I should hit him to wake him up.

507
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,551
Good shot.

508
00:35:36,887 --> 00:35:38,180
God damn it.

509
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,226
Stop!

510
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,061
Stop!

511
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:45,187
Thank you!

512
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,730
What happened, sir?

513
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:47,940
Thank you!

514
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:49,358
For what?

515
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,109
Go, go!

516
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:54,613
SERGEANT CLEANING

517
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,740
-Go!
-Okay!

518
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,955
Please forgive me! I was wrong.

519
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:15,884
What the...

520
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,251
Let me out!

521
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:51,086
Please, let me out!

522
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,995
What have you done to me?

523
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,457
I'm just getting started.

524
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:12,334
Your real trial begins now.

525
00:38:13,669 --> 00:38:17,756
Do you admit that you, sinner
Choi Wonjoong, murdered Won Changseon

526
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,717
and yet are unrepentant and unforgiven?

527
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:26,640
What kind of bullshit is that?

528
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:28,851
You bitch!

529
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,399
Fine. It's not fun
if you repent right away anyways.

530
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,988
What kind of bullshit
are you trying to pull?

531
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,052
What's that? What the...

532
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:37,419
TICKET BOX

533
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:54,413
Why are you doing this to me?

534
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,893
Did you have fun?

535
00:41:17,477 --> 00:41:19,521
What do you think?

536
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,210
Help!

537
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:46,775
Help...

538
00:42:49,862 --> 00:42:53,073
Yes, I was wrong. Let me go.

539
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:56,827
-What did you do wrong?
-I killed him. I killed Won Changseon.

540
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,913
I hired people to kidnap him

541
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:02,624
and beat him.

542
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,751
I made it look like a suicide
and killed him.

543
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,461
I'm sorry.

544
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:08,505
I'm sorry. Please, stop.

545
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:11,258
-I'm sorry.
-Right? You killed him, right?

546
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:13,635
Yes.

547
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:15,888
Then do you regret killing him?

548
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:17,139
Have you been forgiven?

549
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,892
I repented at church.

550
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:22,352
I said "I'm sorry" at church.

551
00:43:23,312 --> 00:43:26,899
And God forgave me.

552
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,109
Not that.

553
00:43:29,193 --> 00:43:32,029
Did you apologize to the victim?
Were you forgiven?

554
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,116
What?

555
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:40,162
I've already been saved by the Lord.

556
00:43:50,506 --> 00:43:51,507
Wrong.

557
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,259
"Execute killers
unforgiven by their victims

558
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:56,011
and unrepentant of their sins

559
00:43:56,803 --> 00:43:58,388
and send them to Hell."

560
00:43:58,472 --> 00:44:00,182
That's what God wants.

561
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:04,520
It's the only power God gave demons.

562
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,607
Demons?

563
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:12,319
Go to Hell.

564
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:33,215
geenna

565
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,814
geenna

566
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,111
Court is adjourned.

567
00:46:13,357 --> 00:46:15,400
So you did kill them all.

568
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:18,570
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong, Yang Seungbin
and now Choi Wonjoong.

569
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:19,738
How are you here?

570
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,664
For believing in me

571
00:46:28,747 --> 00:46:30,457
and telling me it wasn't my fault,

572
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:31,542
thank you.

573
00:46:47,474 --> 00:46:48,475
No.

574
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,993
But what I said then was all true--

575
00:47:06,076 --> 00:47:07,077
Shut up!

576
00:47:13,208 --> 00:47:14,209
Give me your phone.

577
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:29,474
How...

578
00:47:29,892 --> 00:47:30,976
How did you?

579
00:47:32,436 --> 00:47:33,437
Amen.

580
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:36,732
What did you pray for?

581
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:41,278
Someone's been picking on me.

582
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,572
I prayed they'd go back to Hell soon.

583
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,409
I mean, I even bought sulfur powder.
For revenge.

584
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,913
How can you get revenge with that?

585
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,751
It's a secret,

586
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:59,505
but if you throw sulfur powder at a demon,

587
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:01,757
their powers are frozen
for an hour or two.

588
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,759
Koo Mando, that idiot.

589
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:15,354
Let go!

590
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:17,356
Kang Bitna,
you're under arrest for murder.

591
00:48:17,439 --> 00:48:19,566
-You have the right to remain silent--
-Shut up.

592
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,735
I won't complain if you don't read me it.

593
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,988
I'm not petty or cheap like you.

594
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:30,202
EUNSEOP

595
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:32,955
Go ahead.

596
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:36,041
You found Detective Kim?

597
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,001
Where?

598
00:48:38,627 --> 00:48:39,711
I'm on my way.

599
00:50:55,138 --> 00:50:56,139
Soyeong.

600
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:37,723
YEAR 1999, YEONJU-DONG

601
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:07,044
Wait! Don't step on it.
We have to preserve the scene.

602
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:09,922
Requesting backup.
There's a homicide in 312 Yeonju-dong!

603
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,423
We need emergency backup!

604
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,469
Is someone in there?

605
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:27,898
-Mom!
-Wait!

606
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:31,068
You can't go out there now.

607
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,655
-Mom.
-No.

608
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,043
Officer.

609
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:52,256
My dad, mom, and Jion.

610
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:54,758
When are they coming back
from the hospital?

611
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,261
They'll be back soon.

612
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:09,231
Why are you crying?

613
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,696
You're lying right now, aren't you?

614
00:53:23,036 --> 00:53:24,329
I'm...

615
00:53:24,913 --> 00:53:26,915
going to become a great detective

616
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,709
and catch whoever did this

617
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,504
to your mom and dad

618
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,424
and Jion.

619
00:53:36,175 --> 00:53:37,301
I promise.

620
00:53:48,437 --> 00:53:50,439
What happened to the boy?

621
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,524
There's no relative to take care of him.

622
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:53,817
From Yeonju-dong?

623
00:53:54,693 --> 00:53:56,320
Was it White Tree Childcare Center?

624
00:53:56,403 --> 00:53:58,238
I hear he's staying there.

625
00:53:59,031 --> 00:54:01,867
But isn't the center too far

626
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,411
from Manjae Elementary
for such a little boy?

627
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:08,874
Fight!

628
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:11,043
- Get off, you beggar!
- Fight!

629
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,127
Get off me!

630
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:14,546
Move!

631
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,758
Get off, you orphan!
Do you have a death wish?

632
00:54:17,841 --> 00:54:19,968
Stop it! Stop!

633
00:54:21,136 --> 00:54:22,971
Han Daon lives in an orphanage.

634
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,473
Don't play with him.

635
00:54:24,556 --> 00:54:25,599
Beggar!

636
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:27,017
He's an orphan.

637
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,227
It's because
he doesn't have parents.

638
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:29,353
Are you okay?

639
00:54:29,978 --> 00:54:32,856
I bought you some sneakers.
Do you want to try them on?

640
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,067
Do you pity me because I'm an orphan, too?

641
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,487
I'm not a beggar! I don't need this!

642
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,823
-It's not that.
-You're a liar.

643
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:46,119
You said you'd catch the killer.
You didn't keep your promise.

644
00:54:46,662 --> 00:54:48,288
You suck, get lost!

645
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:53,835
Get lost now!

646
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,189
Kim Yeongsu's mother?

647
00:55:14,857 --> 00:55:17,025
Yeongsu... Hello!

648
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:21,488
Next is Kim Chaeyeon's mother.

649
00:55:21,572 --> 00:55:23,574
- Hello.
- Hello.

650
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:26,577
-He's alone.
-Daon!

651
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:31,248
I told you.

652
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,749
Stop coming.

653
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:35,168
I don't want to see you. I'm tired of you.

654
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:38,213
Are you mad because I'm late?

655
00:55:38,797 --> 00:55:41,008
Give it. Come here.

656
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,677
Daon, let's do it together.

657
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,430
I made this, it's really good.
We made this together.

658
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:48,640
Come on. Let's go.

659
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:51,935
There's one space left
for parents' kickball.

660
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:53,812
-Would anyone like to join?
-Me!

661
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:56,315
I'm Han Daon's mom. Class 3-1.

662
00:55:57,024 --> 00:55:59,151
Yes, Daon's mother.

663
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,278
-Let's go, Daon. This way.
-Okay.

664
00:56:01,361 --> 00:56:02,696
It's Daon's mother.

665
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:04,990
-You got this!
-We got this! Let's go, Daon.

666
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,911
MANJAE ELEMENTARY
CLASS KICKBALL MATCH

667
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:19,588
One more!

668
00:56:19,671 --> 00:56:24,259
One more!

669
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:33,519
Hey, what are you doing?

670
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:41,568
Out!

671
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,578
Give me your hand.

672
00:56:54,831 --> 00:56:57,584
This? I'm fine. It's not even bleeding.

673
00:56:57,668 --> 00:56:58,877
Not that.

674
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:05,133
Okay.

675
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,389
Why won't it get better?

676
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:12,808
That's annoying.

677
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:19,231
Have you thought about
what Hyeongseok and I said last time?

678
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,192
When we move into a new house next year,

679
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:24,736
we want to live with you.

680
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:28,574
We would like to live with you

681
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:31,076
and be your family.

682
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:33,579
You can have your own room there.

683
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:35,247
I don't need it.

684
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:41,837
I want to sleep in the same room

685
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,840
as you guys.

686
00:57:44,923 --> 00:57:46,091
What?

687
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,437
Thank you, Daon.

688
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,691
On the count of three, okay?

689
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:06,653
Now, smile.

690
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:11,700
One, two, three!

691
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:40,771
Daon.

692
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,865
Can you kill someone for me?

693
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:16,783
Who?

694
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,118
Serial killer J.

695
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:21,830
Find him and send him to Hell.

696
01:00:23,665 --> 01:00:25,667
You can do it because you're a demon.

697
01:00:26,293 --> 01:00:29,087
No, let's do it together.

698
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:34,092
I'm going to rip him to shreds
when I see him!

699
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,553
- Han Daon.
- Didn't you hear me?

700
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:37,846
Should I say it again?

701
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,890
I'm going to kill that bastard!

702
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:43,435
No. Then you'll go to Hell, too.

703
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,442
After I kill that bastard,

704
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:53,946
you can kill me and send me to Hell.

705
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,871
I will gladly let you kill me then.

706
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,629
That promise,

707
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:13,715
make sure you keep it.

708
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:37,799
The Judge from Hell

has returned after 25 years
and murdered a detective...

721
01:03:19,967 --> 01:03:22,886
Now that we know

722
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:26,807
all we need to do is kill him.

723

01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:33,814
And catch you myself.

726
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:37,234
If you want to go to Hell,
you should see it first.

727
01:03:38,151 --> 01:03:40,529
The moment you join hands with a demon,

728
01:03:40,612 --> 01:03:42,531
you will have to give up many things.

729
01:03:42,614 --> 01:03:45,659
Whether you use Daon and discard him
or protect him.

730
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:48,078
She cried?

731
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:50,205
It's up to you.

732
01:03:55,752 --> 01:03:57,754
