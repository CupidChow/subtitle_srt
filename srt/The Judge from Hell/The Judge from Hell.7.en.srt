Please, don't.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,410
Let me go.

9
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,828
Please.

10
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,415
Goodness! Who are you?

11
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,584
I said, who are you?

12
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,300
Gosh! Honey! Are you okay?

13
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,096
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

14
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,973
Who was that?

IN A RELATIONSHIP
ASSAULT

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,068
You said you couldn't see his face.

19
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,113
But does anything stand out
in your memory?

20
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,115
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,199
I'm so...

22
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,411
I'm so shocked
that I don't really remember.

23
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,871
No, it's all right.

24
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,582
Take your time and let me know
what comes to mind.

25
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
Well...

26
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,128
Compared to me, his height was...

27
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,382
He was about this tall.

28
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:13,883
Okay.

29
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:17,595
The knife he was holding
was quite unusual.

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,888
The blade was...

31
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,349
a bit...

32
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,433
Well...

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,144
Do you think you could

34
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,522
draw the knife you remember here?

35
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:28,606
Yes.

36
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,035
I think it looked something like this.

37
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,499
J SERIAL KILLING CASE

00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,005
REMARK

39
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,593
Daon.

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,845
He's back.

41
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:03,808
The Judge from Hell

42
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,041
I'm sure Daon didn't
even have seaweed soup today.

43
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,755
I'll make him some
this evening at the camp site.

44
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,801
I'm sure it breaks your hearts.

45
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,889
That he still can't really
enjoy his birthday.

46
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,434
It's been long enough
that he should be able to. Right?

47
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,813
As his parents,

48
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,024
I'm sure you'd want Daon to be happy.

49
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:58,321
But that dummy still doesn't know that.

50
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,577
You should've told me.

51
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,956
Hey. You're the one
who should have told me.

52
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,457
We could've come together.

53
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,335
I'm glad you're here.

54
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:17,799
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll take good care of your son.

55
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,511
There are three victims in total
as of now.

56
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,514
Clues left behind
are the engravings on the forehead

57
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,225
and the abdominal stab wounds.

58
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:31,729
We looked into all iron manufacturing
companies in the country.

59
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,065
But none made this kind of thing.

60
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,943
Oh, right. The case in Hwangcheon...

61
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,366
Also, the crimes only took place
where there were

62
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,785
no security cameras
or where they were broken.

63
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,996
And judging by the fact,

64
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,455
they seem very meticulous.

65
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,790
Any evidence?

66
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,917
None yet.

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,045
But we'll find it soon. We will.

68
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,464
Oh, right. About Judge Kang Bitna,

69
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,384
do you know she's getting
a lot of criticism online

70
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,261
for acquitting Yang Seungbin?

71
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,805
EVEN MY DOG WOULD BE A BETTER JUDGE
THAN KANG BITNA

72
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,891
THE JUDGE IS TRASH
KICK JUDGE KANG OUT OF COURT

73
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,811
COURT

74
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,480
It's my favorite tea.

75
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,028
And it's caffeine-free.

76
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,072
Look how pretty it looks.

77
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,285
I'm giving you such a rare gift

78
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,997
in the hopes that you'll do better...

79
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,041
Are you listening to me?

80
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,208
No.

81
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
This...

82
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:39,130
you won't be able to ignore.

83
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,343
"The judge needs to be brutally murdered
herself to understand."

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,595
"Die, Kang Bitna."

85
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,806
These are the comments
posted to the articles on this ruling.

86
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,350
What do you have to say?

87
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,559
Nothing.

88
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,937
Maybe you do have a conscience.

89
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,815
What's wrong is wrong,
even if Assemblyman Jeong asked for it.

90
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,402
I can never put you
on a case like this again.

91
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,322
-So go back to the single-judge court.
-Okay.

92
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,824
Why aren't you talking back today?

93
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,077
-Should I?
-No.

94
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,288
I'll get going
if that's all you have to say.

95
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,339
Her compliance is even more unsettling.

96
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,592
What's up with her?

97
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,263
Did you get an earful?

98
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,848
Gosh, I knew it.

99
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:34,435
Your conscience is dead if you expect
no backlash after that ruling.

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,771
There are so many malicious comments now.

101
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,316
- You wrote one too, didn't you?
- Of course, I...

102
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,362
Justitia.

103
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,780
Justitia.

104
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,281
There's something important.

105
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,411
What do you think about the rumor?
The one I told you last time

106
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,371
about Arong being Satan.

107
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,790
Arong? Satan?

108
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,916
It's true.

109
00:06:56,999 --> 00:07:00,628
Something's unsettling about her eyes.
It's not just her bad temper.

110
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:04,298
Her eyes always look a bit crazy,
even when she's not angry.

111
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,968
I'm sure she'll soon show her true self.

112
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,720
When will you stop this nonsense?
I'll cover my ears.

113
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,681
I'm sure of it!

114
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,391
Wait, Justitia.

115
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,560
Did you see the landlady's message?

116
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,521
She wants all the residents
to hike together this weekend.

117
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,690
To foster a sense of unity. Are you going?

118
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,235
Weekend, unity, hiking together.

119
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,446
I don't like any of it. You go without me.

120
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,905
Nice.

121
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,784
Judge Kang, are we going back
to single-judge court?

122
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,035
- Yes--
- The sign out there

123
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,996
- should be changed to this one.
- Okay.

124
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:36,956
I'm leaving.

125
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,541
Okay.

126
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,548
Hey.

127
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,967
-Come here a second.
-Me?

128
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,218
Damn it.

129
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,720
I said come here, you shit.

130
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,889
-Come here.
-Come.

131
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,391
Can you lend us some money?

132
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,934
I don't have any money.

133
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,021
If I find any on you, you're dead.

134
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:01,355
Wait... Stop.

135
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,440
Hold still.

136
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,900
No! Don't!

137
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,984
Look.

138
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,404
- Look. How dare you lie?
- No, not that. Stop.

139
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,615
- Not that! Stop!
- You bitch!

140
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,994
What the...

141
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:17,622
Thank you for saving me.

142
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,874
No need for that.
I wasn't trying to help you.

143
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,709
-What?
-Who are you, lady?

144
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,170
You don't need to know. Pick up the trash.

145
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,965
Just be on your way
if you don't want to get messed up.

146
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,092
I'm not in a very good mood these days.

147
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,677
Pick it up, or else.

148
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,179
Or what are you going to do?

149
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,306
What are you going to do?

150
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,027
I warned you. You should've picked it up.

151
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,696
Why are kids these days so rude?

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,406
You're pretty, though.

153
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,618
NOBONG POLICE STATION

154
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,623
-The Hwangcheon case.
-Yes?

155
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,626
Did something happen
in Hwangcheon-dong? What is it?

156
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,169
What? I don't know either.

157
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,213
It's nothing serious, right, ma'am?

158
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,589
What? Right.

159
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,926
Donghun and I will take that.
You stick to what you're working on.

160
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,886
Okay.

161
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,805
What? It's a number from our station.

162
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,767
This is Kim Soyeong from Violent Crimes.

163
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,103
What?

164
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,688
DIVISION CHIEF
WOMEN AND YOUTH

165
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,566
You're here.

166
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,442
Mom.

167
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,821
Hold on. What happened?

168
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:37,118
Well, these girls were
robbing your daughter...

169
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,912
I mean,
they were extorting money from her.

170
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,455
And she saved her.

171
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,959
But in the process, she used violence.

172
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,128
If they lay another hand...

173
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,839
-Goodness, my daughter...
-Who did this to you?

174
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,048
Did you hit my kid?

175
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,466
No. I disciplined her.

176
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,927
Hey! You can't talk to me like that!

177
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,471
You started it.

178
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,307
Who the hell is she?

179
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,560
-I want to sue that woman for assault.
-Me too.

180
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,186
Like mother, like daughter.

181
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,897
Then I will sue them, too.

182
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,734
They shoved me and stole from me first.

183
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,987
Seems like it was
just a prank between kids.

184
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,781
But an adult stepped in and hit them!

185
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:21,370
I assumed they weren't
being properly disciplined at home.

186
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,998
- And seeing you, it all makes sense.
- What?

187
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,084
Let's see if you stay that cocky
in front of a judge.

188
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,794
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

189
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,546
She is a judge.

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,381
-What?
-She's a judge.

191
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,845
Should we include school violence, too?

192
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,265
I can't believe you!

193
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,558
If this is over, can I go?

194
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
Yes, of course.

195
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,272
Let's not run into each other again.

196
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,862
We can't even speak up
because of school violence.

197
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,530
I can't believe you.

198
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,283
Let's go.

199
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,957
Mom.

200
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,921
Should I say hello to your colleagues
and have dinner since I'm here?

201
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,465
Why were you in Hwangcheon?

202
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,676
I heard Daon got a place there.

203
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,886
I was going to surprise him at his house.

204
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,554
Don't go
to that neighborhood again.

205
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,392
Those girls won't be around anymore--

206
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,143
Just don't go there!

207
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,816
Why are you yelling?

208
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,778
Those bad girls pushed me to the ground

209
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,697
and took my money.

210
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,408
You didn't even ask if I was okay.
You just yelled.

211
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,742
Dahui, I'm just...

212
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll go.

213
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,003
Dahui!

214
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,385
Thank you so much for helping my daughter.

215
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,929
I didn't really help her.

216
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,347
You did.

217
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,100
If those moms cause trouble, let me know.

218
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,437
I will make sure
you're not inconvenienced.

219
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,689
Thank you, Judge Kang.

220
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,300
I was wondering when you might come.

221
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,302
Come in.

222
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:02,531
I know why you came to see me.

223
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,743
I'm sure you were curious why I said

224
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,581
one of you would die if you and that woman
on the second floor stayed together.

225
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,417
She already killed me once
and I came back to life.

226
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,002
I know it sounds ridiculous.

227
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,797
But she's a demon.

228
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,802
You know about Judge Kang, don't you?

229
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,846
Please tell me the truth.

230
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,390
If you two stay together,

231
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:32,186
one of you will die for sure.

232
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,982
But there's still a chance
you might survive.

233
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,527
That's the truth.

234
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,743
I knew your parents well.

235
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,205
They were such kind and just souls.

236
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,665
They were poor,

237
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,002
but their love for you was overflowing.

238
00:13:57,086 --> 00:14:01,674
It was unfortunate
they had to leave you so early.

239
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,177
How do you know my parents?

240
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,224
A long time ago,
someone asked me for a favor.

241
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,060
To protect you no matter what.

242
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
Was that...

243
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,523
my parents?

244
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,733
Leave this place at once.

245
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,945
Never see that woman Kang Bitna again.

246
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,823
Ma'am.

247
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:30,452
Today, I kept my promise to them.

248
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,081
Whether you live or die,

249
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,000
that's your choice.

250
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,801
You should go now.

251
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,936
Aren't you going to thank me?

252
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,567
I don't care for that stuff either,
but you seem too unappreciative.

253
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,987
If I say thank you, will you admit it?

254
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,908
If you're suspicious of me, bring proof.
I've been saying this over and over.

255
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,786
Are you going hiking tomorrow?

256
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:54,912
Yes.

257
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,373
Then I won't go.

258
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,459
I don't want to speak
with someone accusing me of murder

259
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,378
without any proof of it.

260
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,047
HWANGCHEON VILLA

261
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,225
Admit it? Admit what?

262
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,852
I didn't kill Ko Yunseong.
What should I admit to?

263
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,063
He doesn't know anything.

264
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,899
I hate Han Daon.

265
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:26,777
Damn it.

266
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,281
Are you okay, honey?
Don't you need more rest?

267
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,450
Staying home alone is worse.

268
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,661
It's better to be with everyone else.

269
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,996
I'll protect you, Mom.

270
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,706
Thanks, sweetie.

271
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,168
By the way, just how sick is Unit 201

272
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,129
that she's not joining us?

273
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,631
I think she's not feeling well. Let's go.

274
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,050
How sick is she? Did she faint again?

275
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,219
She probably fainted and is sleeping.

276
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,596
Wait. She's here.

277
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,764
What?

278
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,974
Honey!

279
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,309
I thought you were sick. What happened?

280
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,519
I'm all better now.

281
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,312
I'm glad you came.

282
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,734
-Don't you want some?
-I'm fine.

283
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,821
You should hydrate
as you start climbing up, you know?

284
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,116
Here.

285
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,247
-Give me your bag.
-No need.

286
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm stronger than you.

287
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,836
Are all humans fake like you?

288
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,047
Suspicious of me
but pretending to be nice?

289
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,968
Let's go that way.
There's a platform to walk on up ahead.

290
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,764
No, the landlady and the old woman
in the basement went that way.

291
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,979
One, two, three.

292
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,147
Cheese!

293
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,315
I just got me.

294
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,611
Let's take it again.

295
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,410
Let me ask you something.

296
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,288
Why are you so suspicious of me?

297
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,708
Do you know how insulting it is
to be accused like that?

298
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,586
What kind of person are...

299
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,214
I mean, what kind of demon are you?

300
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,925
Sometimes, you're so evil.

301
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,386
But sometimes, you're so kind.

302
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,847
It's confusing.

303
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:21,391
Then stop caring.

304
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,569
Thanks for yesterday.

305
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,782
I won't accept the appreciation.
It's past its expiry date.

306
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,619
Dahui isn't my real sister.

307
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,041
My parents and younger sibling
died in an accident when I was ten.

308
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,629
The people who took me in
when I was left alone

309
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,964
are my parents now.

310
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,633
And Dahui is their daughter.

311
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,678
The three people you said you killed
when you were young...

312
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:58,762
That's right.

313
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,891
They died because of me. So I killed them.

314
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:07,020
My dad, mom, and brother.

315
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:13,777
I don't know what happened,
but I know for certain

316
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,363
that you did not kill your family.

317
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:21,243
If you did,
you'd already be in Hell by now.

318
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,412
That might have been better.

319
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,875
Stop with the self-pity already.

320
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,669
Look here, Detective.

321
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,130
You did not kill them.

322
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,218
Do you really believe it wasn't my fault?

323
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,179
I don't believe. I know.

324
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,765
You've never killed anyone. Ever.

325
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,565
Gosh, it's so stressful
that you don't get it.

326
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,901
Just for today,

327
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,778
I'd like to believe you.

328
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,281
I'll try to.

329
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,993
Don't believe in me. That's idol worship.

330
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:23,013
Okay! To Hwangcheon Villa's bright future!

331
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,265
Cheers!

332
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,061
I have to go
pray in the morning.

333
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:34,441
Goodness, you guys are gulping it.

334
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,278
You guys sure can drink.

335
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,155
Goodness, what's this?

336
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,202
Here. Have some fruit, too.

337
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,995
By the way,

338
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,040
Ms. Oh is so energetic.

339
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,210
She already went out
with her handcart without eating.

340
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,879
When people are dying, they stop eating.

341
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:58,257
-I guess it's her time.
-Hey!

342
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:02,344
If you're pretty,
your words should be too.

343
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:09,935
Mando, thank you so much.

344
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,646
If it weren't for you and Ms. Jang,

345
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,189
I would've been in big trouble.

346
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,816
Don't mention it.

347
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,901
The meat is delicious. Thank you.

348
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,113
I mean, we walked by
just in time that day.

349
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,864
Thank the Lord!

350
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,825
-Amen.
-Amen.

351
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,202
Anyway, thank you both so much.

352
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,745
I'm grateful, too.

353
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,581
Thank you for saving my mom.

354
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,459
At least you know when to say thank you

355
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,044
before it's too late.

356
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,756
Ah. Never mind.

357
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,759
I said that for someone else's benefit,
but he's too drunk.

358
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,557
Gosh, you know
you really have a way with your words.

359
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,103
The Lord has really
blessed you with great talent.

360
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,857
-Speaking of which--
-I'm not going.

361
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,234
Here they go again.

362
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,902
Goodness.

363
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,530
Are you playing hard to get with the Lord?

364
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,407
No, she's playing it with me.

365
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,243
Are you nuts?

366
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,496
When we first met in court

367
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,624
for the abuse of authority trial,

368
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,253
I almost fell for you then.

369
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,422
Because you were so cool.

370
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,470
And last time--

371
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,514
You're very drunk right now.

372
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,643
What are you doing? You think you're cool?

373
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,277
I think you've had enough to drink.

374
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,113
No, I'm not drunk at all.

375
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,907
I know myself. I can go on my own.

376
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,742
- He says he's not drunk.
- I'll take you home.

377
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:51,995
Goodness!

378
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,164
Honey!

379
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,875
- He's a goner.
- Detective.

380
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,503
Detective. Gosh, he's heavy.

381
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:11,973
What's the password?

382
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,058
I don't know.

383
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,978
I'll give you a hint. Take a guess.

384
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:19,689
Here I go.

385
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,443
♪ The pain of giving birth ♪

386
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,112
Parents' Day song.

387
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,531
That's correct.

388
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,700
You got it right.

389
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,203
I have to carry him again.

390
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,136
Hey, Kang Bitna.

391
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,347
Can't you just be nice?

392
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,809
No, I can't.

393
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,895
Why not? Because you're a demon?

394
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,400
Then keep being bad like a demon.

395
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,530
Don't be nice sometimes
and get me confused.

396
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,700
Don't be confused. I'm bad.

397
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,912
No, you're good.

398
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,249
You consoled me

399
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,334
and saved our Dahui.

400
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,545
You're good.

401
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,009
Then why are you so suspicious of me?

402
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,136
That's because

403
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,555
you did it.

404
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,224
This again?

405
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,729
But I hope you really didn't do it.

406
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,398
I have to catch you.

407
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,736
But I don't want to.

408
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,994
Just recycle this. You're going to
bug me again tomorrow anyways.

409
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:43,875
He still has this?
To remember me by?

410
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,589
Haeseo River?

411
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,885
-Recycle it.
-Yes.

412
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,679
In front of the kids...

413
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,306
I will get rid of the bloodstains.

414
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,145
Just for today, I'd like to believe you.

415
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
I'll try to.

416
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,035
I knew humans can't be trusted.

417
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:30,046
DEMOLITION

418
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,721
Do you remember I gave you
a can of cola after I killed Bae Jayeong?

419
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,348
-Yes.
-Where did you throw it?

420
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:45,270
I put it in a recycling bin by the road.

421
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,068
I really did.

422
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,737
I recycled it properly.

423
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,280
Your gear keeps getting better.

424
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,283
It's so heavy. I'd like something lighter.

425
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,827
- Ride with us.
- I was going to.

426
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,414
But is there a seat for me?

427
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,501
Right, I have to recycle this.
Wait a second.

428
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,669
All right.

429
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,590
My shot was perfect.

430
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,384
It's true. Justitia, believe me.

431
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,012
I heard you screwed up, you bastard!

432
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,181
Oh, no!

433
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,808
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

434
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,185
I'm sorry.

435
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,728
I'm sorry I'm late.

436
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,563
What on earth is that?

437
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:34,569
If a demon did something wrong,
he must pay the price.

438
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,072
I really recycled it.

439
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,074
With which hand?

440
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,992
What... I really...

441
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,078
As always, it's my fault.

442
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,414
Justitia, I'm sorry.

443
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,503
"Our Father in Heaven,

444
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,588
hallowed be Your name."

445
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,340
"Your kingdom come..."

446
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,093
Stop. And you, get up.

447
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,224
The can you threw away by Haeseo River,
Han Daon picked it up.

448
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,351
Really?

449
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,812
But it can't prove

450
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:11,272
that you killed Bae Jayeong.

451
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,942
That's why he moved in next door.
To secure evidence.

452
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,777
Then what do we do now?

453
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,531
I have to kill sinners
as soon as possible and return to Hell.

454
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,701
You find the witness to the serial murder?

455
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:25,495
He was sent to an orphanage
right after the incident.

456
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,915
I've been visiting orphanages
in the area and checking records.

457
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:31,084
I'll secure their information soon.

458
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,419
That's such a relief.

459
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,635
So Han Daon did have evidence.

460
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,887
Should I teach him a lesson?
I won't kill him.

461
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,890
-I'll just maim him.
-Leave Han Daon alone.

462
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,103
That might complicate things,
so just leave him.

463
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:52,605
Right. Okay.

464
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,901
Mark my words.

465
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,405
-You don't get a second chance.
-Understood.

466
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,752
- Hey.
- Yes?

467
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,420
Isn't she kind of strange today?

468
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,464
She's always strange, so I don't know.

469
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,049
That's not what I mean. Damn it!

470
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,139
Normally, she'd be hopping mad
because of Han Daon.

471
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,058
But she protected him
and told us to leave him alone.

472
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,398
Has she ever cried?

473
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,650
How can a demon cry?

474
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,028
Watch her closely.

475
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,198
If she sheds even a single tear,
report to me.

476
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,282
Why?

477
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,618
Demons who fall in love with humans

478
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,869
are useless.

479
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,496
But I...

480
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,707
must obey Justitia's orders only.

481
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,000
Why you little!

482
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,335
Okay, I got it.

483
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,430
The star of this year's
Young CEO Awards

484
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,183
is Choi Wonjoong, CEO of KO Food.

485
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,192
I believe that our KO Food was

486
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,987
able to make remarkable progress
over the past three years

487
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,950
thanks to the devotion
of all of our KO Food employees.

488
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,037
I will continue to be the kind of CEO
who prioritizes mutual prosperity

489
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,997
between labor and management.

490
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:35,542
Thank you.

491
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:40,797
Let's go!

492
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:42,340
Thank you!

493
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,469
The finance director will report
second-quarter profits this afternoon.

494
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,138
After the lecture at your alma mater
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

495
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:51,599
you have the executive meeting
at 1:00 p.m.

496
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,483
Stop the car right now.

497
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,402
Stop the car now!

498
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,458
Oh, no.

499
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,168
It's all right.

500
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,254
Goodness.

501
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,090
Hey, isn't that the CEO
of KO Food?

502
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,216
It's Choi Wonjoong.

503
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,718
Oh, you're right.

504
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,513
He's amazing.

505
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,190
Goodness.

506
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,234
- He must be taking it to the vet.
- Yeah.

507
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,948
KO FOOD

508
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,533
KO Food

509
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:54,495
must guarantee a safe workplace!

510
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,706
Guarantee it!

511
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,083
Improve the inhumane

512
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,252
working conditions!

513
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,630
Improve them!

514
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,173
2020 CONSUMERS' BRAND OF THE YEAR

515
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:09,636
"The icon of good deeds,
KO Food CEO Choi Wonjoong

516
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,098
is now making headlines by rescuing
an injured abandoned dog."

517
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,644
You've received an award and saved a dog.

518
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,146
Now you just need to
take care of the strike.

519
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,773
Don't worry, Father.

520
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:24,067
I'll take care of it.

521
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,361
It's because you're too nice

522
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,031
that the underlings don't know
their place and speak up.

523
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,617
You have to put your foot down.

524
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,412
Only then will they realize
who feeds them.

525
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,165
Do you understand what I mean?

526
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,793
Yes, Father.

527
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,507
KO Food must guarantee a safe workplace!

528
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,218
Guarantee it!

529
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,678
Improve...

530
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,472
The CEO would like to see you.

531
00:32:57,475 --> 00:33:00,103
He's invited the chairman for lunch.

532
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,273
Just me?

533
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,358
Please come with me.

534
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,869
I hope it goes well.

535
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,038
I think it's a good sign.

536
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,873
I hope it goes smoothly.

537
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,958
That'd be great.

538
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,378
- Let's have hope.
- Go.

539
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,088
Smile a little.

540
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,091
We got this. It'll go well.

541
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,343
It needs to go well.

542
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,194
Sit.

543
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,155
Sit down.

544
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,245
Good, now stay.

545
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,330
Stay!

546
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,419
Gosh, Mr. Won.

547
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:51,172
You see, that dog and I

548
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,841
have the same birth date.

549
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,719
That's why I brought him.

550
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,888
But he won't listen.

551
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,558
So he ended up like that. Let's go.

552
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,050
CEO CHOI WONJOONG

553
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,262
CEO CHOI WONJOONG

554
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,974
You're on strike
because of money.

555
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,059
I've given you money, so you can stop.

556
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,479
We're not on strike because of money.

557
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,065
We've had five workers die in the factory

558
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,985
in the last three years.

559
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,486
What we want

560
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,282
is to work with dignity.

561
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,492
That's all.

562
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:07,248
I can't send it back to you now
because of a transfer limit.

563
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,167
As soon as the banks open tomorrow,

564
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,004
I will return this money to you.

565
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,173
Well, then.

566
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,465
People think...

567
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,261
we conglomerates are special.

568
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,596
But we're not.

569
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,348
We also

570
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,934
lick yogurt off the lids

571
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,561
and enjoy cup noodles.

572
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,524
And when we get mad,
it's hard to suppress our anger.

573
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,734
Mr. Won.

574
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,987
Don't make me mad.

575
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,699
I've always gotten what I wanted.

576
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,287
So my patience is very much

577
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,455
lacking.

578
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,261
I should get going.

579
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,704
LABOR UNION VICE-CHAIRMAN

580
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,294
Are you Chairman Won Changseon?

581
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,297
Yes, but what is this about?

582
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,841
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

583
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,546
Looks delicious.

584
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,723
Mr. Won.

585
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,103
Do you golf?

586
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,898
Nothing brings people together
like a good game of golf.

587
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
But unfortunately, it's night.

588
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,447
So, we'll have to hit a few here.

589
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,698
Please...

590
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,200
let me go.

591
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,496
That's too bad if you don't want to.

592
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,874
Go on.

593
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,011
I said go.

594
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,149
God, you keep getting in my way.
I'm so upset.

595
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,778
Please stop, sir.

596
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,946
Please, stop.

597
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,823
That's what I want to say.

598
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,827
Please stop, Mr. Won!

599
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,423
I want to make a hole-in-one this time.

600
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,675
But where's the hole?

601
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,351
Sir, stop...

602
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,439
You guys will get hurt.

603
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,404
Sir, please... Please...

604
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,323
Sir...

605
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,784
Please, stop.

606
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,169
I'm having a great game.

607
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,045
YANGWOL POLICE

608
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,505
It's my dad.

609
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,632
Ma'am.

610
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,343
An adult man who hasn't come home
for just one day

611
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,053
can't be reported as missing.

612
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:18,017
His phone has been off.
We're just worried...

613
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,603
If he still doesn't come back
in a few days,

614
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:22,104
you can come back then.

615
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,856
But...

616
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,903
SERGEANT CLEANING

617
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,364
EXTERIOR WALLS - MOVE-INS - BUILDINGS
VARIOUS CLEANING - FACILITY REPAIRS

618
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,908
24 HOURS
PRO CLEANERS

619
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,167
Yugyeong, it's been a while.

620
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,544
Right. Hello.

621
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,838
What's wrong?

622
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,173
Did something happen?

623
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,549
My dad...

624
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,551
What do I do?

625
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,721
Yugyeong!

626
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,074
Wow, I think
I can play a game of golf with this.

627
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:18,160
-Don't you think so, Judge Kang?
-Then play a round with it.

628
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,246
Judge Kang.

629
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,957
Your already lacking social skills
are worse today.

630
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:24,583
Did something happen?

631
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,211
Mr. Won,
KO Food Union Chairman,

632
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,214
was kidnapped by unidentified men
and hasn't been seen for five days.

633
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,840
It's been revealed that

634
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,677
right before his kidnapping,
he met with CEO Choi Wonjoong.

635
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,430
Nobong Police continue to track
the missing person and the men

636
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,807
who abducted him.

637
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,101
They plan to bring
Mr. Choi in for questioning.

638
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,521
It seems like
Nobong Police are on every case.

639
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,190
It's like they're the only
police station in Korea.

640
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,527
Nobong's the go-to. The go-to.

641
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,238
I know. How terrible.

642
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,700
I heard the man who came
with the megaphone

643
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,743
is a detective at Nobong Police.

644
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,540
People are saying you two
fell in love in court.

645
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:08,085
Bring me whoever started
that malicious rumor.

646
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,753
I'll rip their lips right off.

647
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,673
Gosh.

648
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,468
CLEANER1

649
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:26,020
Why do I have to find him?

650
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,772
He's known to be a kind man
in the neighborhood.

651
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,816
He works at a bread factory.

652
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:35,904
He buys bread cheap there
and shares it with the residents and us...

653
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,114
Did I eat that bread?

654
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,574
No, but...

655
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,076
If he'd been murdered
after his kidnapping...

656
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:44,038
If he'd been killed,

657
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:48,042
we thought finding the culprit
would be helpful to you, too.

658
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,044
Aren't you looking for murderers?

659
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,505
Why do you think he's dead?
Not all kidnappings end in murder.

660
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,009
His family is really worried.

661
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,302
Please help us.

662
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,723
Fine. Let's say he's dead.

663
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,058
Do you know who did it?

664
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,853
It's him.

665
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,440
CHOI WONJOONG

666
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,821
Why do you think
this weasel is the culprit?

667
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,449
He was the last person
to see him before he was taken.

668
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,746
What's the missing man's name?

669
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,667
It's Mr. Won Changseon.

670
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,100
WON CHANGSEON

671
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,820
He's dead. Satisfied?

672
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,406
I'll help check you out for the donuts.

673
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,991
No need.

674
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,707
How much is it?

675
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,473
Hello? Is this emergency services?

676
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,142
There's someone...

677
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,310
Someone's dead here.

678
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,411
Look over here!
Give us a smile!

679
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,246
Please make way.

680
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:51,623
They say you were the last
to see the deceased.

681
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,000
What did you talk about?

682
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,752
Any words for the family?

683
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,504
Mr. Choi!

684
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,217
Is it true you tried to end the strike
by bribing him?

685
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,927
Were you involved in the death?

686
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,847
I will cooperate fully
with the investigation.

687
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,891
My deepest condolences to his family.

688
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,853
Please say a word for
the union and the bereaved.

689
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:20,694
Why did you send
300 million won to the victim's account?

690
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,363
The deceased threatened Mr. Choi.

691
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,449
It just doesn't make sense

692
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:29,953
that the chairman of the labor union
would threaten the CEO.

693
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:34,124
Mr. Choi is very generous
to the less fortunate.

694
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:37,461
Then why did he hire thugs
to kidnap and assault the victim?

695
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,213
-He never--
-Can you answer yourself?

696
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,882
Detective, you can't do that.

697
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,009
It's all right.

698
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,179
I really know nothing about it.

699
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,725
A tape recorder that the deceased had
has been found.

700
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,229
Near the golf practice range owned by you.

701
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,315
I said go.

702
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:03,403
God, you keep getting
in my way. I'm so upset.

703
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,113
Please, stop.

704
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,657
That's what I want to say.

705
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,452
Do you still not know?

706
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,997
Oh, right.

707
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,999
Oh, that day.

708
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,295
I had dinner with Mr. Won.

709
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,256
And we played golf after.

710
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,757
So...

711
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,845
are you admitting that
you assaulted the deceased?

712
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,263
Detective.

713
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,849
The chairman
of my company's union is dead.

714
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,350
No one is sadder than me.

715
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,353
Are you still going to deny it
despite this evidence?

716
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,273
What evidence?

717
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,316
Right.

718
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,612
The evidence showing
that I accidentally hit him with the ball?

719
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,865
But...

720
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,119
that's not enough
to prove I killed him. Right?

721
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,328
Am I right?

722
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,621
Do you know...

723
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,708
what's most difficult in business?

724
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,628
Competition with other companies?
Securing customers?

725
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:06,633
It's dealing with the have-nots.

726
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,887
Those who have nothing
and so with nothing to lose.

727
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,056
Those who just want
a piece of their masters

728
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:15,893
to feed themselves.

729
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,481
The lowlifes.

730
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,752
This is Kim Soyeong.

731
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:44,838
The chief?

732
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,466
I'll keep it short.

733
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,384
Cover up Choi Wonjoong's case.

734
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,553
We can't do that.

735
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,514
You bastard. Are you the chief here?

736
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,682
Do as you're told.

737
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,060
Even if the chief of police orders it,

738
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,228
I can't do that.

739
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,901
Do you think I'm doing this
because I want to?

740
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,903
The Choi Wonjoong case

741
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:11,031
will be thoroughly investigated
and sent to the prosecution.

742
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,574
Kim Soyeong!

743
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,976
Ignore what the chief said.

744
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,311
We're going ahead with the investigation.

745
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,313
Are you okay?

746
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,357
Why wouldn't I be?

747
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:47,567
Are you okay?

748
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,363
Mocking the less fortunate
and lying outright. It makes me mad.

749
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,951
If only I could punish
Choi Wonjoong myself,

750
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,995
I'd kill him.

751
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,790
The duty of a police officer
is to reveal the crime, not punish.

752
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,376
We investigate according to procedure,

753
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,420
and judges punish with verdicts.

754
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,005
Legally and fairly.

755
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,257
Promise me.

756
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,301
Wherever you are and whatever you do,

757
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,470
don't ever forget that you're a detective.

758
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,391
I'm not a kid. I don't do pinky promises.

759
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,351
You're a kid to me.

760
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,855
Happy?

761
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:26,648
That's enough, it's gross.

762
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:35,699
The matter has gotten
out of hand.

763
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,576
Please help us, Assemblyman.

764
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,457
Please help us.

765
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,336
What dirty scheme
are you plotting here?

766
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,131
Don't tell me you...

767
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,425
No, I didn't do drugs.

768
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:58,013
Just tell him to get up.
The old man will ruin his knees.

769
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,768
Mr. Choi, get up.

770
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,519
I said get up.

771
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,652
I know how much you care for your son.

772
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,113
But the judicial system

773
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,700
is as solid as an iron fortress.

774
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,911
I can't bend it to my will.

775
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:27,417
Our group has some land.

776
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,548
It may be a firm fortress,

777
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,302
but there may be a crack or two somewhere.

778
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:38,970
So you're saying

779
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,349
I'm the crack
in the country's judicial system?

780
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,435
Don't twist my words that way.

781
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,980
Why are you so twisted, Judge Kang?

782
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,816
You're the one who started it.

783
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,150
Anyway,

784
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,862
you take care of it
according to precedents.

785
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,448
Is this a favor or external pressure?

786
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,535
You offer me nothing,
so it can't be a favor.

787
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,454
And it's too non-threatening
to be external pressure.

788
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,289
It's neither.

789
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,709
Were you promised a nice position
somewhere after your retirement?

790
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,213
What do you take me for?

791
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,633
The person who always
assigns me annoying trials...

792
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,260
His underling.

793
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,849
Underling.

794
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,017
Under...

795
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,145
CHIEF JUDGE NA YEONGJIN

796
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,274
Thanks to the recorder the victim took
when he went to see the defendant,

797
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:35,277
the defendant's assault
was caught red-handed.

798
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,906
You work for one of the top law firms
that only hires elites.

799
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:42,993
Aren't you embarrassed
to be representing someone like him?

800
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,163
Don't like it that a judge
is talking to you like this?

801
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,709
No, Your Honor.

802
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,421
Prosecutor, you may question
the defendant.

803
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:57,549
No questions, Your Honor.

804
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:01,428
PROSECUTION

805
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,729
Defendant, why did you hit
the victim with a golf ball?

806
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:13,899
Where did you hide the thugs
who kidnapped the victim?

807
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,193
Your Honor, the defendant is--

808
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,987
I just asked the defendant.

809
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,657
DEFENSE

810
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,246
I didn't intend to hit him.
It was an accident.

811
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:31,625
And they weren't thugs.
They were employees of a security company.

812
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,419
I merely asked them

813
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,714
to safely escort Mr. Won
to the golf course.

814
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,383
Everything from when the victim
visited your home

815
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,970
to when he was brought to
the golf course was recorded.

816
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,014
Do you still intend to deny it?

817
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,851
I feel regretful that the security staff
were rough with Mr. Won.

818
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,020
But I don't know anything about it.

819
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:55,982
And you know nothing
about the victim's suicide?

820
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,276
No.

821
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,073
This is no fun.

822
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,991
That'll be all for today.

823
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:19,673
She's a complete nutjob.

824
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,095
How was the trial?

825
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,848
It's a so-so trial.
How well could it have gone?

826
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,768
Oh, right. Detective Han Daon called.

827
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,436
He wants to meet at the cafe.

828
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,189
Now?

829
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,118
Just get to the point.

830
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,996
You haven't taken my calls since that day.

831
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,455
I was wasted, wasn't I?

832
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,293
- I'm sorry. It won't happen--
- To the point.

833
00:54:58,628 --> 00:54:59,629
Right.

834
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,383
The victim's family

835
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:06,469
believe the victim
would've never taken his own life.

836
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,889
Could you meet with the family
and listen to what they have to say?

837
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,141
I don't have time.

838
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,644
There was external pressure.

839
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:19,733
What are they hiding that they're
pressuring mere detectives?

840
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,401
How would I know that?

841
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,363
Besides, what am I supposed to do
when even the police can't figure it out?

842
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:31,953
You're a demon. And so I thought

843
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:35,373
maybe you could find proof
Choi Wonjoong caused his death.

844
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,420
You suspect me yet pretend
to trust me when you need me.

845
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,423
I envy how easy you live life.

846
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,888
I know it's weird I'm asking.
So I hesitated,

847
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:52,474
but I couldn't think of anyone else.

848
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:57,187
Help me. Please.

849
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,944
Has the victim been cremated?

850
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,740
This won't be easy on you.

851
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,992
The state of the body is quite grisly.

852
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,715
What are you doing?

853
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,552
You want to know
if it was suicide or homicide.

854
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,071
Are you Chairman Won Changseon?

855
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,074
Yes, but what is this about?

856
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,118
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

857
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,329
Nothing brings people together
like a good game of golf.

858
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,415
Please, stop.

859
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,333
That's what I want to say.

860
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:06,381
Please.

861
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,968
I'm having a great game.

862
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,930
Please, let me go...

863
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,324
It was suicide.

864
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,879
Here.

865
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,339
Fine, don't have it.

866
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,093
Well, you leave me no choice then.

867
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,140
Putting the serial murder case

868
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,350
and Choi Wonjoong's case aside,

869
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:02,270
we're going undercover
for an attempted assault case.

870
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,189
And we're hiding it from Daon.

871
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,523
Why aren't you asking why?

872
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:10,069
You see, I only do what you tell me to do.

873
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,656
I think that's how
I can become a detective like you.

874
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,874
Go and buy something, quick.
I'm hungry, too.

875
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,960
Then you really leave me no choice.

876
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,545
I'll be right back.

877
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
Right.

878
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,008
Don't do anything on your own.

879
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,010
Officers always move in pairs.

880
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,637
I know. Go on.

881
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,477
NO TO HWANGCHEON-DONG REDEVELOPMENT!

882
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,038
I'm Detective Kim Soyeong, Nobong Police.

883
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,001
It's dangerous to walk alone here.

884
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,463
You're alone too.

885
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,258
-Let me take you home.
-It's all right.

886
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,262
I can go alone, I'm fine.

887
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:18,721
Yes.

888
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,473
Thank you for your service.

889
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,141
Sure. Get home safely.

890
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,047
The knife he was holding
was quite unusual.

891
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,510
REMARK

892
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,104
The number you've dialed
is unavailable...

893
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:10,231
I miss you too, Princess.

894
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,816
To save the message--

895
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:36,090
Who are you, asshole?

896
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,151
Come here!

897
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,946
Stop right there, you bastard!

898
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,516
Stop!

899
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,396
Don't move! I'll shoot!

900
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,069
It's you.

901
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,739
I've waited for 25 years.

902
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,121
We finally meet.

903
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,215
By the way, what was that earlier?

904
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,051
When I touch a dead body,

905
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,887
I can see what they experienced
right before they died.

906
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,307
So you used that power
to kill the murderers?

907
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,021
I've never done that.

908
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:16,149
But even if I wanted to,

909
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,484
I wouldn't have had the chance to use it.

910
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:22,655
Because they cremate the body
a few days after the autopsy.

911
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,992
So what did you see?

912
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,827
Why are you sure it was suicide?

913
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,538
I did what you wanted. What's the problem?

914
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:34,375
Just stop. Don't talk to me.

915
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,088
Wait. That's Donghun.

916
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:44,510
Donghun.

917
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,264
Wow, look who it is.

918
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,767
It's been a while. How have you been?

919
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,436
Not well because of someone.

920
01:02:56,272 --> 01:02:58,191
-But what are you doing here?
-What?

921
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,818
What do you mean?
I'm undercover with Detective Kim...

922
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:01,903
Undercover?

923
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,070
Well, we...

924
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,158
Where is she?

925
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,333
Damn it!

926
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:26,344
Detective Kim!

927
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,432
Detective Kim!

928
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,017
Detective Kim!

929
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,027
Detective Kim!

930
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:50,970

935
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,201
The blood found on the scene
is presumed to be Detective Kim's.

936
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:18,205
The only survivor of serial killer J,
I found him.

937
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:19,624
Is Han Daon?

938
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:22,376
For believing in me
and telling me it wasn't my fault,

939
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,544
thank you.

940
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,213
Why are you forgiving him as you please?

941
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:29,842
Why not?
I've always made my judgements that way.

942
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:32,929
-Let me out!
-Asking the victim for forgiveness?

943
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,430
No, the Lord.

944
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,515
If you move, you'll get hurt.

945
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,270
You really came.

946
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:43,022
Start it.

947
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,651
"Execute killers
unforgiven by their victims

948
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:49,904
and unrepentant of their sins
and send them to Hell."

949
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:51,447
That's what God wants.

950
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,743
Detective Han Daon.
Don't chase me. Help me.

951
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,996
Then I will find him

952
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,958
and make him pay in your place

953
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,793
because the law can't.

954
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:05,878
It will be more horrible

955
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,296
and violent.
