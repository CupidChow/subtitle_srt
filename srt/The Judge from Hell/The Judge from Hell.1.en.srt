00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:29,875
Ah.

183
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,627
So what happened to him?

184
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,380
We went to court,
but he got off with a small fine.

185
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:39,134
Hmm. And he sued you after the trial?

186
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,637
Yes. He's arguing that
when I kicked the knife,

187
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,723
I hit his hand and hurt it.

188
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,350
[prosecutor] It's the truth,
not an argument.

189
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,936
Please refer to the diagnosis submitted.

190
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:53,565
Ah. You mean a two-week recovery prognosis
they hand out like candy?

191
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,400
[spectators whispering indistinctly]

192
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:06,245
Why aren't the results
of a full medical exam included?

193
00:13:06,328 --> 00:13:08,080
I'd like to see how badly he's hurt.

194
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:11,625
The victim is currently unable to
eat properly because of his injury.

195
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,921
He should have just starved to death.
Why sue?

196
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,006
[spectators gasping,
whispering indistinctly]

197
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,009
[prosecutor] Your Honor,
you've gone too far.

198
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:23,720
You're the one who's gone too far.

199
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,598
The police can't just stand there.

200
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:29,476
He came at him with a knife.
What was he supposed to do?

201
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,187
Say, "Please, sir, give me the knife"?

202
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,691
Or should he have gotten stabbed
and buried with honors?

203
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,817
[spectators gasping, whispering excitedly]

204
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:41,029
[prosecutor] An arrest could've been made
easily without excessive use of force.

205
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:45,367
If that's excessive use of force,
this is excessive indictment.

206
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,744
Why bring such a small matter to court

207
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,997
and make me busier? This is so annoying.

208
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,584
[prosecutor] Your Honor, we are in court.
Let's show some respect.

209
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,420
[muttering] Is this church
or something? Respect?

210
00:13:57,004 --> 00:14:00,215
His mother is the president of PTL Group.

211
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:03,844
And the prosecutor's father-in-law
went to school with her.

212
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,220
[spectators gasping]

213
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,597
PROSECUTION

214
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,350
Now, am I the one
disrespecting the law in court?

215
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:12,269
Or is it you, Prosecutor?

216
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:18,942
I'll be late.

217
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,278
Defendant. Your final statement. Hurry.

218
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,156
[Daon clears throat]

219
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,870
Every night, before I go to bed,
I regret that day.

220
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,707
If I'd known I would be tried,
I'd have done it differently.

221
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,753
I would've kicked his hand
pretending to aim for the knife.

222
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,214
And when I cuffed him,

223
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:43,425
I should have twisted his arm harder.
That's what I regret.

224
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:45,844
[spectators whispering indistinctly]

225
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,596
You're not remorseful?

226
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,725
There's no need to be.
I didn't do anything wrong.

227
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,021
[chuckles dryly]

228
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,568
I have made my decision.

229
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,321
[teacher] Everyone,
this is the Goddess of Justice.

230
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:08,492
[child 1] But why are her eyes covered?

231
00:15:09,076 --> 00:15:11,245
Her eyes are covered because...

232
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:13,997
Should we ask the judge?

233
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,624
[children shouting] Yes!

234
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,919
Excuse me, Judge?
May we have a moment of your time?

235
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,255
-I'm not a judge.
-[child 2] Liar!

236
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,006
You're wearing a judge's robe!

237
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,427
[children clamoring]
Liar! A judge is lying!

238
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,513
It's true. I'm not a judge.

239
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,265
[both] Then what are you?

240
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,517
Detective Kim. I was acquitted.

241
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,019
-Not guilty.
-[Judge Kang] Don't get scared and cry.

242
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,312
I'm actually...

243
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:39,398
a demon.
[dramatically] A terrifying demon!

244
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:41,942
[children laughing]

245
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,114
-[Daon] I'll explain more when I get back.
-[Judge Kang] I really am a demon.

246
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:50,325
[child 2] Stop lying.
No demon's that pretty.

247
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,702
-What?
-[child 3] Yeah!

248
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,912
[child 4] Demons have horns. [roars]

249
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:57,040
And they look scary, but you're pretty.

250
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,334
[laughs] Seriously.

251
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,628
Am I that pretty?

252
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,756
[children] Yes! You're very pretty!

253
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,260
Gosh! Children can't be fooled.

254
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:10,596
What's the question?

255
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:14,433
Why are her eyes covered?

256
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,435
[Judge Kang] What a great question.

257
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:19,229
She's playing hide-and-seek
with a bad guy.

258
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:22,900
[child 2] Why does she need a knife
to play hide-and-seek?

259
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,735
So she can cut them up...

260
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:30,574
[child 5] To teach them a lesson.

261
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:33,285
-[child 6] To teach them a lesson.
-To teach them a lesson.

262
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,830
But that's too long.
Smaller, mobile ones are used these days.

263
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,540
[teacher] Ma'am, your hand...

264
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,378
Then what's that? Why's she holding that?

265
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,172
That's a scale.

266
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:48,217
It's used to measure
how bad the sinner's deeds were.

267
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,261
Ma'am! What's her name?

268
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,601
Justitia. Known as the Goddess of Justice.

269
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,561
Though she's not really.

270
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,064
But what's justice?

271
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,857
It's simple.

272
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,402
Good people live happy lives
and bad people are punished.

273
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:08,904
That's justice.

274
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:11,490
Then why do bad people live better?

275
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:13,909
Because there's no justice in this world.

276
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,455
Do you want to repeat after me?

277
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,457
[children] Yes!

278
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,001
-Justice...
-[children] Justice...

279
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,712
-...is dead!
-[children] ...is dead!

280
00:17:25,796 --> 00:17:27,714
-Justice...
-[children] Justice...

281
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,342
-Who needs it?
-[children] Who needs it?

282
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,427
One more time. Justice...

283
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:33,512
[children] Justice...

284
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,597
-...is dead!
-[children] ...is dead!

285
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:37,599
-Justice...
-[children] Justice...

286
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:40,143
-Who needs it?
-[children] Who needs it?

287
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:41,812
Good job!

288
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,355
[children clapping]

289
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:44,773
Oh, no. I'm late.

290
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:45,858
Bye!

291
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,359
Wait! Judge Kang!

292
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,072
I'm glad I ran into you. Your name is...

293
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,533
What was it? It reminded me of softener.

294
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,077
Han Daon. I have something to ask you.

295
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,539
Fifth floor, 18th Criminal Division.

296
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,875
You can get a temporary pass and go up.

297
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,293
What? Why are you--

298
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,795
When you get there,
you'll see a chubby man.

299
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,798
-Give it to him.
-What...

300
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,177
Wait. Judge Kang.

301
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,512
What? You don't think you can find it?

302
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:18,223
No, I'm curious why you acquitted me.

303
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:21,727
Not happy with it?
Shall I hand you a death sentence?

304
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,856
I was moved because you
sympathized with my frustration.

305
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,233
You got me totally wrong.

306
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:30,485
Pardon?

307
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:34,114
I'm not interested in the stories
of the wronged. Nor do I sympathize.

308
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,119
Do you know
why I like being a criminal court judge?

309
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:41,663
Because I can meet a lot of bad guys.

310
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,083
Those who deserve to go to Hell.

311
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,128
So no need to thank me.

312
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,547
I'm just disgusted by brazen criminals

313
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,300
who don't repent for their crimes.

314
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,968
Either way,

315
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,554
you did come to a ruling based on the law.

316

If you ever need help, call me.

317
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:03,352
I make sure to give back
what I've been given.

318
00:19:03,435 --> 00:19:06,563
I'm just too perfect
to need anyone's help.

319
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,815
Still, you never know.

[Wongyeong] Killing is hard?

328
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,137
Killing what?

329

[stuttering] Nothing. It's nothing.

-I'm just tired--
-Yes, this is the 18th Criminal Division.

331

Has our judge's trial ended?

332
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,523
[muttering] Why ask
if you're not going to listen?

333
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:52,025
Really? Then where is she?

Hello.

Can I help you?

The chubby guy.

339
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:06,790
Right.

340
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:08,750
The judge asked me to deliver this.

341
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,795
Why did she give these important things
to a stranger?

342
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,299
-Either way, thank you.
-Where is Judge Kang?

343
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:19,303
I don't know. She left in a hurry.

344
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,139
Gosh. When will she grow up?

God listens to all your prayers

354

Who are you?

356
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:19,488
Nice to meet you. I'm judge Kang Bitna.
I'll be taking your case.

357
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:22,032
How did you know I was here?

358
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,244
Did you have someone watch me?

359
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:28,205
No. I'm just interested.

360
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,458
Interested in the truth
of the case as a judge.

361
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:39,174
I already told the police everything
and submitted a non-punishment letter.

362
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,845
I just find
the non-punishment letter strange.

363
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:46,515
He hit you and threatened to kill you.

364
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,058
How can you forgive him?

365
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,479
[groans, screams]

366
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,231

[moans]

368
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:03,824
You're lying about

369
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:05,868
forgiving him, aren't you?

370
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,035
[sniffs]

371
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,745
I'm not lying.

372
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,748
I want him to be released
from the lock-up soon.

373
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,671
[♪ enchanting music playing]

374
00:22:19,214 --> 00:22:21,592
[voice echoing] Don't be like that.
Be honest with me.

375
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,304
Only then can I make the right ruling.

376
00:22:31,435 --> 00:22:32,436
[music stops]

377
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:34,938
I have nothing more to say.

378
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,316
[in normal voice] No, wait!

379
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,320
[sighs] Really?

380
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,156
[Judge Kang] Ms. Cha Minjeong?

381
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,827
[screaming] Ms. Cha!

382
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,538
Ms. Cha, let's talk.

383
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,541
Stop following me.

384
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,336
Tomorrow is the first trial.

385
00:22:58,003 --> 00:23:01,882
If you keep doing this, I have
to accept the non-punishment letter.

386
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,342
Then do it.

387
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:06,345
That's why I submitted it.
Why are you doing this?

388
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,805
I'm a judge.

389
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,768
A judge must consider
even the smallest truth to make a ruling.

390
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,691
Tell me. I'm all ears.

391
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:26,114
No. You may be a judge,
but you have no right to do this.

392
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,160
[officer] Are you all right?

393
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:31,245
[Minjeong] Excuse me.

394
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,121
She keeps following me.

395
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,916
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

396
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,084
[chuckles]

397
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,752
There's been a misunderstanding.

398
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:40,712
I'm a judge.

399
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,800
Can you show us your government ID?

400
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:46,760
Here...

401
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:52,057
Well, I don't have it now.

402
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,017
Take my personal ID for now.

403
00:23:58,856 --> 00:23:59,982
Ms. Cha...

404
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,692

408

Stop! You're grossing me out!

409
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,469
You punk.

410
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:32,055
My son made it back
from the gates of Hell.

411
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,683
Can't a mother hug her son?

412
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,143
That really hurts.

413
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,604
I hit you so it hurts.

414
00:24:39,688 --> 00:24:41,231
Be more careful next time.

415
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:45,110
Do your best to catch criminals,
but don't give up your life for it.

416
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,447
You, too.

417
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,115
-Don't worry about me, punk!
-[Daon chuckles]

418
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,201
So,

419
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:55,996
who's the savior who acquitted you?

420
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:59,583
-Well...
-[Soyeong] Detective Kim!

421
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,128
Cha Minjeong called the police.

422
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,671
Someone kept following her.

423
00:25:04,755 --> 00:25:07,508
Moon Jeongjun's in jail. So who is it?

424
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:11,845
-[Eunseop] They're headed here now.
-She seemed a bit not right in the head.

425
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,723
[Judge Kang] I said I'm going. I'm going!

426
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:16,642
Judge Kang?

427
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,061
Hey.

428
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,148
Nobong Police Station, Violent Crime
Investigation Team 2, Han Daon?

429
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:29,655
[Daon] Kang Bitna, age 35, judge, right?

430
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:32,407
I thought we were closer than this.

431
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,826
Weren't we?

432
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,334
[clears throat]
It's not what you're thinking.

433
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,964
Why did you follow Cha Minjeong?

434
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,507
I wanted to ask her something.

435
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,718
What's that?

436
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:55,055
About the truth she's hiding.
And what she really feels.

437
00:25:56,807 --> 00:26:00,644
Why do you care what Ms. Cha is hiding?

438
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:04,648
I thought you were
the lead detective on her case.

439
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:08,110
I'm the judge in charge of her trial.

440
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:11,822
So you're doubtful
of the non-punishment letter?

441
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:14,867
For a fair trial,
I need the truth, not lies.

442
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,660
And uncovering the truth

443
00:26:16,743 --> 00:26:19,121
and punishing the bad guys properly

444
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:21,290
is the judge's job.

445
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:32,384
I haven't shown this to anyone else.

446
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,804
Don't look at me like that.

447
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,806
I was misdiagnosed by a quack.

448
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,018
I saw it was from
the most famous hospital in the country.

449
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:44,354
So, Defendant, I mean...

450
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:46,899
Detective. What do you think?

451
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:51,028
I saw you telling a group of kids
that you're a demon.

452
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:55,073
You're saying I need treatment
for my diagnosis?

453
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:57,868
I don't know if demons exist.

454
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,953
But I'm certain there's no God.

455
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:04,499
If there was,
the world wouldn't be in this state.

456
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,792
[chuckles]

457
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,003
You've got it seriously wrong.

458
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:11,006
It's not God or Satan
who's made such a mess here.

459
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:12,591
It's humans.

460
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:16,345
The very humans you arrest and I judge.

461
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:18,222
I think you're right.

462
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:19,848
You haven't answered me yet.

463
00:27:20,891 --> 00:27:24,478
Do you also think
I'm someone who needs treatment?

464
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,941
I don't care
whether you're a demon or not.

465
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:33,570
I think you're impeccable as a judge.

466

[chuckles]

467
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,407
Then trust your own judgement.

468
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,618
That's the answer.

469
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,162
Tomorrow's trial...

470
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:45,499

Prosecutor?

474
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:18,782
Defendant Moon Jeongjun has assaulted
his then girlfriend on three occasions

475
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:22,619
from October 2023 to December 2023.

476
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:25,539
When the victim asked
that they stop seeing each other,

477
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,291
he confined and threatened her.

478
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,503
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

479
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:33,589
We admit the assault.

480
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:36,049
But there was no threat.

481
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:39,595
This can be confirmed through
the victim's non-punishment letter.

482
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:43,432
The victim lied
because she feared retaliation.

483
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,643
[defendant] Your Honor, this is
the prosecution's one-sided speculation.

484
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,520
Agreed. Please strike from the record.

485
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:53,442
We submitted photos taken by the victim
immediately after the assault as evidence.

We were fighting, and before I knew it...

because of it.

Before I knew it, my hand was--

00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:45,160
Why do you keep saying,
"Before I knew it"?

497
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:48,121
Are you saying you had no control?

00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:57,589
do you admit to assaulting the victim
on three occasions and threatening her?

501
00:29:57,673 --> 00:29:59,508
I did hit her.

502

But I didn't threaten her.

Saying "then let's die together"
when she asked to break up

504
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:06,098
is not a threat?

505
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:11,353
Literally, I thought I'd rather die
than break up with Minjeong.

506
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:15,023
Because I love her so much.

507
00:30:15,107 --> 00:30:18,402
It wasn't a threat
but a plea for her to stay.

You want her to die because of you, right?

No.

520
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:57,983
If it's that difficult for Minjeong,

521
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,154
I will never go near her again.

522
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:03,822

No, never mind.

00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,236
I will see you on your sentencing day.

533
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:46,532
[spectators whispering indistinctly]

534
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,702
Don't worry. It'll be all right.

535
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,466
[Jeongjun] I have something to say.

536
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,469
Don't. We don't want to hear it.

537
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:16,979
I'm really sorry.

538
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,028
How is Minjeong?

539
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,613
[♪ intense music playing]

540
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:39,209
[mocking Jeongjun]
"I know I won't see her again,

541
00:32:39,293 --> 00:32:41,837
but I want to say
that I really loved Minjeong."

542
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,964
Barf.

543
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,299
JUDGE KANG BITNA

544
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:47,843
So, what will you decide?

545
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:50,846
One year for arguing
that it's love, after beating her.

546
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:53,724
One year for crying.
So, two years in total.

547
00:32:53,807 --> 00:32:56,393
Hmm. Can you do that?
The prosecutor requested one year.

548
00:32:57,019 --> 00:32:59,229
-It's up to me.
-Yes, you're right.

549
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:03,692
[clears throat] I guess a judge
can do as they please.

550
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:05,652
Recycle it.

551
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:07,279
Yes, I will.

552
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:12,242
Anyway, this case just won't work.

553
00:33:13,035 --> 00:33:14,536
It's not that.

554
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,955
I'm sure he's acting, so he's suspicious,

555
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,999
but I don't know what he's plotting.

556
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,835
I won't finish in a year at this rate!

557
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:27,341
You know, killing a human by trial
isn't the only way to go about it.

558
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:29,635
You think I haven't thought of other ways?

559
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:32,012
-Don't you know this is the best way?
-Look.

560
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:37,100
First, find a sinner to send to Gehenna
among humans on trial.

561
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,312
Second, give them a sentence
much too low for the crime at hand

562
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,939
and release them from prison.

563
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:43,982
Third, kill them.

564
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,151
This plan is too complicated and perverse.

565
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,487
Get out. I'm busy.

566
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,697
What about this?

567
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:51,782
A serial killer.

568
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:55,702
If you send to Hell one criminal
who's killed five people,

569
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:58,372
it'll be counted as five.

570
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:02,668
So if you kill just one serial killer
who's murdered ten, it's over.

571
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:07,130
Is there even a serial killer
with ten victims that hasn't been caught?

572
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:10,384
Probably not.
Since there are so many CCTV cameras.

573
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,427
[Mando exclaims]

574
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,223
[phone ringing]

575
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,060
Yes, this is Kang Bitna.

576
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:22,396
-[Daon] It's Han Daon.
-And?

577
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:26,191
I have something urgent to tell you
about Moon Jeongjun.

578
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:32,364
I clearly saw Moon Jeongjun
mocking Ms. Cha's parents myself.

579
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:35,409
If he's released,
he will commit another crime.

580
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,244
Do you really think so?

581
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,455
That if Moon Jeongjun is released,
he'll find the victim and--

582
00:34:40,539 --> 00:34:42,916
We don't know what he might do then.

583
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,919
-Worst case--
-He might kill her.

584
00:34:47,087 --> 00:34:48,088
The defendant.

585
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:54,178
I'd like you to sentence Moon
with the maximum penalty allowed by law.

586
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:57,347
You do know
you're overstepping here, right?

587
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,473
Yes.

588
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,684
Yet you still came to see me. Why?

589
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,227
You said that

590
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:07,149
it's the judge's job to uncover the truth
and punish the bad guys properly.

591
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:09,860
I just wanted to tell you
there's something else

592
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:12,029
that wasn't revealed in court.

593
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:15,490
[sighs]

594
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,076
Let me speak with Cha Minjeong's parents.

595
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,536
Alone, without you.

596
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,289
I want to hear it for myself as the judge.

597
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:26,293
The victim and her family's true story.

598
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,421
[slurping loudly]

599
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:33,884
Ah.

600
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,970
Excuse me. Another cola, please.

601
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:38,263
[woman] Of course.

602
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,308
-Our meeting today must remain a secret.
-Yes.

603
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:43,101
Tell me about Moon Jeongjun.

604
00:35:43,185 --> 00:35:45,604
I heard he mocked you after the trial.

605
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:48,649
He apologized to us, and then...

606
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,068
asked after Minjeong.

607
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:53,153
It was terrifying.

608
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:56,281
[Mr. Cha] His demeanor
was completely different in front of you.

609
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:59,284
What about the non-punishment letter
submitted by Ms. Cha?

610
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:01,161
[sobbing] She was afraid.

611
00:36:02,913 --> 00:36:05,040
[Minjeong] It won't make a difference.

612
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:09,127
He won't stay locked up long.
He'll be right out.

613
00:36:09,711 --> 00:36:11,755
[voice quivering]
So why did you report him?

614
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,049
You shouldn't have.

615
00:36:14,174 --> 00:36:15,384
[crying]

616
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,641
That was the last time.

617
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:25,561
She won't even answer our calls now.

618
00:36:25,644 --> 00:36:27,688
[Mr. Cha] Even if he receives
a maximum sentence,

619
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,940
I heard he won't stay in long.

620
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:33,402
Then what will happen to our Minjeong?

621
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:37,447
She'll have to live
in fear of him forever.

622
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:42,035
So you're sure Moon Jeongjun
will come after Ms. Cha?

623
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,621
Yes, I'm sure.

624
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:53,088
[crying] Ma'am, please save our daughter.

625
00:36:53,172 --> 00:36:56,341
You're the only one who can.

626
00:36:57,009 --> 00:36:58,010
[sniffs]

627
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,345
Excuse me.

628
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:15,068
This is it, now!

629
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:19,281
I'm so sorry for upsetting you...

630
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,867
No, it's fine.

631
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,243
I didn't want to cry,

632
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,747
but it was so heartbreaking
that I couldn't help it.

633
00:37:26,914 --> 00:37:28,540
[sobs] I shouldn't be like this.

634
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:30,876
Stop flowing, tears!

635
00:37:30,959 --> 00:37:34,338
[crying] Thank you so much.

636
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,715
For listening to our side of the story

637
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:38,342
and crying with us.

638
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:40,802
I'm even more grateful.

639
00:37:42,012 --> 00:37:44,431
How dare he toy
with the judge's conscience?

640
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:47,726
I'll make sure he gets what he deserves.

641
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,979
Thank you. Thank you so much.

642
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:56,902
Then, would you mind telling me

643
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:01,031
what happened between
Moon Jeongjun and Ms. Cha?

644
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,741
All of it.

645
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,754
Hey, Eunseop.

646
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,258
Don't you know there's
a hierarchy when it comes to hot coffee?

647
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:21,093
No, I've never heard of that.

648
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:24,346
[sighs]

649
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,430
[phone vibrating]

650
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:28,559
Yes, this is Han Daon.

651
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:31,395
You were together for five hours?

652
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,022
Judge Kang cried?

653
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:38,986
Because she was so heartbroken?

654
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:49,162
-Judge Kang.
-Hello, Chief.

655
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:52,207
If you apologize now, I'll forgive you.

656
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,669
-What?
-You humiliated the prosecution in court.

657
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,629
Oh, that?

658
00:38:57,713 --> 00:39:00,883
They wanted to make this an issue,
and I barely stopped them.

659
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,510
Then why do something humiliating
in the first place?

660
00:39:04,887 --> 00:39:07,014
I heard you told
a bunch of kindergarteners

661
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:10,184
that there was no justice.
[whispering] That you shouted it!

662
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:11,560
Should a judge say that?

663
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:13,478
But it's true there is no justice.

664
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,401
Judge Kang, if a judge wears
that much makeup,

665
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,612
what would people think?

666
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:23,488
That I'm pretty?

667
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,451
What do you think? I'm pretty, right?

668
00:39:27,534 --> 00:39:28,660
Yes.

669
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:31,205
This look, way of speaking, and demeanor,

670
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:34,374
it's not like you at all.

671
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:37,336
I won't ask what I'm like. It's tedious.

672
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,712
And I don't really care.

673
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,716
-What?
-I'm kind of busy and should get going.

674
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:47,554
If it weren't for Assemblyman Jeong...

675
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:50,265
How can someone change that much?

676
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:53,227
It was a traumatic accident.

677
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:59,149
Unsolved serial murders...

678
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:01,193
SERIAL MURDERS IN THE UK...

679
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:04,029
Shouldn't you get off work?

680
00:40:04,112 --> 00:40:06,031
Order in spicy tofu soup.
I'm working late.

[sighs]

683
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:12,663
What is it?
Seeing her smile makes me uneasy.

684
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:16,333
AGGRAVATED ASSAULT...

685
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:20,420
[knocking on door]

686
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,423
Did something good happen?

687
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:25,342
I finally got someone.

688
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,595
His name is Moon Jeongjun.

689
00:40:29,054 --> 00:40:30,055
Didn't you let that one go?

690
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:35,310
[Judge Kang whispering indistinctly]

691
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:40,107
But that's a bit too brutal for humans.

692
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,025
Who cares? You're not human.

693
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:44,528
And we can't be worrying
about others right now.

694
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,905
Don't you remember
what that spider did to me?

695
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,993
[Mando imitating Bael]
If you don't complete it,

696
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,120
you will die.

697
00:40:53,912 --> 00:40:55,289
Do you want to die?

698
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,294
Get some omelets, too. With cheese.

699
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:01,920
Yes, ma'am.

700
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,468
[♪ music playing]

701
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:19,271
[bailiff] Please take your seats.

702
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:30,157
[Judge Kang] Case number 2024GoDan175.

703
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,951
I'll pronounce the verdict
on the defendant.

704
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:37,748
Moon Jeongjun
was in a relationship with the victim

705
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,334
during which
he continuously assaulted her.

706
00:41:40,417 --> 00:41:42,544
The victim wanted to end the relationship,

707
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:46,006
but the defendant only assaulted
the victim in a more brutal way.

708
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,467
The defendant treated the victim
as his property

709
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,012
rather than an independent person,
which is a serious criminal offense.

710
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:55,849
Therefore, the defendant shall not
avoid severe punishment.

711
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,355
However, that the victim
appealed for leniency

712
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:04,900
and the defendant
promised to right his wrongs

713
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,401
shall be considered.

714
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:09,738
Also, the defendant
is deeply regretful of his actions

715
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:11,949
and is a first-time offender.

716
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:14,993
Depriving the young defendant of a chance

717
00:42:15,077 --> 00:42:17,538
to live
as a contributing member of society

718
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:20,332
would be cruel.

719
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:21,458
[spectators gasping,
murmuring indistinctly]

720
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:25,379
Thus, the court's ruling is as follows.

721
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,508
The defendant, Moon Jeongjun,
is hereby ordered...

722
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:35,639
-to pay a fine of three million won.
-[spectators erupt in protest]

723
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,558
-[spectator 1] What?
-[spectator 2] That's ridiculous.

724
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:42,229
[spectator 3 shouting]
What? A fine? That's absurd.

725
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:47,317
What? That's...

726
00:42:51,405 --> 00:42:52,406
[indistinct chatter continues]

727
00:42:53,448 --> 00:42:55,993
[Jeongjun] Thank you,
Your Honor. Thank you.

728
00:42:59,538 --> 00:43:00,539
Thank you!

729
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:22,436
Honey.

730
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:25,439
This doesn't make sense.

731
00:43:26,064 --> 00:43:28,859
What about our Minjeong?
[sobbing] Oh, no.

732
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:35,824
[Daon] Judge Kang. Judge Kang Bitna!

733
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,077
I know what you're going to say. Don't.

734
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:40,913
I only ruled according to the law.

735
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,748
That was according to the law?

736
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:45,292
Who is this law for anyways?

737
00:43:45,375 --> 00:43:47,294
The victim already forgave the assailant.

738
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:49,463
What more should the law have done?

739
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:52,090
You know it's because
she feared he'd retaliate.

740
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:55,802
Shouldn't the judge take
the victim's feelings into consideration?

741
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:59,806
A judge isn't a psychological counselor
or a mind reader.

742
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,559
Didn't you sympathize
with their pain and grief?

743
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:06,021
So you lied when you said
he'd get what he deserved?

744
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,191
You're adorable.

745
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:12,444
Like a little puppy barking at the law
which should be feared.

746
00:44:12,528 --> 00:44:15,405
-What?
-I didn't sympathize with them.

747
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:18,033
Nor did I feel any compassion
for the victim.

748
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:20,494
I think I might have teared up
because I yawned.

749
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:24,665
But I wasn't lying
when I said he'd get what he deserved.

750
00:44:24,748 --> 00:44:27,501
And a mere fine is what he deserved?

751
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,127
Think what you like.

752
00:44:29,545 --> 00:44:30,546
Ah...

753
00:44:30,671 --> 00:44:32,631
I'll walk you another time.

754
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:34,675
I'm going to be busy for a while.

755
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:47,563

SEOUL CENTRAL DETENTION CENTER

757
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,702
Why are you here, Detective?

758
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:06,999
[Jeongjun chuckles]

759
00:45:14,173 --> 00:45:16,175
Go on. Eat up.

760
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,262
[Jeongjun] What did you say?

761
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:22,598
I got you locked up in here.

762
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,684
Yet you're free with only a mere fine.
It feels...

763
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,644
pretty crappy.

764
00:45:27,811 --> 00:45:28,812
[Jeongjun sighs]

765
00:45:30,772 --> 00:45:34,359
Don't come anywhere near Cha Minjeong.

766
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,570
Lie low and don't make a peep.

767
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:38,280
Are you threatening me?

768
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,366
No, just some advice for you.

769
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:46,079
A warning that the law
won't forgive you twice.

770
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,831
[chuckles]

771
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,124
Hey.

772
00:45:51,877 --> 00:45:53,295
When I get angry,

773
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,591
there's no telling what I might do.

774
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:00,886
Be good.

775
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:03,597
-Okay.
-Good.

776
00:46:05,307 --> 00:46:06,683
Clean this up.

777
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:14,107

[car engine starts]

780
00:46:34,753 --> 00:46:37,214
[Mrs. Cha] Minjeong,
it's Mom. Open the door.

781
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,298
[Minjeong] Go away.

782
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:42,719
Minjeong, you can't stay here.

783
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:44,930
Come with Mom and Dad, okay?

784
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:47,766
[Minjeong] Stop calling
or coming to see me.

785
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:50,477
[crying] Go! Just leave!

786
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:54,731
[Mrs. Cha crying] Minjeong, please.

787
00:46:56,608 --> 00:46:59,486
[Mr. Cha] Minjeong, we'll do as you say.

788
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,408
But if you want to come home,
call me anytime, okay?

789
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,909
I'm come get you right away.

790
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:10,706
We stopped by that bakery you like
and picked up some bread.

791
00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:12,207
Make sure you eat.

792
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:16,044
But don't eat too fast.
You'll get indigestion.

793
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,047
Have it with some milk, too.

794
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:35,397
Ms. Cha. Don't worry too much.

795
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,650
I'm leaving a smart watch by your door.

796
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:41,778
If you press the SOS button,
we'll come right away.

797

799
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:35,499
EVEN IF THE HEAVENS FALL,
THERE WILL BE JUSTICE ON EARTH

[♪ rock music playing]

801
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:16,915
THE SAME PLACE CAN BE HEAVEN OR HELL

802
00:49:16,999 --> 00:49:18,876
Yes, all right.

803
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,461
Gosh, it's already lunchtime.

804
00:49:21,545 --> 00:49:23,839
I'm going to go check up on Cha Minjeong.

805
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:28,177
[Eunseop] But should it be the detective's
job to guard a victim's home

806
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,386
day and night?

807
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:32,306
I'm not guarding the victim's home.
I'm protecting them.

808
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,058
Eunseop has a point.

809
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:37,603
We've done everything we can do.

810
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,814
We've requested protective custody
and increased patrols in the area.

811
00:49:40,898 --> 00:49:42,900
And Moon Jeongjun's
been quiet for two weeks.

812
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,401
That's what makes me nervous.

813
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,487
Look, aren't you going to
work on other cases?

814
00:49:47,571 --> 00:49:50,741
He's not human.
We don't know what he might do or when.

815
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,326
You're right.

816
00:49:52,409 --> 00:49:55,412
But how long are you
going to keep this up?

817
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,456
Gosh, what a headache.

818
00:49:58,165 --> 00:49:59,917
-Daon.
-Yes?

819
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,504
Starting today, only check in
on Ms. Cha once in the evening.

820
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:04,630
But...

821
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:07,299
If this could be stopped by one officer,

822
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,218
I'd ask you to stay there forever.

823
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:11,845
But you know what the reality is.

824
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:14,890
While you're there,
another incident will occur elsewhere.

825
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,767
And there will be another victim.

826
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,061
I know how you feel.

827
00:50:19,853 --> 00:50:21,855
Because I feel the same.

828
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:03,438
[ringing tone]

829
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,442
Dad, it's me.

830
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:09,695
[Mr. Cha] Minjeong. What is it?

831
00:51:10,237 --> 00:51:12,948
Can you come get me?

832
00:51:17,452 --> 00:51:19,663
[Judge Kang] This is driving me crazy.

833
00:51:21,623 --> 00:51:22,666
Damn it.

834
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,251
Why is he so quiet?

835
00:51:25,168 --> 00:51:26,169
Me?

836
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,381
Not you. Moon Jeongjun.

837
00:51:29,464 --> 00:51:30,465
Right.

838
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:33,760
Maybe he's really remorseful.

839
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,056
Or if you do that thing,

840
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,267
you can know what he's doing.

841
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,685
That thing?

Are you going home?

00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,289
No, I'm just starting work.

847
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:49,169
I'm going home.

848
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:52,673
For recycling.

Is it you, Dad?

00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:22,828
Who is it?

852
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,205
[man] It's the police. Is everything okay?

853
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:28,834
Yes.

854
00:53:28,917 --> 00:53:30,252
But what brings you by?

855
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:32,921
Detective Han asked me
to bring you something.

856
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,097
Can you just leave it by the door?

857
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:43,390
[man] Okay.

858
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:03,076

-[Minjeong yelping, groaning]

give you this?

didn't I?
