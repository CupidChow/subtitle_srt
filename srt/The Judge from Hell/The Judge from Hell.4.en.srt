1
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:30,947
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,867
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,377
Damn it. There's water in my ears.

5
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,589
Dad!

6
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,549
My dad's not out yet.

7
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,342
Please save him!

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:54,179
You have to do as I say, okay?

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,264
If you don't listen to me,

10
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,266
I will kill her.

11
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,101
You murderer!

12
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,732
RED GINSENG

13
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:06,858
He's dead.

14
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,780
EPISODE 4

15
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,370
Where's Jiho?

16
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,958
He's safe at home.

17
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,297
Lying makes you a bad adult.

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,258
And bad adults

19
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,095
must be punished.

20
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,606
4 DAYS EARLIER

21
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Judge Kang.

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,955
Yoo Hyeonsu's case
will be reinvestigated soon.

23
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,416
As for the child abuse, Bae Jayeong
will be summoned for questioning.

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,668
That's good.

25
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,587
I won't bother you anymore.

26
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
Why?

27
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,135
I mean...

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,471
What made you have this change of heart?

29
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,268
At first, I just wanted to prove it.

30
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,437
Because no one believed
I'd come back from the dead.

31
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,649
It was unfair,
and I wanted to find evidence

32
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:33,653
so I could prove
that what I said was true.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,614
-But?
-But

34
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,784
after I spent more time with you,
my thoughts changed.

35
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,661
You definitely killed me.

36
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,873
And you keep pestering me
and causing problems for me.

37
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,501
But weirdly, I'm not scared of you,
nor can I hate you.

38
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,006
Do you need money or something?
Why are you so chatty today?

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,760
I won't be curious about you anymore.

40
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,223
I won't ask
why you killed me anymore either.

41
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:03,474
Really?

42
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,894
Can I believe you?

43
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,645
You can.

44
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,190
Do you believe I'm a demon?

45
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,069
Well, you're too odd to be human.

46
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,113
But not bad for a demon.

47
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,074
So I'll believe it from now on.

48
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,785
You're a demon now.

49
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,997
I already was.

50
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,544
Just recycle this. You're going to
bug me again tomorrow anyways.

51
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,761
Then...

52
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:41,846
goodbye.

53
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,112
Aren't you drinking too much cola tonight?

54
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,781
Is it...

55
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,450
that detective
who won't just leave you alone?

56
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,536
Do you want me to break his ribs?

57
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,121
Where's he stationed?

58
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,750
Nobong Police Station,
Violent Crime 2, Han Daon.

59
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,211
Nobong Police, Han Daon?

60
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,171
You're dead if I catch you.

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,924
Leave him.
He says he won't be bothering me anymore.

62
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,175
Really?

63
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,844
That's a relief.
But you look so down today,

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,638
so I thought you were sick.

65
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,848
But actually,

66
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:30,019
Justitia experienced sudden heart
palpitations on her recent work trip.

67
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,107
Apparently, when humans
are in front of someone they love,

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,609
their hearts beat really fast.

69
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,163
And they can hear their heart
pounding in their ears.

70
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,541
What? Love?

71
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,709
Do you have a death wish?

72
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,670
Hey, I don't know about other demons,

73
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,131
but that would never happen to Justitia.

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,924
Yes, you're right.

75
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,428
But just in case,
if a demon falls in love,

76
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,595
what happens?

77
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,807
-They die.
-What?

78
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,520
There's only death for betrayers.

79
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,896
During your mission,

80
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,066
if you feel human emotions
or fall in love,

81
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,861
you will face a fate
even worse than death.

82
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:24,073
Then won't it be dangerous
if we stay here too long?

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,243
I've become humanized
and feel too many human emotions.

84
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,369
It's so tough.

85
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,789
Then we might fall in love and cry,
like they say.

86
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,750
Then Bael will kill us all--

87
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,127
Stop that nonsense
and get ready for the trial.

88
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,378
Should we toast?

89
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,463
For...

90
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,841
For a successful trial to come?

91
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:09,911
BAE JAYEONG

92
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,455
I hear the police
want to question you

93
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,999
at the station for abusing my grandson.

94
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,211
-That's a misunderstanding.
-Like hell it is!

95
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,004
Go back.

96
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:23,174
I'm never giving my Jiho to her. I won't!

97
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,344
How can I when she killed my son?

98
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,346
Who knows what she might do?

99
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:32,183
There's no evidence
that she killed your son. No proof.

100
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,352
My grandson saw everything.

101
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,647
That's why they decided
to investigate it again!

102
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,525
Don't ever show your face here again.

103
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,609
Got it?

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,736
You two-faced wench!

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,155
What a bitch.

106
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,791
Goodness, look at her.

107
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,886
The Judge from Hell

108
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,477
Ma'am, do you need help?

109
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,146
That's so nice of you!

110
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,649
Then can you just
take it to that bus stop there?

111
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,945
Goodness, how kind.

112
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,910
Thank you, young man.

113
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,162
Wait a second.

114
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,746
Take this.

115
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,831
RED GINSENG

116
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,166
Thank you.

117
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,585
You live with adults, right?

118
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:45,131
That's for old people like me.

119
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:49,719
If she takes it around 10 p.m.,
she'll have no pains and sleep well.

120
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,847
Thank you! Goodbye!

121
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,807
Bye.

122
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,693
-Did you do what I asked?
-Yes.

123
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,698
You better not tell anyone.

124
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,825
Of course not.

125
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,669
SLEEP AID

126
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,301
NO TRESPASSING

127
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,844
Goodness, that feels nice.

128
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:33,721
That feels much better.

129
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,098
You're such a good boy.

130
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,977
RED GINSENG

131
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,024
What's this?

132
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,737
Earlier, I helped an old woman
carry her things and she gave me this.

133
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,531
Really?

134
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,158
This will make the pain go away
and help you sleep.

135
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:58,871
Goodness, you're so sweet.
I'll be healthy thanks to you.

136
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,207
Thank you, my boy.

137
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,258
WHO IS IT?

138
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,353
Do you want your grandma
to die like your dad?

139
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,286
How's Jiho's case going?

140
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:42,123
Women and juvenile affairs at the local
precinct will investigate Ms. Bae.

141
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,584
Stay on it and follow up until the end.

142
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,377
Yes, ma'am.

143
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,634
This is Detective Han from Nobong Police.

144
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,763
Hello?

145
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,227
Jiho?

146
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,271
Mister.

147
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,148
Jiho, what happened? Where are you?

148
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,568
Mom brought me back to Seoul.

149
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,361
I'm so scared...

150
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,863
Hello, Jiho?

151
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,740
Where is he?

152
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,659
He said his mom brought him to Seoul,
but I don't know.

153
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,620
It's a pay phone.

154
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,623
I'll go.

155
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,541
Find out where the pay phone is

156
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,460
-and notify Detective Han.
-Yes, ma'am.

157
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,713
-You check on his grandmother, Donghun.
-Okay.

158
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,341
-Get to Bae Jayeong now.
-Got it.

159
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,517
JUDGE KANG BITNA

160
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,525
Hey, Daon.

161
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,694
His grandmother's in the emergency room.

162
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,571
-The emergency room?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,615
When the emergency services arrived,

164
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,575
-she was unconscious.
-How is she?

165
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,494
She might have taken sleeping pills,

166
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,205
but it could be dangerous
because of her age.

167
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,581
Thanks, Donghun.

168
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,630
Ms. Bae?

169
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,216
Ms. Bae, are you in there?

170
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,678
Ms. Bae! This is Detective Han Daon.

171
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,680
Jiho, are you in there?

172
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,265
Ms. Bae!

173
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,142
We found Jiho's location.

174
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,228
Idong-ro 42-gil.

175
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,357
Jiho! Yoo Jiho!

176
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,985
Mister.

177
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,279
Jiho.

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,198
Jiho, why are you here?

179
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:44,078
Mom forced me to come back home.

180
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,456
And she filled the bathtub.

181
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,459
The pillow game
is boring now, right?

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,253
Should we play a new game?

183
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,506
I want to see how long you can
hold your breath underwater.

184
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,093
You can't come up until I say so, okay?

185
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,845
Sounds fun, right?

186
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,518
Hello?

187
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,478
Is this Bae Jayeong'?

188
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,980
Yes. Who is this?

189
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:15,276
You drowned your husband.
Do you plan to do the same to the kid?

190
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,319
You've got the wrong number.

191
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:22,324
Should I hand evidence over to the police
to find out if it's the wrong number?

192
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:25,995
Who are you?

193
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,081
What do you want? Money?

194
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,458
Let's talk in person.

195
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,753
Meet me now at the place
where you killed your husband.

196
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,338
If you don't come alone,

197
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,257
you'll be arrested immediately.

198
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,550
I won't wait long.

199
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,219
Hello? Hello...

200
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,686
What did I say?

201
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,899
Don't call the police
and don't call Grandma.

202
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,901
And don't go to Grandma's.

203
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,778
If you don't listen to me,

204
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,946
I will kill your grandma.

205
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,284
I'll be back soon. Stay right here.

206
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,362
If you don't listen to me,

207
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,948
I will kill your grandma.

208
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,542
Jiho, call me
if anything happens, okay?

209
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,001
HAN DAON

210
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,294
Mister "Han Daon."

211
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,587
Zero, one, zero.

212
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,965
Zero, one, one, two.

213
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,508
Zero, one, one, nine.

214
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,343
I was so scared.

215
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:10,474
And you were the only person
I could think of...

216
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,312
Come here, Jiho.

217
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,692
You did good, Jiho.

218
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,527
You did good.

219
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,027
Damn, I left my phone.

220
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,591
Judge Kang?

221
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,723
Justitia.

222
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,435
-When should I call the guys?
-Call them now.

223
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,771
Okay.

224
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,983
Are you the one who called me?

225
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,943
Yes, it was me.

226
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,363
- What?
- Are you surprised?

227
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,910
-Go and wait. It won't take long.
-Okay.

228
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,500
What are you doing?

229
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,341
Where's Jiho?

230
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,304
He's safe at home.

231
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,643
Lying makes you a bad adult.

232
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,813
And bad adults...

233
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,775
must be punished.

234
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,795
Do you admit that you, sinner Bae Jayeong,
murdered Yoo Hyeonsu

235
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,548
and yet are unrepentant and unforgiven?

236
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,925
What is this?

237
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,469
Why are you doing this to me?

238
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,679
Let me ask again.

239
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,850
Do you admit to your crimes?

240
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,519
-Crimes? What crimes?
-Another question.

241
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,106
What did you put on the seat belt
when you killed your husband?

242
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,984
I never did that.

243
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,210
An adhesive.

244
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,670
A water soluble adhesive.

245
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,881
It dissolves in water.

246
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,442
No, no!

247
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,913
Stop messing around and get me out now!

248
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,957
-Hurry!
-I'm not messing around.

249
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,084
I'll go first. You follow me.

250
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,840
No, no!

251
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,091
No!

252
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,175
Don't go!

253
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,052
Help! Get me out!

254
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,269
Help me!

255
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,523
Help me!

256
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:12,943
Help me! Help...

257
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,865
Help me!

258
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,960
How'd the water taste?

259
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,051
Please don't kill me. Please.

260
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,637
Do you admit to killing Yoo Hyeonsu?

261
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,931
Yes, I killed him.

262
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,433
You killed your previous husband, too?

263
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,188
That... That really was an accident...

264
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,695
Why did you kill him?

265
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,076
If I tell the truth,

266
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,745
will you let me go?

267
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,457
Okay. If you tell me the truth,
I'll let you go.

268
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,959
But...

269
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,046
Tell me everything about the murder
of your ex-husband and Yoo Hyeonsu.

270
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,882
But if you lie, I'll beat you.

271
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:06,181
My ex-husband, all he had was money.

272
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,478
I hated the sight of him,

273
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,564
but I stayed in the marriage
for the apartment.

274
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,316
Honey, have some of this.

275
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,776
It's really good for you.

276
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,153
Hurry, drink it.

277
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:24,700
I figured I should squeeze more out of him
since he's going to die anyways.

278
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,453
So if he loses sight in both eyes,

279
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,871
that would be 120 million?

280
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,416
Okay.

281
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,758
It was pretty easy after that.

282
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,303
Because he liked to hike.

283
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,346
Be careful.

284
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:49,474
-Hey, stand here for a moment.
-Okay.

285
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,351
-I'll take a photo of you.
-Okay.

286
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:52,978
-How? Like this?
-Yes.

287
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:58,608
Okay, one, two, three...

288
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,860
What's wrong?

289
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,944
Oh, no.

290
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,948
When I dropped my phone off a cliff,
he came close.

291
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,992
Oh, no.

292
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,911
I took the chance.

293
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,877
And pushed him.

294
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,838
And the police were so dumb.

295
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,342
When they found out I was
a school teacher, they just believed me.

296
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,345
My husband just fell off a cliff.

297
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,722
Yes, please hurry up.

298
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,233
That's how you got
the apartment and death benefit.

299
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,445
But it was too small.
Only 500 million won.

300
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:49,034
I had my own apartment now,
so I thought of making money

301
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,119
and happened upon a naive man.

302
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,830
So your motive was money.

303
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,250
Why else would I marry
an old man with a child?

304
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,294
Why did you spare Jiho?

305
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,214
That way, no one would suspect me.

306
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,382
Right.

307
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:08,220
Then why did you
bring him back from his grandmother's?

308
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,680
I felt sorry for my husband.

309
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,142
So I wanted to raise him right.

310
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,653
You felt sorry,
but you choked the kid with a pillow

311
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
and tried to drown him in the tub?

312
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,574
I was just playing...

313
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,501
Then smile.

314
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,294
I'm just playing with you, too.

315
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,966
Fine! I was going to
make it look like he drowned in the bath.

316
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,844
So I could get the money he's entitled to.

317
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,470
Happy now?

318
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:58,770
Do you know why I lured you out here
before you killed that kid?

319
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,107
I may be a demon, but I don't hurt kids.

320
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,609
Demon?

321
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,902
Let's finish this.

322
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,990
You admit to killing
your ex-husband and Yoo Hyeonsu, right?

323
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,074
Yes!

324
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,951
I killed them both!

325
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,870
You aren't forgiven, right?

326
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,205
How can they when they're dead?

327
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:22,502
So you don't regret it at all.

328
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,004
If I say I do,

329
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,964
will you believe me?

330
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,842
You've hurt me enough.

331
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,844
Now let me go.

332
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,680
Okay, I'll let you go.

333
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,348
To Hell.

334
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,192
You are about to be
on the receiving end of what you've done.

335
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,235
That's the rule in Hell.

336
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,821
You just experienced a bit of it earlier.

337
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,784
Welcome to my world.

338
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,245
Please! Please don't!

339
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,538
Please!

340
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,583
You're a judge. You can't do this.

341
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,002
No, but just like they believed you,

342
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,172
people believe me so easily, too.

343
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,882
Because I'm a judge.

344
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,050
What should I do?

345
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:13,345
Should I let go? Or not?

346
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,765
I won't do it again.

347
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,893
I was wrong. Please spare me!

348
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,020
Please don't kill me!

349
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,647
Goodbye.

350
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,369
Mom, let's play a fun game.

351
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,996
What do you mean, a game?

352
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,289
Move!

353
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,253
Isn't it fun? It's fun, right? Say it is.

354
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,801
It's fun.

355
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,303
It's fun,

356
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,514
so please stop!

357
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,224
What are you talking about, Mom?

358
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,393
Fun time's only beginning.

359
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,660
Mmm... Smells so healthy.

360
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,885
Mmm... Want some?

361
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,762
It's really good for you.

362
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,517
And it's really tasty.

363
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,561
What did you put in it?

364
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:46,938
What did you put in it?
Get it away!

365
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,565
Say "ah."

366
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,610
Open your mouth. Open it.

367
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,737
I said open.

368
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,324
You gave it to your ex-husbands,
so why won't you drink it?

369
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:05,707
What did you give me?

370
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,209
Can you still see me?

371
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,670
Maybe I didn't put enough.

372
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,840
Still, it's fine.

373
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:16,676
This one won't be hard.

374
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,470
No.

375
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,972
No.

376
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,891
Don't come closer.

377
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,227
Get away from me. No.

378
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,900
No...

379
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,239
Did you have fun?

380
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,618
Please let me go.

381
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,622
Go to Hell.

382
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,709
COIN

383
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,921
Court is adjourned.

384
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,392
Are you still not done?

385
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,102
Just come say hello to her first.

386
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,646
- Quick, run!
- Yes, sir!

387
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,152
- Attention! Bow!
- Yes.

388
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,320
It's an honor to meet you!

389
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,323
Last time, at the scene--

390
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,908
- Remove your mask.
- Right.

391
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,994
Did you like the job we did last time?

392
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,662
It wasn't bad.

393
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,166
It's such an honor.
Let me just get that blood...

394
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,084
- Let me.
- Recycle it.

395
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,294
Yes.

396
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,504
In front of the kids...

397
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,048
I will get rid of the bloodstains.

398
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:05,428
SERGEANT CLEANING

399
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,522
Could you turn? No, I will go around.

400
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,565
What was I thinking?

401
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,111
Okay.

402
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,364
Okay, all done.

403
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,701
Should we leave the body like last time?

404
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,497
No.

405
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,542
Let's go another way this time.

406
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,960
What way?

407
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:47,929
Gosh, that stinks.

408
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,358
SEOUL NOBONG POLICE STATION

409
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,735
WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN A BAG
NEAR NOBONG POLICE STATION

410
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,660
-Push me.
-Right, of course.

411
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,041
Why did you leave it
in front of the police station?

412
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,253
Judges Ahn and Seo told me to.

413
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,216
Surprisingly, I need
your advice on something.

414
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,718
You scared me.

415
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,388
If you're wondering
when to give in your notice,

416
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,890
do it right now.

417
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,725
What do you need advice on?

418
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,105
A guy was into me but lost interest.
How can I make him come back around?

419
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,858
Ah...

420
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,027
The man with the megaphone?

421
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,574
You just broke off
your engagement and are already--

422
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,659
- Sorry, my mistake.
- Mmm.

423
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,827
Why wait?

424
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,329
You call him first.

425
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,456
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

426
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,875
It's more fun if he calls first
and gets clingy.

427
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,712
Then come up with a situation
where he has no choice

428
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,089
but to call you first. Then he'll...

429
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,299
Ah!

430
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,593
Why didn't I think of that? It's so easy.

431
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,430
Can you take mine too when you're done?

432
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,649
That's why you dumped that
near the station?

433
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,610
Only then will Han Daon
suspect me and come to see me.

434
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,614
He's perfect for me to fool around with

435
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,282
until I go back to Hell.

436
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,452
But what if he sniffs you out?

437
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,454
What? I don't have a smell.

438
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,206
Do you?

439
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,335
Sniffs me out?

440
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,131
- Oh, dear Lord.
- Let's go shopping.

441
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,176
You look amazing!

442
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,554
I look good in anything.

443
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,931
Cutie,

444
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,183
pretty, gorgeous, elegant.

445
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,643
- Freakin' beautiful.
- Zip it.

446
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,604
Freakin' beautiful.

447
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,941
Mmm... They're all pretty.

448
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,735
I'll have everything from here to there.

449
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,445
In size small.

450
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,449
Why are you so torn?

451
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,742
I have lots of debt.

452
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,162
I wonder what Han Daon is doing.

453
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,374
Shut your mouth.

454
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,336
HAN

455
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
Oh. Oh.

456
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,054
I'm sorry.

457
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,273
Don't run even if it's tough.

458
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,942
Only then can you be a good detective.

459
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,328
Do you have to be
so high-maintenance?

460
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,913
NOBONG POLICE STATION
KCSI

461
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,708
That's exactly
what Moon had on his forehead.

462
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,335
-Gehenna.
-What kind of sick freak does that

463
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,088
and leaves the body by a police station?

464
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,840
Let's turn this into serial killing.

465
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,634
The method of killing
is identical to that of Moon's.

466
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,428
Wait. There's one more link

467
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,097
between these two cases.

468
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,776
Judge Kang. Chief wants you right now.

469
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,110
Someone very high up is here.

470
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,737
I'm expecting a call, so I'm busy.

471
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,280
Who is this VIP--

472
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:45,917
Come in.

473
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,590
When is the VIP getting here?

474
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,220
Judge Kang, sit down.

475
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:58,304
I'll stand.

476
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:02,225
Assemblymen may have a lot of free time,
but judges are really busy people.

477
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,268
Are you going to keep being so rude?

478
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,771
Yes.

479
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,275
I'd like to invite you over for dinner.

480
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,653
I'm going to say no and leave.

481
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,738
I have something to tell you.

482
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:20,535
I'd also like to tell you
what you used to be like. What do you say?

483
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,120
I'm not that curious.

484
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,959
When should I be there?

485
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,264
Heavenly Father,

486
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,393
- we thank you for this food...
- Mmm!

487
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,063
Korean food is the best.

488
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,690
Mmm!

489
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,154
Right. When I leave,

490
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,907
pack me braised short ribs, japchae,
meatballs, and grilled deodeok root.

491
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,707
You've changed a lot.

492
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,419
You used to feel too uncomfortable
to eat properly in front of me.

493
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,756
Ah, since we're talking about the past,
I have a question.

494
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,758
Are my parents still alive?

495
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,803
Why haven't they called
their daughter for several months?

496
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,599
They emigrated to Argentina
five years ago.

497
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,059
Your older brother
runs a big Japanese restaurant there.

498
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:31,856
A Korean running
a Japanese restaurant in Argentina?

499
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,901
Wow. How international.

500
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,695
It's nice
that they're too far away for me to visit.

501
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,325
So, you're no longer
interested in politics?

502
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,493
Was I interested in politics?

503
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,578
What?

504
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,372
Bitna, my father...

505
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,667
Right... I guess I can't do that anymore.

506
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,504
My father adored you, Judge Kang.

507
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,049
From the day you first met
in a private setting,

508
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,553
he selected you
to be his political successor.

509
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,681
Why me over your own children?

510
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,267
Taegyu, as you know,
found his place in business.

511
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,603
And my second...

512
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:17,526
So what did they say at the hospital?

513
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:19,445
I haven't been going.

514
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,323
And I don't care
if my memory never returns.

515
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:25,660
Who stabbed me and why...

516
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,078
I'm not curious at all.

517
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:36,170
Actually, when the incident occurred,
I blocked any news from getting out.

518
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:40,383
Your engagement had just been broken,
and I didn't want people talking.

519
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,718
But I think I was wrong.

520
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,973
I should've publicized it
and caught whoever did that to you.

521
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,517
It's all right.

522
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,435
You did what you did for my sake.

523
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh, right.

524
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:57,275
I hear you're renting
a small villa in Hwangcheon-dong.

525
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,028
-Did you do a background check on me?
-Only because I was worried.

526
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,824
I don't know what's going on,
but I will help you.

527
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:07,159
It's all right. I like it there.

528
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,745
It's cheap and quiet.

529
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,914
Except for the landlady.

530
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,292
Speaking of the landlady,

531
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,877
why on earth
is she so against redevelopment?

532
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,547
Is she holding out?

533
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,965
I don't know.

534
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,343
By the way,

535
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,179
doesn't Seonho know Judge Kang is here?

536
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,266
Tell him to come say hello.

537
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,059
I'm sure he's sleeping.

538
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,575
Thank you.

539
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,634
Welcom--

540
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,720
Hey!

541
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,971
Justitia.

542
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,774
Did you skip dinner?

543
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,444
Mmm-hmm.
I have to wait a bit longer for my pay.

544
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,906
What's her story?
Why is she working several jobs

545
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,950
-and not even eating properly?
-Oh, her?

546
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:33,954
She grew up in an orphanage
but left when she was no longer covered.

547
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,916
But she was scammed by her friend.

548
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,834
She lost all her savings.

549
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,753
Eventually, she took her own life.

550
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,755
I WANT TO STOP. I'M LEAVING.

551
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,889
Why don't you live a bit longer?

552
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,374
Did you get her money back?

553
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,293
One look at the baseball bat,
and they gave it back.

554
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,049
Oh, right. Was his name Koo Mando?

555
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,385
How did he die?

556
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:31,720
That one's a complete sob story as well.

557
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,724
He was a court clerk
and died from overwork.

558
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,976
And he's never dated.

559
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,605
What a terrible tragedy.

560
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,487
How terrible.

561
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,323
That's going to be my face?

562
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,075
He's already so bloated.

563
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,851
See if you can find killers
still at large with multiple victims.

564
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,519
Okay. How many?

565
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:23,230
Fifteen or so? The more, the better.

566
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,818
I guess if you have to kill 20
within a year,

567
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,071
going about it one by one just won't work.

568
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,200
That's true, but more than that,
I'm bored these days.

569
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,701
I want to go back.

570
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,086
JUDGE KANG BITNA

571
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,642
Yes?

572
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,271
A detective's here to see me?

573
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,735
It's been a while.

574
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,156
I wanted to ask for your cooperation
on a serial killer case.

575
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,075
Okay.

576
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:18,118
Thank you for making the time.

577
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,788
We government workers
should help each other out.

578
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,082
But where's Detective Han?

579
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,000
He's actually waiting for you.

580
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,335
-This way.
-Okay.

581
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,716
Where were you the night Bae Jayeong died?

582
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,802
Are you suspecting me right now?

583
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,098
Both Moon Jeongjun and Bae Jayeong
were murdered

584
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,893
after being tried as defendants
by you recently.

585
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,230
I take on
about 200 cases per month.

586
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,148
Are all 200 of them dead?

587
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,402
We're investigating
with all possibilities open.

588
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,990
Then shouldn't you be questioned first?

589
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,951
You went to Moon Jeongjun's house
after he was released.

590
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,454
And you were with Jiho
the night Bae Jayeong disappeared.

591
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:07,126
Who do you think
behaved more suspiciously?

592
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,377
You or me?

593
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,177
You're glad Bae Jayeong's dead, right?

594
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,013
Aren't you thrilled?

595
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,097
No.

596
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,100
I'm angry
that she wasn't legally punished.

597
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,478
Because she died that way,

598
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:29,064
we can no longer get to the truth

599
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:32,276
of Yoo Hyeonsu's death
or the abuse Jiho experienced.

600
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,696
Why is the truth so important?

601
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,073
What matters is that a bad person is gone.

602
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,289
You didn't do it, did you?

603
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:49,418
Probably not.
Since there's no evidence.

604
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,732
What are you doing?

605
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,400
Can you escort me home?

606
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,152
I'm tired from the questioning.

607
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,703
Right. You were curious about me,
so I got some information.

608
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,665
I got engaged
to Assemblyman Jeong's eldest son,

609
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,583
but I broke it off in a month.

610
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,920
And my family emigrated to Argentina.

611
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,546
My brother's the Sushi King.

612
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,508
I don't care.

613
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,218
What?

614
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:43,138
You wanted to know, so I sat
through a boring evening to find out.

615
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,933
How disappointing.

616
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,894
Do you know what Gehenna is?

617
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,146
It means "Hell" in ancient Greek.

618
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,943
-I don't know.
-Shouldn't a demon know that?

619
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,821
Then...

620
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,282
have you stabbed anyone to death
other than me?

621
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,619
Show me the knife you stabbed me with now.

622
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,331
I know why you suspect me.

623
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,583
But it's not me.

624
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,044
If I did kill Moon Jeongjun
and Bae Jayeong,

625
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,672
they would have
come back to life like you.

626
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,890
Look at me.

627
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:38,861
What's with the reaction?
You should get mad at me like last time

628
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,572
or shove your cross necklace in my face.

629
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,575
Demons can joke around, too. It's fine.

630
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,790
How unamusing.

631
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,793
This is boring. It's not fun.

632
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,719
Bye.

633
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,512
If you're curious about something,

634
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,223
you should stick around and find out.
Why give up?

635
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,893
I promised not to be
curious about you anymore.

636
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,563
Promises and skulls
are meant to be broken.

637
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,442
So go back to being
curious about me and annoying me.

638
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,985
Why should I do that?

639
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,112
Because it's fun for me.

640
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,363
Leave right now!

641
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:30,120
Don't ever see this woman again

642
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,622
or spend time with her.

643
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,917
If you two stay together,

644
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,461
one of you will die for sure.

645
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:43,634
Listen to me, or you'll regret it later.

646
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,385
Excuse me, ma'am?

647
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,639
How did you know that I died?

648
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,601
Don't even come
near this neighborhood again.

649
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,103
Leave now! You, get out of the way!

650
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,484
Wow, she's so good.

651
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,319
I should have her tell my fortune.

652
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,083
Didn't you hear her?

653
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,795
Boring and dull Detective Han,
goodbye forever.

654
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,016
To Hell.

655
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,062
Don't ever see this woman again

656
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,313
or spend time with her.

657
00:47:38,897 --> 00:47:41,525
One of you will die for sure.

658
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:58,876
Hey!

659
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,544
What... Hey!

660
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,254
What is this?

661
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,589
Cheers!

662
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,097
Drinking here is therapeutic.

663
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,266
Why did you bring so much?

664
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,684
It's not much.

665
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,728
Honey, eat up.

666
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,980
Daon, I heard you got a girlfriend.

667
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:24,318
But you got dumped after three days
and clung to her.

668
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:25,903
Who said that?

669
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,863
Did she?

670
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,658
I just told her what I saw.

671
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,411
I hear she's a judge.

672
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,664
I'll have to check her out for myself.

673
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,875
So arrange a meeting at a pizza place.

674
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,754
I'm not seeing her anymore. She's a demon.

675
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,797
Yeah, just forget her.

676
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,966
There are so many good women around.

677
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,843
Like your boss.

678
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:55,265
Hey, this is... Why do you always...

679
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,975
-I'll get going! Bye!
-Hey!

680
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,977
Hey! Come here!

681
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,312
How could you...

682
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:04,399
Hyeongseok hasn't changed.

683
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,651
He's still so fun.

684
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,403
He fools around too much
and never grows up.

685
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,280
I'm raising three kids on my own.

686
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,619
Did it hurt a lot?

687
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,958
This? It's been so long,
I don't remember.

688
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,417
I still remember it all.

689
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,337
I never listened to you back then.

690
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,130
Only back then?

691
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,008
By the way,

692
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,387
why do you care about Jiho so much?

693
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:42,270
-It reminds me of you as a boy.
-Yeah.

694
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,400
That's why I wanted to protect him.

695
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,569
Like you and Hyeongseok protected me.

696
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,530
You know why I became a detective, right?

697
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,492
I haven't forgotten my promise to you.

698
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,203
I'm going to keep it.

699
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,498
So don't dwell on the past.
Only look to the future.

700
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:03,375
I'll take care of the past.

701
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,335
Okay.

702
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:14,094
"J, a serial killer
with 12 victims, is still at large."

703
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,848
"A statute of limitations on J
has expired on May 8, 2014."

704
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,518
"This case that took the lives
of 12 innocent citizens

705
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,353
still remains a mystery."

706
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,857
So you're telling me
I should solve that mystery?

707
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,818
So far, you have taken care of three.

708
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,446
If you catch this one,
your total will be 15.

709
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,574
After that,
you'll only need to kill five more

710
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,451
to return to Hell.

711
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,453
Do you think it'll be that easy?

712
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,623
Stop being such a downer
and get your head on the ground.

713
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,378
Are there any witnesses?

714
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,965
A 10-year-old kid survived
after seeing the killer,

715
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,384
but he was a kid in 1999,

716
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,428
so I guess he should be about 30 now.

717
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,430
Find out where he is.

718
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,098
Okay.

719
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,559
By the way,

720
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,603
that detective Han Daon

721
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,897
is not bothering you anymore, right?

722
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,150
No. He says he's not interested anymore.

723
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,736
-It's so annoying.
-That's a relief.

724
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,490
I'll find out
where this kid is.

725
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,033
Okay.

726
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,620
Here's the autopsy report.
Cause of death is severe bleeding.

727
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:24,706
Any forensic evidence at the scene?

728
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,667
Anything around the river
where Bae's car was found?

729
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,294
So far, there aren't any clues.

730
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:31,630
That's baffling.
How are we going to solve this?

731
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:32,839
We just have to.

732
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,681
Listen. I don't know
much about these things.

733
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,558
So can I ask you something?

734
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,109
She was murdered, but she deserved it.

735
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,486
Do you have to catch the killer?

736
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,706
About Bae Jayeong,

737
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,001
wasn't her car found by the river
where Yoo Hyeonsu was found?

738
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,380
It's quite a distance
from where the body was found.

739
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,216
Don't you think something's off here?

740
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,696
Just recycle this.

741
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,310
Someone left this
at the front desk last night.

742
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,273
"Gift"?

743
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:20,989
YOO JIHO
GIFT

744
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:25,744
What's the gift?

745
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:31,750
Do I look like this?

746
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:35,378
Wow, that's...

747
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,464
You can use this as your funeral photo.

748
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,969
Should I throw it out?

749
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,472
No, leave it.

750
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,226
Do you know any demons in Heaven?

751
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,732
Come on,
how can demons enter Heaven?

752
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:57,359
But why do you ask?

753
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:00,528
I wanted to find something out,
but never mind.

754
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,659
But why are your hands shaking?

755
00:54:08,453 --> 00:54:10,372
I have a tremor.

756
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:15,085
Your work's been sloppy these days.

757
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,462
-Get it together.
-I will.

758
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,766
My eyes don't match.

759
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,691
POST OFFICE

760
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,775
Jiho.

761
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,320
Is this your home?

762
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,239
Yes, but...

763
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,616
Who are you?

764
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,786
I'm a... mailman.

765
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,498
Your mom and dad sent you a letter.

766
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,210
My mom and dad passed away.
They can't send me letters.

767
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,382
Do you want to see for yourself?

768
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,641
"Dear Jiho."

769
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:15,979
"I'm in Heaven with Mom now."

770
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,026
"I'm sorry for leaving you so soon."

771
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,239
"Mom says she's sorry, too."

772
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:30,285
"But your mom and I

773
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,746
love you very much

774
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,082
and will always love you."

775
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,795
"We will see each other again

776
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:44,591
and be a happy family."

777
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,219
LOVE, YOUR DAD

778
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,767
Is there

779
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,271
something you'd like to say
to your mom and dad?

780
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,858
Just that...

781
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,905
I will take care of Grandma,
so they don't have to worry.

782
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:12,952
And that I'm doing well

783
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:15,246
so they don't have to worry.

784
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,316
THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS

785
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,859
Why is a demon so chatty?

786
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,153
Why doesn't he just go and beat them up?

787
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:51,908
Unit 201!

788
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,536
Can you come out?
I won't ask you to come to church.

789
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,587
I brought you some rice cakes.
Don't you want some?

790
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:08,716
Rice cakes?

791
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,970
My goodness.

792
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,889
You know

793
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:19,144
the Lord loves you
even if you pretend not to be home, right?

794
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,187
-I don't.
-Of course you do.

795
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,649
God's love is as warm
as these rice cakes. Here.

796
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:26,734
I like the honey ones.

797
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:30,280
The red bean ones are for when you move.

798
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,994
-Move?
-I'll leave you to talk.

799
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,305
You said we'd never see each other again.

800
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,891
I changed my mind.

801
00:57:58,892 --> 00:57:59,934
Why?

802
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,186
I'm curious again.

803
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,606
About you, Kang Bitna.

804
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:10,403
Unbelievable...
You're so bothersome.

805
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,875
Are you messing around again?

806
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,376
You won't fool me this time.

807
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:39,349
Judge Kang.

808
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,062
Judge Kang.

809
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,042
Judge...

810
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,057
Judge Kang. Judge Kang!

811
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,561
Judge Kang Bitna! Judge Kang!

812
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,522

Why are you curious about me again?

820
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,337
I wanted to confirm

821
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,090
what kind of person Kang Bitna is.
I want to know everything.

822
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,467
Get away from Judge Kang Bitna right now.

823
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,262
Han Daon is suspicious of me right now.

824
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,764
No one can catch me.

825
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:04,350
They're all dead. What do I do?

826
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,311
I think I know who did it.

827
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,276
He killed three?

828
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,320
Kang Bitna is the judge.

829
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,322
I don't care if we're in court!

830
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,366
Hey, bitch.

831
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,661
You having fun? Do you want to die, too?

832
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:27,540
Insanity or idiocy,
he's still a killer.

833
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,793
The man. Where is he?

834
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,170
Don't do anything.

835
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,006
Or say anything.

836
