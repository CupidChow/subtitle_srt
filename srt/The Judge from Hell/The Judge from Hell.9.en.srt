6
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,759
of the late Inspector Kim.

7
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,140
The sorrow and heartbreak
of saying goodbye are beyond words.

8
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,728
May she now rest in eternal peace,

9
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,691
free from the burdens of this earth.

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,493
No.
Then you'll go to Hell, too.

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,914
After I kill that bastard,

12
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,584
you can kill me and send me to Hell.

13
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,716
I will gladly let you kill me then.

14
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,747
If you want to go to Hell,

15
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:05,667
you should see it first.

Wait.

20
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,666
I'll be outside.

21
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,066
So did you get a look at his face?

22
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,485
-Yeah.
-That's great!

23
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,197
Did you tell Han Daon?

24
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,323
No.

25
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,870
Ah.

26
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,415
Your plan is to use Han Daon to find him,

27
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,669
and when you do,
you'll have him to yourself, right?

28
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,712
I knew it.

29
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,341
Next, Lieutenant Han Daon
from Violent Crime Investigation Team 2,

30
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,551
Nobong Police,
will deliver a funeral address.

31
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,918
YOUR NOBLE SACRIFICE WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN

FUNERAL ADDRESS

33
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,815
"We will always remember
Inspector Kim,

34
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,610
who took the responsibility
of being a police officer seriously

35
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,280
and put her heart and soul
into every moment."

36
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,367
"In this moment of longing and grief,

37
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,828
I feel resentful that we cannot

38
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,497
turn back time."

39
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,709
"Inspector Kim Soyeong

40
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,588
was the police officer
I admired and respected

41
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,050
most in this world."

42
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,719
"She was an outstanding colleague,

43
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,055
loving wife,

44
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,225
beloved mother...

45
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:01,319
"AND A MOTHER TO ME AS WELL."

46
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,704
and a mother to me as well."

47
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,551
"Longing is for those left behind."

48
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,762
"I hope she leaves all pain here

49
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,599
and rests in peace with happy memories."

50
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,198
Whoever killed Inspector Kim,
listen carefully.

51
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,411
I'm going to catch you no matter what.

52
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,831
And when I do,
I will make you beg for death.

53
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,463
I will make you feel this pain I feel
that's worse that death!

54
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,633
We will conclude
the funeral address here and--

55
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,760
I will give up everything I have,

56
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,720
even my own life if I have to!

57
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,764
I will chase you to the ends of Hell!

58
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,891
And find you myself.

59
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:17,186
I will tear you apart alive,
limb by limb!

60
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,271
Get him off!

61
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,816
Let go!

62
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,609
Let go of me!

63
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,071
Let go! I will kill you!

64
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,907
I will catch you at all cost!

65
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,993
I will!

66
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,453
I'm going to kill you!

67
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,329
You!

68
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,874
Let go!

69
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,208
I said!

70
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,962
Let me go!

71
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,755
I will!

72
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,592
I will catch you at all cost!

73
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,510
I will!

74
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,974
I will!

77
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,944
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong,
Yang Seungbin, Choi Wonjoong.

78
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,363
Why did you kill them?

79
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,448
I'm a judge in charge of murderers.

80
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:57,078
I only punish
unrepenting and unforgiven killers.

81
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,916
Think back to all four of them.
What kind of people they were.

82
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:07,588
Now that you've joined hands with a demon,
you will have to give up many things.

83
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,175
I use any and all means necessary

84
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,094
to kill sinners.

No.
Then you'll go to Hell, too.

00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,628
After I kill that bastard,

88
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,548
you can kill me and send me to Hell.

89
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,597
I will gladly let you kill me then.

90
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,473
That promise,

91
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,685
make sure you keep it.

92
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,108
It can't be.

93
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:37,428
Me?

94
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:41,432
That can't be. No way.

95
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,810
Right. I'm just broken.

96
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,813
I just need to be fixed. It's no big deal.

97
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,315
I am weak.

98
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,025
Please make me stronger.

99
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,195
Please make me fear no more.

100
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,780
I don't want to go to Hell--

101
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,033
What are you praying so hard for?

102
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,203
Did you commit a sin
or something?

103
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes. I did something bad.

104
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,168
I'm worried I won't be forgiven.

105
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,879
Gosh. Of course you'll be forgiven.

106
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:15,466
It's not like you kidnapped
and murdered someone.

107
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,469
But you know what?

108
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,389
Before you ask for forgiveness here,

109
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:24,517
go ask the person you've wronged
for forgiveness first.

110
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,436
Did you sincerely apologize to them?

111
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,858
The thing is, I don't feel
apologetic towards them.

112
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,694
Really?

113
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:37,655
But I have to ask for forgiveness
to go to Heaven.

114
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,241
To tell the truth, I come to church

115
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,369
because I don't want to go to Hell.

116
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,871
Repeat after me.

117
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,790
This is how we pray.

118
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,004
Lord.

119
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,717
I leave everything in your hands.

120
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,888
I leave everything...

121
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,641
By the way,

122
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:10,271
do you always pray like this?
That you leave everything in His hands?

123
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,400
Gosh. It's already so late.

124
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,278
Good luck with your prayer. I should go.

125
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,487
In His hands...

126
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,156
His...

127
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,326
It's in your hands...

128
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,663
Well, of course it is, but...

129
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,498
Isn't there anything you can do?

130
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,000
Please.

131
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,716

00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,424
Aren't you going to pray?

145
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,469
"Lord. I'm about to get beaten to death."

146
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,304
"Please help me."

147
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,388
Go ahead, pray.

148
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,598
No, wait.

149
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,184
Do you have to recite
the Lord's Prayer like last time?

150
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,770
As always, it's my fault.

151
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,606
Justitia, I'm sorry.

152
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,110
"Our Father in Heaven,

153
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,154
hallowed be Your name."

154
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,447
"Your kingdom come..."

155
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,407
Please, forgive me this once.

156
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,662
I told you that day to see
if Justitia cried and to report to me.

157
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,664
But why haven't you said anything yet?

158
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,624
Because I've never seen her cry.

159
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,709
Please don't tell Justitia about this.

160
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,837
Please, Arong?

161
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,172
Arong!

162
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,384
If she knows I go to church,
she'll kill me.

163
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,762
Please, I'm begging you, Arong. Please.

164
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,223
There is one way I'll let you live.

165
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,350
What is it? I'll do anything.

166
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,812
But you only follow Justitia's orders.
Not mine.

167
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,981
No. From now on, Arong...

168
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,485
No, I will obey you, Gremory.

169
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:34,540
But... why must you take it this far?

170
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,348
Venato!

171
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:53,934
Venato...

172
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,185
That's right.

173
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,397
It's my job to weed out traitors
who are becoming humanized.

174
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,442
To put it mildly, I'm the secret police.

175
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,446
She's not Satan but Venato?

176
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,823
Then where's Satan?

178
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,662
Okay, good.

179
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,956
What's wrong with me?

180
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,752
Don't worry. There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

181
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,086
There's nothing wrong?

182
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,340
I mean, there were so many big tears.
I kept crying.

183
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
It was like the Iguazu Falls.

184
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,136
I can't accept this. Test me again.

185
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,764
It doesn't make sense
that there's nothing wrong.

186
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,058
"I'm a demon."

187
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,976
"Demons do not cry."

188
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,562
"But I recently did."

189
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,814
"I'm sure there's something wrong
with my eyes."

190
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,317
"But the ophthalmologist found nothing."

191
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,196
"So I came to a psychiatrist."
Is that right?

192
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,324
I don't need a summary. I need a solution.

193
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,161
Can you tell me
what situation you were in when you cried?

194
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,705
My next-door neighbor
cried in front of me.

195
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,415
And I started crying with him.

196
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,876
What relationship do you have
with your neighbor?

197
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,002
We're good neighbors.

198
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:06,173
Then what was the neighbor
feeling when he cried?

199
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,883
I think he was angry.

200
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,719
He seemed sad and in pain.

201
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,930
Heartbroken.

202
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,808
And when you saw him like that,
how did you feel?

203
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,768
How did I feel?

204
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,527
It felt like
my heart was being ripped out.

205
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,071
Like something heavy

206
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,991
slammed into me deep in my chest.

207
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,494
Have you ever felt
compassion or love for this man?

208
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:38,539
Compassion? Love?

209
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:43,252
Doctor.

210
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:47,506
Is there such a thing
as warm cold iced tea in this world?

211
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,676
There are just two emotions
demons can't feel.

212
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,720
Compassion and love.

213
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,804
Why?

214
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,598
Because only humans get those feelings.

215
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,477
Then maybe you've become
a humanized demon.

216
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,188
If that man

217
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,400
were to disappear form this world,
how would you feel?

218
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,330
Warm iced tea?

219
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,832
It exists.

220
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,251
Even the ice in iced tea

221
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,004
melts if it stays out in the sun too long.

222
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,174
And it becomes warm.

223
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,238
Don't run even if it's tough.

224
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,658
Only then can you be a good detective.

225
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,308
VIOLENT CRIME INVESTIGATION TEAM 2

226
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,880
Here.

227
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,928
You'll become a better detective than me.

228
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,055
No way. I'm nowhere near that.

229
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,516
I need to work under you
for ten more years.

230
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,102
Gosh, that long?

231
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,355
Can I say no to that?

232
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,869
He wanted to thank his mom and dad
on his birthday.

233
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,537
That's why he came here.

234
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,165
Didn't I raise him well?

235
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,170
Now all he has to do is
find a nice girl and get married.

236
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,884
I'll protect Daon, ma'am.

237
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,808
I'm sure you know, but let me remind you.

238
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,685
The case involving Detective Kim

239
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,354
is a follow-up
to the unsolved J serial killing case.

240
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,564
It's a bigger case now.

241
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,400
So the regional investigation unit
has taken over.

242
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:57,404
And you all must know
I'm team leader here as of today.

243
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,072
There he comes.

244
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,157
Hello.

245
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,660
Hello, I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

246
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,831
All right.

247
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,166
It's nice to meet you.

248
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,751
Nice to meet you.

249
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,085
ENERGY DRINK

250
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,254
I feel like we're about the same age.

251
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,425
Thank you.

252
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:21,178
Lieutenant Han Daon.

253
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,350
I've heard a lot about you.

254
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,519
Do you feel better now?

255
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,732
Drink this and chin up.

256
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,781
Four people are dead.
What have you been doing?

257
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,658
How can you call yourselves
police officers?

258
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,117
I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,577
I'm sorry.

260
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,080
Tell me everything
you've investigated so far.

261
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,793
Well... There is one person
that there's something fishy about.

262
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,128
Judge Kang Bitna.

263
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:58,048
All four victims had been tried by her
before they died.

264
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:00,676
I thought she was already
interviewed as a witness.

265
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,302
Is there new evidence?

266
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,222
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong,
Yang Seungbin, and Choi Wonjoong

267
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,226
were all tried by Judge Kang Bitna
and released.

268
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,104
Isn't that strange?

269
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,149
Judge Kang tries over 200 cases a month.

270
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,110
Have all those 200 died?

271
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,904
Right. I also think

272
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,657
there's no reason
for a judge to commit murder.

273
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,076
There's no law saying judges can't kill.

274
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,577
There's no evidence.

275
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,913
Whether we have evidence or not,

276
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:33,250
she's the most suspicious.
So we should look into her again.

277
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,086
There's no need.

278
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,671
It's not Judge Kang.

279
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,423
Are you her lawyer or something?

280
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,216
Why do you keep defending her?

281
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,593
That's because you keep talking nonsense!

282
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,012
What's nonsense?

283
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,555
What do you think you're doing?

284
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,438
My apologies.

285
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,949
What would you like for lunch?

286
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,284
I'm not very hungry.

287
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,161
You two go ahead.

288
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,495
Is everything okay?

289
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,622
I'm fine.

290
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,918
That's not how it looks.

291
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,546
You have to eat to feel better. Let's go.

292
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,636
JUDGE'S OFFICE

293
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,356
There must be something here you like.

294
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,192
Someone told me
you have to eat to feel better.

295
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,986
And I had a hunch you wouldn't.

296
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,613
Eat up.

297
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,658
Do I need to feed you?

298
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,496
Ah.

299
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:55,874
Ah.

300
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,633
Hey, did you see the news?

301
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,009
Was it Hwangcheon-dong?

302
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,429
The police officer who went missing
turned up dead.

303
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,973
I heard her arm was cut off.

304
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,683
That's so creepy.

305
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,228
Do you think it was cut
when she was alive?

306
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,147
No way. Cut someone alive
like they're sushi or something?

307
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,901
Even for fish, they at least
knock them out before they're sliced.

308
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:25,195
The killer must've
knocked the officer out, too.

309
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:29,449
They probably beat her up
until she became unconscious and then...

310
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,829
- What the...
- Hey, let go.

311
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,747
Should I crack open your head first?

312
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,457
Or rip out your mouth?

313
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,751
Who the hell are you? Get him on camera.

314
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,253
- What is this?
- Get him.

315
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,715
I have a thing about filming crime scenes.

316
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,969
Hey!

317
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,804
Hey.

318
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,889
What are you doing?

319
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,558
If you feel upset, sue me.

320
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,561
I'm Judge Kang Bitna
of Seoul Central District Court.

321
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,897
You. Don't open your mouth
unless you have to eat.

322
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,610
Hey!

323
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,784
Some people just
shouldn't be allowed to talk.

324
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:16,955
Sorry.

325
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,417
You did that on purpose
so I wouldn't get sued, didn't you?

326
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,336
Stop losing your temper like that.

327
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,257
I acquitted you of assault last time,
but other judges would never.

328
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,592
Thank you.

329
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,011
For then and now.

330
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,016
Don't get any wrong ideas
just because I fed you.

331
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,019
No way. That will never happen.

332
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,063
- What?
- Nothing.

333
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,357
Just get me
the investigation records later.

334
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,568
I feel good that we're on the same team.

335
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,321
Who says we're on the same team?

336
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,198
I'm going to kill you.

337
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,162
It's an honor to die by a teammate's hand.

338
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,050
They're openly going on dates now?

339
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,308
Find out if that person's in Hell.
Han Daon's parents and brother, too.

340
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,893
But what for?

341
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,436
Do you need a reason?

342
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,146
No, it's not that.

343
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,233
Finding someone in Hell
by asking around without a photo

344
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:28,568
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

345
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:31,613
Okay. Then you better start looking.

346
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,782
What you just asked us to do,

347
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:35,992
did you get permission from Hell?

348
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,036
No, I didn't.

349
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,162
Well, then--

350
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,915
You burned those thugs
without my permission too.

351
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,002
We're sorry!

352
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,213
We can't do it. It's too dangerous.

353
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,426
Not as dangerous as them finding out
you donated to the hospital.

354
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,264
I can't give you much time.

355
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,140
But...

356
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,522
I wonder if this is the real Hell.

357
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,525
This is the worst crisis
in our ten years in the human world.

358
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,321
METROPOLITAN AREA
NUMBER OF PEOPLE CLEANED UP

359
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,156
I don't want to go.

360
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,783
SEOUL NOBONG POLICE STATION

361
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,870
We can't question someone who's already
been interrogated without new evidence.

362
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:23,999
We must secure evidence first.
That's how it works.

363
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,084
-Yes, sir.
-Yes.

364
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,836
Park Donghun, Han Daon.

365
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,046
You take the Moon Jeongjun
and Bae Jayeong cases.

366
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,506
Jang Munjae, Ko Eunseop.

367
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,049
Look into the Choi Wonjoong case.

368
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,011
Forget what you've investigated so far.

369
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,346
Start by asking around again, okay?

370
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,849
I'm sorry, sir,

371
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,351
but I can't work with Han Daon.

372
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,606
Then I will work with Detective Han.

373
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,441
That solves it, right?

374
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,901
Fine.

375
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,724
Hey!

376
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,604
I'll clean it up. Cleaning it up now.

377
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,525
Cleaning.

378
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,328
Wow, this works so well.

379
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,001
Clean, right?

380
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,341
Anyway, there's no new information at all.

381
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,886
The dismemberment, the oddly shaped knife,

382
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,806
the letter J
written with the victims' blood.

383
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,892
This was all in the news back then.

384
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,105
Do you remember anything from that time?

385
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,738
The metallic smell of blood
when I went inside.

386
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:22,242
My mom taking her last breath
with her phone in her hand.

387
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,913
My dad, covered in blood,
holding my dead brother in his arms.

388
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,129
It becomes clearer every day.

389
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,221
By the way,

390
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,849
I'm feeling really tired for some reason.

391
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,517
I'm tearing up from yawning.

392
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,935
Because I yawned.

393
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,521
-What are you looking at?
-I...

394
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,648
I don't know...

395
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,192
I should get going.

396
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:03,825
She cried?

397
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,706
But tears didn't
stream down her face or anything.

398
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,541
Her eyes just got watery...

399
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,043
What's the mood between her and Han Daon?

400
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,463
Well...

401
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,132
It is romantic,

402
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,386
but more melodramatic than rom-com.

403
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,305
Melodramatic?

404
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,390
Rom-com?

405
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,893
Want to shoot a thriller with me?

406
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,103
I only answered your question.

407
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,188
Hey!

408
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,606
Who are you, thief?

409
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,151
If you want to rob someone,
you should be more selective.

410
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,944
Look at his face.

411
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,198
He's got the look of a pauper.

412
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,574
He's a poor fellow.

413
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,618
I'm not robbing him.

414
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:48,036
Get home safe.

415
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,622
-Okay.
-Keep your mouth shut.

416
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,706
Okay.

417
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,379
Thank you.

418
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,049
Good night.

419
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,472
So she cried?

420
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:40,964
How did you get in?

421
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,555
I don't care how old you are.

422
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:50,265
Stop hiding and come out now!

423
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,820
Are you going senile?

424
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,196
Get down now.

425
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,948
No. I'll get up there myself.

426
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,158
Where's the ladder?

427
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,411
Damn it.

428
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,079
Wait right there.

429
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,782
I get it, you're a demon.

430
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,743
You play dirty.

431
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,871
State your name
before it gets any dirtier.

432
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,671
An angel who descended to Earth
in the name of God

433
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,174
to protect the good and the poor.

434
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,258
I'm Gabriel.

435
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,556
Thanks for the cringy introduction.

436
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,391
How long have you known who I am?

437
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,020
Welcome.

438
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,614
Ma'am, please save our daughter.

439
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,957
You expect me to believe that?

440
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,875
Why ask when you won't believe me?

441
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,002
You're an odd one.

442
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,837
Put your stupid wings away.

443
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,756
You look way too tacky.

444
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:55,014
So why are you here?

445
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,182
Are you slow?

446
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,268
I'm here to protect the good and poor.

447
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:00,353
I just told you.

448
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,731
I've never seen you
do anything good to anyone.

449
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,693
Try and use that head of yours.

450
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,361
They were all people you knew.

451
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:19,580
Someone's dying here. Hurry!

452
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,459
I saved a poor woman

453
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,962
who was not yet ready to go to God.

454
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,505
Jiho.

455
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,176
Your mom and dad sent you a letter.

456
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,928
I delivered the letter
his parents sent...

457
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,179
Do you want to see?

458
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,724
...to their little boy
from Heaven.

459
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:42,729
Please save my Yugyeong.

460
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,860
And I breathed life
into the daughter of someone...

461
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,826
who so unfairly lost their life.

462
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,997
They were all miracles I performed
in the name of God.

463
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,081
So,

464
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:06,502
in the name of God,
you've been stalking me.

465
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,504
And you kicked me in my sleep.

466
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,006
I wasn't following you.

467
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,635
I was staying by the good people
left behind after your killings.

468
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,137
And I urgently woke you up

469
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,097
because of Daon.

470
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:21,642
Han Daon?

471
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,186
When I first met Daon,

472
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,188
I was living in the body of an officer.

473
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,278
And there,

474
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,657
I heard the prayer
left behind by a poor soul.

475
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:41,621
Please protect
my son, Daon.

476
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,708
Rest in peace.

477
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:50,004
Your prayers have been answered.

478
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,472
And he met a woman who would

479
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,266
love the lonely child
in place of his deceased parents.

480
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,645
Was it White Tree Childcare Center?
I hear he's staying there.

481
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,273
But isn't the center too far

482
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,526
from Manjae Elementary
for such a little boy?

483
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,534
I had to go back to Heaven soon.

484
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,370
And that was the only way

485
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,539
I could safely protect Daon.

486
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,749
- Daon!
- Kim Jieun's mother?

487
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,252
I'm Han Daon's mom. Class 3-1.

488
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,088
Yes, Daon's mother.

489
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,673
Now, smile.

490
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:38,136
One, two...

491
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,643
What a boring story.

492
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,020
So what? What do you want?

493
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,648
I can only protect the good and poor.

494
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,443
But the moment Daon decided
to commit murder,

495
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,029
I could no longer protect him.

496
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,157
He hasn't killed anyone yet.

497
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,661
-Committing it in your mind is also a sin.
-But why are you telling me all this?

498
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,829
I'm a demon.

499
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,914
The only person who can protect Daon now

500
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:08,833
is you.

501
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,264
But the moment Daon decided
to commit murder,

502
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,808
I could no longer protect him.

503
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,520
After I use Han Daon
to extract the information he has,

504
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,771
I'm going to discard him.

505
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,859
So if you're worried
Han Daon might to go Hell,

506
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,694
there's no need.

507
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,364
I don't know who it will be,
but either you or Han Daon will die.

508
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,451
My prophecies have never been wrong.

509
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,661
Then I guess it'll be Han Daon...

510
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,416
I've done what I can do.

511
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,836
Whether you use Daon and discard him
or protect him,

512
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,796
it's up to you.

513
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,881
Damn it.

514
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,644
Gosh, you're eating so well.

515
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,604
Minjun.

516
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,772
Try this.

517
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,401
There you go.

518
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,405
And this too.

519
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,451
By the way, it's all meat today.

520
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:28,788
I'll go get some vegetables.

521
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,499
This is enough already. It's all right.

522
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,794
You need a well-balanced diet
to grow tall. Keep eating, okay?

523
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,088
I'm really fine.

524
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,260
Let's see.

525
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,387
Mm.

526
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,348
This is really the power of nature.

527
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,433
All right.

528
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,978
STRONGLY AGAINST HWANGCHEON DEVELOPMENT

529
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,151
You can't go in there.

530
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:06,117
I'm sorry. I thought it was the bathroom.

531
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,870
Right. Goodness. The bathroom's that one.

532
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,372
HWANGCHEON MIDDLE SCHOOL

533
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,879
Hello, ma'am.

534
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,131
Can I help you with that?

535
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,756
What the...

536
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:54,308
Honey.

537
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:58,062
You must be tired
after working the night shift.

538
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,772
Eat something at my place, okay?

539
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:04,151
It's all right. I already feel bad
that you give Minjun breakfast every day.

540
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,986
Gosh, don't say that.

541
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,989
I also lost my husband young
and worked to raise my kids.

542
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,616
I know how hard that is.

543
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,451
My daughter's about your age.

544
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,329
You and Minjun both are like my children.

545
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,414
That's all.

546
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,416
You're like

547
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,086
an angel sent from above to encourage me.

548
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,005
Goodness!

549
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,843
If an angel hears that,
I'll be sued for libel.

550
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,011
Let's go eat, okay?

551
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,723
Gosh, it's too early
in the morning for this!

552
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,808
Thank you.

553
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,017
HWANGCHEON VILLA

554
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,312
Honey,
you don't have to do that.

555
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,397
It's all right.

556
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,898
Goodness.

557
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,780
Detective Kim Soyeong of Nobong Police

558
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,200
went missing in Hwangcheon
and has been found dead.

559
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:57,079
The culprit has been revealed
to be serial killer J.

560
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,248
Serial killer J,

561
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,876
who murdered 12 innocent people

562
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,421
over a two-year period
in 1998 and 1999 and disappeared,

563
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,631
has returned after 25 years.

564
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,010
That they murdered a police officer
on duty was a great shock.

565
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,978
COURT

566
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:25,566
Gosh, I can't believe
you're not eating this delicious lobster.

567
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,570
The food here
must not suit your taste, right?

568
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,864
Why don't you
just hand in your notice now?

569
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:34,950
Who am I?

570
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,745
There's no way
I'd do something so foolish.

571
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,829
Right?

572
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,708
Love? Compassion?

573
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,628
What a bunch of baloney.

574
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,172
Who cares what happens to him?

575
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,882
Just forget about it.

576
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,801
Have you been day drinking?

577
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,095
What's up with the random monologue?

578
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,640
I'd be craving alcohol
during the day, too.

579
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,559
She was just heavily criticized
for that family murder case.

580
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,978
And now, more malicious comments
are flooding in

581
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:05,064
because of that Choi Wonjoong case.

582
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,148
Here.

583
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,527
"Was the judge bribed?"

584
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,738
"My dog would make
a better judge than her."

585
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,908
"Satan lost his job after this trial."

586
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,036
People are so cruel.

587
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:22,623
I did something deserving criticism.

588
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,127
Gosh. Judge Kang.

589
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,631
You should be glad you didn't
marry into Assemblyman Jeong's family.

590
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,927
The younger son took drugs again
and caused trouble.

591
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,345
He's been arrested.

592
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,555
Again?

593
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,432
He'd been arrested before
and released on probation.

594
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,644
I know.
Thanks to his father's influence.

595
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,728
His father?

596
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,569
I'm leaving. Can you clean mine up?

597
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,490
Gosh.

598
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,120
Goodness.

599
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,913
- What...
- Give it.

600
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,873
Goodness.

601
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,256
Jeong Seonho.

602
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,055
JEONG SEONHO

603
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:38,449
Judge Kang. The chief's asking
if you have time tonight.

604
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,034
I'll tell him you're busy.

605
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,702
What time tonight?

606
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,039
- At 8 p.m.
- Okay.

607
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,545
Why are you so late?

608
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,340
The assemblyman's been waiting.

609
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,633
It's all right.

610
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,218
Four years' probation.

611
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:04,975
What is it you want?

612
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,061
I'll grant anything.

613
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,729
You must be omnipotent.

614
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,607
I'll tell you when I want something.

615
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,317
That's all for today, then.

616
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,361
Let's eat in peace.

617
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,821
I can't eat in peace with this group.

618
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,198
If you'll excuse me.

619
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,241
Wait, Judge Kang...

620
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,584
Young people these days are like that.

621
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:35,172
What's wrong? I find it charming.

622
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,510
I thought I said
I didn't want to see you again.

623
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:44,098
Don't overreact. I didn't come to see you.

624
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,266
You're not Kang Bitna, are you?

625
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,647
Why do you think that?

626
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,320
Kang Bitna was always overly polite
in front of me. Almost servile.

627
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,405
So...

628
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,783
You don't think I'm Kang Bitna
because I'm not servile?

629
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,868
One more thing. Kang Bitna

630
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,288
would never live in a rotten place

631
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,790
like Hwangcheon.

632
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,126
Even if she'd lost her memory,

633
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,420
she was too squeamish

634
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,922
to be able to live among the poor.

635
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,550
You looked down on the poor last time.

636
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,844
And again this time.

637
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,429
I don't look down on them.

638
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,056
I loathe them.

639
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,144
The way one might recoil
when they see a cockroach.

640
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,437
Ah.

641
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:36,150
Like how I recoil when I see you, maybe?

642
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,153
That wasn't funny, stop snickering.

643
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,614
You spoke as if it would be
a big deal if I regained my memory.

644
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:43,824
Let's hear why.

645
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,909
It is a big deal if you do.

646
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:50,372
Because then you'll beg me
to get engaged to you again.

647
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,916
Don't flatter yourself. I don't want you.

648
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,086
Let's not run into each other again.

649
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:01,091
I'm not asking. It's a warning.

650
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,887
Could you tell your father?

651
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,764
To stop calling me.

652
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,349
And I'm not asking either.

653
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,059
It's a warning.

654
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,575
Hey, what's Kang Bitna to you?

655
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,160
What...

656
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,453
I mean, it's odd.

657
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:32,080
You used to suspect her
and follow her around.

658
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,665
But now you're defending her.

659
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,542
Without thinking.

660
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,919
God damn it.

661
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,588
Then did you think

662
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,259
when you left her alone
to go to the store during your stakeout?

663
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,386
Had you not left her alone--

664
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,805
You bastard!

665
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:54,269
You don't even know
how to protect the people around you.

666
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,440
Now you're insisting on catching
an unknown culprit without evidence.

667
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:02,110
Ridiculous, don't you think?

668
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,781
You asshole!

669
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,559
Daon's been acting weird.

670
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,394
I saw the look in his eyes.

671
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,479
He was ready to kill someone.

672
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,606
I'm pretty sure Daon

673
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,278
is hiding something
about Kang Bitna from us.

674
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,823
Bringing up Detective Kim just now
was to provoke me

675
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,534
to stop talking about Kang Bitna.

676
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,494
What do you think he's hiding?

677
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,371
We have to find out.

678
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:05,424
Gosh, he shouldn't have hit you
no matter how angry he was.

679
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,302
I provoked him on purpose.
I wanted him to hit me.

680
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,930
Kang...

681
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,181
What was it?

682
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:15,183
Banjjak?

683
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,061
No, that's not it. What was it?

684
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,771
Kang Bitna.

685
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,691
Judge Kang Bitna.

686
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,818
Looks like you were fighting
because of her.

687
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,823
What kind of person is Kang Bitna?

688
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,618
A bad judge, but a good person.

689
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:38,874
She doesn't let the strong push her around
or walk over the weak.

690
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,420
She may seem cold from a distance,
but up close she's very warm.

691
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,548
She sounds very humane,

692
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,718
this Kang Bitna.

693
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,305
Please tell Detective Yoo I'm leaving.

694
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,058
Okay. Best you don't let him
see you like that.

695
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,559
I'll talk to him for you.

696
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,572
A humane person

697
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,952
whom the police suspect.

698
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,129
No one's taking your food. Eat with
your head up. Have you sinned or what?

699
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,925
He didn't get to eat all day.

700
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,554
Now that we know who serial killer J is,

701
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:37,265
all we need to do is kill him.

702
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,102
Congratulations on making it back to Hell!

703
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:44,272
But I'm not 100% sure if it's him.

704
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:48,402
Either way, it's true
he killed Detective Kim Soyeong.

705
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,530
You won't lose anything if you kill him.

706
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,158
Then Han Daon will be left alone.

707
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,744
What?

708
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,206
What does that have to do with you?

709
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,710
I mean...

710
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,462
I've had fun messing around with him.

711
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:08,797
It would be a shame.

712
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,716
Should I take him to Hell?

713
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,428
I get it now.

714
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,725
Justitia.

715
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,103
It's cola.

716
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,187
Two plus one.

717
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,818
Aren't you broke? Thanks.

718
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,947
The moment I realized I was a demon,

719
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,533
it was my dream
to become a demon like you.

720
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,327
So...

721
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,247
please don't disappoint me.

722
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,833
Bye.

723
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,316
What happened to your face?

724
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,817
Who did that? What bastard...

725
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,653
Bring him to me now. I'll kill him.

726
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,407
Even if the police call, ignore them.
I'll stop them no matter what.

727
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,702
Did that happen because of me?

728
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:23,872
No. Good night.

729
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,681
Why did you just take it?

730
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,308
You should've fought back.

731
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,477
Gosh, your poor handsome face.

732
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,237
What's with the face?

733
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,280
Has a pretty girl never nursed you before?

734
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,869
That's enough now.

735
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,042
Actually...

736
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,213
No! I'm a demon.

737
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,881
We can't be doing this.

738
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,217
This...

739
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,553
It's not an ointment. It's a lip balm.

740
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,725
- Did it not hurt?
- It did.

741
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,937
What... Then why didn't you just tell me?

742
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,647
Are you a perv or something?

743
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,819
I liked how you were worried about me.

744
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,073
You are a perv.

745
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,992
Wait here. I'll...

746
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,744
get something
with great healing properties.

747
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,130
Defendant's counsel,

748
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,465
do you accept the prosecutor's charges?

749
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,759
- No, we do not.
- Yes.

750
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,096
I accept.

751
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,890
I will respond
to the questions.

752
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,183
I did drugs,

753
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,810
drove, and ran a red light.

754
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,104
Then I almost hit the kids

755
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,731
and broke the transformer.

756
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,400
Defendant. Face me.

757
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,077
WITNESS STAND

758
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,499
Look at me, Defendant.

759
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,590
Is this a joke to you?

760
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,675
Look at me.

761
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,862
Defendant, have you ever killed anyone?

762
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,280
Your Honor?

763
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:04,741
Or have you ever wanted to kill?

764
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,963
Let's wrap up for today.

765
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,685
Why would a judge

766
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:36,398
visit the defendant of a case
that's already reached a verdict?

767
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,360
She visited Moon Jeongjun to tell him

768
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,903
not to commit any more crimes.

769
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,113
Oh, right.

770
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:46,366
That's what it said
in the witness statement.

771
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:53,707
Yes?

772
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:56,793
What?

773
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,588
You have footage from a CCTV camera
towards Haeseo River?

774
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:05,427
Yes, understood. Thank you.

775
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:10,098
If this goes well, we might get promoted.

776
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:12,809
Let's go.

777
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,858
You still have the CCTV footage
from March.

778
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,778
Do they not get deleted after that long?

779
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,905
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

780
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,656
Last year, a car passing by

781
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,576
crashed into the store's sign
on the road and sped off.

782
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:14,496
When I installed new ones,
I got ones that can record long.

783
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,122
You did well.

784
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,916
Anyway, can I use your bathroom?

785
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:19,459
It's to the left there.

786
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,794
- That corner there?
- Yes.

787
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,462
-You start checking.
-Okay.

788
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,805
I'm sorry. Can I trouble you
for a glass of water?

789
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,931
Of course.

790
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,853
USB STORAGE 1

791
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,413
DELETE 55 FILES?

792
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:57,497
DELETE

793
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,291
Did you find anything?

794
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,001
Well...

795
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,462
Let's see.

796
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,548
Let's see.

797
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,049
Thank you.

798
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,134
What?

799
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:13,430
These are all
from after the day of the incident...

800
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:17,058
- Is something wrong?
- Did you delete anything before we came?

801
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,644
No. This is everything.

802
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,981
Seriously?

803
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,066
Damn it.

804
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,573
Why was he killed here?

805
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,658
Try lying down here.

806
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,077
This is a new outfit.

807
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:39,205
The moment you wear it, it's old.
Get down now.

808
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:42,542
Darn it.

809
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,755
Like how the body was.

810
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,300
Gosh.

811
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,260
Is this good?

812
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,473
I'm Kang Bitna.

813
00:57:56,556 --> 00:58:00,685
And I stabbed Choi Wonjoong with a knife
at an amusement park of all places.

814
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:08,485
Why?

815
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,612
Do you still suspect her?

816
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,655
How can a judge be a murderer?

817
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,908
Get rid of that bias.

818
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,744
It is Kang Bitna.

819
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:20,622
But we have no evidence.

820
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,040
If you feel that strongly,

821
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,960
why don't we dig into
Judge Kang from the beginning?

822
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,591
From the beginning?

823
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,474
Why did you do it?

824
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,311
What?

825
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,730
I saw you.

826
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,315
You deleted it on purpose.

827
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,204
You're an officer
but destroyed evidence for her.

828
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,875
You must really like
this Judge Kang Bitna.

829
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,427
I'll keep this a secret for now.

830
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,056
If you do what I say.

831
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:54,799
You were right.

832
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,219
Han Daon knows everything.

833
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,263
And yet he's covering for her.

834
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,354
Then as Bael ordered,

835
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,316
please kill Han Daon.

836
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,734
Of course.

837
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:17,864
In the most painful...

838
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:22,243
and brutal way possible.

839
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,552
Nice to meet you.

840
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,055
I'm Detective Jang Munjae.

841
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,785
The Judge from Hell

842
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,245
♪ Lost ♪

843
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,707

♪ Justice, justice ♪

846
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:08,474
-How can you believe a demon's promise?
-We just need him to die.

847
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,435
This is betrayal.

848
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,854
A human
is interfering with Justitia.

849
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:14,272
Please kill that man.

850
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,190
-What is his name?
-Han Daon.

851
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:18,943
How much do you love
Detective Han Daon?

852
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,362
Enough to give up your life?

853
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:24,699
Stop messing around. Before I kill you.

854
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:28,870
He dismembered different body parts
of each victim. Then...

855
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,414
You're Satan, right?

856
01:02:31,497 --> 01:02:32,832
You're J, aren't you?

857
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:33,916
Lord...

858
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:36,461
Please hear my prayer.

859
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:39,088
What plan? Why him?

860
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,551
I thought
I was having a heart attack!

861
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,803
Detective Han
is in danger right now.

862
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,556
- When will you kill Han Daon?
- Be patient.

863
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,808
I'm preparing something very interesting.

864
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:53,019
Judge Kang. You love me.

865
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,979
Please die.

866
01:02:55,855 --> 01:02:58,357
Die!
