1
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,947
The Judge from Hell

2
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,866
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE SITUATIONS

4
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,954
Defendant,
your final statement, please.

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,581
I know I won't see her again,

6
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,459
but I want to say
that I really loved Minjeong.

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,210
The defendant is hereby ordered

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,047
to pay a fine of three million won.

9
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,174
Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you!

10
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,307
Please, let me go.

11
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,643
I'll be back. Stay pretty.

12
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,814
She's dead.

13
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,778
EPISODE 2

14
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,363
Shall we go talk somewhere quiet?

15
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,617
What would we have to talk about?

16
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,705
Come on. It won't be long.

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,459
Okay.

18
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,883
What brings you here,
Detective?

19
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,303
-You know why.
-I don't.

20
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,348
I told you clearly

21
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,725
to stay away from Cha Minjeong.

22
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:23,977
Actually...

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,645
Mom left when I was in high school.

24
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,355
Dad kicked me out when he remarried.

25
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,899
It's because I grew up without parents.

26
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,067
Shut up!

27
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,569
Not every orphan is like you.

28
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,405
So are you going to hit me?

29
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,115
That won't do you good.

30
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,369
Yeah. I'll beat you to a pulp

31
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:42,954
and resign.

32
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,543
It will really be
abuse of authority this time.

33
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,296
Let go.

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,768
Daon! Stop!

35
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,023
Aren't you Judge Kang?

36
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,442
-We meet again.
-Right.

37
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,696
-Do we arrest him without a warrant?
-He has to come on his own.

38
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,158
Will you come with us
on suspicion of stalking Ms. Cha?

39
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,993
You may refuse

40
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:26,456
and can leave during the transfer.
You also have the right to an attorney.

41
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,166
What'll it be? Clock's ticking.

42
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,627
I'll go.

43
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,898
-Let's go.
-Where?

44
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,033
Can you get rid of that?

45
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,869
I thought you didn't believe in God.

46
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:06,955
But you have a cross in your car?

47
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,499
You don't believe in God
but want to go to Heaven?

48
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,583
Is that it?

49
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,211
I don't want to go to Heaven.

50
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,838
You mean you can't.

51
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,675
People who raise their fists first
go to Hell.

52
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,345
And your car is weird like you.

53
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,722
Why were you at Moon Jeongjun's place?

54
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,059
To monitor him.

55
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,603
To make sure the person I released
is being good.

56
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,480
It's like a follow-up service.

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,026
-But where are we going?
-To do some follow-up service.

58
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,643
Please, let me go.

59
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,691
But can I kill
your parents instead?

60
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,652
I just asked you a question.

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,701
LOVE YOU TO DEATH

62
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,411
MINE FOREVER!

63
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,495
How pretty.

64
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,083
I'll be back. Stay pretty.

65
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,504
See the results of your ruling?

66
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,506
Are you sorry now?

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,591
Not at all.

68
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,762
Had you not released him with just a fine,

69
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,722
she wouldn't have been attacked.

70
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,226
What if I gave him one year?

71
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,228
This wouldn't have happened in a year?

72
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,731
At the very least,
the victim and her family

73
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,359
wouldn't have felt that
the law had abandoned them.

74
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,362
Your ruling was a secondary offense.

75
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,781
I merely made a ruling based on the law.

76
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,075
Stop pestering a blameless person

77
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,785
and resent the laws instead.

78
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,413
But it's you who ruled based on that law.

79
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,712
Countless people have lost their lives
from cases like this.

80
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,174
They appear in the news
and the public is outraged.

81
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,927
I'm talking about terrible crimes
and lenient punishments.

82
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,223
And everyone forgets about the dead.

83
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,225
And when someone dies again,

84
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,936
it starts all over again.

85
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,312
Is that my fault?

86
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,442
We'll apply for
an arrest warrant for Moon Jeongjun.

87
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,322
Is an arrest investigation necessary?

88
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,158
A few visits to the station
should suffice.

89
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,202
That's up to me, the detective, to decide.

90
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,999
He won't be released so easily this time.

91
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,169
Because not all judges will be like you.

92
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,768
You broke into
Ms. Cha's place, right?

93
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,021
No. Minjeong opened the door.

94
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,357
She asked you to come in?

95
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
Yes.

96
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,364
And you admit to assaulting Ms. Cha?

97
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,950
Do I have to answer this
when I'm here voluntarily?

98
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,871
Why did you bring this?

99
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:39,083
In case Minjeong needed something
to nail while I was gone.

100
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,712
After you left,
Minjeong hung herself in the living room.

101
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,674
Is she dead? No, right?

102
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,676
Didn't you want her dead?

103
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,386
What happened to Minjeong?

104
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
She's alive.

105
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,099
Please be understanding.

106
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,642
Excuse me.

107
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,935
I'm opening it. One, two...

108
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,356
Ms. Cha! Ms. Cha!

109
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,816
Ms. Cha, you can't do this!

110
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,526
Cut her down! Hurry!

111
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,986
Minjeong! Ah!

112
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,910
Oh, my God!

113
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:18,915
We told you
to come home with us.

114
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,501
Why didn't you listen to me?

115
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,668
Mom.

116
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,171
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,633
But can you please let me go?

118
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,347
I don't want to live anymore.

119
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,146
That's a relief.

120
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,731
I can't live without her.

121
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,692
She tried to die because of you.

122
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,111
She's a bit overdramatic.

123
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,532
And every couple fights.

124
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,784
Why must the state
intervene in our lovers' quarrel?

125
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,995
Fine. When you're in court,
repeat that nonsense.

126
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,082
That dating abuse
is just a lovers' quarrel.

127
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,337
It's been six hours now. Can I go?

128
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,425
-Park Donghun.
-Yes?

129
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,553
Get an arrest warrant.
Provisional measures, too.

130
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:14,637
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,639
Is an arrest investigation possible?

132
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,890
He almost killed her.

133
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,142
What kind of judge wouldn't approve it?

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,897
What the hell
is that bastard looking at?

135
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,440
I should rip his eyes out.

136
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,525
I'll get him.

137
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,610
Hey. Come here.

138
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,695
Damn it!

139
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,073
We should have
kept a closer eye on her place.

140
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,784
That was my misjudgment.

141
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,078
You did your best.

142
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,538
Eunseop's right.

143
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,248
He's the bad guy.

144
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,749
-Han Daon.
-Yes?

145
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,751
Don't let him out of your sight.

146
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,919
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,463
-Here.
-Yeah.

148
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,136
BABE, ARE YOU OKAY? I'M SO...

149
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,887
Come on. I'll take you home.

150
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,097
I'm fine.

151
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,768
I'm not.

152
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,978
Just come.

153
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,898
Darn it. He catches on quick.

154
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
Hey, Moon Jeongjun.

155
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,659
I'm going to sleep
in front of your house every night.

156
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,953
Don't even think about leaving.

157
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,609
This number is...

158
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,028
She's not home and won't pick up.
Where is she?

159
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,906
Jus... I mean, Judge Kang.

160
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,074
What happened?

161
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,577
You look terrible.
What happened last night?

162
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,037
Did you take care of it?

163
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,540
Does it look like I did? Does it?

164
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,378
Judge Kang.

165
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,713
Ah. That shower felt so good.

166
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,216
Here.

167
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,552
-Seriously?
-Right.

168
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,347
Here.

169
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,724
But what happened?

170
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,310
You didn't leave her to die, did you?

171
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,979
-She's alive.
-What?

172
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,817
Then...
It's over for this case, right?

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,361
Having a pulse doesn't mean she's alive.

174
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,240
Her mental state's all messed up,
and she has no will to live.

175
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,325
Breathing isn't living.

176
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:46,539
Still, a doctor has to determine her death
for her to be dead.

177
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,876
Are we defining life or death
by human standards?

178
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,211
Then why am I here?

179
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,213
Right. You're right.

180
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,801
Still, Moon Jeongjun
didn't kill her himself...

181
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,137
Mental murder is also murder.

182
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,513
Yes, you're right.

183
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,808
But Han Daon's the bigger problem.

184
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,728
I feel like he keeps getting in my way.

185
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
Just get rid of him, then.

186
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,400
Don't you know
I can only send those who've killed?

187
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,862
Justitia, go to the human world,

188
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,199
punish ten murderers who are unrepentant

189
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,201
and unforgiven,

190
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,747
take their lives, and send them to Hell.

191
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,166
You have one year.

192
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,712
Just leave Han Daon alone.

193
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,257
He is a pain in the butt,
but the way he challenges me

194
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
is kind of adorable.

195
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,303
Adorable? Justitia, don't tell me--

196
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,263
-No. So shut up.
-Yes.

197
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,895
Either way, this case is a fail, right?

198
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,398
If the arrest warrant is rejected,
maybe not.

199
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,819
Come on. You think
there's another terrible judge like you?

200
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,241
You really think there isn't?

201
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,166
Detective Kim,
the arrest warrant's been rejected.

202
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,709
What? Rejected?

203
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,377
-Yes.
-What's the reason?

204
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,506
He agreed to come in and cooperated.
He's not a flight risk.

205
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:22,593
Seriously?
What the hell is this crap?

206
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,471
If it were that judge's daughter,
this wouldn't happen.

207
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,432
Daon, go watch over
Ms. Cha and her family.

208
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,809
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,394
JUDGE KANG BITNA

210
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,327
Can you see me?

211
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,746
Yes, I can see you.

212
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:59,213
We checked the cameras
at Ms. Cha's apartment.

213
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,300
Insulation tape was stuck
on the outer lens, making it not visible.

214
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,054
I'll be in the area at night
for the time being.

215
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,390
If anyone comes by, don't let them in,

216
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,599
and give me a call.

217
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,353
I'll leave once I make sure
you've locked the door.

218
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,356
Okay, thank you.

219
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:18,691
Goodbye.

220
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,280
It's Detective Han Daon.

221
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,118
What is it, Minjeong?

222
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,496
I couldn't see then too.

223
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,791
And he said he was an officer.

224
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,210
It's him!

225
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,087
He's here to kill you guys!

226
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,546
It's all right.

227
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,175
Honey, call the detective now!

228
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,262
Why aren't you calling him?

229
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:16,934
If I do,

230
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,061
we'll be safe for today.

231
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:23,607
But even if he gets a prison sentence,
he'll be back out again.

232
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,527
How long do you think
the police can protect us?

233
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,281
-Mom, untie me.
-No.

234
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,741
Dad, I'll go take care of it.

235
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,077
I'll go out.

236
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,620
Untie me!

237
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,082
Minjeong, look at me!

238
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,167
What did I say when I brought you home?

239
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,295
I promised I'd protect you
no matter what, didn't I?

240
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,968
No one can protect me, Dad.

241
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,186
Honey! Take her to the bedroom
and lock the door.

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,315
And don't come out
no matter what you hear.

243
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,652
Once it quiets down,
call the police. Okay?

244
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,199
-Hurry, go!
-No.

245
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,951
-Get inside.
-Dad!

246
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,786
-Come here.
-Dad!

247
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,330
-Let go!
-Minjeong, get in!

248
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,042
-Minjeong, please!
-No, Dad!

249
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,293
-Get in!
-Dad!

250
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,403
No!

251
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,322
Sir, calm down.

252
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,714
I'm sorry, Detective.

253
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,603
This is a smart watch.
You can each wear one.

254
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,814
When you press the SOS button--

255
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,190
It's my fault.

256
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:33,153
Mom and Dad almost died because of me.

257
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,114
It's not your fault.

258
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,788
But everyone says it's my fault.

259
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,290
That I have terrible taste in men.

260
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,084
That I dated the wrong guy

261
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,921
and I don't even know
how to end the relationship.

262
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,673
All this won't work.

263
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,925
It ends only when I'm dead.

264
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,557
Excuse me for a moment.

265
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,605
Yeah, what is it?

266
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,607
Daon, Moon Jeongjun's dead.

267
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,109
What?

268
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,997
The Judge from Hell

269
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,584
Justitia,
did something good happen?

270
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,377
You're glowing today.

271
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,382
Yes, the trial ended very well.

272
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,551
JUDGE'S OFFICE

273
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,762
-From the day before yesterday.
-What should I have for lunch?

274
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,357
12 HOURS AGO

275
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,951
Jeongjun, it's me, Minjeong.

276
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,288
Meet me at 323-21 in Hwangcheon-dong
at midnight tonight.

277
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,332
You want to talk in person?

278
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,168
It's too late.
I'm going to kill your parents first.

279
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,045
If you keep this up,
I'm calling the police.

280
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,671
The police? Go ahead.

281
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,341
What's a few months in prison?

282
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,218
Don't be like that. Let's meet.

283
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm the one you want anyways.

284
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,054
Hey.

285
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,557
I know you're plotting with the police
to lure me out there.

286
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,767
I'm not.

287
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,143
Then get down here now.

288
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,438
I can't. My parents are still up.
And the police are watching.

289
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,233
See you there at midnight.
We'll talk then.

290
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,913
THE GREATCOAT
GIACOMO PUCCINI

291
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,866
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT

292
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,101
DEMOLISH

293
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,948
Minjeong, let's play

294
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,195
Judge Kang?

295
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,366
What are you doing here?

296
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,119
What do you think?
I'm here to kill you.

297
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
What?

298
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,000
Where are you hiding? Get out now.

299
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,714
Gosh. I'm so tired.

300
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,426
Seriously?

301
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,223
Can I go home now?

302
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,225
Yes.

303
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,185
Good work today.

304
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,855
I had to work late...

305
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:21,233
...because of you.

306
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,281
Your real trial starts now.

307
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,498
Do you admit that you, sinner
Moon Jeongjun, murdered Cha Minjeong

308
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,000
and yet are unrepentant and unforgiven?

309
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,629
Minjeong's not dead.

310
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,756
And Minjeong's already forgiven me.

311
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,884
I'll be the one to judge
if she's dead, if she's forgiven you,

312
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,054
and if you really are repentant.

313
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,639
Let me ask you again.

314
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,725
Do you admit to your crimes?

315
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,727
You gave me the fine.

316
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,273
It's all over now. Why are you doing this?

317
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,949
I told you.

318
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,076
This is your real trial.

319
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,203
I've never killed anyone.

320
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,582
I'm going to report you
for attempted murder.

321
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,951
What the hell?

322
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,913
Welcome to my world.

323
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,340
You are about to be
on the receiving end of what you've done.

324
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,177
That's the rule in Hell. Understood?

325
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,138
Yes.

326
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,810
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Bitna.

327
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,573
Wow, I'm full.

328
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:35,200
Already?

329
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,868
Have more, babe.

330
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,787
I'm full. I'm done.

331
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,291
-Are you ignoring me right now?
-What?

332
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,211
No, I'm not...

333
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,047
I said eat.

334
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,554
Eat.

335
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,472
Eat.

336
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,141
Eat. I said eat.

337
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,020
Are you crazy?

338
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,773
Are you crazy?

339
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,567
Why aren't you doing what I say?

340
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:14,739
Sorry, I won't do it again.

341
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,075
You know I can't live without you, right?

342
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,331
I'd rather die than break up with you.

343
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,666
I'll kill myself.

344
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,626
Hey, stop it!

345
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,253
Just put it down first!

346
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,344
Don't ever ask to break up again.

347
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,432
I can't live without you, okay?

348
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,227
Hmm?

349
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,150
Let's break up.

350
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,658
Break up?

351
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,164
So, is this...

352
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,374
a goodbye party?

353
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,294
What you did that day,

354
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,046
it's too creepy.

355
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,756
Let's end this.

356
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,970
I was trying to be nice until now!

357
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,390
I told you

358
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,602
not to ask to break up ever again.

359
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,540
For God's sake.

360
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,171
I kept this here just in case.

361
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,881
I'm finally using it.

362
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,550
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

363
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,760
Stop.

364
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,303
Stop?

365
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,597
This is only the beginning.

366
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,226
I think I'm going to die.

367
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:07,560
Please hurry up.

368
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,815
-Honey, open the door.
-Please come quick!

369
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,316
Open the door.

370
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,081
Honey, stay well until we meet again.

371
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,010
Hey...

372
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,179
You're home.

373
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,224
I've been released.
Why didn't you tell me you moved?

374
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,476
How did you find me?

375
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,812
How did you even get in?

376
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,566
If you press that,
I'll end up back in prison.

377
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,069
It'll probably be a year this time.

378
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,195
But you know what?

379
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,240
Next time I come back out again...

380
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,201
I'm going to kill you.

381
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:08,997
Come in.

382
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,291
Hurry.

383
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,670
I'm making braised tofu
to celebrate my release. Oh, wait.

384
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,675
For betraying me and calling the police.

385
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:29,184
Oh, my.
You're hair's so long now, babe.

386
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,978
I learned how to cut hair inside.

387
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,855
I'll cut you after we eat.

388
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,649
I mean, your hair.

389
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:39,736
I won't...

390
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:41,905
call the police.

391
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:44,324
I'll give you whatever you want.
Money or anything.

392
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,326
So please, let's break up.

393
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,622
I told you not to ask me that.

394
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,168
All I want is you.

395
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,587
But why do you keep asking to break up?

396
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,507
I told you not to ask me
to break up again.

397
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,343
Why do you keep ignoring me?

398
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,887
Why won't you do what I say?
Why?

399
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,390
Please just let me go. I'm begging you.

400
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,943
Fine. I'll let you go.

401
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,905
Go.

402
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,376
You'll never be free of me.

403
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:38,503
Until you die.

404
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,468
I love you, babe.

405
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,935
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

406
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,021
Babe, are you okay? Does it hurt a lot?

407
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,524
So why didn't you just listen to me?

408
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,651
Sorry, I made a mistake.

409
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:05,196
Babe, where are you going?

410
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,699
Oh, no.
It must have hurt so bad.

411
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,335
Babe, open the door.

412
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,337
The longer you take,
the worse it'll be for you.

413
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,131
Babe.

414
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,675
No.

415
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,093
Babe.

416
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,055
Open up before I get the bat again.

417
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:37,937
Babe.

418
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,025
Open the door now. Come on.

419
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,780
Do you really think you can escape me?

420
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,491
You're mine forever.

421
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,912
I love you to death.

422
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,546
Don't feel good?

423
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,801
I feel nauseous, too. But I had no choice.
This is part of the trial.

424
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,887
Those who do not admit their crimes,

425
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,015
shall feel the same pain
experienced by the victim and more

426
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,601
before the trial can resume again.

427
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,686
Hell?

428
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,689
I'm here to take care of guys like you.

429
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,899
A demon from Hell.

430
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,443
So,

431
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:29,238
a crazy demon from Hell is here
to seek revenge for Minjeong?

432
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:33,701
Wrong. I don't do anything for humans.

433
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,996
I only take care of
disgusting murderers like you.

434
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,208
-Minjeong's still alive.
-No.

435
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,753
The night you trampled on her soul,
she was already dead.

436
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,054
That's ridiculous.

437
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,184
I told you before.

438
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,728
I'm the judge who decides
what's ridiculous or not.

439
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,272
Gosh, I'm being too nice today.

440
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:05,274
Shall I make a judgement now?

441
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,069
I was wrong, Your Honor.

442
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,487
Please forgive me this once.

443
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,948
I just don't get it.

444
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,201
Why do humans ask judges
to forgive them for crimes

445
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,245
they've inflicted on others?

446
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,832
Please, let me go.

447
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,583
Mmm...

448
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,131
Yeah, I'm still in trial.

449
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,425
Is the clean-up crew on standby?

450
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,301
They know the address?

451
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:48,234
Don't do something you'll regret.

452
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,737
You'll be the one
to regret, you bitch!

453
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,656
Die! Die.

454
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,827
I'm going to kill you
and Minjeong and her parents. All of them.

455
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,787
So die!

456
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,582
Die!

457
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,756
Having fun?

458
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,026
I couldn't control my strength.
Sorry.

459
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,160
From now on,
I'm going to hit you the human way.

460
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,332
Let go!

461
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,021
How fun. Go for it again.

462
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,240
Die!

463
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,631
I hit you only
a fraction of how much you hit her.

464
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,174
But you're down already?

465
00:36:58,257 --> 00:36:59,258
Get up.

466
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,344
Please, stop.

467
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,346
Cha Minjeong asked you the same thing.

468
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,139
"Please, stop."

469
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,268
Please forgive me this once.

470
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,272
Don't you pity me?

471
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,942
I was wrong, Your Honor.

472
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,070
You were?

473
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,322
Yes.

474
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,162
Do you admit
Cha Minjeong is dead because of you?

475
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:30,289
Yes.

476
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,417
If not for me,
she wouldn't have tried to kill herself.

477
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,546
But you know
she hasn't forgiven you, right?

478
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,008
Of course. I wouldn't forgive me either.

479
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,762
Are you really remorseful?

480
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,057
Yes, I really am.

481
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,642
Mmm.

482
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,020
And you admit you deserve

483
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,564
to die?

484
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,069
Yes, I deserve to die.

485
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,575
Then die.

486
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,207
Go to Hell.

487
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,663
Gehenna!

488
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,201
Court is adjourned.

489
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,667
Isn't that just harassment?

490
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,297
You're here.

491
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,467
Hey.

492
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,677
Really? That's gross.

493
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,319
What's that on his forehead?

494
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,784
Looks like he was killed inside
and dragged out here.

495
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,369
You're right.

496
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,081
Why would they leave the body
where everyone can see it?

497
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,626
Maybe they wanted
to dump it somewhere far but gave up

498
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,628
or to display the brutality.

499
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,050
There are no bloodstains from here.

500
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,475
Way too clean, right?

501
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,477
Yes.

502
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,647
Doesn't seem like a murder scene.

503
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:45,151
Of course, it's clean.

504
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,236
They've been cleaning forever.

505
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,071
They're complete professionals.

506
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,406
Are they that good?

507
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:53,784
Of course. They're the go-to guys
in Seoul and Gyeonggi regions.

508
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,413
Anyway, they've got
a good reputation in Hell.

509
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,167
-But why haven't I heard of them?
-What?

510
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,253
Well, you don't really
care about underlings.

511
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,881
They're at the bottom
of the chain in Hell.

512
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,507
I'm an egalitarian, okay?

513
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,178
You have a tendency to overstate my evil.

514
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,054
I'm not overstating, it's a fact...

515
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,682
I mean...

516
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,142
Take it.

517
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,605
Justitia,

518
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,191
the police will be scratching their heads
thanks to these guys.

519
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,026
SERGEANT CLEANING

520
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,076
I'll clean the traces
of Justitia still left on the body.

521
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,877
This area is
completely destroyed, too.

522
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,348
Oh, right.

523
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:58,557
You know,

524
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,810
when I told them that you ordered the job,

525
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,647
they said they were completely honored.

526
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,066
And promised to be
extra meticulous.

527
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,072
Mmm. Let's go.

528
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,699
Get every crack and crevice today.

529
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,578
Justitia is a total pain.

530
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,080
If we make a mistake,

531
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,957
she'll have our heads.

532
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,793
I heard she's a complete nutjob.

533
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:30,089
But we can clean up the body for her.

534
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:33,217
Why did she ask us
to drag it out to the front door?

535
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,219
-Because she's a pain.
-Is she sick?

536
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,595
I wanted to show them

537
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:38,347
what happens to bad guys.

538
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,268
But the police will see it, too.

539
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,396
Hmm. Yeah, I wanted them to.

540
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,233
Watching them muddle about,
unable to find any clues...

541
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,359
It's fun.

542
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,862
Darn it.

543
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,198
It's dangerous.

544
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,744
It doesn't all fit!

545
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,252
You'll break the car!

546
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,256
The National Forensic Service
sent Moon Jeongjun's autopsy report.

547
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,966
There are multiple fractures,

548
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,552
but the cause of death is heavy bleeding.

549
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,178
The stab to his abdomen.

550
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,723
Where was Moon Jeongjun last seen?

551
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,518
By the entrance
of Ms. Cha's apartment complex.

552
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,271
He was caught on camera
talking on the phone with someone.

553
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:30,441
Three hours later, he got off a taxi
at Nobong intersection.

554
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,694
And then he was seen
walking towards Hwangcheon-dong.

555
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,822
I got his messaging history
and call logs from that time.

556
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,450
The last person he was in contact with

557
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,744
was using a burner phone.

558
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,456
Were there any people or cars
that approached there around that time?

559
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:48,792
That neighborhood is a redevelopment site,
so there are no cameras.

560
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:53,005
There's no one else
besides the villa residents.

561
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,089
WHO SPOKE WITH HIM LAST?

562
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,883
They were determined.

563
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,760
Request search dog assistance.

564
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,094
-Check all the empty homes.
-Yes.

565
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:00,262
-Yes.
-Yes, ma'am.

566
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:02,806
And did you look into the scar
left on Moon's forehead?

567
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,726
Yes. It's here.

568
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,647
I can't get used to that.

569
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,607
Flip the photo left and right.

570
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,491
It means "Hell" in ancient Greek.

571
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,993
In Latin,
there's a letter "H" in the middle.

572
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,579
-So it's read, "Gehenna."
-Gehenna? Wow.

573
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:30,209
Wow. Who on earth
kills someone and brands them

574
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,877
with the word "Hell"?

575
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,379
Gehenna...

576
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:35,422
Hell.

577
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,681
It's a lot, right?

578
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,393
I can see why judges die from overwork.

579
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,521
To kill just one person,
I read all those case files all night.

580
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,856
But I still have nine left.

581
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,069
Justitia, I...

582
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,155
I thought about it.

583
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,536
We can select bad guys through trials
because this is a criminal court.

584
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,620
But...

585
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:10,749
there's another place
teeming with bad guys as much as here.

586
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:12,626
The police station?

587
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,920
Become a policewoman?

588
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,840
No, you don't have to
become a police officer.

589
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,259
You can also do it
through a policeman you know.

590
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,970
That man Han Daon who you said was cute?

591
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,724
He won't tell me anything.
He doesn't like me.

592
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,142
Well, obviously.

593
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,018
He'd have to be crazy to like you.

594
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,729
Or...

595
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,109
Well...

596
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,236
So, what I'm saying is,

597
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,322
maybe you can try
getting on the detective's good side.

598
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,782
Forget it.

599
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,950
I can find it myself.

600
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,622
-Yes?
-The chief judge asked for you.

601
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,291
He's really mad. I wonder what it is.

602
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,793
What could I have done to make him--

603
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,839
Huh. She's so rude.

604
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,300
But what's up with that guy?

605
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,304
Find something.

606
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,351
I, who you'd have to be crazy to like,

607
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,103
am leaving.

608
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,693
CHIEF JUDGE'S OFFICE

609
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:21,361
Judge Kang.

610
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,946
Moon Jeongjun.

611
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,617
How could you release him
with a mere fine?

612
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,701
At the very least

613
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,162
It should've been based on common sense.

614
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,832
Since when have judges
judged with their common sense?

615
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:34,917
What?

616
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,878
Are you going to take responsibility

617
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,631
if the defendant retaliates
against the victim?

618
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,550
What if I do?

619
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,432
Judge Kang, I know
it was a traumatic accident.

620
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,810
And that you're like this because of it.

621
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,812
But if you keep causing trouble like this,

622
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:57,189
there's only so much
I can cover up for you.

623
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,983
If you're a judge,
you should act like one.

624
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,568
And not only in trials...

625
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,737
Those loud outfits
and that disheveled hair.

626
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,572
And your makeup. Change it.

627
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,865
Understand what I'm saying?

628
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,285
But I'm dressed very elegantly.

629
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,663
Only respond with "Yes" or "No"!

630
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,081
No!

631
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,839
Gosh, my head.

632
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,466
Am I unwell?

633
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,262
If not for Assemblyman Jeong,

634
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:31,265
I'd banish her to the countryside.

635
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,349
ASSEMBLYMAN JEONG JAEGEOL

636
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,810
Oh, no. It's Assemblyman Jeong.

637
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,941
I heard you got an earful from the chief.

638
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,237
Is it just me,
or do you seem really happy about that?

639
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,281
Or course, I'm not happy.

640
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,742
You were in there for only ten minutes.
He let you off easy.

641
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,161
Who is this Assemblyman Jeong?

642
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,706
Is he my sponsor or something?

643
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,666
There he is.

644
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:01,044
...volunteered serving
free meals at a homeless shelter.

645
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:05,132
To help them rejoin society,
Assemblyman Jeong...

646
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,884
I don't know who that is.

647
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:10,053
Seriously? You don't remember
Assemblyman Jeong?

648
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,098
You can forget your parents,
but you should remember him.

649
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,018
You don't remember
breaking off the engagement?

650
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,061
Oh, my.

651
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,232
I broke off the engagement
with this Assemblyman Jeong?

652
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:25,569
Not with him. With his son.

653
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:26,904
His oldest son, I think.

654
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,363
Of course he was the oldest son.

655
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,907
His second son is a scumbag.

656
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:34,202
I guess I've been
too indifferent to myself.

657
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,887
Seonho, you look good.

658
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,430
Yes, I probably do.

659
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,765
I'm off drugs now.

660
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:55,891
Seonho.

661
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,731
How is Judge Kang doing?

662
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:08,904
She's your ex-fiance. Why haven't you
checked in on her at all?

663
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,239
Well...

664
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,117
I'm sure he's busy with work.
He doesn't have time.

665
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:18,038
I hear you're really busy with
the redevelopment of Hwangcheon-dong.

666
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,958
I saw it on the news.

667
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:29,132
I heard Judge Kang lost her memories
because of the incident.

668
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,593
Apparently, she's lost
most of her memories.

669
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:34,304
She's a different person now.

670
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,101
Please watch over her.

671
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,894
Of course. I've been

672
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:45,315
watching over her closely
like a mother hen looking after her eggs.

673
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:51,571
You should make the time
to ask after her yourself.

674
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,490
I will.

675
00:49:57,035 --> 00:50:00,038
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT
WITHOUT RESIDENT CONSENT!

676
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,373
Should I drive if you're tired?

677
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,044
I have too much left to pay
in installments to let you drive it.

678
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,546
Then step on it more.

679
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,717
If you were going to drive this slow,
why buy a sports car?

680
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,885
You have to drive slow in alleys.
Don't you know?

681
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,180
But why is this neighborhood so dark?

682
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,600
I hope that's all it is.

683
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,478
There are no cameras here,
so it's a scary neighborhood.

684
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,814
That's how I was able to send one.

685
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,191
I know it's going to be redeveloped,

686
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:29,901
but it's too run-down.

687
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,904
If only someone hadn't spent
all her salary

688
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,324
and racked up credit card debt
to shop at high-end brands--

689
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,453
Keep talking, and I'll redevelop
that mouth of yours.

690
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:53,467
Why do humans think
being a judge is so great?

691
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,011
They work overtime every day
and still get criticized.

692
00:50:56,636 --> 00:50:59,014
You wouldn't if you judged properly.

693
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,977
Thy mercy is even greater

694
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,772
Than life itself

695
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,482
HWANGCHEON VILLA

696
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,525
Oh, my. Shalom!

697
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:11,818
Damn it.

698
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,783
Shalom.

699
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,743
Shalo--

700
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,456
Going to church again tonight?

701
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:27,209
No, I'm picking up the elderly
from this apartment.

702
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,211
Oh, right.

703
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,755
Today's the neighborhood meeting.

704
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,257
Yes, but I won't be there.

705
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:35,675
What?

706
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,053
But there'll be snacks.

707
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:45,018
Do you think I'm the kind of person
you can win over with snacks?

708
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,103
Yes.

709
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,427
Start talking so we can go.

710
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,263
I have to go collect the recycling.

711
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,515
Gosh, what's the hurry?

712
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:24,599
All right.

713
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,603
I called an urgent meeting today
because...

714
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:33,233
Here. You can write down
your names and sign here.

715
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,860
-Here.
-Let me see.

716
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,905
This is a petition
against the redevelopment.

717
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,491
We all talk a lot about redevelopment,

718
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,576
but that's not--

719
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,954
You should stay longer.

720
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,666
You'll drone on and tell us to believe
in Jesus so we can go to Heaven.

721
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,084
Why would I?

722
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,961
Drone on?

723
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:56,590
You should take
the side dishes I made there.

724
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,634
Goodness.

725
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,553
You should all sign, too.

726
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:05,724
At first, my friends all signed yes
thinking it would be a good thing.

727
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,185
They left and lived elsewhere
for a few years.

728
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:11,021
And when they came in,
they asked for a lot of money.

729
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:12,731
Who is this redevelopment for?

730
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,650
We should really think about this.

731
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:18,445
And when they moved, things like sofas...

732
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,529
I'll defer for now.

733
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,867
I can't just sign anything
and regret it later.

734
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:28,371
Half off your rent
and no more maintenance fees.

735
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,374
That won't be enough to convince her.

736
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,961
KANG BITNA

737
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,088
Good.

738
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,634
We're now all in the same boat.

739
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:41,843
-Goodbye, then.
-What?

740
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,136
Where are you going?

741
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,431
Let's pray before you leave. Okay?

742
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:50,685
Lord, there's a woman
in her 30s who's lost her way.

743
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:52,854
Please keep our unit 201

744
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,273
as far away from Satan as possible.

745
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,609
And pave the road to Heaven--

746
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,278
I got a reply.

747
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,864
-Already?
-Yes.

748
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,699
Lord told me...

749
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,912
to go home and sleep.

750
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:13,208
Come to church with me next week--

751
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,339
That was exhausting.

752
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:23,343
Why does the landlady
have to be a church deaconess?

753
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,888
I have to kill
the remaining nine and go back.

754
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,437
Extract information using Detective Han?

755
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,356
With what? How?

756
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,026
Like that?

757
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,407
You're a genius.

758
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,581
Minjeong.

759
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,501
TOP-NOTCH NOBONG POLICE

760
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:58,211
How are you feeling?

761
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,796
I'm a lot better.

762
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,715
And I'll come back to my work.

763
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,383
That's great.

764
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,385
It's all thanks to you.

765
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,098
Actually...

766
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:14,644
Judge Kang Bitna came
to see me a few days ago.

767
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,604
Why?

768
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,939
Crying again?

769
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,695
What are you wishing for today?

770
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:26,865
And did what you wished for last time
come true?

771
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,366
What did you ask for?

772
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,744
To save them.

773
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,621
My death was inevitable.

774
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,124
So I asked Him to leave me to die

775
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:38,960
and save my innocent parents instead.

776
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:42,172
I told you.
He doesn't really grant wishes.

777
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,216
And He didn't.

778
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,677
You and your parents are all alive.

779
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,722
You didn't hear
I almost died because of you?

780
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,724
Sounds like you want me to apologize.

781
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,060
Sorry, I'm not at all apologetic.

782
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,395
Why did you come to see me?

783
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,481
The joy you feel
because Moon Jeongjun is dead

784
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,608
is only natural because you're human.

785
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,861
I came to tell you there's
no need to feel guilty about it.

786
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:10,241
But if you still feel bad,
confess everything to Him.

787
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,997
He's stingy about granting wishes.

788
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:20,251
But I heard He's generous
to those who tell Him their sins honestly.

789
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:26,299
We won't be seeing each other again.

790
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,467
Be well.

791
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,690
I still resent her.

792
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,945
But when she said
I didn't have to feel guilty,

793
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,491
it comforted me more than anything else.

794
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,159
Actually, that day...

795
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,162
I was praying for repentance.

796
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,331
Dear Lord.

797
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:02,335
I know it's terrible of me
to be glad about someone's death.

798
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:05,672
But I have been freed from the fear
that he'll come after me again

799
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:09,342
and the terror
that he might murder my family.

800
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:11,094
I'm completely free.

801
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,222
I wanted to give everything up
and take my life.

802
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,060
But I want to live again now.

803
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,189
I'm a terrible person, right?

804
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,381
What the...

805
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,927
What are you doing? That was dangerous.

806
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,680
Nothing happened. Calm down.

807
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,225
What are you doing here?
How did you know where I was?

808
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,436
Why am I here?

809
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,564
You blocked my number
and ignored my calls, so I'm here to talk.

810
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,274
How did I know where you were?

811
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,985
A detective from the station told me.
He spoke in a dialect.

812
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:11,237
He just told you I was here?

813
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,824
I said I was your girlfriend
and that I wanted to surprise you.

814
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,911
He said, "Daon is finally dating someone!"

815
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,996
He shouted a lot.

816
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,831
He gave me this address right away.

817
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,875
Why would you lie like that?

818
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,212
If you don't like that I lied, let's date.

819
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,755
Then it won't be a lie.

820
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,299
I care more about personality.

821
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:33,551
Mmm. Then I'm your perfect gal.

822
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,804
Let's talk over
some grilled pork and soju.

823
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,431
I don't want to talk to you.

824
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,559
This isn't just any pork.
It's deep scored.

825
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,520
And domestic, not imported.

826
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,938
You can have it all.

827
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,940
Really? Then that leaves me no choice.

828
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:51,236
I'll share it with the other officers
at the station tomorrow.

829
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:53,530
And I'll tell them all about just how much

830
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,698
we love each other!

831
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:01,788
Oh!

832
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,164
Gosh, it's heavy.

833
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,041
Thank you.

834
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:06,918
Ah.

835
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:11,089
Judges are buried in records,
unaware of what's happening on site.

836
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,967
But I realized watching you

837
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:18,346
that the discouragement you feel when
a hard-to-catch criminal gets off too easy

838
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,973
must be really great.

839
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,814
So I wanted to treat you to dinner.

840
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:39,617
It's not cooked yet.

841
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,369
Yes, it's rare.

842
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,956
-Give it.
-Sheesh.

843
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,253
I heard you went to see Cha Minjeong.

844
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:54,048
She told you already?
She must have really bad-mouthed me.

845
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,217
She said you comforted her.

846
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,677
I never did that.

847
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,848
I'm more curious

848
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,475
about what you think of me.

849
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,772
At first, I was grateful.

850
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,149
Then you were cool.

851
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,651
After the trial--

852
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:15,862
I'm sure you despised me. I know.

853
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,031
Then what about now?

854
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,868
I'm confused.

855
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,458
It's hard being
a violent crimes detective, isn't it?

856
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,377
Nothing in this world is easy.

857
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:39,010
Are there any cases
you just can't break these days?

858
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,846
Like maybe there's a brutal killer?

859
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:45,642
Like someone who caused someone's death
even if they didn't really kill.

860
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,269
-Cases like that?
-A lot.

861
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:51,731
Oh...

862
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,776
And among those, are any still uncaught?

863
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:55,860
Hmm...

864
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,696
-It's confidential.
-I won't tell anyone.

865
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,240
I don't have friends to tell anyways.

866
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,576
Makes sense that you don't have friends.

867
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,119
Still, no.

868
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,040
Fine.

869
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,005
Let's drink for now.

870
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:40,905
So, if there's a murderer you still
haven't caught, tell me their name.

871
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:43,449
I don't need many. Just nine.
Or even just one.

872
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,119
I'm just curious, please?

873
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:47,662
Hmm...

874
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,956
Fine. But...

875
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:52,667
you can't tell anyone.

876
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,961
Understood.

877
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,380
What are their names?

878
01:01:58,589 --> 01:01:59,590
Han Daon.

879
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,926
I already know your name.

880
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,553
I need names of murderers.

881
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,471
I know. Han Daon.

882
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:12,311
How can a killer become a detective?
Fine, don't tell me. You're mean.

883
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,856
Why won't you believe me?

884
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,024
I've really killed before.

885
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,360
Three people, in fact.

886
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,658
Really?

887
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,286
Yes.

888
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:30,496
I stabbed them with a knife.

889
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,707
And I can still smell the blood here.

890
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:37,378
It never goes away.

891
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,339
It might have even gotten more vivid.

892
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,342
How did you become
an officer after killing three people?

893
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,552
Is that possible?

894
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,972
I was young then.

895
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,186
Do you feel bad for the people you killed?

896
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,146
They're already dead.

897
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:58,191
What's the point of apologizing now?

898
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:02,737
That's just self-consolation
to ease the guilt.

899
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,491
Did their families forgive you?

900
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,619
They said they never would.

901
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:14,749
That they'd curse me forever.

902
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,922
They said they hoped
I'd go to Hell when I died.

903
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,550
So...

904
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,095
you're admitting to your crime.

905
01:03:28,888 --> 01:03:31,808
Of course. Not just any crime.

906
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,227
It's deserving of death.

907
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,938
Do you think

908
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:39,649
I could meet with the families?

909
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,990
You're sitting next to one.

910
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:51,786
What?

911
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:55,623
Where?

912
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:58,000
Detective.

913
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,169
Get up, okay?

914
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,230
You're still here?

915
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,400
I wanted to know

916
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,861
if what you said last night is true.

917
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,697
What did I say last night?

918
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,578
Can you keep it a secret?

919
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:19,749
So it's true.

920
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,128
Don't worry, your secret's safe with me.

921
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,963
Thank you.

922
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:31,010
Everyone says I'm not normal
because of the incident.

923
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,720
Despite knowing about that,

924
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:36,015
you're the first human to look at me,
a demon, without judgement.

925
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:38,851
And you have convictions

926
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:42,855
not easily found in other humans.

927
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,565
The conviction

928
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,944
or tenacity
to do what you believe is right,

929
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,571
no matter the cost.

930
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,531
That's why I like you.

931
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,201
And also because you're cute.

932
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:58,162
Oh, I see.

933
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:01,248
Either way, thanks.

934
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:03,793
Sure.

935
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:07,505
-Your hand.
-What?

936
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,674
I said I'd take you on a walk.

937
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,302
Do you need a treat first?

938
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:15,012
Uh...

939
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:19,767
Where do you want to walk?

940
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,734
To Hell.

941
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:46,437
The Judge from Hell

942
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,731
Gehenna.

943
01:08:05,831 --> 01:08:09,835
You, Justitia, will be punished
for the wrong judgement.

944
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,713
If you object to the punishment,
I will kill you.

945
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,049
Do we know each other?

946
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:17,676
Justitia?

947
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,388
Can you tell me what happened on this day?

948
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:25,017
Bring back my son!
Bring me my son back!

949
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:30,397
My mother-in-law's demanding she
have the death benefit under Jiho's name.

950
01:08:30,481 --> 01:08:31,607
Dad!

951
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:34,193
No my Jiho. He's my son.

952
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,653
Where's the boy?

953
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,197
He's at an orphanage
because they said I can't raise him.

954
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,573
She abandoned him?

955
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,742
Jiho, are you home?

956
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,120
He's dead.

957
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,581
And bad adults must be punished.

958
