If you really want chocolate, sir,

00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,808
My standards are rising now,
but I think I'm also out of luck.

637
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,145
So keep an eye on it.

638
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,898
That guy's my pension, all right?

639
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,441
[man chuckles]

640
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,069
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

641
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,290
[Yeo-jeong] Do you still feel sick?

642
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,920
Maybe I drove too recklessly.

643
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,592
I have a question.

644
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:09,517
Before you even saw
the pictures up on my walls of them,

645
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,353
you already knew about Myeong-o.

646
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,398
Why didn't you tell me?

647
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,817
Why didn't you ask me anything?

648
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,902
Did you think I killed him?

649
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:29,036
Executioners don't question those above.

650
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,998
It all comes to the same conclusion.

651
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:36,585
I don't care if you killed him,
and I don't care if you didn't kill him.

652
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,631
Whether you want a corpse
or the evidence destroyed,

653
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,634
I'm here to do whatever you want.

654
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,681
Who am I to you?

655
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,434
Why do you want to do this for me?
What makes you so sure?

656
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,894
This is so much deeper than "sure."

657
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,648
I've already told you before.

658
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,776
I had a very rough period of my life.

659
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,572
And I realized when I tutored you…

660
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,658
"Oh, this woman…"

661
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:09,660
"She can save me."

662
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,163
[sweeping, emotional music playing]

663
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,754
Well, at some point, we all get to choose
what kind of person we'll become.

664
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,508
I've chosen to become
the one who's your partner in crime.

665
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,178
It suits me as well.

666
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,642
Anyone ever tell you you're crazy?

667
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:35,603
As crazy as you need.

668
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:38,439
Will you let me?

669
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,947
[Dong-eun] <i>I wonder</i>
<i>which one of us will cause</i>

670
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,076
<i>an unpredictable swell</i>
<i>with our hope, Yeon-jin.</i>

671
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,173
[tense, dramatic music playing]

672
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,993
YEONGSAN FUNERAL HOME

673
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,745
[man] Hello! Welcome.

674
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,764
[dark, brooding outro music playing]
