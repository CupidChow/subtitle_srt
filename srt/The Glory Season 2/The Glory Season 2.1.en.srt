[Sa-ra] You expect us to believe that?

No one's willing to say it,

who did something to So-hee.

I think you should shut up now.

[Hye-jeong] So then,

Any idea how hard a membership

Hey, I didn't win this
in just any gambling match, either.

[woman] How'd you wrap it up?

502
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:57,702
It was deemed nothing more than a suicide.

PARK YEON-JIN

00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,382
I should burn this.

508
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,133
It's bad luck.

509
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,720
[Dong-eun] Back then, I was far too naive.

510
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,890
I thought they would
reopen the investigation

511
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,892
if additional evidence was discovered,

512
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,310
but nothing ever happened.

513
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:26,439
Even the name tag wasn't
in the evidence list.

514
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,025
Then the name tag you had wasn't real.

515
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:31,945
So why did you tell Mr. Son
that you had it?

516
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,823
Because Myeong-o didn't know
it wasn't real.

517
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,785
I just needed some bait
to get him to start swimming.

518
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:42,372
Where exactly did you want Mr. Son to go?

519
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,417
To Yeon-jin.

520
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,002
Hmm.

521
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,172
You've been repeating yourself
this entire time.

522
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,674
The weather reporter, Park Yeon-jin,

523
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,176
was somehow involved
in Mr. Son's disappearance,

524
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,680
but you have no evidence
to support this claim. Am I right?

525
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,184
I have to give you the proof too?
After I turned in this report?

526
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,895
Ninety-nine percent
of reports like these are lies.

527
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:09,274
And defamation is a very serious crime.

528
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:14,654
Now, all I want to know is
if Mr. Son had anything to do with drugs.

529
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,406
Do you know anything about that?

530
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,743
I'll think about it.

531
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,912
All I want to know is,
do you know something or not?

532
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:25,957
I don't know if this is defamation or not,

533
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,459
so I'll think about it.

534
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,795
After all, I shouldn't commit
such a serious crime.

535
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,469
And what about the name tag?

536
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,055
Didn't they send it to you then?

537
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,975
If it was dropped off at the station,
there has to be a witness.

538
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,062
Did you even try
and conduct an investigation?

539
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,146
[chuckles]

540
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,317
You're mad I wasn't investigating?

541
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,320
You're asking me why I didn't
make your problem even bigger?

542
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,656
Do you want me to really live in fear?

543
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,991
What if they turn themselves in?

544
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,910
After all this time?

545
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,954
You said it. They were anonymous.

546
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:07,499
If they were going to show up,
they would've done it back then.

547
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,417
But what if there's more evidence?

548
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:12,587
What if the witness
suddenly goes crazy now

549
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,006
and decides they need
to be a hero tomorrow?

550
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,180
It's been 18 years.

551
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,141
Your mother got rid of
the name tag long ago.

552
00:36:25,225 --> 00:36:26,434
Only the corpse remains.

553
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:29,479
And that corpse has been
in the mortuary, rotting away.

554
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:33,733
Even if they were to reinvestigate,
the case is already ruled as a suicide.

555
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:39,656
Even if they somehow came back to life,
there's no way anyone can overturn it!

was a very good man.

637
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,588
So kind and warm-hearted.

638
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:49,507
But then,

639
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,012
blindly acting with good intentions
only brings false glory.

640
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,430
Nothing more.

641
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,185
I always thought
you took after your father,

642
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,645
but now I see I was wrong.

643
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:04,147
You're more like me.

644
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,360
You wanna help her?

645
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:14,615
Then keep it secret.

646
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:18,244
If this is what you really want to do,

647
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,080
I'm not going to stop you.

So Yeon-jin really broke into your house?

651
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:36,095
Oh my God.

652
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,680
Did she take anything?

653
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,183
What do I have
that she'd want to steal from me?

654
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,186
I only asked for your help
'cause I was worried about this.

655
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:44,979
Really? What is it?

656
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,815
So-hee's incident report.

657
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:50,943
This is the reason
why I shared everything with Myeong-o.

658
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,239
But how did you get your hands on this?

This is the autopsy report
for Yoon So-hee.

It was performed here.

EIGHT WEEKS INTO PREGNANCY

673
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:53,381
Yoon So-hee

674
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,175
was eight week pregnant.

675
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,427
So-hee was pregnant?

676
00:43:59,053 --> 00:43:59,887
Yeah.

677
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:04,684
That's why I asked them
to get the incident report for me.

678
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:08,855
I want to bring So-hee back home.

679
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,860
I'm going to get it for her.
I'm avenging her.

680
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:19,740
I think that may be why I'm still alive.

681
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:23,327
So many times I have wanted to die.

682
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,374
You won't believe me,

683
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,795
but I feel So-hee
was helping me fall asleep.

684
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,009
Because she's with me, I feel strong now.

685
00:44:39,177 --> 00:44:40,178
I just…

686
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,517
You poor thing, Dong-eun.

687
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,355
I feel horrible for you and So-hee.

That ship's totally off-course.

693
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,976
So think carefully, Dong-eun.

694
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,479
What if I decide to switch teams on you?

695

I mean, even for you…

696
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,858
the odds are one against four.

697
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,320
I mean, they're all murderers.

698
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,240
Those four killed So-hee.

699
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,784
The only one innocent is me, right?

700

What am I guilty of?

703
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,917
A sin that warrants being ripped apart.

704

Don't forget,
I've already fought five to one.

Ah, shit. Damn it.
