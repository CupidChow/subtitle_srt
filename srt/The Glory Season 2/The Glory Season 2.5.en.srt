[Gyeong-ran] What are you doing?

Jae-jun called to ask
about the security camera.

00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,731
He wants to know
who changed the hard drive and why.

He took it with him
to have it examined by an expert.

I hear it's better to change it, right?

Do-yeong can just be so meticulous.

I didn't know that.

This is a heartbreaking life.

Yeah. When she was young,
she was bullied at school very badly.

358
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:57,496
I must soothe her.
She was born to such a terrible destiny.

This destiny is not yours. Whose is it?

Uh, I guess even a shaman
can't figure that out?

The General wants to perform a ritual.

He's asking for a very,
very big ritual to be performed.

The ritual will have to be very big.

Of course.

Good work, Mom.
You did it. You got what you wanted.

640
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,398
I quit my job at the school.

641
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,984
I'm coming over, and I want you out.

642
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,158
[Choi] Excuse me, Ms. Park?

643
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:21,951
I'm not doing interviews.

644
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,452
[Choi] I'm from the police.

645
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,254
You're hard to get ahold of.

646
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,091
I know you check your text messages,
but you never returned my calls.

647
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,552
How can I help the police?

648
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:42,430
The night of October 19th,
can you tell me where you were?

649
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,100
[Yeon-jin] <i>A detective came,</i>

I told him I was broadcasting,
but what do I do now?

653
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,567
Did you know
they were starting an investigation?

654
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,653
You didn't check, did you?
Can you stop this or what?

655
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:00,531
No.

656
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:02,783
No, I can't.

657

What the hell have you been doing?

658
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,248
Are you done?

659
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,543
For one second, let's not talk about you.

660
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,756
I'm retiring.

661

I want to move somewhere warm
and play golf all day.

662

I've heard Hawaii's pretty cool.

You decided to retire? In this mess?

00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:29,352
Messy as it is,

666
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,438
I can retire on someone else's dime now.

667
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,906
Why should I leave, huh?

668
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,575
I'm not going anywhere!

669
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:49,205
Try to make me leave,
you fucking bitch! Try!

670
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,582
Why the hell did you quit your job?

671
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:55,294
You could have made so much money
if you just held out!

672
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,172
Do whatever the fuck you want,

673
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,842
because you could never be
a teacher anyways.

674
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,053
Fuck you, you stupid bitch.

675
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:09,809
And I see you. I see the way
you look at my boyfriend.

676

How dare you try
to steal my man, you bitch!

677
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:18,985
He left because he's a nice guy,
way better than you deserve.

678
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:21,070
But I swear if you were anyone else,

679
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,199
I would've slapped you across the face.

680

God, I never should have had you.

681
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:31,163
Everyone told me to get an abortion,

682
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:34,083
but I gave birth to you anyway,

683
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,961
and I gave you everything!

684
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,463
I'm sorry!

685
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,632
I'm sorry!

Get out!

Fuck you, you little fucking whore!

691
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,233
I should've killed you.

Kill me! Do it!

From the kindness of your heart,
of course. It's only fair.
