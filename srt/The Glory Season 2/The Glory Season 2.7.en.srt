The driver came here herself,
in order to reach a form of settlement.

There won't be a settlement.
I'm not settling.

[lawyer] Ma'am, please reconsider.

171

Since the road was so wet,
the driver couldn't see him coming.

we can meet and talk about this.

I'm not going to settle.

I knew Lee Seok-jae, and I know
you hired someone to have him killed.

He didn't. I came on my own.

Park Yeon-jin murdered Yoon So-hee,

206

and how Shin Yeong-jun
cleaned up after her.

You have Yeon-jn's nametag, don't you?

I know you kept it at the shaman's shrine.

All I want is for you
to turn it in as evidence.

or will you turn over the nametag

and you'll only be charged
with manslaughter?
