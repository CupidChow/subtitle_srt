I guess Hawaii's not in the cards for you.

We had ramen earlier, so we're good.

God, you guys can't survive

Still working with Yeon-jin?

Yeah, for a little pocket money.

51
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,209
Right. Keep up the good work.

Don't forget, no minors, okay?

[grunts] What are you talking about?

It's not my thing.

61

Just ask my daughter. She'll tell you.

62
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,289
She's a teacher.
Look at my smart daughter!

63

You can trust her, can't you?

64
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,545
You were diagnosed
with alcohol dependency six years ago.

65
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,672
Are you saying you've had
nothing to drink since then?

66
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:43,969
Uh, I actually, uh, had a little glass.

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,096
Not even a full one. Basically half.

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,431
But I drank it really slow.
[imitates gurgling]

69
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,892
How much do you typically drink
once you start drinking?

70
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,811
How many bottles would you estimate?

71
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,355
[yelling blearily]
I said I don't drink, okay?

72
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,357

How dare you?!

You two are ganging up on me,
aren't you? Huh?

77
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:11,746
-Why did you start the fire?
-The fire? Come on! Hey!

78
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,499
It was really just
a tiny little burn on the floor.

79
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:19,045
I was just trying to teach my daughter
a silly little lesson, no big deal!

There are fire extinguishers everywhere.
We weren't in any danger.

81

We put the fire out right away.

You have to help me!

Say something, come on!

94
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,893
This decision is mine to make.

95
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,022
Because I am

[moans] You fucking bitch!

101
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,210
How could you do this to your own mother?!

102
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,963
I hope you rot in hell!

103
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:46,633
Get off! Let me go, you assholes!

104
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,763
I'll go with this for the flooring.
And the wallpaper, let's see…

105
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,850
So, what's going on with you and Ms. Moon?

106
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,603
Ah, you startled me. Good to see you.

107
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,106
-I didn't sneak up on you.
-[Yeo-jeong chuckles]

108
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,440
Have you chosen yet?

109
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,441
No, I haven't.

110
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,861
I'm debating if I should go with
the mid-century modern white,

111
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,115
or if I should choose something
more offbeat, like the Bauhaus grey.

112
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,700
Ugh, it's hard to pick one.

113
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,619
Oh, wow. Too much luxury for a rental!

114
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,789
You know which one he'll pick?
The most expensive one.

115
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,915
Yeah, of course!

116
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,084
You got a new tenant recently.
They leave already?

117
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,670
Oh, no. A unit caught fire.

118
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,172
Oh, I heard about that fire.
That was yours?

119
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,592
Wow, how did that happen?
Are they paying for the damages?

120
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,679
Even if they didn't, I wouldn't care.

121
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,017
I owe Ms. Moon my life,
because she saved it once.

122
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,102
[clerk] What? really?

123
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,607
[reporters clamoring]

124
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,957
[Sa-ra breathing heavily]

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,711
Here, drink this.
Tomatoes are good for detox.

126
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,965
Where's Yeon-jin? Where'd that bitch go?

127
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,551
Is that really the first thing
you're gonna say to me?

128
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,096
Can't you see how anxious I've been?
I've lost so much weight!

129
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,098
When do I have to go back?

130
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,851
You'll get a notice to return
to the station sometime next week.

131
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,936
If you cooperate with the police,

132
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,813
it gives you grounds
for a reduced sentence,

133
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,106
so it's best to show up.

134
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,941
Jesus Christ, this sucks!

135
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,360
Where's my old phone? Do you know?

136
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,614
Your old cell phone?
It's probably in your bedroom at home.

137
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:33,990
Why do you need it?

138
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,534
Important memories are on it.

139
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,621
Of one bitch in particular.

140
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,339
[Sa-ra] Let's go in there.

141

-[Sa-ra] Here.

142

-Oh, that one?
-Mm-hmm.

143
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,803
-Okay.
-Ugh, so hungry.

144
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,937
[Hye-jeong] Oh shit,
you're wearing matching clothes!

145
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,564
Oh my God, Yeon-jin.
That's so embarrassing.

146
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,776
[Sa-ra] This is so fucking cute.
You two are like besties now.

147
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,277
Let's capture this beautiful moment.

148
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,821
Shut the fuck up.

149
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,073
Hey. Hey!

150
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,497
Take it off.

151
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,082
Huh?

152
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,750
Are you fucking Deaf like your mother?

153
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,419
Don't make me repeat myself.
Take your clothes off!

00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,053

-[Sa-ra] <i>Oh my God, she's so mad.</i>
<i>-Get that out of my face!</i>

161
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,989
MY DAUGHTER WAS A VICTIM
OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE

162
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,330
BULLIED HER BY BURNING HER
WITH CURLING IRON AND CIGARETTES

163
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,834
"A" WORKS AT A BROADCASTING STATION
AS A WEATHER FORECASTER

164
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,170
[intense, somber music playing]

165
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,971
[sighs]

166
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:27,103
[Do-yeong] I keep thinking about
that statement the mother released.

167
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,272
The part of it that said,

168
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,943
"After that class, my daughter fell
from an abandoned building and died."

169
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,280
You think that's true?

170
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,741
That depends.

171
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,076
How deep are you willing
to go down this hole?

172
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,163
Do you want the truth,
or do you want to bury it?

173
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,127
[Do-yeong] Why did you quit the school?

174
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,630
Was Yeon-jin responsible for that too?

175
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,216
Not entirely.

176
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,637
I'm not that sure
that I would have made a good teacher.

177
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,146
Here's the address for her family.

178
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,606
One person lives there now.

179
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,816
It's her mother.

180
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,737
And you should know the girl's name.
Yoon So-hee.

181
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:21,991
I heard that…

182
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,578
her body's still frozen somewhere.

183
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,414
Which hospital is she in?

184
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,042
Do you want to move her?

185
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,796
Or are you willing to help me?

186
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,260
Seoul Joo General.

187
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,470
[delicate, somber music playing]

188
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,391
This here is what you asked me
to dig into the other day.

189
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,434
All the details are inside.

190
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,313
You should know, his family owns
Seoul Joo General Hospital.

191
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,277
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

192
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,909
10TH ANNIVERSARY
FAMILY OF DOCTORS BECOME PARTNERS

193
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,040
Why did you choose to protect Ye-sol?

194
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,544
You must have known that using her

195
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,629
would have been
the easiest way to torture Yeon-jin.

196
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,758
If I'd done that,
I would have hurt you too.

197
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,552
I don't want that.

198
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,767
Once you finally get revenge…

199
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,563
will you be happy?

200
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:42,196
I really hope I will.

201
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,909
I want to be happy enough that I…

202
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,413
feel like I could die.

203
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,375
That's how I want to feel
when this is over.

204
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,887
Jesus Christ, answer me, motherfucker.

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,806
-HA DO-YEONG
-LET'S MEET UP

206

[Jae-jun] <i>We need to meet.</i>

207
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,101
<i>-It's important.</i>
-[door opens]

208
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,859
I'm guessing you heard
from Hye-jeong, right?

209
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,695
About Myeong-o.

210
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,448
He was found dead.

211
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,283
Since…

212
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,620
you two are living together.

213
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,540
I heard.

214
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,047
I figured you'd be
the first person to know,

215
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,048
outside of his family.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:43,966
I mean, he did work here.

217
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,303
They said anything? The police?

218
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,892
Like anything about have they determined
his cause of death, or whatever?

219
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,103
I heard…

220
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:01,067
something about where the police found
Myeong-o's body.

221
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:03,486
Where was he found?

222
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,780
That abandoned building

223
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,198
where So-hee fell.

224
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,282
[unsettling stinger]

225
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,083
I'm really sorry, Yeon-jin.
I swear, I threw all those clothes away.

226
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,000
They're gone.

227
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,710
[Yeon-jin sighs]

228
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,005
Okay.

229
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,007
Okay?

230
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:27,593
Really? Thank you, Yeon-jin.

231
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,511
[grunts]

232
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,597
Of course you should thank me.

233
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,266
And?

234
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,351
[dark, menacing music playing]

235
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:41,399
Uh… Uh, I… I swear I'll stay
out of your way from now on.

236
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,236
Bitch, I already know you will. And?

237
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:50,032
Come on. You're not even sorry, are you?

238
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:53,119
Uh, no, I'm really so sorry,
Yeon-jin, I really am.

239
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,036
You are?

240
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,290
Then you better strip to prove it to me.

241
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,419
[Jae-jun] Here's the thing.

242
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,755
I just got my hands on a file.

243
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,757
An audio file you'll find interesting.

244
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,929
You were the last person who saw him,
weren't you? At Siesta?

245
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,561
That asshole was actually recording?

246
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,608
Oh. That must be it.

247
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,068
Hye-jeong heard it, too.

248
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,947
What was it like?

249
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,783
Pretty fucking shocking.

250
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,122
God damn it, Yeon-jin. Come on!

251
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,916
So, what are we gonna do now?

252
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:44,045
I'm still Ye-sol's mother, Jae-jun.
I'm your daughter's mom.

253
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,422
And now you finally know everything.

254
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,427
You have to save me. Save me.

255
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,221
And you have to save Ye-sol.

256
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,223
Jae-jun, you're our only hope.

257
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,851
Tell me the truth.

258
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,687
What did you do to Myeong-o?

259
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,567
It was an accident.
And I thought I took care of it.

260
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,277
I… I don't know why this is…

261
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,029
I just know Dong-eun…

262
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,364
I know she did this.

263
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:15,034
There's a doctor helping her,
whose family owns Seoul Joo General.

264
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,286
So-hee is inside there right now!

265
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,622
At Seoul Joo?

266
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,791
It feels like everything's falling apart.

267
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,336
I'm gonna leave, okay?
We can come live with you, right?

268
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,173
Ye-sol deserves better
than be the daughter of a murderer!

269
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,925
Will you say it?

270
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:36,055
I was with you
the day Myeong-o disappeared, wasn't I?

271
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,186
Yes, you were.

272
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:47,650
You know how much fun
we have when we're alone.

273
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,485
Don't you?

Where's Ye-sol, is she home?

276
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,180
Uh, your friend's here to see you.

277
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,101
Wow, that's a really
beautiful drawing, Ye-sol.

278
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,061
Want to be my artistic apprentice?

279
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:29,734
What do you say, Ye-sol?
Do you want to get high? Sound fun?

280
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,446
-[Sa-ra] Hmm?
-Get up.

281
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,908
Hey! God, what's your problem?
I meant "get hired", not "get high"!

282
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:41,912
Hey, Ye-sol! I'll make sure you get high
next time I see you, okay? Bye!

283
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,292
You psychotic bitch!

284
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,545
Wow. Shit, you're really the mother
of the fucking year, aren't you?

285
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,674
Wow, you must have spent a fortune
on lawyers. How are you out already?

286
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,259
So it was you.

287
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,219
I was just looking out for you.

288
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,473
You should be careful.
You're running out of chances.

289
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,933
Hey. I know it was you.

290
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,354
That article was
written by the same asshole

291
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,564
who wrote
all those cover stories about you.

294
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,987
That's ridiculous.

295
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,323
What's ridiculous is that I got caught

296
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,076
on the same day
people found out about your past.

297
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,953
You planted that shit
so yours would get buried.

298
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,873
Is that why they know about
the tax evasion, too?

299
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,549
Thanks for the heads-up.

300
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,760

Why would I bring you here if I was lying?

I don't care!

305

You have to fix this right now!

Before you get any ideas, you should know
I already have a crush on someone.

I have two kilometers left
to hit my daily goal.

It's been nice chatting,
but I have to get back to my run.

322

Do you go jogging often?
You take good care of your body.

323
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,825
Sorry ma'am, I told you
I have a crush on someone else.

324
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,410
You've got stamina!

325
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,039
-Stamina separates winners from losers.
-And who are you trying to beat?

326
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,876
Listen, lady, you've got the wrong guy.
I really do have a crush on someone else.

327

She's very beautiful.

Come on, you're not gonna drive away.

330
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,633
I know you're just joking.

What's this about?

336
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:19,797
I just really missed you.

337
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,217
I'm sure we just saw each other.

338
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,929
When we're apart, it feels like forever.

339
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,644
Why have my walls up
when you crash right through them?

340
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,604
Really? You still have your walls up?

341
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,773
Yeah, because you're a sweet psycho.

do you know her well?

00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,409
-Do I know her?
-Yeah.

346
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,495
I ran into her and she said
you saved her life. What happened?

347
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,999
I don't think I did.

348
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,335
I don't think I can save myself,
let alone save someone else.

349

Well, that's obvious,
because you're not that nice.

I take back "sweet."

351
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,051
Hey, can't take it back.

352
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,306

[song fades away]

355
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,236
Let me get this straight.

356
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,031
A missing body has turned up,
and you're wondering if they're gonna--

357
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:30,701
Simple yes or no,
are they gonna perform an autopsy or not?

358
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,785
[scoffs]

359
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,748
If they can't prove it was
suicide or an accident, they have to.

360
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,291
What if the family says no?

361
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,419
What if everyone
in the family's against it?

362
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:41,337
Doesn't matter.

363
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:46,008
If the police suspect foul play,
they can request a warrant for an autopsy.

364
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,676
So there'll be one.

365
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,304
And I can't stop it.

366

You're starting to scare me.

367
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,601
You never ask about anything
other than tax evasion.

368
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,227
Why are you worried about criminal law?

369
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,563
Okay. I'll find a way to deal with this.

-Hey, hey, hey, don't just leave!

Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

372

So, this might take a while.

00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,378
I can relate.

You're the first guy
who's ever had the pleasure.

I couldn't even fight back.

380

Wow, someone's getting impatient.

382

Suit yourself.

383
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:38,060
You already know this place has
a special meaning to Yeon-jin, don't you?

384
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,979
Careful what you say here.

385
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:49,321
That's a voice recording
on Myeong-o's phone from October 19th.

386
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,573
Take this and give it a listen.

387
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:55,244
You know Myeong-o.
You were looking for him, too.

388
00:24:56,245 --> 00:25:00,416
The last place he was seen alive was here.
The last person who saw him was Yeon-jin.

389
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,002
That's what I want to talk about.

Something I only realized today.

Pretty good grip on it, yeah?

And now it's gone.

397
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,230
Where is it? Where could it be?

398
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,526
Would you mind asking Yeon-jin
if she knows where it is?

399
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,240
She has very expensive taste
in murder weapons. You know?

-Yes, she is.

402
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,174
You're married to a murderer.

403
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,347
What do you want me to do?

404
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:58,724
What do you really want?

405
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,226
Should I report her to the police?

406
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,478
God, you're insane.

407
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,772
I could have done that myself.

408
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,900
We need to help her,
not fucking call it in.

409
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,527
I won't give this to the cops if you swear

410
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,863
to divorce her and give up custody.

411
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,364
That sound good?

412
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:19,995
I mean, that poor kid, she can't have
a murderer for a mother, can she?

Whether she's your daughter or mine.

What did you do?

474
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,646
There's been an accident!

475
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,524
I hit a jaywalker. He came out of nowhere!
Hurry, send an ambulance!

476
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:00,525
[Yeong-jun] Shit!

477
00:31:02,486 --> 00:31:04,529
Are you insane? Why'd you call that in?

478
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:07,574
I wasn't drunk. I wasn't speeding.

479
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,868
All the rain. It obscured my vision.

480
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,830
You're my witness,
so suck it up and help me.

481
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,416
What?

482
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,002
You really think you could play me?

483
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,005
That I wouldn't find out you two were
working together to blackmail me?

484
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,674
What the fuck are you talking about?
In order to get what?

485
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,177
He knew details about things
only we would know.

486
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,303
Who else would've told him?

487
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,306
I have no fucking idea,
but I know it wasn't me, okay?

488
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,350
Have you always been this crazy?

489
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,268
Don't lie to me.

490
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:36,978
You can't escape this.

491
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:40,107
This is happening, and you have to
find a way to protect me.

492
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,235
I still have the evidence
that proves we're in this together.

493
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,861
Yeon-jin's name tag.

494
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,406
Fuck, I could kill you!

495
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,537
You've fucking lost your mind,
haven't you?

496
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,706
That name tag would only work
against you and your daughter.

497
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,126
You plan to turn in
your daughter for murder?

498
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:03,797
How would some housewife even possess
evidence that was handed over to the cops?

499
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,466
It's still sealed,
exactly the way you gave it to me.

500
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,803
Between everyone involved,
who's the most fucked?

501
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,598
Don't you think at least one of us
left some DNA?

502
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,976
[both laughing]

503
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,769
This is fucking ridiculous.

Bitch!

505
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:22,774
What the fuck are you trying to do,
take us all down?

506
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,235
I'm just trying to get what I need

507
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,612
before you run off
like the coward you are.

508
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:31,867
You would go down with me, no matter what.

509
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,452
So take care of it.

510
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:37,289
Because whether this kills us
or we come out the other side,

511
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,331
we're in this together.

512
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,624
Right, Yeong-jun?

[dark, intense music continuing]

514

Light the candle at the shrine,
and then go bleed a chicken.

515
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:00,145
I will.

516
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,482
Also, did she come with you?

517
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:04,399

I'm sorry, the sanctum's not open,
and it's very late, so leave.

00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,955
[Dong-eun] Are you only working
with one client today?

522
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:25,295
Yeon-jin's mother is demanding.
But does that surprise you?

523
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:29,382

Wow.

527
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,465
Funny running into you here.

528
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,052
What are you doing alone in the dark?

529
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,139
I could ask you the same, Dr. Joo.

530
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,600
I was curious about the building.

531
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,812
What, you ended up here
completely at random?

532
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,814
Both times?

533
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,359
I own this property now.

534
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,780
Oh wow, no way.

535
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:38,952
I was looking for a bathroom.

536
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,455
God, even I don't believe
I can't think of a better excuse.

Open the gate!

I'm just trying to keep out trespassers.
Gotta be careful.

541
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,328
Why are you doing this?

[door opens]

543
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,503
What did you do to me the other day?

544
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,716
When you put me under, what did you do?

545
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,718
Procedures.

546
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,347
Your jawline looks more chiseled.
Really thins out your face.

547
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,601
I don't know
what that bitch has said to you,

548
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,437
but you don't know the whole story.
Stay out of it.

549
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,483
Did you know I'm also a dermatologist?

550
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,194
When I look at a wound,

551
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,905
I can see the pain
that the person wanted to inflict.

552
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,784
I know what you did.

553
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,041
You were looking for something,
weren't you?

554

Is this it?

555
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:11,920
You can take it.

556
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,547
I already have everything that I need.

00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,551
And as for the gate, you can just open it.

558
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,388
Those chains are fake.
It's not even locked.

559

Don't worry,
I won't make you pay for parking.

Because I have a feeling this is
the last time you'll get lucky.

Drive safe out there.

[Yeong-jun] <i>It was raining heavily,</i>

and that man came out of nowhere.

They ran a breathalyzer at the scene,

571
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,690
and we can confirm she was sober.

572
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,234
He was jaywalking. She wasn't negligent.

573
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,487
She didn't flee. She has no record.

574

I think we're done here.

575
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,952
Yes, I'm aware of the circumstances.

576

Unfortunately, the site
had no security cameras.

We're still trying to get in touch
with the man's family,

you're going to need to stay
a little longer.

As for you, you can head home, Chief.

Okay, good luck here.

Just try not to worry.

When it's manslaughter, try to come
to an agreement with the bereaved.

Have you already spoken to Park Yeon-jin?

Or am I here because I'm a suspect?

601

We searched Mr. Son's emails.

It seems like he was doing
a lot of research on Yoon So-hee's case.

It appears you were the one feeding him
most of his information.

And is that illegal?

What actually happened
between you and these people?

I already told you everything.
The problem was, you didn't believe me.

Somebody died yesterday.

631
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,848
It's done. We have to live for today.

632
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,600
What are you saying?

633
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:52,116
If that man still has the original file,

634
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,327
I'd suggest you make a decision soon.

635
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,333
If he chooses to leak this first,
this could be very bad for us.

636
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,717
Can you find some small town
in England or Ireland to send Ye-sol?

637
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,804
Her nanny will accompany her.

00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,315
Be careful.

641
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,443
Yes. You too, sir.

WE HAVE A DATE FOR YOUR INTERVIEW

Where's the shaman?

647
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,809
She's preparing for a ritual.
It'll be starting soon.

I'm okay.

Yeah, that's…

660
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:40,660
my husband.

[woman] Oh, Yeon-jin!

It's been so long! How have you been?

667
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,906
Hi, Yeon-jin. It's me, So-hee.

668
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:03,492
I'm Yoon So-hee, the girl who transferred.
Remember me?

669
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:05,661
What the fuck are you doing right now?

670
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,789
Should I take them off?

671
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,251
Do you want that?
Should I take these clothes off

672
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,378
and give them to you?

673
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,088
What do you want?

[loud banging resumes]

676
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,566
Go on, strip off all your clothes for me.

677
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,153
Yeon-jin, I'm sorry,
but these aren't even the same clothes.

678
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,821
It's not about what you're wearing.

679
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:45,117
I care that little bitches like you
don't listen, even when I ask nicely.

00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:46,202
[Yeon-jin] Why?

681
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:55,461
Is this even a sweater?
Or just a gross pile of lint?

682
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,171
You have a minute

before your time's up.

You didn't strip?

686
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:12,853
I've had enough, okay?

687
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,067
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

688
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,155
You're nothing
when you're all by yourself.

689

[cackles] What the fuck
are you even saying?

690
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,953
Is that from a movie?

691
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm not scared of you or your money.

692
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,709
When I think about it, I feel bad for you.

[tense music playing]

694
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:39,213
So, I've decided to forgive you.

695
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:43,718
Because I'm a better person
than you, Yeon-jin.

696
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:46,804
Wow.

697
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,058
Are you calling me pathetic?

698
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,312
You feel bad for me, so clearly you are.

699
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,189
Fuck, that's a lot
to take in at once, you know?

700
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,193
[Yeon-jin] Hmm.

701
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,238
So you wouldn't mind

702
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,824
if this pathetic loser
helps you get this lint off.

703
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,996
You're better than me, right?

704
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,582
You should at least dress the part.

705
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,209
What… What are you doing?

706
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:18,878
[Yeon-jin] Don't move.

707
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,505
or I'll visit you at your new school.
