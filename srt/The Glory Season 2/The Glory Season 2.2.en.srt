That was a lot faster than I thought.
At least tell me why.

00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,426
Exactly how am I supposed
to get her there?

166
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,720
We just had a huge fight.
She probably won't even pick up.

That's for you to figure out.

It's nice to see you, ma'am.

I'm a friend of Dong-eun's.

Dong-eun is working at some school now?

So it seems like you don't know.

Dong-eun's teaching at that school.

Uh, Dong-eun's a public servant?

205
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,529
Well, it's a private school, so not quite.

Anyway, ma'am,

207

Who are you?

00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,464
Why would I get her fired
from something that pays so well?

212
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:26,384
It's not like you would get
any of that money.

213
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,303
You haven't spoken to her
in over a decade.

I'll give you more

[low, dramatic music playing]

You just need to get her kicked out.
It's a pretty similar situation.

Take this now, for the taxi ride there.

And this for the ride back.

Make sure she signs her resignation,

come get the rest of your money.

00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:18,838
My husband sure has standards.
It was an Hermès bag, I mean.

320
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,130
Would you like a procedure too?

321
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,468
People usually end up returning
after seeing my work.

322
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:28,264
[scoffs] Semyeong housewives
are probably most of your clients.

323
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:31,517
I'll think about it
when it's going to rain.

324
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,312
You can come for your filler
if you don't have an umbrella.

325
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,816
It won't rain for a while, though.

326
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:40,776
See you later.

327
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:56,083
[officer] Come on, hurry up. Get in there.
Come on, stop stalling. Get in there!

328
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,043
Come on, inside.

[line ringing]

331
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,397
Mr. Park, your team raided
a gambling den earlier today, right?

332
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,944
I said to never gamble again.
Didn't I say that?

333
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,405
You went to a gambling den?

334
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,741
Where did that money come from?

335
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,622
If I have to ask him and he gives me
that same bullshit story,

336
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,332
I'm going to kill you.

337
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,009
So then, there was a car accident,

338
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,553
and you extorted money from her?

339
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:53,140
I mean, people normally do that
for any accident. It's only natural.

340
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:59,229
They say if you hire smart people,
they'll backstab you,

341
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,274
and that dumbasses like you
just screw up for me!

342
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:07,237
I'm the reason you get to work, assholes,
And this is how you pay me back?

343
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,032
This is the reason
I can never leave the force.

344
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,619
I can't when you morons are
screwing up my business! Fucking bitch!

345
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,288
-[Seok-jae] Give it.
-[clerk] Stop it! Get out of here!

346
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,458
No more! Does this look like
some sort of charity? Huh?

347
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,087
I've only been putting up with you
this long because of your wife!

348
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,089
-Get out!
-Hey, shit.

349
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,425
I told you you'll get your money
when my bitch wife comes back.

350
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,678
That's what you said yesterday,
and the day before that!

351
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,846
Don't come back
unless you're with your wife.

352
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,808
If I were her,
I wouldn't come back either.

353
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,976
Come on, stop that!

354
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,269
-Enough!
-Ugh, you're such a fucking bitch!

355
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:42,314
-My goodness.
-I'll set this fucking store on fire!

356
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:45,567
-[Dong-eun] Can you ring this up?
-What're you doing, you fucking bitch?

357
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,445
Want me to rip your eyes out?
I was in line first!

358
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,864
Hey, now. Stop messing with my customers!

359
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:52,741
Heh, I'm sorry. Let me ring you up.

360
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,909
Just one second.

361
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,829
-[Seok-jae] Let go!
-Stop that. Really, come on!

362
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,789

You were exactly right, ma'am.

365
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,014
Park Yeon-jin did find me.

366

[delicate, inquisitive music playing]

My… My husband? You sure?

371
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,404
Yeah.

372
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,741
Park Yeon-jin might have discovered
the two of us have been working together.

373
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,956
Don't worry, ma'am.
I'll call you when I can.

374
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,541
I'm parking my car now.

375
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,689
So then I turned off my cell phone

376
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,108
and just started driving with Sun-a.

377
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,740
I don't want you to misunderstand
anything that I was doing.

378
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:17,034
Misunderstand?

379
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,955
I thought you'd think

380
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,458
I had switched sides
and was actually working for her now.

381
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,420
You already made that mistake before.

382
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,007
Have you had the chance to eat yet?

383
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,427
Yeah.

384
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,563
Please take care of my Sun-a.

385
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,817
I need to turn my phone back on

386
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,236
and get back on Yeon-jin's radar.

387
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,490
Everything we've done so far
will be useless if she meets my husband.

388
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:02,329
Thankfully that hasn't happened yet.
I made sure.

389
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,461
Don't worry too much about Sun-a.

390
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:11,046
Yeah.

391
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,424
I guess I'll try to buy us some time.

392
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,969
I'll ask for more money first.

393

From this moment on,
Park Yeon-jin is my boss.

You'll be staying here for the time being.

398
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,622
I'm going to need your phone.

399
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,208
You can only contact me and her.

400

Just the two of us in this room.

401
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:50,961
Understand?

402
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,131
What about school?

403
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,885
Your mother is going to pull you
out of school tomorrow.

404

You'll be able to finish
high school in the States.

But if I disappear,
my dad is going to kill my mom.

He said he'd kill my grandma and aunt
if my mom and I ever tried to run away.

That will never happen.

I promise you.
Just trust your mother and wait.

410
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:19,156
The one thing that I know

411
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:23,202
is your mother is doing
everything she can for you.

412
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,496
The life we have can be very cruel.

This is why you have to study abroad.

414
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,503
Just go and study as hard as you can.

415
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,799
The only way you can show anyone
how brave you are

416
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:39,927
is by leaving.

417
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,056
While you're studying,
go on a trip sometime.

418
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,641
Go visit art museums.

419
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,101
Eat dinner nice and slow.

420
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,730
That's the way you should live.

That's all you need.

422
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,363
Okay.

423
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,786
Thank you, ma'am. Please take care of her.

424

Mmm, she's safe with me.

425
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,916
Oh, wow. You're so young and beautiful.

426
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,002
I've heard a lot about you.

427
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,839
I was Ms. Moon's teacher
when she was a student.

428
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,259
But I had to quit my job a long time ago.

429
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,679
Now it seems I've got
another student to take care of.

430
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:25,973
Come on.

431
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:33,772
Hungry? Want me to make you
some noodles? Would you like that?

432
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,464
I texted you earlier
saying I'd be out until 10:00.

433
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,882
Did you get it?

434
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,093
You trying to start something?

435
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,680
You're the one
who's starting things here, you know.

436
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,559
Did you go and meet with Hye-jeong? Why?

437
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,603
Why?

438
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,106
You're starting to scare me, hon.

439
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,234
I'm just trying to have
a calm conversation.

440
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,946
The past is in the past.
The future's what's ahead.

441
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,949
I don't have any other options.

442
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:27,701
I'm not so sure about that.

443
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:30,704
So I looked into your other options.

444
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,622
But why did it have to be Hye-jeong?

445
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,754
What did Hye-jeong say? Do I have one?

446
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,921
Who else could I ask?

447
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:44,092
Sa-ra's out since she's
ruining her life with drugs.

448
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:46,928
So Jae-jun, that thug?

449
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,680
Or Myeong-o, who disappeared?

450
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,308
Or your mother who's been giving
some shaman millions of won?

451
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,562
You're really doing this then?

452
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,107
You're really going to take their side?

453
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:05,614
[foreboding music playing]

454
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,158
If I'm taking sides, it will be Ye-sol's.

455
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,496
If you have ever felt
even the slightest bit of guilt

456
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:13,955
for me or your daughter, then…

457
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,377
you wouldn't have said anything.
Nothing. You should've waited.

458
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,716
But clearly, you don't feel any guilt.

459
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,636
You don't.

460
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:44,820
-Anything new today?
-Not really.

461
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,488
Just took Louis to the groomer.

462
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,156
When are you free?

463
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,575
I'm working here this weekend.

464
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,619
Why?

465
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,704
Guess we're closing this weekend, then.

466
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,209
I want to get a Christmas present
for a friend, but I have no idea what.

467
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:02,671
Would you like to come with me?
She's pretty young.

468
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,507
There isn't anything in the store?

469
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,052
Hmm, is it the redhead
or the racing flag girl with the accent?

470
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,595
Aren't you listening to me?

471
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,098
I just need you to tell me
if something's green or red.

472
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,850
Fuck, it's Christmas so it's all…

473
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,894
Are you free or not?

474
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,690
What exactly counts as "new"?

475
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,275
What?

476
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,277
You asked if there was anything new.

477
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,613
Yeon-jin's husband
came to the store by himself.

478
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:31,616
Does that count as "anything new"?

479
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,328
He did? Why?

480
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:36,830
I have no idea.

481
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,250
He tried on a shirt and then he left.

-CCTV
-NOVEMBER

483
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,718
[Jae-jun] Was it the first time,
or has he been here before?

484
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,887
It's the first time I've seen him.

485
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,431
But I'm not sure if he came
when someone else was working.

486
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,393
How long do we keep these?
None were deleted?

487
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,146
We keep them for 30 days.

488
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:04,483
But anything from before October 19th
has been reformatted.

489
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,777
You reformatted it? Why?

490
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,822
Yeon-jin had asked me to erase it.

491
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,534
There he is. Look.

492
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,914
[suspenseful music playing]

493
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,279
Son Myeong-o?

494
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,615
Yeah. Our director asked about him.

495
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,451
He showed me
some of their security footage

496
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,703
and asked me if the man was Son Myeong-o.

497
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,330
When was that?

498
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,251
I told him all I knew about Myeong-o,
but I never heard anything about footage.

499
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,169
A little less than a month ago.

500
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,213
I must've forgot.

501
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,840
But yeah, they came to talk to Yeo-jeong.

502
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,762
The police really came to see Yeo-jeong?

503
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:23,937
[chuckles] Moon Dong-eun,
you're a lot more interesting now.

504
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,438
[mysterious music playing]

505
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,212
[doctor] Hey, Dr. Joo?

506
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,880
I thought that was you.

507
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,592
I saw you walk by earlier,
but I wasn't sure.

508
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,011
I've been meaning
to get in touch with you.

509
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,097
You asked me to let you know
if anyone came to the morgue.

510
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,807
Yeah. A woman?

511
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,559
Uh, no. It was a man.

512
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,603
Uh, he came in like two hours ago.

513
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,148
Here's his number.

514
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:10,817
SON MYEONG-O

515
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,485
[Yeo-jeong] <i>I never actually met him.</i>

516
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,155
All I had was his cell phone number.

517
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,407
A long time after that,
I tried to call him.

518
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:19,659
Could you tell me when?

519
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,829
October 19th, 11:15 that night, I think.

520
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,957
But he hung up as soon as he answered.

521
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,125
Cursed me out.

522
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,086
That's very detailed information.

523
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,714
I keep records on my phone.

524
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,216
Understandable.

525
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,844
Why'd you try to call him?

526
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,681
Ah. That was back when I was
working at Seoul Joo General.

527
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,266
There's this body at the hospital.

528
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,728
This death was concluded
as a suicide in 2004.

529
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,231
Their family did not agree
with the investigation.

530
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,442
So the hospital refused to process it.

531
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:56,154
So when I heard there was a visitor,
I thought it was family..

532
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,281
But it turned out to be Mr. Son.

533
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,367
Were you the doctor
in charge of that case?

534
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,451
No.

535
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,328
Ah. [chuckles]

536
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,455
There is something I forgot to say.

537
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,208
The previous and the current
hospital directors are my parents.

538
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,002
Oh, I see.

539
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,008
I'm sorry, did I do something wrong
when I called Mr. Son?

540
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,260
No, not really.

541
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,556
But you do happen to be
the last person who called Mr. Son.

542
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:25,558
Oh.

543
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,022
In that case, I do sound suspicious.

544
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,316
What?

545
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:35,610
Just kidding.

546
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,195
[laughs]

547
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,405
That wasn't too funny.

548
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,825
Could you text me
if you have any other questions?

549
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,076
I have an appointment soon.

550
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,912
[suspenseful music playing]

551
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:28,413
SON MYEONG-O

552
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,337
So you wanted me to…

553
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,009
find Son Myeong-o.

554
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:11,372
[Yeon-jin] Weather's great,
but I was feeling a bit down.

555
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,708
I hear you'll even see patients at night.

556
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,668
Well, I'm glad.

557
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:19,297
A lot of patients come
even when they don't need an umbrella.

558
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,008
Do you have a girlfriend?

559
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,136
Hmm? Probably have a few.

560
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,847
My girl's very clever and pretty,

561
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,475
but she can also act very cold sometimes.

562
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,977
So you're dating a mean girl then?

563
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,356
Let me ask you.

564
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,983
How much can guys usually forgive?

565
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,820
Assuming the girl's done bad things?

566
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:43,905
I'm not sure.

567
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:49,077
Guys don't usually want to marry
women who've had plastic surgery.

568
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,122
But they won't care what work
you've had done if they don't know.

569
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,792
But what if he already found out?

570
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,294
Then I think you should just get filler.

571
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,340
You'll still be able to keep your beauty,
but it'll disappear over time.

572
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,718
That way, you can keep playing dumb
until he learns the truth.

573
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,349
I didn't know fillers could be romantic.

574
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,395
I guess I'll have to see if you're right.
I'll need you to put me under.

575
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,647
I need to see
how the filler will react before I--

576
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,190
It's okay. I know you're good.

577
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,860
I just don't like how it feels
when filler goes in.

578
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,696
All right, get some sleep.

579
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,090
[soft, cryptic music playing]

580
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,901
I'm sure privacy is very important to you.

581
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,904
So I picked Seoul instead of Semyeong.

582
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,116
I haven't been here in a while, in Seoul.

583
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:11,451
This is nice.

584
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:16,831
I heard about the two of you.

585
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,543
Then you probably didn't hear everything.

586
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,516
I'm injecting the propofol
into the IV now,

587
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,060
so you'll feel sleep soon.

588
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,729
Start counting backwards from ten.

589
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,440
Ten…

00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,906
-It's been too long, Mr. Ha.
-Yeah.

00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,075
May I take your code, ma'am?

If there's still air in this
before I administer it,

One minute. Then I'm gone.

612
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,748
You said you wanted to talk, so talk.

613
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,916
Wow, you haven't changed.

614

You know that asshole, Jae-jun?

616
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,341
I did everything for that bastard.

617
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,928
I drive for him, I keep him company,
I act like I'm his friend.

618
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,140
And you probably know
I didn't go to college.

619
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,560
But I basically went there.
I signed his attendance.

620
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,522
So it really hurts my fucking pride

621
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,566
to only be called a driver.

622
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,069
Get on with it. You're pissing me off.

623

Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

Honestly, I expected more from you.

All you have is that I cheated?

636
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,746
If you want to threaten me,
you'll have to try harder.

637
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,332
You can't make money that easily.

638
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,794
I'll buy you a new phone.

639

How about this one?

Oh, bitch, please!

Been there for years.

That day, you were on the roof,
weren't you?

What the hell are you saying now?

649
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,124
You're not making sense.

650
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,459
It does make sense, doesn't it, though?

651
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,630
The evidence I need
to prove you were there that day…

652

is right here.

I'm not going to
have to haggle with you at all!

660

You actually were there, weren't you?

661
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,231
You know I was joking
about the director thing?

662
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,649
I'll take cash.

663
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,652
Let's start with around a billion won?

It's strawberry-flavored.

If I…

can use this on you, I'll take off 10 mil.

670
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,018
And I'll take off another 10
if we do it without it.

671
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,103
Sound good?

But wait, I almost forgot.
