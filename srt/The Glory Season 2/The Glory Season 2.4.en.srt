How influential do you think he is?

14
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,471
I was following him one day
and saw him go there.

15

-It's a funeral home.
-Yes.

18
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,273
It's been out of business for three years.

19
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,485
But then, guess what I found there?

20

OUT OF BUSINESS
DO NOT ENTER

22
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,148
Apparently, an average home consumes

23
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,735
up to 2,000 kilowatt hours
a month at most.

24
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,531
But the meter reads more than 5,000
at this abandoned building,

25
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,700
and it's not the end of the month yet.

26
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,161
So this place is
still using a ton of power?

27
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,455
Right, and it uses the most…

Detective Shin probably
bought someone off for it.

34
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,728
The property owner lives in LA,

35
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,690
and the funeral home has been
up for sale for three years.

36
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,484
A nearby lottery shop owner
takes care of the facility.

37
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,194
I mean, do you want to check?

38

39
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,699

40
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,620

This is private property.
You can't come in.

00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,310
We've gotten permission
from the owner to come.

47
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,603
I'm a real estate agent.

48
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:52,899
Real estate agent? Why?

49
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,652
What? Didn't the owner
tell you we were coming?

50
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,280
Looks like my phone calls
aren't the only ones you ignore.

Open the gate, please.

53
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,286
We've already talked to the owner.

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,707
What? Uh, wait, hold on a minute.
I need to call someone.

61
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,995
[Dong-eun] Actually, until we met you,

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,290
we weren't sure
if Shin was really behind it.

63
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,501
Now, we know he is.

64
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,961
Why'd you come here? To trick me?

65
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,798
What do you plan to do now?

66
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,801
Why are you asking me?
Aren't you going to call the police?

67
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,511
No, we're not.

68
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,806
You're not going to call them?

69
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,517
You're serious?

70
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,728
But why? Why not?

71
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,731
Since they vacuum sealed the body,

72
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,026
it means they were delaying
the decaying process to conserve evidence.

73
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:19,778
But why?

74
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,197
Maybe it's like some insurance?

75
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,908
While Shin was covering up
what Yeon-jin did,

76
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,369
he developed an ulterior motive.

77
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,412
How sure are you?

78
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,331
Shin could've done it himself.

79
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:33,291
Ninety-nine percent?

80
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,087
If it had been up to him,
he wouldn't have left anything behind.

81
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,588
He wouldn't have kept the body.

82

00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,783

to get Park Yeon-jin to my clinic?

that are warmer than usual…

create a thick fog, obscuring things.

00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:15,715
-You ungrateful--
-Honey, stop.

323
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,508
You think we wanted you back here?

324
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,760
The community in Paris was gossiping

325
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,847
that you were doing drugs every night
and sleeping in the streets like a whore!

326
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,473
He's right, Sa-ra.

327
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,601
We can take care of you here in Korea
and get you some help.

328
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,438
You don't even speak Dutch,
so why don't you stay home?

329
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,275
You know I hate living here.
Why can't I live in the Netherlands?

330
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,485
I wanna go! Let me go! I want to live!

331
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,487
Get me out of here! Let me go!

332
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,990
Dad, just let me fucking go!

333
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,117
[Sa-ra's father] Damn it!

334
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,328
Where are you going? I want to go now!

335
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,416
[officer] The victim is
willing to accept a settlement.

336
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,793
-If you and the victim--
-Who's the victim?

337
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,545
He's the criminal.

338
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,172
Don't call that fucking pervert a victim

339
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,174
when he's been taking
dirty pics of little girls!

340
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:01,177
I just need to know if you're willing
to settle regarding the assault.

341
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,264
-The photos are a different matter, right?
-[scoffs]

342
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,933
The law is really fucking strange, huh?

343
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,186
The fuck's he talking about?
Are you gonna say something?

344
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,645
You should stop talking.

345
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,857
I'll be speaking for my client.
We're willing to settle.

346
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,611
I won't settle with that asshole.
That fucker should be rotting in jail!

347
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,070
[lawyer, officer sigh]

348
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,658
Hello. You're the one
I spoke to on the phone?

349
00:21:24,742 --> 00:21:29,622
I am. I'm Choi Won-seok,
from Jaepyeong Construction's legal team.

350
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,373
What the hell?

351
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:36,587
Here. This is the agreement I mentioned
when we spoke on the phone.

352
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,671
Thank you so much.

353
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,009
Hey, you fucking insane?
I didn't agree to this.

354
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,720
Shut the fuck up.

355
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,390
You're the one going to jail
if we don't settle.

356
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,142
[frustrated sigh]

357
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,228
[footsteps approach]

358
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:58,943
[Jae-jun sighs]

359
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,749
I reached out because I figured
it'd be easier to get a settlement

360
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,292
if Jaepyeong were involved.

361
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:17,503
Right, and regarding the photos
that were taken,

362
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,046
we will be pressing charges.

363
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,090
Both civil and criminal.

364
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:25,094
[Jae-jun] Why would you get involved?
I should be the one to do that.

365
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:27,096
Don't you think?

366
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,141
[Do-yeong] What could you do?

367
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,435
Please tell me.

368
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,231
Tell me, what right do you have
to press charges?

369
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,399
[tense music playing]

370
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,861
You know, right?

371
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,196
Don't you?

372
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,116
You know I'm Ye-sol's father.

373
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,247
You're an even bigger son of a bitch
than I thought you were.

374
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,707
[Jae-jun chuckles]

375
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,625
I'm warning you, back off.

376
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,879
[sighs] This fucking asshole.

377
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,092
-You shouldn't do this here!
-We're outside a police station!

378
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,010
Please don't do this!

379
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,887
[Jae-jun chuckles]

380
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,055
Hey, you fucking…

381
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,520
[Jae-jun chuckles]

382
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,576
You fucker! [grunts]

383
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,376
That's enough now, stop!

384
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,378
-Why?
-Stop it, please, sir!

385
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,213
Hey, hold on. Let me go.

386
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,382
Oh, shit!

387
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,636
Fuck you, let me go!

388
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:49,720
I let you go.

389
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,806
I'm not doing this for you.

390
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,434
My family is none of your business.

391
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,561
You should go.

392
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,271
And I'm warning you,

393
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,857
never come near
my daughter again, asshole.

394
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,363
[Jae-jun groans]

395
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,036
Shit.

396
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,791
The police said what?

397
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,210
They received a report about the hospital?

398
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,796
Yes, for illegal storage of a corpse.

399
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:27,299
They want to search the morgue
and the freezer. What should we do?

400
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,221
Where's the body now?

401
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,142
We've conducted an autopsy.
We can't hold her body anymore.

402
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,060
WINTER OF 2004

403
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,230
If we don't do anything with her body,
the corpse will rot.

404
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,232
You have to have a funeral for her.

405
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,818
EVERYTHING WILL BE OVER
IF WE HOLD THE FUNERAL

406
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,070
IT'S UNFAIR, SO UNFAIR

407
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,907
PLEASE, HELP ME

408
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,492
PLEASE

409
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,035
PLEASE HELP
MY POOR DAUGHTER, DOCTOR

410
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,704
Doing this here won't help you!

411
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,624
I need to know
you understand what I'm telling you.

412
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:03,127
AGREEMENT TO HOLD FUNERAL

413
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,920
Please review this, and then sign.

414
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,339
You can sign with a thumbprint.

415
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,299
[So-hee's mother sobbing]

416
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,220
Please, ma'am! You have to sign.

417
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,350
This whole thing is tragic.
Without the family's consent,

418
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,769
we aren't allowed
to do anything with the body.

419
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:21,770
No, we can't.

420
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,773
The temperature in the morgue
isn't enough to preserve her.

421
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:28,527
Right. Body will decompose
within six months.

422
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,864
Think of the discharge from the decay,
not to mention the smell.

423
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:32,781
I know.

424
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,868
Clearly, we should move the body
to the freezer.

425
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,369
Huh? What?

426
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,873
Oh, don't even joke about that, sir!

427
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,585
She says it wasn't a suicide.

428
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,921
This whole situation isn't our concern.

429
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:51,008
The hospital can't be held liable
for incurred costs.

430
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,886
I think it'll be sorted out soon.

431
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,971
They say good triumphs over evil.

432
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,477
Let's take care of her
until things get sorted out.

433
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,479
[chuckles]

434
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,898
I've been informed
there was a civil complaint.

435
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:11,403
Still, I can't wrap my mind around
how strange this is.

436
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,907
Hospital staff would be
the only ones inconvenienced,

437
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,036
and I'm not sure
why there's a problem after all this time.

438
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,580
Also, why would someone
report this to the police,

439
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,875
not the Ministry of Health and Welfare?

440
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,465
Hard to say, but we're obligated
to investigate this case.

441
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,344
I need the body moved back to the morgue.

442
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,972
I filed the report.
Understand what I'm saying?

443
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:41,558
Yeah.

444
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,604
So you admit that the hospital moved
the body from the morgue to the freezer,

445
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,855
without the family's consent?

446
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,399
And the intentions
behind that decision were unclear.

447
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,484
"Intentions"?

448
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,237
You could have moved the body
to conduct illegal experiments,

449
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,863
or for any other number of reasons.

450
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,868
That said, you must move the body
back to the morgue.

451
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,162
We won't.

452
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,623
If there's been a crime here,
we'll accept punishment.

453
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,835
Till then, the body stays in the freezer.

454
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,630
This girl's death was suspicious…

455
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,173
PROCESSED ON 12/15/2004
YOON SO-HEE

456
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,967
…and we've yet to find the real truth.

457
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,928
That's our intention.

458
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,597
Have I made myself clear?

459
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:22,683
[dramatic music playing]

460
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,355
Oh, piece of shit.

461
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,774
You better text me back

462
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,860
or pick up your fucking phone.

463
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,445
Too busy to talk?

464
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,866
[whimpers, groans]

465
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,748
Let me just see here.

466
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:49,835
COME MEET ME,
I HAVE THINGS TO SAY

467
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:50,919
YOU MUST BE IGNORING ME

468
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,588
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
THIS NUMBER

469
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,922
BUT I'M DONG-EUN'S MOM

470
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:55,174
YOU HAVE TO MEET YOUR…

471
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,641
[Dong-eun's mother] Aw, come on!

472
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,604
Damn it!

473
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,900
YOU HAVE TO MEET
YOUR FUTURE MOTHER-IN-LAW

474
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:13,817
HOW RUDE OF YOU

475
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,947
[Dong-eun's mother] I want pickles.

476
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,532
I'll pay.

477
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,786
-Including that person.
-[Dong-eun's mother] Bring me more!

478
00:28:28,332 --> 00:28:30,334
[Dong-eun's mother yelling incoherently]

479
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,809
Why are you here?

480
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,146
You didn't go pick up Ye-sol?

481
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:53,899
Ye-sol got out early
and went to her grandmother's.

I'm going to visit a site.
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,963
Why did you send Ye-sol to your mother's?

489
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:18,090
I have my reasons. We'll talk later.

I have to hear it from the drive…

491

What happened?

492
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,805
A fight?

493
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,348
I don't think we should talk now,

494
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,308
because I don't have
anything nice to say to you.

So I can't even ask
why my daughter left school early?

Why are you acting so superior right now?

497
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,902
I'd rather have an argument.
I'd rather you be mean.

498
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,531
Fine. Then let's talk.

499
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:47,035
I'm not sure where to start,
but this is as good a place as any.

00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,915
My wife's lover went
to my daughter's school,

who is Ye-sol's father.

506
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,311
I know everything. All your secrets.

507
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,945
You have no idea
how much I'm holding back!

508
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,491
Even after all of this,

00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,161
the only thing
you truly care about is yourself.

510

Ye-sol is suffering…

511
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,502
and you want to argue with me?

512

At least…

with these secrets.

515
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,891
You destroyed it by dragging it all out.

516
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,809
What did you want to protect?

517

Our marriage, your career,
Ye-sol, your lover?

518
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,026
You couldn't protect any of it.

519
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,867
Let me make this very clear.
