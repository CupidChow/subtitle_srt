[inmate] Hey, cutie.
What's the weather like tomorrow?

504
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:01,102
Huh?

505
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,741
For these past few days,

506
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:17,243
all the rain we've received
has made the temperature drop.

507
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,120
However, tomorrow
temperatures will warm up

508
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,623
and rise close to 30 degrees Celsius
around mid-day.

509
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,334
I recommend you wear some light clothes,

510
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,712
and make sure you stay hydrated
throughout the day.

511
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:34,844
Although we expect no clouds
and pollution will be low,

512
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,681
the ozone levels
and the UV radiation will be very high.

between the hours of 2:00 and 5:00 p.m.,

will be at its highest.

[Dong-eun] Yeah.

It's already summer.

00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,108
I looked deeper
into that bitch and that bastard.

523
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,026
You were absolutely right, Ms. Moon.

524
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:35,446
Thank you for looking out for me.

525

Well, I know nothing ever comes for free.

526
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:44,705
Now tell me why
you've been staying here so long.

527
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,628
I need some information.

528
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,006
There's a prisoner serving in Cheongsong.

529
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,888
Prisoners are sorted into five tiers,
ranging from S-1 to S-5.

530
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,891
Cheongsong is where S-4 prisoners go.

they're one nasty piece of work.

533
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:14,402
Yeah. Two of his victims
were innocent women.

534
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,281
Could he be transferred?

535
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:25,580
You would need to stir up trouble
at the prison to do that.

Come find me if you need a loan.

542

I've really missed you.

Then why did you leave me again?

558
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,870
Maybe it was out of love,

559
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,455
and not for revenge.

I think you just need some lessons.

Would you let me teach you how?

From now on, I will be your executioner.

I will be your missing 1%.

Nice to meet you.

685
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,871
It sounds rather formal
when you call it debate class.

686
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,248
Especially as this is
meant for those of you

where we can freely discuss
the material we've read.

So thank you, Doctor.

Thank you for taking care of my sister.

She'll need a few more laser treatments,

Sure. There's no way
I'll let that son of a bitch outlive me.

Right. You're in here

Yeah.

You don't have to tell me.

I've heard removing scars

712
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:11,543
can be a very expensive procedure.

If I wanted to save animals,
I would've become a veterinarian.
