1
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:24,633
Life is so difficult.

2
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:27,076
I'm going to talk casually.

3
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:30,805
I'm never the type to post
anything like this online.

4
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:35,985
But one of my friends is a user,
so I've read some postings.

5
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,968
When I read them, I got to know
about all kinds of legendary men.

6
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:45,478
The guy who gave his girlfriend free
cotton pads from the cosmetic shop.

7
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:48,170
The glutton who didn't want to share
pizza so waited in the playground,

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,740
then got the delivery
and ate it by himself.

9
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,931
(The glutton)

10
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:55,517
Actually, my friend
who's a user here...

11
00:00:55,517 --> 00:00:57,896
had met such a guy a while ago.

12
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:00,668
He's the kind of guy who robs A
to pay B.

13
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:04,135
He would bring the sports car
girl A bought him...

14
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:06,172
to pick up my friend, B,

15
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:10,872
and gave the tablet PC my friend
had bought him to girl C.

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,831
Hey, didn't you buy that for him?

17
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:14,380
- But...
- Don't make me laugh.

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,017
I had a bad feeling
as soon as I saw that guy.

19
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:23,869
So I honestly thought my friend
was weird.

20
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:30,141
Are you insane?

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,103
There are good guys in this world,

22
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:35,583
so why would she meet a guy
like him?

23
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,383
But I can't believe
I'm leaving a post here now.

24
00:01:43,534 --> 00:01:45,965
My ex-boyfriend is a dentist.

25
00:01:45,965 --> 00:01:48,357
He's in his mid-30s,
worked as a hospitalist,

26
00:01:48,357 --> 00:01:50,214
then took out a loan
to open his hospital.

27
00:01:50,214 --> 00:01:51,399
We dated for seven years.

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,937
I was in the engineering department
in the same school...

29
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:56,196
and working in an IT company now.

30
00:01:56,197 --> 00:01:59,120
I won't say more as my friends
may notice it's me.

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,158
Come to think of it,
there were odd moments.

32
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,058
I thought you'd like what I chose.

33
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:06,950
Everything is decided then.

34
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,693
You should do whatever you want
when you can.

35
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:10,940
You won't be able to do any of this
once we get married and have a kid.

36
00:02:11,654 --> 00:02:16,291
Then I got to see the group chat
of my boyfriend and his friends.

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,314
I won't say here
how I got to see it.

38
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,398
But...

39
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:24,554
there I saw pictures of me
in my underwear...

40
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:28,954
and all kinds of appraisals
about my face and body.

41
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:32,027
I saw a new side to Jung Han today.

42
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,022
- Jung Han is a man of loyalty.
- You're right.

43
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,545
He's marrying out of loyalty too.

44
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:37,513
There are fresher and juicier girls
out there.

45
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:40,901
- She can't open an office for you.
- Hey, I'm all about the body.

46
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:43,406
That's a share of loyalty. You have
to keep her even if she flops.

47
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:45,645
Hey, she's quite good in bed.

48
00:02:45,645 --> 00:02:47,443
That's what I love about old women.

49
00:02:47,444 --> 00:02:49,007
(She has boobs! Look at this.
It's from the surveillance footage.)

50
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:52,107
(These are blurry.
Get better shots.)

51
00:02:52,204 --> 00:02:53,521
(- They look pretty small to me.
- Here you go. This is the proof.)

52
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:56,153
He's been watching me through
the surveillance camera in secret.

53
00:02:56,153 --> 00:02:59,211
Then he captured that picture
and put it on the group chat.

54
00:03:01,122 --> 00:03:02,550
Crazy jerk.

55
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:07,641
Also, I saw footage of him
cursing me on the dashcam.

56
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,155
Why does she have
to nag me to pick her up?

57
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,648
I wish she could've
just gone home early.

58
00:03:15,921 --> 00:03:19,617
My mind is all over the place
right now as I'm drunk.

59
00:03:20,427 --> 00:03:24,512
Anyway, no one knows
how my life would pan out.

60
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:28,056
So you don't have
to feel sorry for me.

61
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:33,874
Everyone reading this would need
a good revenge story by now.

62
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:35,680
And so...

63
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,430
what I did was...

64
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,054
(Please Don't Date Him)

65
00:03:45,175 --> 00:03:47,860
(Episode 2.
I Shouldn't Have Met You)

66
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:06,995
I get chills whenever I read
that article.

67
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,581
A guy broke into a house
where a woman was living alone.

68
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,594
And he was hiding under the bed.

69
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,897
- Really?
- He's a lunatic.

70
00:04:16,897 --> 00:04:18,021
Shake your hand.

71
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,353
Okay. It's working.

72
00:04:19,353 --> 00:04:21,201
So the camera can see me?

73
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,680
Right.

74
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:24,290
You're the best, honey.

75
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,900
Hey. We should turn that off.

76
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:30,458
What a despicable jerk.

77
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,474
- What is it?
- They are matching sweaters.

78
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:34,926
This happened last time too.
How come we're so good together?

79
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,907
I guess we connected.

80
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:42,383
He was peeking at me through CCTV.
What? We connected?

81
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,864
He's been playing with me but
also posted it on the group chat.

82
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:50,288
Should I put him in jail?

83
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,554
- What are you looking at?
- You started first.

84
00:04:52,554 --> 00:04:55,514
- You grabbed my hair first.
- Calm down.

85
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:57,671
You grabbed my hair like this.

86
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,090
Please be quiet.

87
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,211
But...

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,038
didn't you say you are dating
and going to get married soon?

89
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,680
That's why it's more upsetting.

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,498
- But you agreed to installing it.
- Well,

91
00:05:08,498 --> 00:05:10,751
that's true, but the problem is...

92
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:13,464
that he posted that picture
on the group chat with his friends.

93
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:15,274
Everybody looked at it.

94
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,369
But are you sure this is you?

95
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:20,210
- Yes.
- I mean,

96
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:23,854
your face is not taken
from the front,

97
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:26,564
so it's hard to tell exactly
with just the body.

98
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:27,349
Pardon?

99
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,018
We need verification
that it really is your body...

100
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:34,641
for you to sue him.

101
00:05:34,964 --> 00:05:36,209
Excuse me, sir.

102
00:05:36,874 --> 00:05:40,027
I said that's me because it is.
How can I make it clearer?

103
00:05:40,027 --> 00:05:41,469
Goodness.

104
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,880
I revealed my name and face.
What more do you want me to reveal?

105
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,383
I can't go to the police.

106
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,149
No, I won't go.

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,637
Bang Jung Han.

108
00:05:54,214 --> 00:05:57,388
I'm going to kill you myself.

109
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:12,287
Honey. Do you want to come over
to my place tomorrow?

110
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,094
You're here.

111
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:18,725
- Ta-da!
- What is that?

112
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:21,704
I thought you would've finished
your wine.

113
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,935
- Oh, right.
- Sorry?

114
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:28,096
Nothing. You must've felt like it.

115
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:30,653
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

116
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:33,832
Why don't you wash up first?

117
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,555
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

118
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:38,751
While you wash up,
I'll get things ready.

119
00:06:41,523 --> 00:06:44,293
If you say that as soon as I'm here,

120
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,182
I appreciate it.

121
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,396
Gosh. It's hot.

122
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:31,391
Why?

123
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:33,675
Do you want to join me?

124
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:40,808
What are you doing?

125
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:53,413
Honey. That's...

126
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,981
You son of a gun!

127
00:07:56,981 --> 00:08:00,012
You piece of crap!

128
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,142
Listen to me properly.

129
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:05,769
I will never marry a guy like you.

130
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,402
The day my picture here gets out,

131
00:08:08,402 --> 00:08:11,467
this modest nude photo of you
will be all over the world.

132
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,703
Got that?

133
00:08:51,595 --> 00:08:54,591
Why did things come to this?

134
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,527
I got rid of my boyfriend.

135
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,401
Now I'm going to delete you.

136
00:09:11,963 --> 00:09:14,287
(Are you sure you want to delete
Janggo Project?)

137
00:09:19,396 --> 00:09:20,943
(Problem Occurred)

138
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:30,605
- Hi, Janggo.
- Yes, please go on.

139
00:09:32,091 --> 00:09:33,373
Get lost.

140
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,947
Get lost!

141
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,351
I'm sorry.

142
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:42,363
- Get lost.
- I'm sorry. I did not understand.

143
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,118
How come nothing goes
the way I want it to?

144
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:50,440
Why not? I've lived really hard.

145
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,743
Why me? Get lost.

146
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,631
Get lost.

147
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,129
Just get lost.

148
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,108
Why?

149
00:10:05,274 --> 00:10:07,743
What did I do wrong?

150
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,393
What did I do wrong?

151
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:24,928
(Seo Ji Sung)

152
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:27,318
(Energy Drink)

153
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,237
(Project Development Schedule)

154
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:34,923
I followed formulas
and algorithms in life.

155
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:38,684
I put effort to get what I wanted.

156
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:42,130
I thought I calculated
all the possible variables.

157
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,270
But why is it...

158
00:10:45,397 --> 00:10:47,788
that the program
I've been working on...

159
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,237
as well as the man I've chosen...

160
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:53,909
are giving me such a huge error...

161
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:57,250
at the same time?

162
00:10:58,235 --> 00:11:00,626
What kind of menu
should I recommend you?

163
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,828
Woman in her 30s.

164
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:10,056
An AI programmer.

165
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:14,592
Suffering from reflux esophagitis
due to continuous overtime work.

166
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:16,959
Expecting her wedding in a month,

167
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,518
which is about to be called off.

168
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,015
Sandwiches for dinner yesterday.

169
00:11:24,152 --> 00:11:26,892
It's been such a long time...

170
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:28,847
since I had a decent meal.

171
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,327
What should I eat?

172
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:38,250
How about a bowl
of rich soybean paste stew, Ms. Seo?

173
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,938
You're too occupied with going over
my personal data, aren't you?

174
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:46,886
I've never had
rich soybean paste stew before,

175
00:11:46,886 --> 00:11:48,819
so why do you keep

352
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:15,798
Why would you bring that up
of all things?

353
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:18,329
- How can you ask that?
- Come on.

354
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:21,569
How did you find out?

355
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:25,335
Did you find photos of you
on the internet or something?

356
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:26,776
I stopped him before it got to that.

357
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:29,078
Are you sure you stopped him
for good?

358
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:30,841
I have something over him.

359
00:23:30,944 --> 00:23:32,476
I have naked photos of him too.

360
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:38,754
Let's not judge.

361
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:42,224
I didn't say anything. Good job.

362
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:44,755
Of course, you need naked photos,
even if he was an old man.

363
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:47,580
You almost got married
to that piece of trash.

364
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:52,068
- That's right.
- Your Ancestral Spirit saved you.

365
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:54,765
Yes, it really did.

366
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:58,726
It's infuriating
to just think about it,

367
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:01,138
but you know
what's even more infuriating?

368
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:04,213
The thought of having spent...

369
00:24:04,213 --> 00:24:06,916
seven whole years with him.
What a waste.

370
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:10,881
How did I date a man like this
for seven whole years?

371
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:12,989
I can't believe it.

372
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:15,913
It's good that you broke up
at least now.

373
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,976
That's right. You can get over him.

374
00:24:17,976 --> 00:24:20,329
Look at me. I get over mine easily.

375
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,198
- You get over too easily.
- You get over too easily.

376
00:24:22,198 --> 00:24:24,428
Why are you girls always so mean
to me?

377
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:27,098
Come on.

378
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,634
Ji Sung,

379
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,351
it may be difficult right now,

380
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,508
but I promise that it'll get better.

381
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,112
Did Jung Han break it off that easy?

382
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,814
What can he do? He's busted.

383
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:48,057
Hey,

384
00:24:48,057 --> 00:24:49,320
do your parents know?

385
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:52,790
Right. My parents.

386
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:59,500
(Recruiting at MBS Media Center)

387
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,271
You called at the right time.

388
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,407
What are you going to do?
Are you really going...

389
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:06,308
to make your dad sit beside me
at the wedding?

390
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:09,845
I just don't even like the idea
of having to sit beside him.

391
00:25:09,845 --> 00:25:11,680
How does he have the audacity
to want to sit beside me?

392
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,310
Honestly,

393
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:15,618
it's not like your mom did me
any good.

394
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:18,816
I absolutely loathe the idea
of taking photos...

395
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:20,956
beside your mom.

396
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:24,255
You two won't have to sit together.

397
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:25,489
- Why?
- Why?

398
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:33,224
What are you saying?
Your wedding is in a month.

399
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,565
Did you two have a fight?

400
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:36,205
We just broke up.

401
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,907
I don't want to tell you twice.

402
00:25:37,907 --> 00:25:40,042
Your daughter isn't getting married.

403
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:41,155
You know,

404
00:25:41,155 --> 00:25:44,646
couples get into quarrels
before the wedding all the time.

405
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:48,078
Yes, I know that it happens.

406
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,946
But that's not why I'm breaking up.

407
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,116
I don't know what happened,

408
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:56,520
but do you really have to be
so dramatic?

409
00:25:56,592 --> 00:25:59,336
Jung Han is a good guy.

410
00:25:59,628 --> 00:26:01,992
Dad is a good guy too.

411
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:04,328
You're right.

412
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:08,866
Ji Sung,

413
00:26:09,124 --> 00:26:10,172
by any chance,

414
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,942
did us two getting divorced...

415
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:16,106
make you change your mind
in any way?

416
00:26:16,378 --> 00:26:18,414
What are you saying?

417
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:20,748
Hey, it's pathetic
for someone over 30...

418
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,919
to say that they've been scarred
because of their parents' divorce.

419
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,821
You know that, right?

420
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:27,785
That's not at all why I broke up.

421
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:33,016
I just have a very good reason
why I possibly cannot...

422
00:26:33,729 --> 00:26:35,726
marry him.

423
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:37,867
Ji Sung,

424
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,635
let's have your dad leave,

425
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:41,570
and have a talk
between just the two of us.

426
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,234
Why are you making me leave?

427
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:46,208
I've been detached
from our marriage all that time...

428
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:49,740
because you keep leaving me out
of things like this!

429
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,460
Yes, so you got attached
to records instead,

430
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,671
and you make a living
off of them now.

431
00:26:54,671 --> 00:26:58,087
That's why we broke up.
Stop bringing the past up!

432
00:26:58,087 --> 00:26:59,722
Stop it, you two.

433
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,385
It's not like I'm going to change
my mind.

434
00:27:01,444 --> 00:27:04,460
I get that, but we need to know
why you're breaking up at least.

435
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,623
Well,

436
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:09,026
it's an issue between us two.

437
00:27:09,077 --> 00:27:10,894
That's just it.

438
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:13,497
It's just...

439
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,032
I just...

440
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:17,868
can't marry him.

441
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:21,772
I can't do this.

442
00:27:22,311 --> 00:27:24,346
She's not going to spill it today.

443
00:27:24,346 --> 00:27:27,711
She's like me, so once she decides
on something, she'll stick through.

444
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,714
I know that well.

445
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,583
I was frustrated...

446
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:34,818
so many times
because you're like that.

447
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:36,287
Goodness.

448
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:39,657
So we got a divorce!
Stop bringing up the past!

449
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:42,398
All right.

450
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,429
It's better to not have a husband
at all instead of getting a divorce.

451
00:27:47,269 --> 00:27:50,706
Does this mean...

452
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:53,542
that I have to call
all the relatives?

453
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:54,843
Of course, we do.

454
00:27:54,843 --> 00:27:56,912
I was losing sleep
over having to meet...

455
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:58,714
your sister on the wedding day.

456
00:27:58,714 --> 00:28:00,583
I guess that's one good thing.

457
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:02,885
Are you serious?

458
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:05,789
What are you doing?
We have to test this.

459
00:28:09,225 --> 00:28:10,821
Does it feel real?

460
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:20,236
Hello?

461
00:28:20,236 --> 00:28:24,148
Ms. Seo Ji Sung,
your dress fitting is this week.

462
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:25,703
There's no change in that, right?

463
00:28:26,175 --> 00:28:29,245
Actually, there is.
Could you cancel that?

464
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:31,447
When should we re-schedule, then?

465
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:34,717
No need to re-schedule.
Please just cancel it.

466
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,518
I'll hang up now.

467
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,515
Ms. Seo, that means...

468
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:51,700
Hello?

469
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,064
Ji Sung, it's me. Ji Sung!

470
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,245
I'm in front of your office.
I'll wait until you get out.

471
00:29:15,246 --> 00:29:20,246

472
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,734
Make it quick. I'm busy.

473
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,312
Don't you think...

474
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:39,042
you should give me a chance
to explain my side of the story?

475
00:29:39,381 --> 00:29:40,677
What side of the story?

476
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,947
I'm saying this since you saw
the entire chat.

477
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:48,524
You know that I'm not the kind
to just share that out of nowhere.

478
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:49,925
The guys were...

479
00:29:49,925 --> 00:29:52,594
talking about how big
their girlfriends' boobs are,

480
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,958
and they said that I wouldn't
understand them...

481
00:29:55,764 --> 00:29:59,229
because my girlfriend's boobs
are small.

482
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:01,070
I wanted...

483
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,333
to prove them wrong and prove
that you have big boobs.

484
00:30:03,672 --> 00:30:06,403
That's why I shared those photos.

485
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:09,278
The same goes
for the surveillance cameras.

486
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:10,879
It's not...

487
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:12,876
like I shared that footage online.

488
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:16,452
I just shared a screenshot
of that...

489
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:18,354
to tell the guys
that this is a good way...

490
00:30:18,355 --> 00:30:21,518
to know what your girlfriend needs
and buy them for her.

491
00:30:22,057 --> 00:30:24,121
That was my intention
in sharing that.

492
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:27,491
Do you not understand men?

493
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:34,131
I thought you were a bad person,

494
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:36,733
but it turns out
you're just pathetic.

495
00:30:42,437 --> 00:30:46,714
I told my parents. You tell yours.

496
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:48,345
You can take care of everything.

497
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:50,660
Let's...

498
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,650
never meet again.

499
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:08,777
I told my parents. You tell yours.

500
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:10,363
You can take care of everything.

501
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:12,782
Let's...

502
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,505
never meet again.

503
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,036
Hey, did Manager Seo go somewhere?

504
00:31:29,037 --> 00:31:31,836
- Yes, she did.
- Where did she...

505
00:31:33,334 --> 00:31:34,659
- Hey, guys.
- Oh.

506
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:38,103
You're the clueless newbie
mentioned in the anonymous board.

507
00:31:39,025 --> 00:31:40,038
Hey!

508
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:43,564
- It's been a while, Ye Seul.
- Is Ji Sung not here?

509
00:31:43,565 --> 00:31:46,854
She looked awful, so I brought
some facemasks for her.

510
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:52,167
- Get out of my way.
- You're right.

511
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:53,418
It's all my fault.

512
00:31:53,933 --> 00:31:56,295
I'm sorry for making you upset.

513
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:58,161
I admit I made a mistake.

514
00:31:58,487 --> 00:31:59,414
But you know,

515
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:01,952
you should think more rationally...

516
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,384
instead of being emotional
in situations like this.

517
00:32:04,385 --> 00:32:07,714
Think of our loss
if we call off our wedding.

518
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:10,579
The wedding hall, the dress,
the honeymoon...

519
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,562
I booked and paid the deposit
for everything.

520
00:32:13,563 --> 00:32:15,536
Are you going to pay half of it?

521
00:32:15,537 --> 00:32:18,337
Even if you were to pay me back,
it's still a loss for me.

522
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:21,322
What kind
of inefficient decision is this?

523
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:25,282
I even...

524
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:29,561
shut down the hospital today
to solve our problem.

525
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:33,708
That's how much I value
our relationship.

526
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:38,562
- So please, don't be emotional...
- How could I not be emotional?

527
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:41,063
Just leave me alone!

528
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,493
You didn't shut down
the hospital for me.

529
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:47,517
It's because you're embarrassed
and worried about losing your money.

530
00:32:47,518 --> 00:32:49,146
Please lower your voice.

531
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:50,091
Gosh.

532
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:53,722
You have no idea
how serious this is, do you?

533
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:56,129
If you ever show yourself again,

534
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:59,534
I'll sue your friends
for sexual harassment and contempt,

535
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:02,571
and I'll sue you
for distributing pornography.

536
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,769
- Sue?
- Yes, sue!

537
00:33:12,228 --> 00:33:13,962
Unbelievable.

538
00:33:13,986 --> 00:33:16,534
- Hey, where have you been?
- I was meeting someone.

539
00:33:16,535 --> 00:33:19,784
By the way, that fridge is
totally a fortune-teller!

540
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:20,729
What?

541
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:23,750
- I'll put these in here.
- Sure.

542
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:30,544
This must be the Fridge
that knows if the food's gone bad.

543
00:33:30,545 --> 00:33:31,390
It is.

544
00:33:31,391 --> 00:33:33,509
It recommends you a meal depending
on the user's data...

545
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,352
like gender, age, job,
or other things to note.

546
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:41,444
To give you a tip, you need
to input what you had last night.

547
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,392
That's incredible!

548
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,834
Try it.

549
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,355
- Hey, Fridge.
- Yes, sir.

550
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:48,828
- How can I help you?
- Female in 20s,

551
00:33:48,828 --> 00:33:50,163
lives in Gorae-dong,

552
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:51,985
works in disinfection,

553
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,355
has credit delinquency,

554
00:33:53,356 --> 00:33:57,417
and I had four bottles of soju
last night. What should I have?

555
00:33:58,462 --> 00:34:00,152
You're just the same.

556
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:03,252
You should have another drink today!

557
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:05,406
Oh, my. This is amazing.

558
00:34:05,407 --> 00:34:08,274
- Is that all?
- Yes.

559
00:34:12,225 --> 00:34:13,998
Hey, Manager Seo.

560
00:34:15,886 --> 00:34:18,618
Aren't you slacking off too much
preparing for your wedding?

561
00:34:19,073 --> 00:34:20,653
If I had said that,

562
00:34:20,654 --> 00:34:24,520
you would see me as a jerk
sticking my nose in, so I won't.

563
00:34:24,925 --> 00:34:27,754
How many times have you
sat on your desk today?

564
00:34:27,755 --> 00:34:31,904
- As someone who got married...
- Okay, I won't leave my desk!

565
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:35,821
Did she just cut you off?

566
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:38,542
No, she didn't.

567
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:41,074
She just left
while you were still talking.

568
00:34:41,075 --> 00:34:43,732
Hey, don't be a jerk.
She knows what I'm talking about.

569
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:45,661
What happened?

570
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:49,164
Is Fridge gone?

571
00:34:49,896 --> 00:34:51,621
What's going on?

572
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:55,013
(Jung Han's mother)

573
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:02,529
Hello, Mother.

574
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:10,147
Thanks to you,
my cafe sales are up.

575
00:35:10,148 --> 00:35:13,324
- At least you're having a good day.
- Of course.

576
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:23,606
- Mom, I told you not to...
- Sit down.

577
00:35:31,058 --> 00:35:35,737
A marriage is between two families,
not just between you two.

578
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:40,161
I think certain problems
need meddling,

579
00:35:40,235 --> 00:35:43,216
so I also called your mother over.

580
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:46,450
My mother?

581
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:50,627
Mom!

582
00:35:55,683 --> 00:35:58,231
We've already exchanged
our wedding gifts...

583
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:03,202
and we have to talk about the house,
so I've asked you to come.

584
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,406
By any chance, did we...

585
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:09,133
do anything to offend you
or Ji Sung's father?

586
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:10,993
Of course not.

587
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:14,137
They're grown-ups who made
this decision by themselves.

588
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,465
So I thought it was better for me
to step aside,

589
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:19,547
and let them solve their problem.

590
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,295
Of course, you did the right thing.

591
00:36:23,462 --> 00:36:26,245
But Jung Han told me...

592
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:30,884
that Ji Sung got very upset
about something that Jung Han did.

593
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:35,998
So I thought I should help them
talk it out.

594
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,435
Hey, Ji Sung.

595
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,159
I'm on your side.

596
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,926
I don't know what Jung Han did,

597
00:36:43,927 --> 00:36:48,078
but he says he'll be good forever,
and I'll make sure he does.

598
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,412
Could you please just
forgive him this once?

599
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,700
I...

600
00:37:06,488 --> 00:37:09,626
didn't want to tell you,

601
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:16,342
but your son...

602
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,637
sent a non-consensual photo of me
to his friends.

603
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,468
What kind of photo?

604
00:37:29,495 --> 00:37:31,240
What did he send?

605
00:37:34,626 --> 00:37:37,390
He took a screenshot
of the CCTV camera in my house...

606
00:37:37,905 --> 00:37:40,323
of me in my underwear
and sent it to his friends.

607
00:37:41,486 --> 00:37:43,934
They talked about...

608
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:47,617
how my figure was like
and other stuff.

609
00:37:47,618 --> 00:37:48,521
Hey!

610
00:37:48,825 --> 00:37:50,563
How could you...

611
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:56,988
It wasn't pornography or anything.
It was just a picture,

612
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:59,739
and she wasn't completely naked.

613
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,864
Were you also in that picture?

614
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:05,341
- No, I wasn't.
- You idiot!

615
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:09,531
I never thought my son was
one of those punks in the news.

616
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:14,889
How embarrassing to your family
to act so immaturely at your age!

617
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:18,679
Immature?

618
00:38:19,393 --> 00:38:21,610
How is this being immature?

619
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:28,517
Ji Sung, my son has made
a terrible mistake.

620
00:38:28,518 --> 00:38:30,986
What should we do?

621
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:33,624
- A mistake?
- Yes.

622
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,703
It's all my fault.

623
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:38,913
I've taught my only son wrong.

624
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,040
I don't know...

625
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:45,538
what to say to you.

626
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:50,467
What will it take
for you to forgive us?

627
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:53,870
There's no need.

628
00:38:54,268 --> 00:38:56,107
You don't have to ask
for my forgiveness.

629
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:58,305
Really?

630
00:38:58,511 --> 00:38:59,508
Yes.

631
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:01,849
Because I'm not
going to forgive him.

632
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,765
I'm not going to marry him
and I won't ever see him again.

633
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:08,344
Oh, I see.

634
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,699
I couldn't possibly know
what you're going through,

635
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:17,502
but please.

636
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:23,607
Maybe, we should take some time off
until you cool down a bit.

637
00:39:24,258 --> 00:39:26,462
I don't need to cool down.

638
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,015
I don't need time either.

639
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:29,625
My goodness.

640
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,611
I'm sorry,

641
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:33,984
but we're going to leave now.

642
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,937
- Mom, let's go.
- You're one stubborn girl.

643
00:39:39,214 --> 00:39:40,212
Excuse me?

644
00:39:40,774 --> 00:39:44,009
Do you have to act so cold
when I'm embarrassing my son...

645
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:46,072
in front of you?

646
00:39:47,314 --> 00:39:50,606
It's not like he cheated on you
or beat you up.

647
00:39:50,607 --> 00:39:53,683
He just wanted to show off
his girlfriend to his friends.

648
00:39:53,684 --> 00:39:56,399
You weren't even completely naked!

649
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,966
- Mom, just...
- Be quiet.

650
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,028
On top of that,

651
00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:03,117
even if you were going to marry him,

652
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:07,947
you shouldn't have let him
take such pictures of you!

653
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:11,508
It's your fault for being
photographed in the first place.

654
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,088
Women these days are
so shameless.

655
00:40:21,706 --> 00:40:23,179
I apologize.

656
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:29,346
I didn't educate my daughter...

657
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:33,387
on how to act properly
in situations like this.

658
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:36,746
Well, you don't need to apologize.

659
00:40:38,088 --> 00:40:40,331
He made a mistake too.

660
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:41,755
No.

661
00:40:42,262 --> 00:40:46,346
I think I need
to give you my apology.

662
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,121
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:00,492 --> 00:41:01,887
Oh, my gosh!

664
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,798
- Mom.
- Goodness.

665
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:06,339
- Mom.
- You little...

666
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,346
- Hey, you punk!
- Mom.

667
00:41:07,347 --> 00:41:08,910
Mom.

668
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:10,567
What's wrong with you?

669
00:41:10,658 --> 00:41:11,891
What?

670
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:14,891
You don't deserve to raise
your voice at my daughter.

671
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:18,789
"It's not like he beat you up"?
"It's not like you were naked"?

672
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:20,587
Hey, you scum.

673
00:41:20,876 --> 00:41:23,763
What did you say you did
with my girl's pictures?

674
00:41:23,764 --> 00:41:24,731
A mistake?

675
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:28,417
You call it a mistake when you step
on someone else's foot on a bus.

676
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:31,011
You took pictures of her in secret,
saved them,

677
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:32,928
and shared them on a group chat.
That isn't a mistake.

678
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,237
How is that a mistake?

679
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:37,476
Don't you speak Korean?

680
00:41:37,476 --> 00:41:38,767
Hey!

681
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:40,566
How unsophisticated.

682
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:44,452
This is why I was against a daughter
from divorced parents.

683
00:41:44,452 --> 00:41:48,245
Look here. You aren't divorced,

684
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,657
but your husband cheated on you
his whole life.

685
00:41:51,657 --> 00:41:53,740
What? Says who?

686
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,912
Your son, of course.

687
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:56,996
You crazy brat.

688
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:59,144
Why would you pick on my son
all of a sudden?

689
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:01,611
Imagine this happened
to your daughter.

690
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:05,012
I'm boiling out of rage.

691
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:08,334
Killing him won't be enough
to calm me down.

692
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:12,019
I'm treating her as my daughter.

693
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,315
I'm not unsophisticated like you.

694
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:18,042
I've always thought of her
as my daughter.

695
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,445
Don't make me laugh.

696
00:42:20,445 --> 00:42:23,753
I'm always worried
she might be busy and bothered...

697
00:42:23,893 --> 00:42:26,966
that I don't even text her
unless she texts me first.

698
00:42:26,967 --> 00:42:28,898
Now why would you invite her
to your family's group chat...

699
00:42:28,898 --> 00:42:31,585
when she didn't even marry him yet?

700
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,605
I didn't do that.

701
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:36,218
I told you not to invite her.

702
00:42:36,218 --> 00:42:39,546
- You told me to ask her and do it.
- Seriously!

703
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:41,668
You should've said no.

704
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:43,237
Would you have listened then?

705
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:46,640
She keeps saying no here,
but you aren't listening.

706
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,549
Did you think you were her real mom
and order her around...

707
00:42:49,549 --> 00:42:51,216
because she called you Mother?

708
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:52,812
Hey, forget it!

709
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,063
Call this marriage off.

710
00:42:55,427 --> 00:43:00,247
There's a line of young women
willing to open a hospital for him.

711
00:43:00,248 --> 00:43:02,329
You don't know how lucky you are.

712
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,330
Let's go.

713
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,149
Why do you say it
as if you're calling it off?

714
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:06,836
We're calling it off.

715
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:09,172
They'd never open a hospital
for that punk...

716
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:11,632
if they find out
about who he really is.

717
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:15,241
- He could get sued instead.
- Stop calling him punk, you woman.

718
00:43:15,241 --> 00:43:18,695
- The ball has left my hands now.
- We're calling it off.

719
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:22,213
- My marriage...
- We're not doing this marriage.

720
00:43:22,244 --> 00:43:23,842
is broken for real.

721
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,143
Come over here, you scum.

722
00:43:28,143 --> 00:43:29,391
- Mom.
- Come here.

723
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,856
Mom.

724
00:43:30,856 --> 00:43:33,181
Let's go!

725
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:35,954
Come on.

726
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:45,064
(I will find the one for me
and get married.)

727
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:51,539
So why did you have to go there?

728
00:43:53,903 --> 00:43:57,460
What if I hadn't gone there?

729
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:59,621
You could've sat still
and listened...

730
00:43:59,621 --> 00:44:02,127
to all her ridiculous remarks.

731
00:44:02,565 --> 00:44:04,996
Besides, I didn't say
anything wrong.

732
00:44:05,289 --> 00:44:07,875
We don't have to be submissive
just because our family is poor.

733
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,872
And having a daughter isn't a sin.

734
00:44:10,384 --> 00:44:14,575
You should've told me sooner
about what happened.

735
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:16,649
I didn't want to make you sad.

736
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:18,101
What's there to be sad?

737
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,784
It's fortunate we found out
about it before your wedding.

738
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,151
Exactly.

739
00:44:23,221 --> 00:44:25,589
What if it was after my wedding?

740
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:28,910
Getting divorced would make me
a worse daughter.

741
00:44:29,174 --> 00:44:30,658
So you know.

742
00:44:31,787 --> 00:44:33,013
Still,

743
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,216
I'm sorry I got divorced.

744
00:44:36,712 --> 00:44:38,807
Why would you bring that up here?

745
00:44:39,464 --> 00:44:40,909
You did nothing wrong.

746
00:44:40,909 --> 00:44:44,169
That woman mentioned it first
to find fault with you.

747
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,173
"Against a daughter
from divorced parents."

748
00:44:48,836 --> 00:44:52,880
You said it'd be cowardly
for adults over 30 to talk about...

749
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,574
how their parents' divorce affected
their life and traumatized them.

750
00:44:57,047 --> 00:44:58,883
Right, it's cowardly.

751
00:44:58,884 --> 00:45:02,843
I couldn't do anything for years
since you were born.

752
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:04,974
I raised you with great care.

753
00:45:04,974 --> 00:45:08,728
If you talked about how my divorce
traumatized you after growing up,

754
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:10,450
I'd feel wronged a little.

755
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:14,046
Still, I'm sorry.

756
00:45:18,526 --> 00:45:19,912
I'm sorry too.

757
00:45:23,498 --> 00:45:25,659
Why would you be?

758
00:45:26,136 --> 00:45:28,351
Getting divorced is worse
like you said.

759
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,969
Still, I'm sorry.

760
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,293
You just have to talk back
to me, don't you?

761
00:45:36,293 --> 00:45:40,133
I wish you give birth
to a daughter just like you.

762
00:45:40,194 --> 00:45:41,547
Don't say that.

763
00:45:41,547 --> 00:45:44,122
I'll keep working, so you'll
have to raise her anyway.

764
00:45:45,597 --> 00:45:48,015
Shut your mouth.
I won't fall for your dirty trick.

765
00:45:49,762 --> 00:45:51,636
The bus is here. I'll be off.

766
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,055
I have to go to work early at dawn.

767
00:45:56,055 --> 00:46:00,701
Sorry I can't stay with you
and cook for you on a day like this.

768
00:46:02,141 --> 00:46:04,498
It's okay. Go on.

769
00:46:09,813 --> 00:46:11,289
I'm sorry.

770
00:46:11,524 --> 00:46:12,868
Go.

771
00:46:30,372 --> 00:46:33,028
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

772
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,963
I made some sales
thanks to Ji Sung today,

773
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:41,115
and I'm spending it all with this.

774
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,205
Guys.

775
00:46:44,448 --> 00:46:46,058
I'm upset.

776
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:51,108
You refused to drink when I broke up
with Jeong Sang Hoon.

777
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:55,047
But now you're drinking
because Ji Sung broke up.

778
00:46:55,127 --> 00:46:56,186
Hey.

779
00:46:56,187 --> 00:46:59,140
If we'd had a drink
every time you broke up,

780
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,810
we would've become alcoholic.

781
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:09,284
- Stop it.
- Where did she get so drunk?

782
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,640
She's being like this
after drinking with her ex.

783
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:13,594
What?

784
00:47:13,718 --> 00:47:16,803
Are you insane?
Why did you drink with your ex?

785
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:19,729
Not Jeong Sang Hoon.

786
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:22,094
- It's the one before him.
- Alone?

787
00:47:22,094 --> 00:47:25,629
No, with my ex's ex-girlfriend...

788
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:28,803
and her soon-to-be boyfriend.

789
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,163
Ye Seul.

790
00:47:30,163 --> 00:47:34,153
This is Korea, not Hollywood.

791
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:37,460
But seriously, how did you know?

792
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,830
How did you know that
he posted weird pictures of you...

793
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,147
and spoke ill about you?

794
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:45,622
Just.

795
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:47,664
Just?

796
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:50,432
Did you just think he would?

797
00:47:50,432 --> 00:47:55,319
Then did you just think
that Sang Hoon would be...

798
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:58,114
at that coffee shop
with another woman?

799
00:47:58,114 --> 00:47:59,282
Right.

800
00:47:59,649 --> 00:48:02,368
Maybe she's got a spiritual power.

801
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:07,138
She said my boyfriend was a jerk
every time I dated a guy,

802
00:48:07,138 --> 00:48:10,403
and it all turned out to be true.

803
00:48:11,652 --> 00:48:15,267
Everyone knew it except for you.

804
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,230
Right.

805
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:20,566
No, she's strange these days.

806
00:48:20,567 --> 00:48:21,755
Gosh, she's strange.

807
00:48:21,755 --> 00:48:24,225
- Right?
- That's right.

808
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:26,892
My ancestor helped me.

809
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:30,397
- They helped me.
- Gosh.

810
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:38,454
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

811
00:48:53,188 --> 00:48:54,920
Why are you crying?

812
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:01,145
Why would you cry?

813
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,677
Why did you let me know?

814
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:10,220
Why?

815
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,440
I didn't want to know,

816
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,092
so why would you make me suffer
by letting me know?

817
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:18,305
It's because of you, Fridge.

818
00:49:18,305 --> 00:49:20,609
Because of you!

819
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:22,058
Something like this.

820
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,203
It has to recognize onomatopoeia
and mimetic words too.

821
00:49:26,112 --> 00:49:27,205
She's crying.

822
00:49:33,481 --> 00:49:35,760
Ji Sung, I... What's this?

823
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,451
Well... Ji Sung, wait.

824
00:49:38,451 --> 00:49:40,521
- I told you not to text me.
- Okay.

825
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:41,984
- Don't text me.
- Wait.

826
00:49:41,984 --> 00:49:44,025
- Ji Sung.
- Don't text me.

827
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,014
- My eyes.
- Don't.

828
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:47,413
- Let's go have lunch, guys.
- Shush.

829
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:07,347
Cheers.

830
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:09,575
I saw it all, you punk.

831
00:50:09,575 --> 00:50:12,077
Shut your mouth.
You know too much of my secrets.

832
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:14,510
Wake up, you rude punk.

833
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,451
- Wake up!
- Gosh.

834
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:20,238
- Wake up and go?
- Go.

835
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,223
- Hey, brush your teeth.
- Let me use your toothpaste.

836
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:25,602
- Here.
- Gosh.

837
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:30,131
Gosh, I can't stand this anymore.
Go home now.

838
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:33,268
- I'm bleeding.
- Yes, you are.

839
00:50:40,196 --> 00:50:41,538
Guys.

840
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:45,798
I'm so happy to have a drink
with you every day.

841
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:48,636
- About your ancestor,
- So happy.

842
00:50:49,224 --> 00:50:51,443
it's a kind of spirit, you know.

843
00:50:51,443 --> 00:50:52,984
Tell them to take her.

844
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:55,787
What are ghosts up to,

845
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:59,545
not taking her for behaving nastily
to someone else's husband?

846
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:01,753
Sang Hoon.

847
00:51:01,898 --> 00:51:04,222
- Sang Hoon!
- Let's get you home.

848
00:51:04,222 --> 00:51:06,654
No. Sang Hoon!

849
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,158
You should take a cab too.

850
00:51:08,158 --> 00:51:11,649
It's okay.
I live close, so I can walk.

851
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:15,082
- Are you sure you'll be fine?
- Yes, I'll be fine.

852
00:51:15,425 --> 00:51:19,122
My mind is crystal clear because we
drank for sadness.

853
00:51:20,196 --> 00:51:21,516
I'm going to start walking now.

854
00:51:21,516 --> 00:51:24,048
All right. Bye now.

855
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:27,418
Are you sure we can just let her
walk like that?

856
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,735
I know. But she lives right by,

857
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:33,893
and I think it'd be better
to let her be alone.

858
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:37,407
The two are so drunk,
and you didn't have a single drink?

859
00:51:37,407 --> 00:51:38,398
That's amazing.

860
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:39,690
What's amazing?

861
00:51:39,690 --> 00:51:41,785
We're not supposed to drink tonight.

862
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:44,818
- Let's go.
- Okay.

863
00:51:46,642 --> 00:51:49,057
When are we getting more people
on our team?

864
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:51,629
We've got so much office work
to take care of,

865
00:51:51,629 --> 00:51:53,290
and we have to do night patrols.
That's too much.

866
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:54,914
I don't even have time to work out.

867
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:59,341
We just need to check
the recycling station.

868
00:52:02,123 --> 00:52:03,207
Hey.

869
00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,648
Hold on.

870
00:52:09,241 --> 00:52:11,150
It's her.

871
00:52:11,725 --> 00:52:13,124
That's a human.

872
00:52:13,712 --> 00:52:15,066
Do you know her?

873
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:19,599
Excuse me, ma'am.

874
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:22,486
Excuse me?

875
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,851
I'm sorry.

876
00:52:33,335 --> 00:52:34,621
I'm sorry.

877
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,804
I'm sorry.

878
00:52:46,316 --> 00:52:48,160
No, you can't go in there!

879
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,528
Let me go!

880
00:52:51,474 --> 00:52:52,885
I just want...

881
00:52:53,148 --> 00:52:55,775
to understand Fridge's algorithm,

882
00:52:55,776 --> 00:52:57,216
and its secrets.

883
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:00,168
This thing ruined my life!

884
00:53:00,597 --> 00:53:02,799
This thing ruined my life!

885
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:05,451
- My life is ruined now.
- Hey!

886
00:53:05,451 --> 00:53:07,117
This stupid fridge!

887
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:10,251
How do you know a weirdo like this?
I'm going to record.

888
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,655
Ma'am?

889
00:53:12,325 --> 00:53:14,492
We're going to record this
to prevent any misunderstandings.

890
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,949
It's dangerous for you to try
to stuff yourself into the fridge.

891
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:19,294
Please come this way.

892
00:53:20,418 --> 00:53:21,967
Come on!

893
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:24,484
Excuse me. I'm going to drag you.

894
00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:27,487
Let go!

895
00:53:27,487 --> 00:53:29,275
Let go of me!

896
00:53:36,123 --> 00:53:37,992
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

897
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:41,227
My foot!

898
00:53:41,227 --> 00:53:42,740
My foot went flying off!

899
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,835
Someone, please save my foot!

900
00:53:45,172 --> 00:53:48,017
My foot!

901
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:51,547
Here you go. Here's your foot.

902
00:53:53,489 --> 00:53:54,746
Don't you pretend that you're kind.

903
00:53:54,746 --> 00:53:59,329
I can ask Fridge, and it'll tell me
about all your secrets.

904
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:03,453
Please stop. Do you know
how much trouble you're causing?

905
00:54:04,803 --> 00:54:06,092
Trouble?

906
00:54:06,211 --> 00:54:08,193
You might be wasting our time...

907
00:54:08,193 --> 00:54:10,961
when there's someone or an animal
that's actually in need of help.

908
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,212
It'll be real trouble then.

909
00:54:14,809 --> 00:54:15,904
Yes.

910
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:17,352
I'm trouble.

911
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,052
I'm...

912
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,052
nothing but trouble.

913
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:23,247
I'll help you up.

914
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:27,150
I'm just trouble. I'm sorry.

915
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:31,618
I burned Fridge, so I'm trouble
to Director Oh too.

916
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:34,768
I shot the fire extinguisher at you,
so I'm trouble to you too.

917
00:54:34,768 --> 00:54:36,894
I'm just trouble
to my parents as well.

918
00:54:36,894 --> 00:54:38,089
I'm nothing but trouble.

919
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,778
Excuse me, you dropped your things.

920
00:54:41,017 --> 00:54:43,495
- Where do you live?
- Over there.

921
00:54:43,926 --> 00:54:45,899
Would you like us to take you home?

922
00:54:45,899 --> 00:54:48,765
It's okay. I can go on my own.

923
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,909
- Here I go!
- Hold on.

924
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:54,409
- I'm going!
- You dropped your belongings.

925
00:54:54,409 --> 00:54:56,262
I'll put them in your purse.

926
00:54:57,435 --> 00:54:58,917
I'll get going now.

927
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:00,762
Yes, get home safe.

928
00:55:01,038 --> 00:55:02,124
Thank you.

929
00:55:02,124 --> 00:55:03,518
Get home safe.

930
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:08,022
Here I go.

931
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:17,859
Will I be able to trust anyone
ever again...

932
00:55:18,464 --> 00:55:22,520
after witnessing what Fridge can do?

933
00:55:23,245 --> 00:55:26,536
I'm good.

934
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,665
Honey, how much longer
do we need to do this?

935
00:55:37,322 --> 00:55:39,479
We have to do it
for more than ten minutes...

936
00:55:39,479 --> 00:55:42,488
for the blood to flow well,
which will help us conceive.

937
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,641
We're done!

938
00:55:53,269 --> 00:55:54,364
Are you ready?

939
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:56,567
Yes.

940
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:02,850
Even if it's someone I can
absolutely trust,

941
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:06,962
wouldn't I be curious
about what messages they're sending?

942
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:14,589
Or...

943
00:56:14,888 --> 00:56:19,397
should I give up on trusting anyone
at all and just date anyone?

944
00:56:28,916 --> 00:56:32,079
After reading those messages,

945
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:37,320
will I...

946
00:56:37,711 --> 00:56:41,312
ever be able to love again?

947
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:55,922
Life is so difficult.

948
00:56:55,923 --> 00:56:58,340
I'm going to talk casually.

949
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:02,132
I'm never the type to post
anything like this online.

950
00:57:19,847 --> 00:57:21,068
What is this?

951
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:22,612
(Gossip Time)

952
00:57:25,134 --> 00:57:26,292
What's this?

953
00:57:26,358 --> 00:57:29,230
(Gossip Time)

954
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:36,815
What have I done?
Am I out of my mind?

955
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,622
Where's my phone?

956
00:58:04,311 --> 00:58:06,079
Why don't I have any apps?

957
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:10,242
(The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable right now...)

958
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:13,470
My phone is off?

959
00:58:21,312 --> 00:58:23,385
This is right around my house.

960
00:58:23,385 --> 00:58:25,132
When did the phones switch?

961
00:58:26,998 --> 00:58:28,407
What time is it?

962
00:58:29,041 --> 00:58:32,368
My goodness. I have to get to work.

963
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:39,987
The day after I wondered...

964
00:58:40,204 --> 00:58:45,733
whether I'd be able to fall in love
after knowing what Fridge can do,

965
00:58:54,856 --> 00:58:56,035
the wind...

966
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,604
started blowing again.

967
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:13,415
(Please Don't Date Him)

968
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:16,617
(Special thanks to Jung Hyung Don,
YJP, and Lee Ji Ha)

969
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,955
I only had a brief glimpse of him,

970
00:59:27,271 --> 00:59:28,974
and he's very handsome.

971
00:59:30,999 --> 00:59:34,541
There's a woman who betrayed
her fiancé and got pregnant...

972
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,194
with another man,
and she apparently works here.

973
00:59:36,194 --> 00:59:39,028
- People are too much.
- How's it going?

974
00:59:39,029 --> 00:59:42,032
- You've tried so hard.
- Are we trying the next solution?

975
00:59:42,032 --> 00:59:44,083
- Sure, if you'd like.
- Is it just me who wants a baby?

976
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:47,515
He's like a model, and his face is
perfectly my type.

977
00:59:47,515 --> 00:59:51,776
Why do bad things keep happening?

978
00:59:52,295 --> 00:59:53,798
This is all a misunderstanding!

979
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:58,251
- Wake up, Ji Sung.
- Wake up!
