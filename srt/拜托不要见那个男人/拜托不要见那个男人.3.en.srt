1
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:11,685
To minimize the loss of lives
in case of a fire outbreak,

2
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:14,693
the fire truck should make an entry
in five minutes or the golden time.

3
00:00:15,204 --> 00:00:18,392
If the entry gets delayed
due to illegal parking,

4
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:19,990
it will increase the loss of lives.

5
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:24,976
But now, with big data, our response
time can be reduced.

6
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:29,016
Based on the data of 30,000 cases
we've been on for five years,

7
00:00:29,016 --> 00:00:30,635
we analyzed
the location information...

8
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:33,050
to find out the area where
traffic gets delayed habitually.

9
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,598
(Direction of the quickest route
to the reported area)

10
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:37,637
Just as we prevent diseases
with big data,

11
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:42,525
we can now prevent accidents
with it as well.

12
00:00:43,717 --> 00:00:44,717
Very good.

13
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:46,766
Good job with the presentation.

14
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:52,403
I...

15
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,680
am not really sure what big data is.

16
00:00:56,861 --> 00:00:59,544
Big data will show
the quickest route.

17
00:00:59,762 --> 00:01:01,188
I'm amazed.

18
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:03,438
They didn't report
a construction here.

19
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:07,833
But wouldn't the small data
that you get on the field...

20
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:11,834
and through experience
be as crucial as big data?

21
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:15,544
Please, find my baby.

22
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:20,794
Geez.

23
00:01:20,794 --> 00:01:22,180
In 1, 2, 3.

24
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:23,778
Oh, here it is.

25
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:25,695
Baby.

26
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,205
- Are you all right? Thank you.
- What may seem trivial to some...

27
00:01:30,205 --> 00:01:32,832
could be a meaningful incident
for others.

28
00:01:33,711 --> 00:01:35,711
Predicting only small things...

29
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:38,801
and doing the best I can
for my small role tomorrow.

30
00:01:38,801 --> 00:01:41,187
That's what I thought I should do.

31
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,971
I believed my days would continue
to be ordinary and trivial.

32
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,699
Until I met her.

33
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:19,211
(Please Don't Date Him)

34
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:44,673
My gosh. Didn't you miss
the cat because of me?

35
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:47,057
Oh, it's all right.
I was too careless.

36
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:50,452
I'm sorry. I'm allergic to cats.
What do I do?

37
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:51,453
That's okay.

38
00:02:51,477 --> 00:02:54,421
I've been trying to catch it
for a month, so I know its moves.

39
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,909
You were after it for a month but
lost it because of me. I'm sorry.

40
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:58,928
No worries.

41
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:03,606
The bus. I'm sorry to ask you this,
but something's wrong with my phone.

42
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:07,107
Could you check
when Bus 303 will get here?

43
00:03:07,107 --> 00:03:09,968
Or else I have to cross the road
to get a taxi.

44
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,319
Do you see the building over there?

45
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,736
If you cross the parking lot
behind it,

46
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:16,044
it'll take you five minutes less
to the station.

47
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:19,197
And Bus 303 arrives every hour,

48
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:21,076
so you'd be able to make it
if you run for it.

49
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,193
I've been living here for three
years. There's a shortcut there?

50
00:03:24,386 --> 00:03:25,939
Well...

51
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm sorry about this. But not now.

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,492
What? It's really a shortcut.

53
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,064
Bus 303.

54
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,647
- Hi, Fridge.
- Yes, please go on.

55
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,688
A man in his 50s.

56
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,688
He lives in Hansim-dong.

57
00:03:56,688 --> 00:03:58,660
The brain in an IT company.

58
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,857
An outdated expert on IT.
His dinner tonight was yukgaejang.

59
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:02,907
Mr. Oh Byung Gil, you can't separate
work from your personal life.

60
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:05,650
Your favorite card to use is
the company card.

61
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:08,724
What should I have this morning?

62
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:13,826
Director Oh.

63
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:16,467
I recommend
dried pollack hangover soup.

64
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,811
Manager Seo. The recommendation
function is complete.

65
00:04:18,811 --> 00:04:20,584
Move over. I need to check
if the recipe is on it too.

66
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:22,532
Hold on. Director Oh.

67
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,640
I was going to report to you
right away.

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,147
You see...

69
00:04:30,754 --> 00:04:32,192
This is perfect.

70
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,297
The layout is much better now.

71
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:37,582
What happened?

72
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:39,117
I'm sure personal data came on.

73
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,167
What do you say?

74
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,345
Did you get a solution
when you followed my tip?

75
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:44,207
Did the bug get fixed?
How's this possible?

76
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:47,323
You should've reported to me
right away if you fixed the bug.

77
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:50,447
- Let's do the PPT as scheduled.
- I can't do that.

78
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:51,666
Why not?

79
00:04:52,714 --> 00:04:54,005
Everything's been solved.

80
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,048
I should report first.

81
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:00,172
- Well, Fridge has a serious...
- Mr. Ok.

82
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:02,122
What are you doing?

83
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,445
Pardon?

84
00:05:04,647 --> 00:05:06,953
I was putting on lip balm
as it's dry in here.

85
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:08,792
Not the lip balm.
What are you filming?

86
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,458
I was shooting a Vlog
before getting to work.

87
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,458
Hello, everyone.

88
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,581
Hello, Director Oh.

89
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,060
- Mr. Ok.
- Yes?

90
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,197
Turn it off already. Didn't you
learn it when you started here?

91
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,909
Filming inside the company
is strictly prohibited.

92
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,557
Isn't that the headquarter? This is
the research and development center.

93
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:29,953
We develop new products
at the development center.

94
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:32,166
Don't you think it'd be
the most sensitive to security?

95
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:35,795
Things are noisy
with Jatnamu Sup as it is.

96
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:37,783
Let's not stir trouble
by doing something like that.

97
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,539
Turn it off!

98
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:41,355
Let's not make trouble.

99
00:05:41,355 --> 00:05:42,770
What about Jatnamu Sup?

100
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,370
The higher-ups are bent on
catching the manager of Jatnamu Sup.

101
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,370
Why would they do that
when they failed for years now?

102
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:50,804
The postings are becoming
more explicit there.

103
00:05:50,804 --> 00:05:53,203
Didn't you see it today?
How can they say that of the CEO?

104
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:56,824
They've been posting personal data
of the staff on it.

105
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,490
So the higher-ups are waiting
for a chance.

106
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,820
Well, private information
is a big issue these days.

107
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,986
You should all be careful.

108
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:06,120
Especially you, Mr. Ok.
If you're not careful,

109
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,240
you can be suspected and being
associated with Jatnamu Sup.

110
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,355
- By the way, Manager Seo.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,749
Fridge has a serious what?

112
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:19,770
Oh, there is nothing, sir.

113
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,342
Let's do the PPT as planned.

114
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,699
You got the function that picks out
rotten food to work, right?

115
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,410
I...

116
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,267
It's definitely gone bad.

117
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:34,770
Smell it.

118
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:38,271
Excuse me. I need to go
to the bathroom.

119
00:06:38,594 --> 00:06:39,993
How do you eat this? Goodness.

120
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:41,993
This one's gone bad. Mr. Ok.

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,287
Did I drink too much yesterday?
Just seeing food makes me nauseated.

122
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:01,796
If he finds out
that Fridge has private information,

123
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,922
won't I be suspected as well?
I should've reported earlier.

124
00:07:04,922 --> 00:07:07,419
I knew she'd do something like this.

125
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,170
Manager Seo.
Did you see it on Jatnamu Sup?

126
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,432
No, what is it?

127
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,812
(The mistress of the CEO
at Pelican Electronics)

128
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,235
No way.

129
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:18,313
Press the link.

130
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,681
But don't you think
they could've met over work?

131
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:24,319
Look at when the photo was taken.

132
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,663
Would she meet the CEO
for work at this hour?

133
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,785
Well, it was 11 at night.

134
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,575
She must've spent the night out.

135
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,983
Isn't that right?

136
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,348
Thank you.

137
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,130
Yes, Director Oh.
I'll be right there. Okay.

138
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:11,501
I must've got on her bad side again.

139
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,064
If it's true about her relationship
with the CEO,

140
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,439
then I'm screwed. I'm done for.

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,201
But why won't the owner
of this phone call?

142
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:24,054
I can't get around this.

143
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,727
- Manager Seo.
- Yes?

144
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:31,778
Your vacation for the wedding
is the 12th, right?

145
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,778
It's not the 9th but the 12th.

146
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,781
- Yes.
- Two days overlap with mine.

147
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,152
Can't you adjust your honeymoon
schedule a little bit?

148
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:46,257
If I said that, I'd be a senseless
boss, so forget that.

149
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:49,504
But two days is a lot.
You're capable of that, Manager Seo.

150
00:08:52,094 --> 00:08:53,081
I'm...

151
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,525
not going on a honeymoon.

152
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:58,769
Why won't you go on the honeymoon?

153
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,012
So you came up with a solution.

154
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:06,812
Did you put off the honeymoon
because of the development schedule?

155
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,669
Really?

156
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:10,487
- You delayed it for work?
- You're like an angel.

157
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,998
- Goodness.
- It's not that.

158
00:09:12,998 --> 00:09:14,872
Actually...

159
00:09:16,634 --> 00:09:18,479
My goodness. Welcome.

160
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:25,383
She's the one from Jatnamu Sup.

161
00:09:25,922 --> 00:09:27,692
Everyone pay attention.

162
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,482
She'll be joining
our team from today.

163
00:09:30,507 --> 00:09:33,292
This is Deputy Manager Hwang Ga Eul.
Round of applause.

164
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:36,952
Please give it to me.
I'll hold it for you.

165
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,234
Your office is over there.

166
00:09:39,234 --> 00:09:41,587
We're still cleaning up the place.

167
00:09:41,587 --> 00:09:42,543
So?

168
00:09:42,802 --> 00:09:44,716
- Did you hear her voice?
- No.

169
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:47,780
Should we look into her?
We can hoggle her.

170
00:09:48,636 --> 00:09:50,332
Can you do that to someone?

171
00:09:50,332 --> 00:09:52,319
What's wrong with it?
It's open information.

172
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:55,054
Those who dig up private data
are the bad ones.

173
00:09:55,393 --> 00:09:58,698
What if you find it out
without digging into it?

174
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,859
- Sorry?
- Never mind.

175
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,312
Don't do it. Why would you do that?

176
00:10:03,485 --> 00:10:07,057
Right. She's the CEO's girlfriend.
That says it all.

177
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,993
Don't believe what people say
on the anonymous board.

178
00:10:08,993 --> 00:10:12,325
So many people quit working
because of that board.

179
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:15,318
I mean, think about it.
Why would a woman in her 20s...

180
00:10:15,318 --> 00:10:17,564
go out with a married man
in his 50s?

181
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,413
Several people saw them on a date.

182
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:24,145
And not every story is a lie
in the anonymous board.

183
00:10:24,432 --> 00:10:25,920
I bet most of them are.

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,551
They say Joo Woo Jae lives
in this neighborhood,

185
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:29,062
but I've never seen him.

186
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,805
- Joo Woo Jae?
- He's a handsome model.

187
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,805
His looks are totally my style.

188
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:36,551
- Goodness.
- After all that you went through,

189
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:38,147
are you still not
over handsome guys?

190
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,764
Why must I?

191
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,481
I'll be into handsome guys
until the day I die.

192
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,593
Occupations, personalities,
preferences all have variables.

193
00:10:45,593 --> 00:10:48,613
But it's most objective
when it comes to looks.

194
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:53,487
Your words are
unexpectedly so persuasive.

195
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,837
Oh, how is it going
with the hospital?

196
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,054
Mr. Lee asked me earlier today.

197
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:00,681
Yes, tell him it's great.

198
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:01,748
I'm going there today too.

199
00:11:02,609 --> 00:11:04,210
I'm darn lonely.

200
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,555
Isn't there any guy
that can capture my attention?

201
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,822
Thank goodness
everyone got rescued safely.

202
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:14,895
Tell me about it.
Seat belts are really important.

203
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,881
Let's go have lunch.

204
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:20,062
There's a place
I've wanted to go nearby here.

205
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:21,493
I need to go find Guk Su.

206
00:11:21,493 --> 00:11:23,286
What? You'll go eat guksu alone?

207
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:27,551
No, it's the troublemaker cat
I'm looking for.

208
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:30,170
- Its name is Guk Su.
- Oh, I see.

209
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,021
Guk Hee and Guk Su.
They have the same Guk in the names.

210
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,267
Goodness, it was so close
to catching it last time.

211
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:39,328
Look for it, and call me
if it's not around.

212
00:11:39,554 --> 00:11:41,939
Oh, right.
Did you get your phone back?

213
00:11:42,516 --> 00:11:45,076
- Oh, I forgot.
- You silly.

214
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,847
You should do that first.

215
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,438
Here, try calling it.

216
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,748
During the presentation, let's
present the robot cleaner, Cane,

217
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:55,536
and the smart refrigerator, Fridge.

218
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,442
We'll keep the scheduled date.

219
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,467
Can't we postpone it a little?

220
00:11:59,793 --> 00:12:02,413
Why? You've fixed
all the errors on Fridge.

221
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,956
Is there any problem?

222
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:06,679
Mr. Jeong Sang Hoon.
Your spending and loans...

223
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:08,082
are already too much.

224
00:12:08,082 --> 00:12:10,202
Mr. Bang Jung Han, you pursue
amicable relationships with others.

225
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:11,393
You're very popular...

226
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:13,722
- in your group chat these days.
- What should I eat now?

227
00:12:13,722 --> 00:12:15,387
Have another drink today.

228
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,226
This is fascinating.

229
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:19,940
Personal data randomly pops up.

230
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,383
It's not stable yet.

231
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:23,382
It's just a prototype,
so let's proceed first.

232
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:26,512
If we postpone it more,
the upper management will think...

233
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,158
we're developing all year round
and try to deduct the budget.

234
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,587
Any other ideas
about the presentation?

235
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,418
Yes, Mr. Ok. How smart of you.

236
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:37,678
- Do you have a good idea?
- It's noon.

237
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:41,049
Are you saying
we should do it at noon?

238
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,250
No, it's lunchtime.

239
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,559
Aren't you going to have lunch?

240
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,734
The company cafeteria is serving
tteokgalbi today. We must hurry.

241
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,285
Or can I go first?

242
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:53,565
Who cares about the presentation?
Go on ahead.

243
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:55,934
Did he get his job
through nepotism or what?

244
00:12:55,934 --> 00:12:57,512
- He's just crazy.
- My gosh.

245
00:12:57,512 --> 00:13:00,109
Did you stay like that
without a chair this whole time?

246
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,283
Tteokgalbi.

247
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:08,982
For over an hour...
Didn't you get cramps in your legs?

248
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,210
Why don't you join us for lunch?

249
00:13:24,322 --> 00:13:26,296
Let's go have lunch.

250
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:28,734
I have an upset stomach.
You guys can go without me.

251
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:30,180
Okay.

252
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,337
He's finally calling me.

253
00:13:36,262 --> 00:13:37,697
Hello?

254
00:13:41,793 --> 00:13:44,029
Manager Seo is so impressive.

255
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,780
She put off her honeymoon for work.

256
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,524
- How ambitious!
- I doubt it's because of work.

257
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:51,075
- I'd say it's something else.
- Like what?

258
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,649
I think she's skipping her honeymoon
because of...

259
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:56,160
- money.
- Her pregnancy.

260
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,146
- Her pregnancy?
- What?

261
00:13:59,518 --> 00:14:01,376
Don't you remember this morning?

262
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,855
- I need to go to the bathroom.
- It often comes out in dramas.

263
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,479
Morning sickness.

264
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't call me!
I told you not to call me!

265
00:14:10,842 --> 00:14:12,842
She easily gets annoyed these days.

266
00:14:13,248 --> 00:14:15,248
She eats a lot of sour food.

267
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,566
She has a huge appetite.

268
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,831
She often dozes off too.

269
00:14:27,432 --> 00:14:30,260
Right. It's for sure.

270
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:48,021
Excuse me. Are you here
to get your phone...

271
00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:52,687
- Gosh.
- Hello.

272
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,863
- Did you have my phone?
- Oh, right.

273
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,704
- This is the one, right?
- Yes.

274
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:04,510
We use the same phone case.

275
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,375
I got it as a gift
from the owner of my regular store.

276
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:09,936
That's why ours got switched.

277
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:13,407
But when? I don't recall it at all.

278
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,189
I think it was at that time.

279
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:18,152
Don't you remember about yesterday?

280
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:20,675
- Let go of me.
- Gosh.

281
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:22,325
- Get off!
- What...

282
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,797
My shoe!

283
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,383
Let us...

284
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,462
- I'll get going.
- How did you meet this lunatic?

285
00:15:28,462 --> 00:15:30,462
- Going and going.
- Wait. Excuse me.

286
00:15:31,675 --> 00:15:32,691
Right.

287
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,900
I don't remember it clearly,

288
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:39,461
but I guess it was then.

289
00:15:40,021 --> 00:15:42,568
And you got a lot of calls.

290
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:44,256
I couldn't pick up
because I was working.

291
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,959
Well...

292
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:47,697
(56 missed calls)

293
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,197
(37 unread messages)

294
00:15:49,197 --> 00:15:50,757
It's so many.

295
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,189
(Ji Sung, please. Who's that punk?
What motel is it? Geumhwang Inn?)

296
00:15:53,214 --> 00:15:54,991
Motel? What is he talking about?

297
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:57,983
It seems your boyfriend
got the wrong idea.

298
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,264
Yesterday...

299
00:16:00,452 --> 00:16:03,329
Bring Ae Sook here.

300
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,191
Or I'll jump off.

301
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,021
- Oh, no.
- My goodness.

302
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,778
- This way.
- Oh, no.

303
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,460
- Hurry up.
- Hey!

304
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:12,871
Hurry and bring Ae Sook to me.

305
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:14,656
I miss her.

306
00:16:15,046 --> 00:16:17,871
Call Ae Sook over here!
Bring her here already.

307
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,963
Do it already!

308
00:16:19,963 --> 00:16:21,635
Or I'll jump off.

309
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,175
Ae Sook.

310
00:16:26,413 --> 00:16:30,119
Gosh, my chest hurts!

311
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,119
Darn, you firefighter.

312
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,864
- I'm going to sue you.
- It couldn't be helped...

313
00:16:33,864 --> 00:16:36,053
- to avoid you from falling. Sorry.
- Whatever.

314
00:16:36,053 --> 00:16:37,358
What is your name?

315
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,364
- Ouch.
- Wait.

316
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,985
- Are you hitting me?
- Get up.

317
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:44,001
Goodness. What's with you?

318
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,351
What... What is your name?

319
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:49,001
Do you know who I am?

320
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:51,755
- You... Wait there.
- Good work.

321
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:54,591
- Goodness. Hello, sir.
- What?

322
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,435
Ae Sook is waiting for you outside.

323
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,424
- Ae Sook?
- Let's talk outside.

324
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,424
- Is she here?
- Yes.

325
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:02,291
- Ae Sook...
- Put on your shoes.

326
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:03,967
No, where is she?

327
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,306
Hello?

328
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:18,851
Who are you?
Isn't that Seo Ji Sung's phone?

329
00:17:20,853 --> 00:17:22,038
Where are you?

330
00:17:22,064 --> 00:17:23,211
(Motel)

331
00:17:23,236 --> 00:17:24,499
Why are you in a motel...

332
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:27,471
Why are you in a motel room?

333
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,749
Ji Sung. No, right?

334
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:30,952
It's not what I imagine it is,
right?

335
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,828
You went there
to wash your feet, right?

336
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:34,746
- Sir, that's not it.
- Let me talk to her.

337
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,031
- What's with you, punk?
- Calm down.

338
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:38,159
Sir.

339
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:47,328
Ji Sung! Please...

340
00:17:47,328 --> 00:17:50,238
No, right? Ji Sung!

341
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:52,614
So your boyfriend
got the wrong idea.

342
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:54,161
He isn't my boyfriend.

343
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,286
Your husband might need
some explanation.

344
00:17:57,286 --> 00:17:59,765
- He's not my husband either.
- Then is he your stalker?

345
00:18:00,664 --> 00:18:02,071
No.

346
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:06,700
Well, he is neither your boyfriend,
husband, nor stalker,

347
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,989
but if he needs some explanation...

348
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:11,148
I don't need
to explain anything to him.

349
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:13,131
I see.

350
00:18:13,952 --> 00:18:15,695
Okay.

351
00:18:16,368 --> 00:18:18,629
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

352
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,574
What are you doing?

353
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:29,145
Are you looking for the cat
from earlier in the morning?

354
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:30,334
Oh, yes.

355
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,997
The cat is a little hurt,
and it'll be dangerous if it rains.

356
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:34,333
I want to find it before then.

357
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,529
I'm partly responsible
for its missing,

358
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:40,227
so I'll help you out.

359
00:18:42,144 --> 00:18:43,815
Hold on a second.

360
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:46,290
I remember an online community
for stray cats in Gorae-dong.

361
00:18:47,276 --> 00:18:48,959
I think it's this one.

362
00:18:49,274 --> 00:18:52,034
Isn't this the guy?

363
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,813
Right. How...

364
00:18:54,838 --> 00:18:56,723
I saw it earlier.

365
00:18:56,723 --> 00:18:59,148
I'll screen-capture this
and post it on social media.

366
00:18:59,148 --> 00:19:00,277
Like this.

367
00:19:00,277 --> 00:19:02,118
(New posting)

368
00:19:02,118 --> 00:19:03,372
(Please contact me
if you see this cat.)

369
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:04,643
And...

370
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:06,146
(I will compensate.)

371
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,727
And like this.

372
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:14,063
Done. We'll hear from someone soon.

373
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,084
It will be hard
because it's a stray cat.

374
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:20,535
Social media is faster
and more accurate than expected.

375
00:19:20,716 --> 00:19:22,107
I see.

376
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,287
You don't believe it?

377
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,068
Why don't we make a bet then?

378
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,571
On who finds the cat first.

379
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:36,149
I finally get to try your food.

380
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:37,971
I'll have curry yuja juice...

381
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,166
and rich soybean sandwich
with strawberry and braised pollack.

382
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,166
- Sure, wait a little.
- Okay.

383
00:19:45,682 --> 00:19:47,169
(Juice Extraction Barista
Level Two Certificate)

384
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,644
That's why your cafe's name
is Natural Food, Tak.

385
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,644
Because your name is Tak Gi Hyun.

386
00:19:53,722 --> 00:19:56,441
It's so easy to memorize.

387
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:00,361
I bet you're getting curious
about my name.

388
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:02,501
So let me reveal my name.

389
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,391
My name is Gam Oh Jung.

390
00:20:05,391 --> 00:20:07,611
Kim Oh Jung? No.

391
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,293
It's Gam Oh Jung.

392
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:11,945
You just get it, right?

393
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,039
Gam Oh Jung and Tak Gi Hyun.

394
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,949
That's some quite unique plating.
I love it.

395
00:20:24,949 --> 00:20:26,751
The curry yuja juice!

396
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,952
I can smell it already.

397
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,254
Welcome.

398
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,926
Do you have any regular coffee?

399
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:38,262
Sorry, we only serve
an organic menu here.

400
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:42,667
Drink something organic
instead of caffeinated coffee.

401
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,769
You have to look after yourselves
when you're in your 20s.

402
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,072
Come on. We're in our 40s.

403
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,308
Don't joke around like that.

404
00:20:50,308 --> 00:20:51,909
You're clearly 27 and 28.

405
00:20:52,948 --> 00:20:54,078
No,

406
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:55,379
you ladies are
definitely college first-years.

407
00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,484
I'll take
the mugwort and garlic yogurt.

408
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:02,320
I'll take some cabbage kohlrabi
wasabi juice.

409
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,154
Okay.

410
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:21,439
This is delicious!

411
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:22,573
It's incredible.

412
00:21:28,012 --> 00:21:28,913
Just amazing.

413
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,348
Because it's organic.

414
00:21:30,348 --> 00:21:31,558
I'm blown away.

415
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,717
Hello?

416
00:21:33,513 --> 00:21:35,144
Yes, honey.

417
00:21:35,144 --> 00:21:37,588
I'll meet you there. I'll go there.

418
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,956
See you later.

419
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,264
Why are there no cabs?

420
00:21:54,526 --> 00:21:57,241
Why don't you ride the bike
instead of dragging it?

421
00:21:57,241 --> 00:22:00,511
It was fine, but the gear is broken.

422
00:22:00,714 --> 00:22:02,213
Would you like me to take
a look at it?

423
00:22:03,214 --> 00:22:06,150
It's fine. The bike is really old.

424
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,587
I've tried everything
but couldn't fix it.

425
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,622
That makes me even more determined.

426
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,724
I'll take a look at it.

427
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:18,963
Show me.

428
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,300
It's common for the derailleur
to move downward,

429
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,168
but you only hear the chains spin
and nothing happen.

430
00:22:24,168 --> 00:22:28,580
When that happens, you have to...

431
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:31,214
unwind this to the right,
then pull to the left.

432
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:33,578
As you turn this,

433
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:36,128
put...

434
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,682
the gear to one,

435
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:40,484
then pull the barrel to the left
and unwind to the right.

436
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,254
Once you repeat the motion
a few times,

437
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:44,455
click.

438
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:45,990
It's good now.

439
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:50,428
See how well it's working?

440
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,734
See?

441
00:22:57,602 --> 00:22:58,769
All good now?

442
00:22:58,769 --> 00:22:59,937
It's working great.

443
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,572
Thank you.

444
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,277
What time is it? This is bad.

445
00:23:06,978 --> 00:23:10,014
How can there be no cabs
on the road?

446
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,749
It'll be nearly impossible
to catch a cab right now.

447
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:14,018
There's an event going on nearby,
so all of them are probably there.

448
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,853
Is that right?

449
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,886
Lunchtime is almost over.

450
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:20,157
It seems like I'll be late.
I'm going to get scolded.

451
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:22,059
What should I do?

452
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:39,477
Would it be possible...

453
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:41,292
for you...

454
00:23:41,924 --> 00:23:43,180
to go faster?

455
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,515
Sure.

456
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:54,992
Would you like me to do it?

457
00:23:55,459 --> 00:23:58,362
No, I'll go faster.

458
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:14,712
Dr. Bang, aren't you going
to go and get lunch?

459
00:24:16,847 --> 00:24:18,783
Is it really possible?

460
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,051
What is?

461
00:24:20,051 --> 00:24:22,286
Is it really possible to go
to a motel with another man...

462
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:26,223
so soon after a breakup?

463
00:24:26,958 --> 00:24:28,359
That's possible...

464
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:31,028
if the ex was trash
and she really hates the ex.

465
00:24:31,028 --> 00:24:32,530
Goodness.

466
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,199
Are you crying?

467
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,402
Is it about you?

468
00:24:39,417 --> 00:24:40,905
No, not me. It's my friend.

469
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:42,273
I feel so bad for him.

470
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,141
There are stages to a breakup.

471
00:24:44,141 --> 00:24:46,243
You can't just jump out
of a relationship.

472
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:48,012
It's about my friend, not me.

473
00:24:50,318 --> 00:24:51,652
I have to ask you something.

474
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,859
Safe!

475
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,261
Thank you for dropping me off.

476
00:25:04,261 --> 00:25:06,764
Thank you. Please get home safely.

477
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:14,872
Hello?

478
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:16,173
Ji Sung, it's me.

479
00:25:16,173 --> 00:25:19,744
I'm borrowing someone else's phone
since you won't take my calls.

480
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,013
I told you not to call.

481
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:23,781
Don't hang up! Please!

482
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:25,349
What is it?

483
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,884
Let me just ask you one thing.

484
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:29,387
Did you sleep with someone?

485
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:30,354
What?

486
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,189
Did you sleep with a man
at the motel?

487
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,358
What's wrong with him?

488
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:37,361
Why won't you answer me? Hello?
Ji Sung!

489
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:38,996
Ji Sung!

490
00:25:39,563 --> 00:25:41,399
You have to answer me!

491
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,339
It's my friend's girlfriend.

492
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,641
He told me to call her.

493
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:53,544
I see.

494
00:25:54,948 --> 00:25:56,147
I feel so bad for him.

495
00:25:56,147 --> 00:25:57,114
Here she is.

496
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,619
- I'm not late!
- Don't run.

497
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:02,853
Manager Seo,

498
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:07,391
the team has prepared this for you.
Congratulations!

499
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:08,519
Congratulations on what?

500
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,928
Have a seat. We'll talk after.

501
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,196
What?

502
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,331
What's going on?

503
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,433
How many months has it been?

504
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,235
- Looks like a four-month-old.
- Sorry?

505
00:26:18,803 --> 00:26:21,105
Congratulations on your pregnancy!

506
00:26:24,144 --> 00:26:25,209
Pregnancy?

507
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,177
Who? Me?

508
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:29,280
We're a family. No need to hide it.

509
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,782
You're not going on a honeymoon
because you're pregnant.

510
00:26:31,782 --> 00:26:34,418
What? Pregnant?

511
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,954
That's not why I didn't go
on the honeymoon.

512
00:26:36,954 --> 00:26:38,522
- Why else?
- Why else would you not go?

513
00:26:41,692 --> 00:26:43,089
Well...

514
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,896
The thing is,

515
00:26:46,497 --> 00:26:48,332
we broke up.

516
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:49,867
Broke what?

517
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,871
The marriage is off.

518
00:26:53,871 --> 00:26:55,773
That's why we're not going
on a honeymoon.

519
00:26:55,773 --> 00:26:57,007
What about the baby, then?

520
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:58,976
I told you I'm not pregnant.

521
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,511
Didn't you ask Ms. Lee
about the obstetrics doctor...

522
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:02,813
because you're pregnant?

523
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:04,615
How are your visits to the doctor?

524
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:07,118
They're going great, thanks to you.

525
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:10,355
- The office is so nice.
- Right?

526
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:13,090
I gave birth
to my first two kids there.

527
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:14,925
Really?

528
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,393
That's because Gi Hyun...

529
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:19,196
Anyway, I'm not pregnant.

530
00:27:19,196 --> 00:27:20,931
Leave. I'm not.

531
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,166
- Take them back.
- Manager Seo,

532
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,301
no need to hide it from us.

533
00:27:24,535 --> 00:27:25,703
Feel better!

534
00:27:25,703 --> 00:27:27,304
You have to think about the child.

535
00:27:27,304 --> 00:27:29,511
Think what for the child?
I told you I'm not pregnant.

536
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:30,480
Come on.

537
00:27:30,481 --> 00:27:31,847
You have to eat well.

538
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:34,311
Tell me if you crave anything.
I'll get anything for you.

539
00:27:34,311 --> 00:27:36,680
I'm telling you, I'm not pregnant!

540
00:27:36,792 --> 00:27:40,518
She says she's not pregnant!

541
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:46,390
Manager Seo,

542
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,992
are you pregnant?

543
00:27:47,992 --> 00:27:49,126
No, I'm not.

544
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,295
You all heard that, right?

545
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,997
Yes, ma'am.

546
00:27:58,347 --> 00:28:01,038
It's been two years since we've been
having sex without a condom.

547
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,440
We had sex twice in a row last week
for my ovulation period.

548
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,075
It was three times, actually.

549
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,110
You're right.

550
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,546
I did a handstand after having sex
three times.

551
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:11,582
Such methods haven't been proven
to be effective scientifically.

552
00:28:11,582 --> 00:28:13,984
The egg is important
for impregnation too,

553
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:16,353
but so are the sperms.
You know that, right?

554
00:28:16,353 --> 00:28:18,389
He's been free of smoking
and drinking alcohol...

555
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,958
for a whole year to have good sperm.

556
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,826
I've also been wearing boxer shorts
instead of briefs.

557
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,095
You've done so much until now,

558
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:27,264
but it didn't work this time.

559
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:35,272
Are we moving
onto the next stage then?

560
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:41,212
(Time for medication)

561
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:55,893
What do you think?

562
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:59,948
In order to have a child
by the latter half of next year,

563
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,499
artificial insemination doesn't
sound like a bad idea.

564
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,568
Are we aiming
for early next next year?

565
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:07,104
I thought we agreed on this
before we got married...

566
00:29:07,404 --> 00:29:10,374
to absolutely have a child
by the end of the first three years.

567
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,309
But that can be amended
at our discretion.

568
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:14,044
We had that rule too.

569
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:18,115
Thirty-seven is the latest age
to give birth to a healthy child.

570
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:19,683
I don't have much time left.

571
00:29:19,683 --> 00:29:21,819
Let's go with it
if that's what you want.

572
00:29:25,261 --> 00:29:27,024
Am I the only one wanting this?

573
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,893
Of course not.

574
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,829
I also want a child.

575
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,969
(Here's a report from Jatnamu Sup.)

576
00:29:40,214 --> 00:29:42,730
(Ms. S' marriage has been called off
all because...)

577
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,495
(You have a new message.)

578
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:49,183
(Here's a report from Jatnamu Sup.)

579
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,183
Hey. Have a look at this.

580
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:56,487
This is her, right?

581
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:57,554
No way.

582
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,190
- I knew it!
- How can this be?

583
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,460
She must be disheartened.

584
00:30:04,987 --> 00:30:07,425
- I knew her belly was growing.
- Why did she get mad at us?

585
00:30:08,862 --> 00:30:10,501
You can give that to me.

586
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:11,925
Thanks.

587
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:13,671
That's good.

588
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:15,662
I'll take that one.

589
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:16,862
(Moonstargram)

590
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,542
(You have a new message.)

591
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:22,995
(Is this the cat?)

592
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:29,586
Here's a report from Jatnamu Sup.

593
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:32,923
"Ms. S called off her wedding."

594
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:42,099
Give that to me.

595
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:44,089
(She's pregnant
with another man's child!)

596
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,222
(- Who's Ms. S?
- There's only one engaged person.)

597
00:30:45,223 --> 00:30:46,761
(The answer is in the post.)

598
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,205
Ms. S?

599
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,509
What? Is this about me?

600
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:06,791
(Ms. S Called off Her Wedding.)

601
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,438
Ms. S?

602
00:31:10,498 --> 00:31:12,875
What? Is this about me?

603
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:22,500
This sounds like someone I know,
and she would never do this.

604
00:31:25,468 --> 00:31:27,420
What? How did they know?

605
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:32,645
(Are you Miss S?)

606
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,227
Are you serious?

607
00:31:35,252 --> 00:31:36,949
(She's pregnant
with another man's child.)

608
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:45,968
She was working late nights
on her baby, not the project.

609
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:50,364
No wonder she was looking so awful.
She's obviously pregnant.

610
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:54,835
- That's despicable!
- She wasn't so innocent after all.

611
00:31:55,991 --> 00:31:57,540
So, who's the father?

612
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,256
Did you guys see
the post on Jatnamu Sup?

613
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:14,004
This girl at Pelican got pregnant
by another guy before her wedding.

614
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,531
Isn't she insane?

615
00:32:18,027 --> 00:32:20,366
- That insane girl is me.
- What?

616
00:32:20,718 --> 00:32:22,040
But she's Ms. S.

617
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,425
Apparently, that Ms. S is me.

618
00:32:25,885 --> 00:32:28,764
- Are you pregnant?
- Of course, I'm not.

619
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,450
But it says
that this girl is pregnant.

620
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:36,063
Yes, that insane girl is me,
and I am not pregnant.

621
00:32:36,505 --> 00:32:40,934
- You've been screwed by that board.
- How did this story get so twisted?

622
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:44,675
Then why are you doing nothing?

623
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,005
Then what? Think of why celebrities
stay low when gossips burst out.

624
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:50,211
It'll only make things worse.

625
00:32:50,406 --> 00:32:52,312
Doing nothing isn't going to help!

626
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:54,752
Ji Sung's our friend.
She's not a celebrity.

627
00:32:54,777 --> 00:32:57,062
People will lose interest
in three days. Just stay low.

628
00:32:57,087 --> 00:32:59,536
But who in his right mind did this?

629
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,433
That scumbag...

630
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:05,580
Who would spread this kind of rumor?

631
00:33:05,605 --> 00:33:08,087
Probably someone
who knows Ji Sung pretty well.

632
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,873
That's right.
The criminal is always near you.

633
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,183
Can you think of anyone suspicious
on your team?

634
00:33:16,672 --> 00:33:20,289
No, my teammates aren't that bad.

635
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:23,109
Hey. You over there.

636
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,727
What are you looking at?

637
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,139
Ji Sung is not that Ms. S!

638
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,750
Ouch.

639
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,690
Sang Hoon was supposed to treat
my cavities for free.

640
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:42,422
I'm just kidding.

641
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:45,180
- You need to brush your teeth.
- Please brush your teeth.

642
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,735
That's not important right now.
It hurts so bad.

643
00:33:59,814 --> 00:34:03,779
She was working late nights
on her baby, not the project.

644
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:05,847
She's obviously pregnant.

645
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:07,523
That's despicable.

646
00:34:07,548 --> 00:34:10,675
She wasn't so innocent after all.

647
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,601
So, who's the father?

648
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:21,106
I think I'm Ms. S of today's
hot gossip on Jatnamu Sup.

649
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:24,191
My wedding is not off
because I got pregnant...

650
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:34,406
I am the despicable Ms. S
on the Development Team.

651
00:34:34,431 --> 00:34:39,225
The reason why my wedding is off is
because my fiancé took photos...

652
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,522
No.

653
00:34:48,165 --> 00:34:52,607
If I write this, they will go crazy
over finding my photos.

654
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:57,407
How do I get myself
out of this rumor?

655
00:34:57,432 --> 00:35:01,623
How could I prove it's not true?
Should I quit my job?

656
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:04,487
No, then it would look like
what they said is true.

657
00:35:05,316 --> 00:35:06,752
There is...

658
00:35:06,777 --> 00:35:10,873
one way to shut people up.

659
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,875
Ji Sung...

660
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,714
Ji Sung, wake up.

661
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:20,801
It's all my fault.

662
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,745
I shouldn't have mentioned
pregnancy.

663
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,650
Manager Seo. This is not
the solution to this problem.

664
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:29,941
Hey, Ji Sung.

665
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:34,778
Tell me this isn't true. Ji Sung!

666
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:39,555
Ji Sung, how am I going
to live without you?

667
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,427
This can't be happening.

668
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:47,233
This is all a lie!

669
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:52,385
I feel so bad for her fiancé.

670
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,350
She must have chosen this way
because she felt sorry too.

671
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:02,210
My top is okay for a funeral, right?
Isn't it nice?

672
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,319
She's back to life.

673
00:36:13,518 --> 00:36:16,963
No way. If I die, it will look like
I did it for Jung Han.

674
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:21,391
I'm always going
to take my vitamins...

675
00:36:24,392 --> 00:36:26,396
and live a long, healthy life.

676
00:36:28,637 --> 00:36:30,647
- Surprise!
- What is it?

677
00:36:31,392 --> 00:36:33,542
I figured you would be
out of wine by now.

678
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:03,483
(Honeymoon Plan
of Ji Sung and Jung Han)

679
00:37:08,502 --> 00:37:09,357
Ouch.

680
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:23,069
Barley.

681
00:37:23,213 --> 00:37:24,243
Rice. Ouch!

682
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:28,449
That hurts!
How about I stab you here?

683
00:37:28,474 --> 00:37:29,918
Come here!

684
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,356
Are you okay?

685
00:38:01,515 --> 00:38:03,543
What were you doing down there?

686
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,221
I'm sorry.

687
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,877
I was looking for my cat.

688
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,546
Why are you looking
for your cat here?

689
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:15,262
Oh, the cat that I lost loves
to hide in places like this.

690
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:16,648
Oh, that cat...

691
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:19,126
Your cat isn't here.

692
00:38:19,151 --> 00:38:22,492
Hold on. Someone posted on SNS
about spotting your cat.

693
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:24,954
This is your cat, right?

694
00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:26,759
(Is this the cat?)

695
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:33,016
They look similar, but it's not
the one I'm looking for.

696
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,464
They posted the location,
you should check it out.

697
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:37,297
Even if I go there,
I won't find my cat.

698
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:39,756
How would you know if you don't go?

699
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:41,315
Are you worried
about losing the bet?

700
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,991
Let's go check it out.

701
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,595
But my cat likes places like this.

702
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:56,717
I didn't know there was a place
like this in our neighborhood.

703
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:59,603
Isn't this place perfect
for cats to hide?

704
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:03,123
Cats are territorial,
so it probably didn't come this far.

705
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,166
This area is dominated by a boss cat
so Guk Su probably didn't come here.

706
00:39:08,191 --> 00:39:11,073
Really?
Then why didn't you tell me so?

707
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:15,002
I didn't think you would believe me.
You trust your SNS more.

708
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:20,371
That's because the information here
is more trustworthy...

709
00:39:20,574 --> 00:39:23,136
Did you guys see
the post on Jatnamu Sup?

710
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:26,201
This girl at Pelican got pregnant
by another guy before her wedding.

711
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,708
and likely...

712
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:31,131
not to be true.

713
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:35,856
I was stupid for trusting SNS.
How could I find your cat with it?

714
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:37,021
That stings!

715
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,551
It's bleeding.

716
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:44,048
- Hold on a second.
- What?

717
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:46,398
That's not sanitary.

718
00:39:46,423 --> 00:39:48,437
- Oh, I see.
- Hold on.

719
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,330
Thank you.

720
00:39:57,535 --> 00:39:58,806
My blood... Gosh.

721
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:13,876
That stings.

722
00:40:49,428 --> 00:40:50,776
Here you go.

723
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,144
Thank you.

724
00:40:55,276 --> 00:40:58,306
Can you give me your number?

725
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,402
Why?

726
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:04,525
It's not what you think.
It's for when I find your cat.

727
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,376
Our bet isn't over yet.

728
00:41:21,363 --> 00:41:22,936
Do you have some cash?

729
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:25,640
What?

730
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,496
Will paper bills ever disappear?

731
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:33,734
There are so many situations
to use cash.

732
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:36,003
Can't I have one?

733
00:41:36,388 --> 00:41:37,326
What?

734
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:41,733
You said you didn't want any, so
I bought it for worth two dollars.

735
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,934
Seeing you eat it
stimulates my appetite.

736
00:41:47,485 --> 00:41:49,968
I didn't eat all day today.

737
00:41:49,968 --> 00:41:52,325
This is my first meal.

738
00:41:52,325 --> 00:41:54,983
- Red bean or cream?
- It's fine.

739
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:57,441
I bought it with your money,
so not sharing it with you...

740
00:41:57,441 --> 00:41:59,667
will make me seem like a bad person.

741
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:01,239
Red bean or cream?

742
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:03,336
- Red bean, please.
- Can't you have a cream one?

743
00:42:03,336 --> 00:42:06,502
- I like red beans.
- I like red beans too.

744
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:09,574
You bought that with my money.

745
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,011
Here.

746
00:42:22,765 --> 00:42:24,013
Thank you.

747
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:32,951
Life is so funny.

748
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,235
It was so painful that
I wanted to kill myself earlier,

749
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,137
but now I'm obsessed
with just one carp-shaped bun.

750
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:41,904
And I'm smiling over it.

751
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,180
How funny.

752
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,036
Isn't it?

753
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:50,055
I won't take your consolation.

754
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:52,600
- I must take that bus to go home.
- What?

755
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:53,871
Goodbye.

756
00:42:54,186 --> 00:42:55,825
What... Wait. Hey.

757
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,459
That was embarrassing.

758
00:42:57,607 --> 00:43:01,356
I wired two dollars to your account.
Try checking it.

759
00:43:01,387 --> 00:43:02,371
Okay.

760
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:09,544
Fine.

761
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,478
Let's not be intimidated
by those strange rumors.

762
00:43:13,478 --> 00:43:15,898
Straighten your shoulders
and be confident.

763
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,138
Things will be different
tomorrow for sure.

764
00:43:19,007 --> 00:43:20,365
Let's go home now.

765
00:43:20,812 --> 00:43:23,124
Go, let's go.

766
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:24,948
Going and going.

767
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:36,796
(Ms. S's Secret Private Life Is Hot
Enough to Melt a Fridge, Episode 2)

768
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:39,931
(I've waited for this day.
The preview was just too long.)

769
00:43:39,931 --> 00:43:41,614
(So hot. Her hot private life is
burning me up.)

770
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:49,767
These people are seriously so mean.

771
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:52,293
Manager Seo, don't mind it.

772
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,219
Everything will quiet down soon.

773
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:56,520
- I got your coffee.
- I don't want it.

774
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:01,218
Ms. Seo.

775
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:04,446
I'm sorry to say this,
but tomorrow's presentation...

776
00:44:05,332 --> 00:44:07,841
- Can I not be worried?
- Of course not.

777
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:10,929
- You know her capability.
- I do.

778
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:12,996
- Is Cane free of trouble too?
- Director Oh.

779
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:15,593
Cane is perfect every day.

780
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:16,687
Right, Cane?

781
00:44:17,368 --> 00:44:20,432
A quiet mode for a pregnant woman.

782
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:25,438
It isn't indicating
that pregnant woman, is it?

783
00:44:25,438 --> 00:44:28,010
Ms. Im in the next office
is pregnant.

784
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:31,154
Right, I think I've heard about it.

785
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:32,914
Yes, she's pregnant.

786
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:34,705
Right.

787
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:44,279
Excuse me.

788
00:44:46,672 --> 00:44:48,530
What is the matter?

789
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:50,530
The repellent smells
a bit too strong.

790
00:44:51,026 --> 00:44:53,576
We have children patients,
so could you reduce the amount?

791
00:44:53,576 --> 00:44:56,155
Our repellent hardly smells.

792
00:44:57,087 --> 00:44:58,994
But I do smell it.

793
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:02,587
I don't.

794
00:45:02,704 --> 00:45:03,704
I do.

795
00:45:04,438 --> 00:45:05,800
Fine.

796
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,777
But reducing the amount could
cause a problem in disinfection,

797
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:11,677
so I'll visit twice a week
instead of once.

798
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:13,791
- Without extra fees.
- Thank you.

799
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:16,347
Wait. Can I...

800
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,347
ask you for a favor too?

801
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:24,925
All right. Lie down at ease.

802
00:45:27,192 --> 00:45:31,112
Don't do it roughly just because
you're giving me a discount.

803
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:34,865
- Nerve treatment could be painful.
- What?

804
00:45:36,907 --> 00:45:38,761
I won't do it.

805
00:45:38,761 --> 00:45:41,029
If you delay it,
the pain might become worse.

806
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,494
It's better to do it now.

807
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:45,588
Open your mouth.

808
00:45:46,112 --> 00:45:47,231
Open up.

809
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:49,179
There you go.

810
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,210
When would you like
your next visit to be?

811
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,210
What? Should I come again?

812
00:46:00,761 --> 00:46:02,324
You'll have to come
for about two months.

813
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:03,951
You have wisdom teeth
to be taken of too.

814
00:46:04,656 --> 00:46:06,180
Two months?

815
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:22,484
You have a lot of cavities,
so it will take that much.

816
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,971
- Help her with the reservation.
- Sure.

817
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:34,863
Is he the doctor
who treated me today?

818
00:46:34,863 --> 00:46:37,093
Yes, he's the director here.

819
00:46:38,157 --> 00:46:40,509
I want all my reservations
to be in this month.

820
00:46:53,554 --> 00:46:55,969
So that guy is Joo Woo Jae.

821
00:47:03,097 --> 00:47:06,098
Director Choi, don't be surprised.

822
00:47:06,317 --> 00:47:08,046
You should move
onto the next stage now.

823
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,965
- Manager Seo.
- Yes?

824
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:14,455
Is that our Fridge?

825
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:17,632
No, but I'll do...

826
00:47:17,632 --> 00:47:20,362
- the presentation with that one.
- Why?

827
00:47:20,362 --> 00:47:24,053
Ms. Seo, I recommend you
to eat a meal with doenjang stew.

828
00:47:24,053 --> 00:47:26,911
This is driving me crazy.

829
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:29,309
Why is it that my personal data
keeps popping up?

830
00:47:29,309 --> 00:47:33,102
I should fix this today,
or things will be horrible tomorrow.

831
00:47:33,605 --> 00:47:35,605
This won't do.

832
00:47:36,105 --> 00:47:39,655
I should just block
the outside network.

833
00:47:41,201 --> 00:47:45,273
What? When did it sync
with all the other machines?

834
00:47:45,827 --> 00:47:47,314
This is crazy.

835
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:50,143
From the air conditioner
to the purifier and Cane?

836
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:51,506
All of them.

837
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:54,787
It has a small problem
with the temperature sensor.

838
00:47:54,812 --> 00:47:56,604
You said there wouldn't be
any trouble!

839
00:48:00,052 --> 00:48:03,834
Hello, I'm Manager Jegal Su Won
of the Development Team.

840
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:08,384
(What is vacuum cleaner?)

841
00:48:08,648 --> 00:48:13,952
Today, I'd like to define
a vacuum cleaner again.

842
00:48:13,952 --> 00:48:17,246
Voice Recognition, Smart Appliance,
Ubiquitous Development Team...

843
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:18,757
has developed
a robot vacuum cleaner, Cane.

844
00:48:18,757 --> 00:48:21,289
And it accurately catches
a user's preference...

845
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:23,503
before it begins to clean.

846
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:26,428
Now let me introduce my soulmate,

847
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,971
my alter ego,

848
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,497
Cane.

849
00:48:33,306 --> 00:48:34,673
Hi, Cane.

850
00:48:35,697 --> 00:48:37,636
I'll start cleaning.

851
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:38,801
Cane.

852
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:43,056
Why don't you play a song
that goes well with today's weather?

853
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:46,114
Today's weather will be
a good match...

854
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:48,367
with "It's Real" by YoungTak.

855
00:48:55,939 --> 00:48:58,049
Do you need music for cleaning?

856
00:48:58,743 --> 00:49:00,930
It's sort of a work song.

857
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:05,077
It's too early to be surprised yet.

858
00:49:06,265 --> 00:49:08,331
Cane can make phone calls too.

859
00:49:09,339 --> 00:49:11,960
- Why would a vacuum make a call?
- Surprise.

860
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:14,543
Sorry I talked too much alone.

861
00:49:14,543 --> 00:49:17,704
Why don't we ask someone
who's working bravely...

862
00:49:18,054 --> 00:49:21,602
despite her recent bad experience
to try calling Cane? Manager Seo.

863
00:49:21,602 --> 00:49:23,524
Please try calling it.

864
00:49:28,028 --> 00:49:29,235
Hi, Fridge.

865
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:31,986
That's not it.

866
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:34,114
Oh, sorry.

867
00:49:34,662 --> 00:49:35,851
Hi, Cane.

868
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:37,100
Call my house.

869
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:40,673
Cane can respond
to a discouraging remark like this.

870
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:45,640
Ta-da.

871
00:49:45,853 --> 00:49:51,302
As you can see, Cane is connected
with a user's phone.

872
00:49:51,302 --> 00:49:54,452
Thus, you can make it clean
even from the outside.

873
00:49:54,482 --> 00:49:56,482
- Goodness.
- Great.

874
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:00,275
Let me take myself for example.

875
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,244
I'm a man in his early 30s.

876
00:50:02,955 --> 00:50:04,302
A manager of Pelican Electronics.

877
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:07,567
The first manager among those
who joined the company with him.

878
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:13,626
I raise two pet dogs
named Tong Ki and Jjang Gu.

879
00:50:13,651 --> 00:50:16,680
I had fried chicken
as a late-night snack yesterday.

880
00:50:16,793 --> 00:50:20,608
Tong Ki and Jjang Gu
made all the fuss to eat it.

881
00:50:20,608 --> 00:50:22,459
So their fur...

882
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:25,915
Mr. Jegal, I recommend you
to eat spicy mandarin fish stew.

883
00:50:26,009 --> 00:50:27,582
(How to make
spicy mandarin fish stew)

884
00:50:27,582 --> 00:50:30,163
This is its function.

885
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:35,564
Well, it's not wrong,
but a slight error.

886
00:50:35,564 --> 00:50:38,810
You're a charming opinion leader.

887
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,313
(Jegal Su Won, Opinion leader)

888
00:50:42,313 --> 00:50:44,247
This is...

889
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:46,919
I guess it's a new function of it.

890
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:50,207
You're an administrator
of Jatnamu Sup,

891
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:52,308
the anonymous board
that the employees visit the most.

892
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:57,439
- What...
- Jatnamu Sup?

893
00:50:58,841 --> 00:51:00,419
- What?
- No way.

894
00:51:00,451 --> 00:51:03,616
Among his recent postings, the one
with the largest number of views is:

895
00:51:03,616 --> 00:51:05,854
"Ms. S Called off Her Wedding."

896
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,403
"Why did she cancel her marriage
right before the wedding?"

897
00:51:08,428 --> 00:51:10,444
She's pregnant
with another man's child?

898
00:51:11,374 --> 00:51:12,269
What?

899
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:14,855
Ji Sung, this wasn't me.

900
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,333
This is a misunderstanding.

901
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:18,683
(Why did she work late nights
every night?)

902
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:20,509
HR should look into this.

903
00:51:21,392 --> 00:51:23,457
You were the writer for Jatnamu Sup?

904
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:25,114
No, it's not me.

905
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:26,656
It's really not me!

906
00:51:26,656 --> 00:51:28,454
(I've been waiting for an update
for so long!)

907
00:51:28,454 --> 00:51:30,603
I wasn't the one who posted
all of this!

908
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:33,068
Sir!

909
00:51:33,068 --> 00:51:35,258
This is the most-linked post.

910
00:51:35,283 --> 00:51:36,651
Ms. Hwang's identity has
finally been revealed!

911
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:39,005
Yes, I manage the page,

912
00:51:39,005 --> 00:51:42,027
but I'm not a stalker!
How would I know all of this?

913
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:44,774
It turns out,
she's the CEO's girlfriend!

914
00:51:44,774 --> 00:51:47,309
Who did this?

915
00:51:47,309 --> 00:51:48,537
This is nonsense!

916
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,221
I told you to find
whoever writes on Jatnamu Sup,

917
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:04,536
and you didn't tell me
when you knew who it was!

918
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:06,577
Sir, this is a misunderstanding.

919
00:52:06,577 --> 00:52:08,783
I just found out now too!

920
00:52:08,783 --> 00:52:11,574
This is all a misunderstanding!
I'm serious!

921
00:52:11,574 --> 00:52:15,538
I'll do whatever it takes
to find out what he's done!

922
00:52:16,124 --> 00:52:17,986
What have I done?

923
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,862
A little more to the left.

924
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:27,122
Mr. Jegal, that man.

925
00:52:27,351 --> 00:52:29,584
How can he stab us
in the back like this?

926
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:32,306
How did it go? Is he getting fired?

927
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:34,191
The disciplinary committee
will decide,

928
00:52:34,191 --> 00:52:37,253
but we know what's going to happen
now that we all know who he is.

929
00:52:37,253 --> 00:52:38,565
But you two are close.

930
00:52:38,565 --> 00:52:41,025
What are you talking about?
Who's close to who?

931
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:43,662
I have newly-found respect
for Mr. Jegal now.

932
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:45,774
How did he invent
a vacuum cleaner like that?

933
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,681
He didn't do anything.
Manager Seo did it all.

934
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:51,920
Do you know anything else?

935
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,078
I didn't know you were that capable.

936
00:52:55,430 --> 00:52:59,850
What? When did it sync
with all the other machines?

937
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,727
From the air conditioner
to the purifier and Cane?

938
00:53:03,028 --> 00:53:05,151
Fridge is behind this for sure.

939
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,489
Tell me if you know anything
about this.

940
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:10,592
The management wants to see everyone
involved with Jatnamu Sup!

941
00:53:10,592 --> 00:53:11,908
I don't know.

942
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:13,427
I don't know...

943
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:16,687
how that happened.

944
00:53:17,744 --> 00:53:21,048
Right. Mr. Jegal has been on Cane
for months.

945
00:53:22,498 --> 00:53:25,867
I thought he didn't even know
how to code.

946
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:27,867
Maybe he's secretly
an amazing hacker.

947
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:33,290
What did I tell you?

948
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,872
I told you that it must be someone
close by.

949
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:38,557
I know he's a little annoying,

950
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:41,288
but he never did anything perverted
like that.

951
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:44,260
You were never good
at judging people.

952
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:46,574
Don't you remember letting Jung Han
completely fool you?

953
00:53:47,352 --> 00:53:49,586
Why do you have to be
so brutally honest?

954
00:53:49,586 --> 00:53:51,586
Truth always hurts.

955
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,794
Why do you look so glum?

956
00:53:55,794 --> 00:53:57,960
Why do bad things...

957
00:53:58,763 --> 00:54:01,561
keep happening around me?

958
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:05,303
How is this a bad thing?
This is some serious luck.

959
00:54:05,328 --> 00:54:07,400
You got rid of your trashy ex,

960
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,945
and caught the man who's been
spreading malicious rumors.

961
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:11,868
Your Ancestral Spirit is
helping you big time.

962
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:23,355
Are you really my Ancestral Spirit
or something?

963
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:26,069
Are you here to help me?

964
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:30,334
Why me, of all people?

965
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:34,607
Manager Seo,
why don't you call Cane?

966
00:54:34,607 --> 00:54:35,846
Hello, Fridge.

967
00:54:37,283 --> 00:54:38,962
I'm sorry.

968
00:54:39,556 --> 00:54:41,211
This is...

969
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:44,197
Is my voice what awakes...

970
00:54:44,855 --> 00:54:45,855
Fridge's...

971
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:47,545
special abilities?

972
00:54:47,545 --> 00:54:49,016
Hi, Fridge.

973
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:51,900
Yes, please go on.

974
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:56,277
How much can you do?

975
00:54:56,277 --> 00:54:58,712
What kind of data do you have?

976
00:54:59,926 --> 00:55:02,356
I wonder if it has any data
on cats.

977
00:55:04,145 --> 00:55:06,883
It's a stray cat
that a firefighter...

978
00:55:06,908 --> 00:55:09,214
at Gorae Fire Station lost
a few days ago.

979
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:14,382
He has a scar, so it seems
like he's been hurt.

980
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:16,913
And I only got a brief glimpse,

981
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,136
but he's handsome.

982
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:24,941
Based on how he couldn't be found
after looking for a whole month,

983
00:55:24,966 --> 00:55:25,982
Gook Hee!

984
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,735
it seems to me that he's
very unpredictable.

985
00:55:28,735 --> 00:55:30,735
Where have you been?

986
00:55:31,356 --> 00:55:33,019
There are people who have seen him,

987
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:35,693
Yes, I'll drop by sometime soon.

988
00:55:37,554 --> 00:55:39,744
Gook Hee, what do I do?

989
00:55:40,767 --> 00:55:43,121
- What?
- yet I can't find him.

990
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,583
Where did he go again?

991
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,300
Will I...

992
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:49,787
be able to find him again?

993
00:55:50,624 --> 00:55:52,920
Sorry, the search failed.

994
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:54,754
I have no data.

995
00:55:57,418 --> 00:55:59,418
I guess you don't keep data
on animals.

996
00:55:59,683 --> 00:56:01,683
I'd like to recommend you
some rich soybean paste stew.

997
00:56:01,884 --> 00:56:04,063
Why do you keep
recommending me that?

998
00:56:19,538 --> 00:56:23,541
Fridge took care
of another human trash for me.

999
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:26,376
But why don't I feel good?

1000
00:56:27,891 --> 00:56:32,694
Is everything Fridge says true?

1001
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:37,478
(There's a cat near the Gorae
Community Center.)

1002
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:39,078
Is this data...

1003
00:56:39,078 --> 00:56:42,308
true or false?

1004
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:46,811
The best way to check is...

1005
00:56:48,311 --> 00:56:51,820
to see it for myself.

1006
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:07,224
There is an immeasurable amount
of data pouring out each day,

1007
00:57:08,178 --> 00:57:11,180
and each point
to something different.

1008
00:57:11,649 --> 00:57:15,175
So, at times, it's better
to just close your eyes and ears.

1009
00:57:16,823 --> 00:57:19,844
Wouldn't that be better?

1010
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,478
(Please Don't Date Him)

1011
00:57:54,229 --> 00:57:56,481
(Special thanks to Ahn Il Kwon
for his cameo appearance.)

1012
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,497
(Please Don't Date Him)

1013
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,298
Ji Sung, just forgive me
this one time!

1014
00:58:07,298 --> 00:58:09,347
You did all of that
because you love me?

1015
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,797
Haven't we met before?

1016
00:58:11,797 --> 00:58:14,250
I will call the police if you break
into her house one more time.

1017
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:18,158
Why do I always run into you
at the most embarrassing moments?

1018
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:21,756
- I'll see you at 7 p.m.
- Sorry, I think I'll be late.

1019
00:58:21,756 --> 00:58:23,804
What was I expecting?

1020
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:27,093
- This is the last time.
- I know this is odd to say,

1021
00:58:27,093 --> 00:58:28,226
- but I have to tell you...
- What is it?

1022
00:58:28,226 --> 00:58:30,362
I'm absolutely trash.
Are you okay with that?

1023
00:58:30,386 --> 00:58:32,527
- Did you see something?
- You scared me.

1024
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:33,826
It's only an 11 years
of age difference.

1025
00:58:33,826 --> 00:58:34,556
Eleven years?

1026
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,972
Just one last time, please.
Does he have a lot of debt?
