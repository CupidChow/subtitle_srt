1
00:00:43,018 --> 00:00:45,293
Stay away from me.
I'm going to scream.

2
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,113
Gook Hee.

3
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:53,722
Did you find the cat?

4
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,691
Oh, hello. You must be...

5
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:58,093
You said you live around here.

6
00:00:58,093 --> 00:01:00,629
Come here and share this umbrella
with us since it's raining.

7
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,330
What happened to the cat?

8
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:04,866
- His leg got stuck in the cable.
- Okay.

9
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:07,736
I think he got caught in the rain
as it couldn't escape.

10
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:09,204
Really?

11
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,474
I got a call from my first daughter.
Hold on.

12
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:14,810
Hello? Sorry?

13
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,012
The youngest bit you again?

14
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,881
Okay. I'll be back soon.

15
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:22,350
What do I do?

16
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:26,988
My kids are fighting every day
now that they've grown older.

17
00:01:27,602 --> 00:01:29,591
Go ahead, Oh Jung,
I'll go to the vet by myself.

18
00:01:29,744 --> 00:01:30,732
Can you do that? I'm sorry.

19
00:01:30,732 --> 00:01:32,661
But I'll leave the umbrella here,
so you can use it.

20
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:34,596
- I can take a cab. I'll get going.
- Okay.

21
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:35,564
Sure. Go ahead.

22
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:54,950
Is that the cat you lost?

23
00:01:56,397 --> 00:01:57,253
Yes.

24
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,021
You won the bet.

25
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,738
(Please Don't Date Him)

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,761
(Episode 4. Let's Meet at Seven)

27
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,504
Can you wait outside for a bit?

28
00:02:15,983 --> 00:02:16,738
Thank you.

29
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,459
Manager Seo.

30
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,748
- Ms. Byun.
- Mr. Firefighter.

31
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,753
- Hello.
- What brings you here, Manager Seo?

32
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:35,355
Why would you be here together?

33
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:37,819
I have something to do here.
How about you, Ms. Byun?

34
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,295
I came to buy a cat snack.

35
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,664
Did you get Guk Su by any chance?

36
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:45,734
- Yes.
- What a relief.

37
00:02:46,034 --> 00:02:48,777
I'll look into a foster home by
posting it on the online community.

38
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:52,440
You helped me out last time too.
Thank you. I appreciate it.

39
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:54,409
No problem.

40
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:57,379
I'll get going then.

41
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,580
See you.

42
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:14,623
I heard you're getting surgery
for the cat.

43
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,364
Is it not well?

44
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:17,899
It's a neutering surgery.

45
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,602
Neutering surgery?

46
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:21,636
Yes.

47
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:26,675
That cat got dozens
of cats pregnant.

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,343
It had more than 100 kittens.

49
00:03:28,663 --> 00:03:29,578
Then...

50
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:34,849
do you plan to get all male cats
in the neighborhood neutered?

51
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:36,484
If I could.

52
00:03:38,086 --> 00:03:41,790
I don't want innocent stray cats
to be euthanized.

53
00:03:47,996 --> 00:03:49,164
What's the name?

54
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:54,002
That stray cat doesn't have a name,
so I named it Guk Su.

55
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,271
Not him but you.

56
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:57,352
What's your name?

57
00:03:59,368 --> 00:04:01,276
"Jung Gook Hee."

58
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,712
What did you save my name as?

59
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,448
Nuisance? Gorae-dong blacklist?

60
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,582
As Seo Ji Sung.

61
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:09,524
How did you know my name?

62
00:04:11,732 --> 00:04:13,335
Isn't that Seo Ji Sung's phone?

63
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,624
Ji Sung. No, right? It's not
what I imagine it is, right?

64
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:17,065
You went there
to wash your feet, right?

65
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:17,846
Sir, that's not it.

66
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:20,795
I somehow found out.

67
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:23,898
I see.

68
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:40,815
It's delicious.

69
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:45,064
I guess you come here often.

70
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:47,489
Yes. When I have a bowl of this
after being on the scene,

71
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:49,364
I feel recharged.

72
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:53,448
I hope it does for me too.

73
00:05:01,409 --> 00:05:03,471
You ran out of the kimchi
at the fire station, right?

74
00:05:03,812 --> 00:05:05,607
You really didn't have to do this.

75
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:11,246
If it weren't for you,
I would not be in this world.

76
00:05:11,248 --> 00:05:13,448
You helped fix this place too.

77
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,845
I'd regret it
if you didn't take this.

78
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,420
Then make it for us sometimes.

79
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,089
It must be hard to run on your own
as Ms. Oxana is not here.

80
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:22,590
I can manage.

81
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:26,061
Oxana used to love
rich soybean paste stew.

82
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,797
I should've packed some with her
when she left.

83
00:05:28,799 --> 00:05:30,932
Did she get to her hometown safely?

84
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:33,401
I'm not really sure.

85
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,070
She sent me a letter.

86
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:39,240
But I couldn't read it
as it's in a foreign language.

87
00:05:39,368 --> 00:05:42,243
Sorry to bother you
when you're eating.

88
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:43,978
Can you have a look?

89
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,514
Sure.

90
00:05:54,247 --> 00:05:56,524
Why can't you read it?
You must've studied.

91
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:59,593
I'm sorry. I don't know Russian.

92
00:05:59,595 --> 00:06:00,895
Russian?

93
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:02,330
Can I see it?

94
00:06:03,511 --> 00:06:04,699
Do you speak Russian?

95
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,201
Hand it to me.

96
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:11,873
As for this...

97
00:06:15,597 --> 00:06:16,311
There we go.

98
00:06:16,871 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll read it for you, ma'am.

99
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,584
"Old lady, this is Oxana."

100
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:24,452
"I am in my hometown."

101
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:27,255
"Thank you for being so kind to me."

102
00:06:27,402 --> 00:06:31,025
"I will work hard here
so I can go see you."

103
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:34,763
"I wish you good health until then.
Let's fight."

104
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:36,431
"Let's fight"?

105
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,295
It seems to be a mistranslation
of "cheer up."

106
00:06:40,297 --> 00:06:41,830
The translation is a bit awkward.

107
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:44,539
It's fine as long as it gets
the meaning across.

108
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:47,942
Have your meals before it gets cold.
Thank you.

109
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:49,744
Okay. Thank you.

110
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,148
So you can do that too.

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,449
I'm good with it.

112
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:59,988
If you have a phone,
there's nothing you can't do.

113
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:02,423
Thank you for the food.

114
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,225
- Thank you.
- Did you enjoy it?

115
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,026
Yes.

116
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:07,729
Did you check the money
that I wired to you last time?

117
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:10,004
It's 2 dollars for a carp-shaped bun
and 3 for rich soybean paste stew.

118
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:11,399
I haven't checked yet.

119
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,615
You should've checked it right away.

120
00:07:13,617 --> 00:07:15,470
Check that as well as today.

121
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:17,071
Sorry?

122
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:19,541
Please lend me some money.

123
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,028
It'd be nice to make an intelligent
card payment machine.

124
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:43,698
When she puts in 14 dollars,
it could get wired automatically.

125
00:07:45,213 --> 00:07:46,801
That's a great idea.

126
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:48,269
I should write it down.

127
00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,039
You do so many things
with your phone.

128
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,474
Sure. It sure is convenient.

129
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,009
Take a look at this.

130
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,846
You can check the weather too.

131
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,347
We have a low fine dust level.

132
00:07:59,347 --> 00:08:01,049
The probability of rain
is zero percent.

133
00:08:05,893 --> 00:08:08,323
It gets it wrong sometimes, though.

134
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:23,037
It's okay. I can buy one
at the convenience store.

135
00:08:23,124 --> 00:08:24,439
The convenience store
is far from here.

136
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:26,241
It's really okay.

137
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:27,542
Get home safely.

138
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,102
You're an administrator
of Jatnamu Sup,

139
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:56,558
the anonymous board
that the employees visit the most.

140
00:08:56,558 --> 00:08:57,265
No, it's not me.

141
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:59,828
I wasn't the one who posted
all of this! I'm not a stalker!

142
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,845
This is nonsense!

143
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,795
- Hold on.
- What is it?

144
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:48,119
Don't run and strain
your lower abdomen.

145
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,523
How is it? Don't you feel yourself
burning up?

146
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:54,191
I'm not sure.

147
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,443
Focus your energy...

148
00:09:56,606 --> 00:09:59,697
on your lower abdomen
when you breathe.

149
00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:09,684
Take this gun of justice!

150
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:12,056
- Take it!
- There!

151
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:14,054
Oh, Ms. Tak.

152
00:10:14,724 --> 00:10:16,599
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

153
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,301
- Do you live nearby here?
- Yes.

154
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:20,301
I didn't know we were neighbors.

155
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:21,875
- Dad.
- Yes?

156
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,510
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry.

157
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:31,324
It looks like you had a bloody stool
in your pants.

158
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,412
Where do you think you're touching?

159
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,239
I only meant to wipe it for you.

160
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,029
Or I'll pay for the laundry.

161
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:42,231
- Well...
- It's fine.

162
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:44,743
I'm sorry, mister.

163
00:10:44,892 --> 00:10:47,610
No, it's okay.

164
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,013
Thank you, miss.

165
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:53,199
- Miss?
- My dad told me...

166
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,434
that pretty women are all a miss.

167
00:10:55,434 --> 00:10:57,270
Good job.

168
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm really sorry.

169
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,534
I'll educate my kids better.

170
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,228
We need to get going now.
We're running late.

171
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,472
Pick the hot dog, honey.

172
00:11:03,472 --> 00:11:04,939
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

173
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:07,736
- Run!
- Okay!

174
00:11:07,736 --> 00:11:11,158
One, two, one, two.

175
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,137
Run!

176
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,163
He's such a funny dad,
don't you think?

177
00:11:16,272 --> 00:11:18,629
I better get washed up quickly.
It feels icky.

178
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:34,018
(Personnel Appointment)

179
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:37,190
I guess I should bring
another innovation...

180
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,783
to the Distribution Team.

181
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,270
I was worried I might not be able
to see you before leaving.

182
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:46,979
- We met again.
- Why, to apologize?

183
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:49,401
- Will you accept it if I do?
- No.

184
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:53,535
Hey, I know it's hard to believe,

185
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
but I started Jatnamu Sup
for employees' welfare.

186
00:11:56,124 --> 00:11:59,592
I wanted to innovate
this problematic company.

187
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,283
Spreading groundless rumors...

188
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:03,944
and ruining people's lives.
Do you call that innovation?

189
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:05,944
That was my intention at first.

190
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,447
I thought an anonymous community...

191
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:10,931
would allow employees to talk freely
without minding the higher-ups.

192
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,364
You remember, right?
In the beginning,

193
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,364
it worked as a place
to raise their voices up.

194
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,626
There were quite a lot
of whistle-blowers too.

195
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,903
Sprucing up won't change the fact
that it's a piece of trash.

196
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,040
You know that, right?

197
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:24,412
What I'm trying to say is
that I wasn't a jerk from the start.

198
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,855
- I'm a victim too.
- What do you mean?

199
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,025
I created Jatnamu Sup,
but I didn't write all the postings.

200
00:12:30,025 --> 00:12:32,860
- Then?
- I don't know.

201
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,843
Somebody posted them
through different IPs every time.

202
00:12:35,843 --> 00:12:38,030
Do you call that an excuse?

203
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,450
I'm not saying I'm innocent.

204
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,874
I abetted it, and that's wrong.

205
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,290
The problem won't disappear
even if I'm gone.

206
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,008
Be careful not
to let it get you again.

207
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:51,639
Mind your own business.

208
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:59,338
You're not going to fix Cane, right?

209
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:03,794
I don't know how it went
out of control but destroy it.

210
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:06,325
Or it might do harm
to a lot of people.

211
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:14,817
Fridge, what should I do with you?

212
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,379
Would it be fine
as long as I don't call you?

213
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,288
- Good morning.
- Hello.

214
00:13:22,706 --> 00:13:25,310
Manager Seo, you aren't done
with fixing Fridge's error, are you?

215
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,787
You mentioned its temperature sensor
before the presentation.

216
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,099
Oh, I'm working on it now.

217
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:31,820
Take it slow.

218
00:13:31,897 --> 00:13:34,752
We've decided to take time
with its development.

219
00:13:37,013 --> 00:13:38,751
Because of Jatnamu Sup?

220
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,527
Well, it worked as a trigger.

221
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:43,796
But there's a financial slump
going on these days.

222
00:13:43,796 --> 00:13:46,395
So instead of focusing only
on expensive smart home appliances,

223
00:13:46,395 --> 00:13:48,970
we should do another business stool.

224
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,113
A two-track system, it is.

225
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:53,296
Two businesses without Jegal Su Won?

226
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:57,033
What are you talking about?
We have Ms. Byun, our ace member.

227
00:13:57,574 --> 00:13:59,451
I'll work hard.

228
00:13:59,451 --> 00:14:01,502
I feel great every time I see you.

229
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:06,654
Well, that was
an anachronistic remark.

230
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:09,592
Let me take it back.
That was a no-no.

231
00:14:09,592 --> 00:14:11,784
Anyway, the headquarters has planned
thermovision camera development...

232
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,584
as a national project.

233
00:14:13,584 --> 00:14:14,922
And we're taking the job.

234
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,820
The one that firefighters use
during a fire accident.

235
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,336
Firefighters?

236
00:14:18,878 --> 00:14:20,717
Who wants to do it?

237
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:24,867
Forget it
if you don't want to do it.

238
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:26,256
The Fire Team went to assist
the forest fire accident,

239
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:27,660
so they left this to us.

240
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:30,758
I better hand it
to another team then.

241
00:14:30,758 --> 00:14:32,900
They're offering a lot
for the overtime work.

242
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,428
I'll take the job.

243
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,277
- Suddenly?
- What do you mean, suddenly?

244
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:39,151
Doing push-ups, I wondered...

245
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:41,524
what kind of idea I should give...

246
00:14:41,524 --> 00:14:43,524
for the poor working environment
of firefighters.

247
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:47,057
We need one more.

248
00:14:47,812 --> 00:14:50,099
- He wants to do it too.
- I don't want to.

249
00:14:50,099 --> 00:14:53,230
Mr. Jung, we're partners, so it'll
be easy to arrange the schedule.

250
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,385
My kids need to take an art class.
Just this once.

251
00:15:02,595 --> 00:15:04,595
Gam Oh Jung and Jung Gook Hee,
ready to do the job.

252
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,413
Jatnamu Sup is gone for nothing
because of Ms. S.

253
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:10,329
It was the only fun
in my working life.

254
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,912
Tell me about it.
I want a sequel to her.

255
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:16,908
Hey, her baby's dad
hasn't been revealed yet, right?

256
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:18,298
No.

257
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:22,241
What?

258
00:15:23,066 --> 00:15:25,873
Why would you shoot disinfectant
to people?

259
00:15:25,873 --> 00:15:28,303
Dear, I'm sorry.
I saw some bugs.

260
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,116
- Bugs? Where?
- Where?

261
00:15:30,116 --> 00:15:31,125
Here.

262
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:36,921
Moon Ye Seul.

263
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,779
It's harmless to the human body,
but spraying it directly to them...

264
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:43,119
was brilliant.

265
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,018
I held myself back from wanting
to do it on their mouths.

266
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,722
Jatnamu Sup is gone now,
so it should quiet down eventually.

267
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:58,069
What are you doing?

268
00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:01,445
I prepared it all
in case I ran out of time.

269
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,217
Did you get a new boyfriend already?

270
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:10,518
Not now, but about 30 minutes later.

271
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,759
You're the best.

272
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:15,997
- See you.
- Bye.

273
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,271
Hello, Doctor.

274
00:16:25,427 --> 00:16:27,427
Oh, hello.

275
00:16:29,076 --> 00:16:31,073
Lie down comfortably.

276
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,073
Okay, comfortably.

277
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:36,386
Going down.

278
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,729
Cover her face.

279
00:16:40,774 --> 00:16:42,133
Well, no.

280
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:46,432
I think I need to see your face
to feel reassured.

281
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:48,779
- Well, suit yourself.
- Okay.

282
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,390
Open your mouth.

283
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,180
Bigger.

284
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,650
Loosen your lips and open up.

285
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,028
- Open up.
- I have a small mouth.

286
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:04,478
You did it
with no problem yesterday.

287
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:06,397
Open up.

288
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,869
Open your mouth.

289
00:17:10,201 --> 00:17:11,414
Bigger.

290
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,555
Bring it.

291
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,238
Let's see.

292
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:26,188
This is too serious.

293
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:28,264
The nerves lie close to the teeth.

294
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:29,631
It won't be easy.

295
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,902
Should I call other staff members
in case of an emergency?

296
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,533
We've got new equipment.
Let's try it with that.

297
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,801
The inner side of your molar
is decaying.

298
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:41,130
Do you see it?

299
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:44,137
Yes. And?

300
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,291
I'll have to extract
your wisdom tooth first.

301
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,884
My wisdom tooth?

302
00:17:50,438 --> 00:17:53,326
Don't worry. It won't hurt at all
under anesthetic.

303
00:18:06,823 --> 00:18:08,360
Can't you trust me?

304
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:13,786
All right, let's begin.

305
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,640
- Cover her face.
- Okay.

306
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:18,483
Hold her tightly...

307
00:18:18,483 --> 00:18:20,483
- so that she doesn't move.
- Okay.

308
00:18:22,604 --> 00:18:25,207
Open your mouth. Suction.

309
00:18:57,517 --> 00:18:59,517
What? Darn it.

310
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,488
The doctor wants to see you
for a moment.

311
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:05,657
What?

312
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,300
Well, let me go
to the bathroom first.

313
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,708
Let's give up on the sexy charm
and go with the feminine version.

314
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:33,193
Thank you, Doctor.

315
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:36,744
- It must've been hard.
- Don't mention it.

316
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,930
I guess your office isn't
disinfected thoroughly.

317
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,111
It smells a little.

318
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:45,398
I sprayed some deodorizer,

319
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:47,290
but the smell didn't go away.

320
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,290
- Why did you want to see me?
- Oh, right.

321
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:53,903
It could be flustering for you
to hear this out of the blue.

322
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:57,591
What is it about?

323
00:19:57,824 --> 00:20:00,837
I wondered if it was okay...

324
00:20:00,837 --> 00:20:02,527
to tell you this.

325
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:06,704
I've never said it
to any of my patients before.

326
00:20:06,704 --> 00:20:08,748
Don't think of me as your patient.

327
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:10,974
Just say whatever you need to.

328
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,576
Thank you.

329
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:14,311
I appreciate you saying that.

330
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:16,246
Well,

331
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,124
could you sign here, please?

332
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:29,159
(Dentist Han Yu Jin)

333
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:32,296
What am I...

334
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:34,698
signing?

335
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,400
Your wisdom tooth is so unique,

336
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:40,037
I'd like to do some research on it
and write a paper.

337
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,806
If you sign this, you're agreeing
to donate your wisdom tooth.

338
00:20:42,894 --> 00:20:46,910
You wanted to see me
because of my wisdom tooth?

339
00:20:47,174 --> 00:20:47,975
Yes.

340
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:52,349
How "unique" is my wisdom tooth
that you want to do research?

341
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:53,524
Well,

342
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:01,191
we usually call teeth like these...

343
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:03,527
the nightmare wisdom teeth.

344
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:07,664
So, the stink in this room is coming
from my tooth?

345
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,802
Its roots were in so deep
that food particles accumulated.

346
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:16,373
I've never seen a case like this,
so I really want to study it.

347
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:18,709
You'll give me permission, right?

348
00:21:25,624 --> 00:21:27,751
You want me to analyze Cane's codes?

349
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:31,655
The Inspection Team dug
through Mr. Jegal's computer,

350
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:33,056
and they couldn't find anything.

351
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:36,994
They think Cane spilling
personal information is a bug,

352
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,429
so they want us to do
an analysis on it.

353
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:42,733
Isn't it such a common bug?

354
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:46,203
That's why personal information is
public information nowadays.

355
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,940
It could get very bad if we mess
with the wrong personal information.

356
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,975
Anyway, the Inspection Team
requested it,

357
00:21:52,087 --> 00:21:55,412
so Mr. Jo, please collect and pass
all information on Cane to Ms. Seo.

358
00:21:55,486 --> 00:21:58,315
The chip installed inside Cane is
missing.

359
00:21:58,816 --> 00:21:59,750
- What?
- What?

360
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:01,284
Why is that missing?

361
00:22:01,981 --> 00:22:04,187
I cleaned Cane's parts
after the presentation,

362
00:22:04,554 --> 00:22:05,822
and that was the only thing missing.

363
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,157
No way.

364
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:13,997
- Deputy Manager Hwang,
- What is it?

365
00:22:14,498 --> 00:22:15,966
could I have a piece of gum too?

366
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,534
My mouth is feeling quite dry.

367
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,111
It's definitely not Ms. Hwang.

368
00:22:31,481 --> 00:22:32,816
You can't analyze its data
without the chip, can you?

369
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:34,351
No, I can.

370
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,486
The computer does the programming
anyway.

371
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:40,624
I'll look into all the programming
for all of our projects.

372
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,893
I'll have Fridge turned off for now
since we're postponing the project.

373
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:44,528
Sure, then.

374
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,762
You can do as you'd like.

375
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:51,784
I'm going to shut Fridge off
before it reveals itself.

376
00:22:52,268 --> 00:22:54,237
Goodbye, Fridge.

377
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:02,412
Hello.

378
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,547
Hello.

379
00:23:04,128 --> 00:23:06,149
We're from Gorae Fire Station.

380
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:12,055
I guess there aren't many of you
at Gorae Fire Station.

381
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:14,424
It's always you two.

382
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:17,527
Yes, it's just the two of us there.

383
00:23:17,528 --> 00:23:19,196
I'm the chief,
and he's the team member.

384
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:20,931
He's the team member,
and I'm the chief.

385
00:23:22,503 --> 00:23:23,400
All right.

386
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:25,969
You've heard, right?

387
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,605
We're developing thermovision
cameras, and we need advice.

388
00:23:28,905 --> 00:23:31,241
We already have thermovision cameras
at the fire station.

389
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:32,409
Are yours different
from what we have?

390
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,178
We're trying to add AI technology
to our cameras.

391
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:37,080
AI thermovision cameras?

392
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:40,450
Is that like Iron Man's mask?

393
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,885
That's possible.

394
00:23:41,891 --> 00:23:43,587
I'm sure we can develop something
like that by next year.

395
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:45,489
Maybe not next year.

396
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,892
We're just developing some
for testing purposes.

397
00:23:49,005 --> 00:23:50,360
Excuse me,

398
00:23:52,062 --> 00:23:53,530
but why are you sitting like that?

399
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:55,832
I have a fear of heights.

400
00:23:58,235 --> 00:23:59,903
Please don't mind him.

401
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:01,805
All right.

402
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,342
Is the AI feature necessary?

403
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:09,179
Lowering the cost and making them
more accessible sounds better.

404
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:12,182
By adding the AI feature,
you can speak to it,

405
00:24:12,186 --> 00:24:14,216
and it'll be able to detect
movements.

406
00:24:14,217 --> 00:24:16,286
Overall, your experience will
improve with it.

407
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,922
If that's the case, it'd be great
if it could measure...

408
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:22,092
the distance between us
and objects or people we're saving.

409
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,794
It's going to take
a really long time...

410
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,362
to develop something like that.

411
00:24:25,488 --> 00:24:27,864
Is that right? If that's the case...

412
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,835
Are you sure this is
a human's wisdom tooth?

413
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:34,471
It sure looks like something
he'd want to research.

414
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:38,675
Hey! You can't drink
after getting your tooth out.

415
00:24:39,274 --> 00:24:40,710
If I don't drink this right now,

416
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:42,379
I might jump into the Han River
out of embarrassment.

417
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:45,215
I'm done.

418
00:24:46,492 --> 00:24:48,685
I give up on Joo Woo Jae.

419
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,620
I'm never going to his office
ever again.

420
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:53,790
You still need to get treated.

421
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:56,159
I'm sure he'll fix your cavities
for free...

422
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,994
if you let him take this tooth.

423
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:02,065
Only if I could just go
to Jung Han's office instead...

424
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,501
But of course, I can't.

425
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,170
Sign it already.

426
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:09,172
Is this really necessary?

427
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:10,674
This is unnecessary.

428
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,342
No need to read it. Just sign it.

429
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:15,612
You guys have deleted
any photo of Ji Sung that I sent...

430
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,182
not only on your phones
but all of your devices, right?

431
00:25:19,272 --> 00:25:21,017
Why? Does she want to sue you?

432
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:23,119
You want me to introduce you
to a lawyer?

433
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:26,223
He got rid of a girl for me
by framing her as a gold digger.

434
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,225
- Do you need his number?
- Forget it, you punk.

435
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,260
It was a mistake to hang out
with you all.

436
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:32,996
Hey, this is your Ancestral Spirit
helping you.

437
00:25:33,163 --> 00:25:34,297
Remember what I said before?

438
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:36,166
You need to move onto a new
and younger girl.

439
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,336
Ji Sung is nothing.

440
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:41,404
She's old, not from a good family,

441
00:25:41,405 --> 00:25:43,740
doesn't have a nice body,
and isn't so obedient.

442
00:25:44,366 --> 00:25:46,176
There's nothing good about her
other than her brain.

443
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:47,978
Smart women are so tiring
to deal with.

444
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,012
Look at how he's been cornered.

445
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:52,282
She's calling the wedding off
for just some photos of her?

446
00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:54,050
Stop talking and just sign.

447
00:25:55,192 --> 00:25:56,119
You're right.

448
00:25:56,658 --> 00:25:57,821
She called the wedding off for that?

449
00:25:58,217 --> 00:26:00,490
I don't know her,
but she sounds very naive.

450
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:02,525
She should've just sued you
right away.

451
00:26:05,095 --> 00:26:08,180
You guys belong in jail,
not at the dentist.

452
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:10,700
- Joo Woo Jae.
- Hey.

453
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:13,169
You're not even a part
of our group chat.

454
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,305
You don't even know
what the photos are.

455
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:18,041
They're just some regular
lingerie photos.

456
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:19,376
I see.

457
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:21,912
Hey,

458
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,014
remember those regular photos
that we took at the sauna...

459
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,415
in our boxers?

460
00:26:26,783 --> 00:26:27,984
Can I upload that on the internet?

461
00:26:28,952 --> 00:26:30,687
I'll add your names and your offices
to the photo.

462
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:32,923
- Hey.
- You better not!

463
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:39,796
It was just some friends
joking around. Just for fun.

464
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:42,065
I'm ashamed...

465
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:46,202
that I'm even friends
with you idiots.

466
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,106
Goodness.

467
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,110
He's still as annoying as ever.

468
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:56,279
It's not like he did anything
so wrong!

469
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:58,148
I did do very wrong!

470
00:26:58,882 --> 00:27:01,451
All of you and I are all terrible,
you punks.

471
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,251
Hey!

472
00:27:16,338 --> 00:27:18,535
(Enjoy. From Dad)

473
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:22,572
Galbi and japchae?

474
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:24,674
Pancakes too?

475
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:27,010
What's with all of these?

476
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:28,545
It's not even your birthday, Dad.

477
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,513
Is it Mom's birthday?

478
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:32,849
That's tomorrow.

479
00:27:32,894 --> 00:27:34,985
Tomorrow is Mom's birthday?

480
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:37,187
You're telling me to bring these
to her, aren't you?

481
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:39,956
Why are you suddenly being
all nice to her?

482
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:41,324
It's nothing like that.

483
00:27:41,524 --> 00:27:42,993
Those are for you.

484
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:44,527
I don't want you to starve.

485
00:27:44,784 --> 00:27:46,463
The older you get,
the more important food is.

486
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,897
I'm only 32.

487
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,299
I'm still young and youthful.

488
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,735
You lost weight the last time
I saw you.

489
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,503
What are you talking about?

490
00:27:53,504 --> 00:27:56,539
Anyway, I get it. I'll bring these
to Mom.

491
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,975
You know how my portion control is.

492
00:27:58,976 --> 00:28:00,443
I cooked too much for myself.

493
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,811
All right.

494
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,847
I'll give you a call
after I bring these over to her.

495
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,416
Okay. Don't worry about it.
Goodnight.

496
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,884
- Bye.
- Bye.

497
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:15,625
He cooked all of Mom's
favorite dishes.

498
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,445
I'm an idiot! I can't do anything
with an umbrella.

499
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,681
- I have to call the police.
- Ji Sung!

500
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:42,152
Ji Sung!

501
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:43,686
Ji Sung!

502
00:28:52,268 --> 00:28:53,163
What are you doing?

503
00:28:53,263 --> 00:28:55,165
I'll say hi later.

504
00:28:55,517 --> 00:28:57,300
Can you just pull me in first?

505
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:59,002
What are you doing?

506
00:29:08,688 --> 00:29:09,702
What are you doing?

507
00:29:09,702 --> 00:29:11,872
I'll say hi later.

508
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:14,001
Can you just pull me in first?

509
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,845
What are you doing?

510
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,845
What do you mean what?

511
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:21,218
This is me acting so desperate
to get closer to you.

512
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:22,777
What?

513
00:29:22,777 --> 00:29:26,317
If you had agreed to see me,
I wouldn't have taken it this far.

514
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:27,970
This really hurts.

515
00:29:28,477 --> 00:29:30,214
Don't you know
this is housebreaking?

516
00:29:30,214 --> 00:29:33,436
- I'm going to call the cops.
- The cops?

517
00:29:33,461 --> 00:29:35,461
I already did.

518
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,349
Excuse me, sir! Over here!

519
00:29:42,374 --> 00:29:43,555
Sir!

520
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,737
We had a report.

521
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:51,514
Sir! Over here!

522
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:53,103
Hey, Ji Sung.

523
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:59,930
How did this...

524
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,891
Let's just say it was
a lovers' quarrel.

525
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:06,297
My girlfriend wouldn't open the door
because she was upset.

526
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:09,189
Is he your boyfriend?

527
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:10,301
- No.
- Yes.

528
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:18,874
Should we contact the police?

529
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:22,844
No.

530
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:29,195
What are you doing right now?

531
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:32,914
I'm sorry, but we need to take
a few pictures for the record.

532
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:36,824
I won't stand by if you use
my picture without my permission.

533
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:38,830
Yes, sir.

534
00:30:39,193 --> 00:30:40,863
Let's see...

535
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:44,334
I think we need to take
the whole window frame off.

536
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:45,804
Pardon me?

537
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,327
Let's bring that thing over here.

538
00:30:48,748 --> 00:30:51,262
Let's see if we could do this...

539
00:30:51,286 --> 00:30:52,841
with the blade of an ax.

540
00:30:54,598 --> 00:30:55,848
Hold on a second!

541
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,917
Gook Hee, hand me the crowbar.

542
00:30:57,917 --> 00:31:00,075
This won't work. I need
to scrape it with a crowbar.

543
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,901
- The big one or the small one?
- The big one.

544
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:04,204
I'll just break the whole thing off.

545
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:07,310
Wait a minute! No!

546
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,958
- Why are you doing this? Wait!
- This is pretty hard.

547
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,116
Ji Sung, where are you going?
I'm scared.

548
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:15,990
You're scared?

549
00:31:16,272 --> 00:31:17,851
That's what I should be saying.

550
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:20,834
How would you feel about your ex
climbing over the window at night?

551
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:24,971
What else could I have done?

552
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,087
You don't answer my calls.

553
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:30,720
You don't respond
to the thousand messages I sent.

554
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
You don't even see me
when I go to see you.

555
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:36,731
You may be a cold-hearted person
to end us like this, but I'm not.

556
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:40,133
We've dated for seven years!

557
00:31:40,436 --> 00:31:42,882
Think of everything I've done
for you during those years.

558
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,145
How much I've loved you!

559
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,128
How could you throw me away
like trash over one mistake?

560
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:50,414
A mistake?

561
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:52,449
Did you just say a mistake?

562
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,317
You keep calling it a mistake,

563
00:31:54,317 --> 00:31:57,506
but is taking a nonconsensual photo
of your girlfriend really a mistake?

564
00:31:57,506 --> 00:31:59,408
Do you honestly believe so?

565
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,292
Fine, I've sinned to death!

566
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,362
I wish I was dead.

567
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,917
My regrets are driving me mad!

568
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:10,242
But this is too harsh.

569
00:32:10,242 --> 00:32:12,414
How could you just cut me out
of your life,

570
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:14,553
when I am begging you
for forgiveness?

571
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:16,315
You know how much I've loved you!

572
00:32:16,315 --> 00:32:18,667
How much I'm missing you right now!

573
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:19,757
I can't...

574
00:32:20,132 --> 00:32:22,289
I can't live without you.

575
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:24,283
I dream of you every day.

576
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:26,935
Did you even love me, Seo Ji Sung?

577
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:32,785
Yes, I did.
I loved you, you son of a gun!

578
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,857
Did you even love me?

579
00:32:34,857 --> 00:32:36,857
Did you do all that
because you loved me so much?

580
00:32:38,928 --> 00:32:41,804
For the past seven years,
I've loved you more than anyone.

581
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:44,553
I trusted and relied on you
more than anyone else!

582
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:46,206
How could you do this to me?

583
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:51,207
I also dreamed of marrying you
and living happily with our kids.

584
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:54,208
But, you...

585
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:57,459
- But, you!
- I'm sorry.

586
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,218
Ji Sung, I'm so sorry.

587
00:33:00,653 --> 00:33:02,971
Forgive me this once, please.

588
00:33:02,987 --> 00:33:05,268
Just this one time, Ji Sung.

589
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:07,983
Please, forgive me, Ji Sung.

590
00:33:07,983 --> 00:33:11,453
I won't ever do it again.
Forgive me, Ji Sung.

591
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:13,453
Please, forgive me.

592
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,069
Can I have some toilet paper?

593
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:28,246
Oh, sure. I'll get you some.

594
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,602
Here you go.

595
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,007
Watch your back.

596
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,740
Now, we're done here.

597
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,808
Thank you for your service.

598
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,812
I thank you, too.

599
00:33:46,113 --> 00:33:47,768
Let's leave together.

600
00:33:48,811 --> 00:33:51,031
I have to talk to my girlfriend.

601
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:51,932
Get out.

602
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:57,523
Ji Sung, I have something to say.

603
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,287
Please?

604
00:34:01,218 --> 00:34:02,624
- Hey, Ji Sung.
- Let's go.

605
00:34:02,649 --> 00:34:04,394
- Wait a second!
- Be careful.

606
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,512
- Let go of me! Okay.
- All right.

607
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,139
- I'll walk out of here myself.
- Sure.

608
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:13,041
Ji Sung, I left something
in the bathroom for you.

609
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:14,989
Please check it later.

610
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,900
I'm leaving now, Ji Sung.
Don't forget to lock up the doors!

611
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,900
- Please, look ahead. Be careful.
- Okay.

612
00:34:19,925 --> 00:34:22,182
Good night, Ji Sung!

613
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:23,779
Look ahead, please. Watch your back!

614
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,779
You'll get hurt if you try
to use force.

615
00:34:35,024 --> 00:34:36,668
- Be careful.
- Okay.

616
00:34:37,994 --> 00:34:40,173
You can cut the frame off
at a nearby hardware store.

617
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:41,399
You should go there right away.

618
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,399
- Thank you.
- Sure.

619
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:46,343
Thank you, too.

620
00:34:46,605 --> 00:34:48,928
As I've told you before...

621
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:52,423
- If you use my picture...
- We delete it after a few days.

622
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,066
Can I trust you to keep your word?

623
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:58,086
I've been very sensitive
to these kinds of issues lately.

624
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,187
You seem trustworthy.

625
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:03,910
You guys are firefighters,
after all.

626
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:07,352
Take special care
around this place, please.

627
00:35:07,698 --> 00:35:10,351
We're firefighters,
not the policemen.

628
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:13,350
But if you break
into this house again,

629
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,164
I'll hand you over to the cops
for housebreaking.

630
00:35:16,438 --> 00:35:18,824
I'm not sure if you heard me.
This is my girlfriend's house.

631
00:35:18,824 --> 00:35:21,859
I heard that you guys broke up.
Very clearly.

632
00:35:21,982 --> 00:35:24,711
I guess you've never had
a girlfriend before.

633
00:35:24,711 --> 00:35:27,866
- When two people date...
- I'll notify the cops in advance.

634
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:30,619
I'll ask them to keep an eye
on this place.

635
00:35:36,562 --> 00:35:38,487
Have we met before?

636
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:42,111
- Why do you look familiar?
- Hey, Mr. Jung!

637
00:35:43,128 --> 00:35:45,128
- Let's go!
- Wait a minute.

638
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:12,912
That guy is unbelievable.

639
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,169
This is a comedy in real life.

640
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:19,668
He's getting in the car.

641
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:22,073
How are you going
to get in the front seat?

642
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:23,674
He's trying backward.

643
00:36:24,141 --> 00:36:26,988
You need to call
a substitute driver. Come on!

644
00:36:26,988 --> 00:36:29,725
If I get to have an interview
with the monthly firefighter issue,

645
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:32,531
I'm going to mention this case
as one of the ridiculous ones.

646
00:36:34,094 --> 00:36:35,476
What are you doing?

647
00:36:37,668 --> 00:36:40,821
(Ji Sung, I'm sorry.)

648
00:36:40,845 --> 00:36:44,041
(Please come back to me.
I love you.)

649
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:54,301
(Confidential Agreement)

650
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:02,108
Bang Jung Han, are you serious?

651
00:37:09,938 --> 00:37:11,094
Oh, my gosh!

652
00:37:11,094 --> 00:37:12,542
I am so sorry.

653
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:21,835
Will this work?

654
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:25,337
It'll be better than doing nothing.

655
00:37:28,305 --> 00:37:30,737
It might bother me
when I use the toilet.

656
00:37:31,086 --> 00:37:33,344
- Should I flip it around then?
- No.

657
00:37:33,345 --> 00:37:35,650
Then people can see from outside.

658
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,650
Let's just put it over here.

659
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:42,746
Just keep it until tomorrow.

660
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:47,136
There must not be enough people
at the fire station in Gorae-dong.

661
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:49,259
Well, we're not short on people.

662
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,783
Then why do I always...

663
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:55,014
run into you
at my embarrassing moments?

664
00:37:58,122 --> 00:37:59,514
What are you embarrassed about?

665
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,695
He's the one
who should be embarrassed.

666
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,453
You did nothing wrong.

667
00:38:09,843 --> 00:38:11,024
You're right.

668
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,468
I did nothing wrong.

669
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,696
I am the victim.

670
00:38:17,898 --> 00:38:21,525
But I don't know why I'm embarrassed
and feel like hiding.

671
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:41,274
I'll take care of the ladder
on my way out.

672
00:38:42,179 --> 00:38:44,057
Call me if something comes up.

673
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:45,476
You know my number, right?

674
00:38:45,476 --> 00:38:47,145
Who doesn't?

675
00:38:47,145 --> 00:38:49,006
- It's 911.
- Not that one.

676
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:52,546
Then 112?

677
00:38:52,944 --> 00:38:53,993
My phone number.

678
00:38:57,193 --> 00:38:58,829
Call me directly.

679
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:00,607
I'll come running over.

680
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:04,831
Why are you so quiet?

681
00:39:05,928 --> 00:39:08,439
Okay. I'll do as you say.

682
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:09,884
Well,

683
00:39:10,585 --> 00:39:13,187
what time do you
leave work tomorrow?

684
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:14,689
Why?

685
00:39:15,156 --> 00:39:16,357
Your bathroom needs a window.

686
00:39:16,782 --> 00:39:19,558
I'll take care of that. It's okay.

687
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,028
I know it's not my duty,

688
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:23,364
but I want to do it myself
to feel relieved.

689
00:39:27,855 --> 00:39:30,171
I leave work at seven.

690
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:32,306
Seven, it is.

691
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:35,343
I'll come here by seven then.

692
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:38,346
Keep your door locked. Goodnight.

693
00:39:42,043 --> 00:39:43,384
Take this with you.

694
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:47,555
Keep it just in case.

695
00:40:01,909 --> 00:40:06,707
Why take last year's calendar
that I printed to take at home?

696
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,442
Print it again.

697
00:40:08,442 --> 00:40:09,911
- Are you going to pay for it?
- Fine.

698
00:40:10,197 --> 00:40:11,212
- Deal.
- Deal.

699
00:40:11,345 --> 00:40:12,166
- Deal.
- Deal.

700
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:13,247
That was nice harmony.

701
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:15,516
Your shift is
in the afternoon tomorrow, right?

702
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,619
- Switch it with mine.
- Why?

703
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,222
- I have something to do.
- Do what?

704
00:40:21,455 --> 00:40:23,858
Oh, the troublemaker cat?
You caught it.

705
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,862
I'm worried
about the other troublemaker.

706
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:29,363
Instead,

707
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:32,320
I'll work your weekend shift.

708
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:46,480
Mom.

709
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:55,256
Where is she going?

710
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:03,598
Oh, dear.

711
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,401
- Mom.
- My goodness.

712
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,672
- Eun Hwa.
- When did you do all this?

713
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:12,773
I can't believe this.

714
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,377
- You're here.
- Gosh.

715
00:41:17,011 --> 00:41:18,546
Happy birthday.

716
00:41:18,886 --> 00:41:20,968
What is this? Thank you so much.

717
00:41:20,968 --> 00:41:22,365
- Goodness.
- Mom...

718
00:41:22,365 --> 00:41:24,365
I've never received something
like this before.

719
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:26,318
- My.
- Really?

720
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:28,856
Since when did you work on this?

721
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:29,724
From five o'clock.

722
00:41:30,605 --> 00:41:33,127
Oh, please.

723
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,235
You're here to celebrate my birthday
despite your busy schedule.

724
00:41:41,616 --> 00:41:43,571
- You're the best.
- Is it good?

725
00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:45,439
It's amazing.

726
00:41:45,693 --> 00:41:46,841
Dad packed it.

727
00:41:49,617 --> 00:41:51,779
Does he still eat food salty?

728
00:41:52,003 --> 00:41:53,746
You said it was amazing
just a second ago.

729
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:57,204
Why, are you worried about him?
Should I tell him to eat it bland?

730
00:41:57,364 --> 00:42:00,421
He has to be healthy to escort you
when you walk down the aisle.

731
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:02,790
Whatever.

732
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:05,993
Aren't you going to get married?

733
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,429
Find yourself a good man
and get married.

734
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:11,632
Why, do you want to marry
another man after then?

735
00:42:12,431 --> 00:42:13,285
What?

736
00:42:14,482 --> 00:42:20,508
Well, I saw earlier that he was
giving you a surprise or something.

737
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:22,510
Did you see it?

738
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:25,406
It shocked the heck out of me.

739
00:42:25,406 --> 00:42:30,084
Is it Buddha's birthday or what?
Why did he make it too serious?

740
00:42:31,412 --> 00:42:32,219
So you saw it.

741
00:42:32,987 --> 00:42:35,656
I was going to introduce him to you
when you get married.

742
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:38,125
Are you going out with him for real?
Is it okay?

743
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,359
He seemed really young.

744
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:42,496
Others might think he's your son.

745
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:44,690
No way. I'm only 11 years older.

746
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:45,560
What?

747
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:48,102
- Mom.
- Quiet down.

748
00:42:48,469 --> 00:42:49,737
He's 11 years younger than you?

749
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,807
Why would that young man
want to date you?

750
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:53,908
It's strange.

751
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:57,078
What do you mean by that?
What's wrong with me dating him?

752
00:42:57,078 --> 00:43:00,147
I'm not saying you're strange.
Let's be rational here.

753
00:43:00,147 --> 00:43:03,350
He's too young. Are you sure
he doesn't have another intention?

754
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:04,652
It feels suspicious.

755
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,723
So your sharp eye for men
made you choose a guy like Jung Han.

756
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:11,659
Why would you bring that up here?

757
00:43:13,974 --> 00:43:17,071
If you're seeing him because
you're lonely or angry at Dad,

758
00:43:17,071 --> 00:43:18,569
just get back together with Dad.

759
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:19,393
I'm not insane.

760
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,837
If you like him that much,
marry someone like him.

761
00:43:23,196 --> 00:43:26,414
There has to be at least
one good side of him.

762
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:29,577
And you had a kid too. Do you really
have no feelings left for him?

763
00:43:29,862 --> 00:43:31,846
Yes, I'm grateful to him
for some things.

764
00:43:32,232 --> 00:43:33,084
Like what?

765
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:37,084
Because of him, I got
a totally different taste in men.

766
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:40,219
Fine. I won't tell you to see Dad.

767
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:42,743
Just look into him properly.

768
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:46,260
Hey, my eye for men is
more accurate than yours.

769
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,595
Leave if you're going to nag me.

770
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:50,464
I'm just being worried
as your daughter.

771
00:43:50,577 --> 00:43:51,899
Hurry on. You must be busy.

772
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:54,135
You don't want to get dumped...

773
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:56,270
- Shut it.
- and cry your eyes out later.

774
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,507
Fine, thank you for your advice
on my birthday.

775
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:02,226
You've got to be really careful
in dating a man these days.

776
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:04,112
You're talking too much today.

777
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:07,615
It's her birthday today.
Was I too hard on her?

778
00:44:20,234 --> 00:44:22,576
- Welcome.
- Hello.

779
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:32,239
It's not like I can ask him...

780
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:33,974
why he's dating Mom out in the face.

781
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:39,013
He doesn't seem too bad, though.

782
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:42,650
May I help you?

783
00:44:43,823 --> 00:44:46,554
Well, where's the novel section?

784
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,389
It's at the back over there.

785
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:49,790
- Thank you.
- No problem.

786
00:44:52,259 --> 00:44:53,894
Is he renting this place?

787
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:56,597
I wonder if offline bookstores
make money these days.

788
00:44:57,357 --> 00:45:02,203
Still, I heard not everyone
can run a place like this.

789
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:06,707
What?

790
00:45:06,766 --> 00:45:09,043
He got so many notices
from banks.

791
00:45:10,084 --> 00:45:11,579
Did he take a lot of loans?

792
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:14,148
Did you find the novel
you were looking for?

793
00:45:14,413 --> 00:45:16,248
- It's this one.
- Okay.

794
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,852
It's 14 dollars and 80 cents.

795
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,688
("Mom's 20 Years")

796
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,309
Okay.

797
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,279
Don't we need a gag today?

798
00:45:32,279 --> 00:45:33,334
No, thanks.

799
00:45:36,598 --> 00:45:37,491
Let's see.

800
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:40,975
Did you have a drink, by any chance?

801
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:43,394
Yes.

802
00:45:43,611 --> 00:45:46,347
I got dumped by a man
even without going out.

803
00:45:46,646 --> 00:45:47,514
Yesterday.

804
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:53,801
There's no need
to open your mouth this big.

805
00:45:58,185 --> 00:46:00,127
When should I come again?

806
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:02,696
How about dinner today?

807
00:46:02,696 --> 00:46:05,332
I got treated just now.
Must I come again in the evening?

808
00:46:07,855 --> 00:46:10,037
I wonder if he's a good man.

809
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:14,909
What if Mom ends up with a jerk
and suffers in her later years?

810
00:46:15,576 --> 00:46:19,046
She has 20 years...
No, 40 years left to the most.

811
00:46:20,048 --> 00:46:21,315
Is the report ready?

812
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,453
At a time like this...

813
00:46:27,828 --> 00:46:30,557
No. Never!

814
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:32,426
It will never be ready by tomorrow?

815
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,285
Excuse me?

816
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,628
The report on thermovision camera.

817
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:38,999
I need it for tomorrow's
executives' meeting.

818
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:41,702
Oh, that. Mr. Ok,
did you organize the interview?

819
00:46:41,704 --> 00:46:43,103
Yes, I'm sending it to you now.

820
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:46,459
(Summary of the Firefighter Meeting
Regarding the Thermovision Cameras)

821
00:46:46,907 --> 00:46:49,743
I've reserved a waxing shop today.

822
00:46:49,745 --> 00:46:51,845
I'll see you guys tomorrow
with sleek legs.

823
00:46:52,172 --> 00:46:53,614
Goodbye.

824
00:46:54,642 --> 00:46:56,850
I'm leaving!

825
00:46:56,852 --> 00:46:58,585
Goodbye!

826
00:47:00,688 --> 00:47:02,688
He's admirable sometimes.

827
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,292
He's got the guts to leave
as soon as the clock hits six.

828
00:47:05,592 --> 00:47:06,593
Bye then.

829
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,129
I'm leaving work too!

830
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:17,838
Ms. Seo.

831
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,140
See you tomorrow.

832
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:22,810
Hi, honey. I'll be there by seven.

833
00:47:25,652 --> 00:47:27,114
I'll come here by seven then.

834
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,086
I better do it at home.

835
00:47:36,837 --> 00:47:37,791
Hi, Dad.

836
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,461
It's a new menu this time.

837
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,308
Delicious.

838
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:58,846
It's really good for your health.
Drink some more.

839
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:02,114
I ate a lot before coming here.
Let me take time with this.

840
00:48:02,116 --> 00:48:03,117
Okay.

841
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:05,486
How fun.

842
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
- Hi, Gi Hyun.
- Hi.

843
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,922
- Dad.
- Hey.

844
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:10,958
What brought you to the company?

845
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:13,794
To get my food containers and stuff.

846
00:48:13,893 --> 00:48:16,063
- They're at home.
- Really?

847
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:18,866
- Did you enjoy it?
- Who?

848
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,267
Me or Mom?

849
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:22,302
Of course, it's you.

850
00:48:22,976 --> 00:48:24,738
She enjoyed it.

851
00:48:25,353 --> 00:48:27,741
She said it was salty and wanted you
to eat food less salty.

852
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:30,444
Is she worried about me?

853
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,182
Don't you have a girlfriend?

854
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:39,153
Why? Now that your mom
has a boyfriend,

855
00:48:40,052 --> 00:48:41,186
are you worried about me?

856
00:48:41,188 --> 00:48:43,557
Did you know? How did you know?

857
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:46,326
She's making it obvious
on her social media page.

858
00:48:46,406 --> 00:48:48,595
She even wore a dress,
which was totally not like her.

859
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:49,963
She put on makeup too.

860
00:48:50,697 --> 00:48:51,899
She became pretty.

861
00:48:52,606 --> 00:48:55,569
If you knew, why did you make
a birthday meal box for her?

862
00:48:57,504 --> 00:48:59,306
Because it could be the last.

863
00:48:59,379 --> 00:49:03,010
When we were married,
she made me a birthday meal,

864
00:49:03,176 --> 00:49:05,546
but I never got to make her
a birthday meal.

865
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:09,682
What should I do
for her next birthday?

866
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,320
Dad, are you okay?

867
00:49:14,214 --> 00:49:16,114
The man should be fine, right?

868
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:19,364
Your mom is old.
Things can't go wrong.

869
00:49:20,534 --> 00:49:22,075
No, never mind.

870
00:49:22,075 --> 00:49:24,075
She'll figure things out on her own.

871
00:49:25,501 --> 00:49:28,674
I wonder if the man isn't
very well-off.

872
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:29,597
Why?

873
00:49:29,622 --> 00:49:33,080
His social media only has pictures
of him eating street food.

874
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:35,728
Your mother is
seriously constipated.

875
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,447
Street food?

876
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:39,391
(Daehan Bank,
Star Bank)

877
00:49:42,356 --> 00:49:44,059
- Dad,
- Yes?

878
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:46,698
I took a break from work
to come and see you.

879
00:49:46,698 --> 00:49:49,167
I have to head back now,

880
00:49:49,191 --> 00:49:51,290
but you can sit here and finish
your drink. Take your time.

881
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:52,878
Hey, I'm leaving now.
Can you take care of my dad?

882
00:49:52,878 --> 00:49:54,159
Dad, I'm going now!

883
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,159
- Be careful.
- Okay.

884
00:50:01,323 --> 00:50:04,410
It's good for you to eat
soft food for a while.

885
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:07,915
Do you want my wisdom tooth
that badly?

886
00:50:08,016 --> 00:50:09,689
So much that you'd buy me porridge?

887
00:50:09,689 --> 00:50:13,107
I'll sign the form for you.
You can do whatever you want,

888
00:50:13,107 --> 00:50:14,430
get a Nobel prize or whatever.

889
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:15,979
Really?

890
00:50:18,776 --> 00:50:20,330
(Wisdom Tooth Donation Agreement)

891
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:29,030
Your wisdom tooth is
all taken care of,

892
00:50:29,055 --> 00:50:30,328
but your cavities are
still an issue.

893
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:31,722
Please refrain from eating
so many sweets.

894
00:50:33,379 --> 00:50:35,206
It's all because of that jerk.

895
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:38,390
My ex used to buy me
shaved ice so often,

896
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,316
I've had days when I had shaved ice
three meals a day.

897
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:41,885
Sounds like a terrible man.

898
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:44,132
My ex-ex-ex-boyfriend was
a pastry chef,

899
00:50:44,132 --> 00:50:45,798
and he specialized
in chocolate cakes.

900
00:50:45,798 --> 00:50:47,713
Then, my ex-ex-ex-ex-boyfriend,

901
00:50:47,713 --> 00:50:50,718
he used to run a wholesale store
for dried seafood,

902
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:54,061
and he bought me dried squids
and filefish fillet all the time.

903
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,812
Those are all foods that are bad
for your teeth.

904
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,712
Such terrible men they were.

905
00:51:00,812 --> 00:51:02,721
Not only did they take my money,

906
00:51:03,172 --> 00:51:04,744
but my teeth too.

907
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:06,809
You've had some interesting exes.

908
00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:08,719
Yes, interesting is a good way
to word them.

909
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:10,719
But to be honest,
they were just trash.

910
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:13,983
At least they were all handsome.

911
00:51:14,645 --> 00:51:17,229
I think I'm just destined
to meet trashy men.

912
00:51:17,229 --> 00:51:20,059
As you might already know,
I approached you...

913
00:51:20,059 --> 00:51:22,740
despite all of this pain
because I was interested in you.

914
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:28,979
Don't laugh. You're making
my heart flutter.

915
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:32,936
Does your heart...

916
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:35,168
still flutter for me?

917
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:38,107
Yes. That's why it's all so hard.

918
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,568
I'm going to regret it
if I don't say this.

919
00:51:46,568 --> 00:51:47,750
What is it?

920
00:51:48,868 --> 00:51:50,519
Do you want to date me?

921
00:51:54,103 --> 00:51:55,438
Why don't we?

922
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,040
Sorry?

923
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:04,474
But I'm also very trashy.

924
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:06,994
Are you sure about this?

925
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:19,672
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry. I'm running late.

926
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:22,129
- I'll wait.
- It's fine. You don't have to.

927
00:52:22,154 --> 00:52:24,268
I'll hire someone to put
my window up for me.

928
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:26,154
Thank you for being so caring.

929
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:39,389
Mom, I called because I felt bad.

930
00:52:39,451 --> 00:52:42,398
You brat. I was going to call first.

931
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:43,736
I'm also sorry.

932
00:52:43,736 --> 00:52:48,219
I overreacted because I'm worried
about you.

933
00:52:48,244 --> 00:52:49,381
You know how much I love you, right?

934
00:52:49,381 --> 00:52:51,675
Who would if I don't?

935
00:52:52,072 --> 00:52:53,682
Did you eat dinner?

936
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:55,786
Not yet. What about you?

937
00:52:55,786 --> 00:52:58,584
- I'm going to head out to eat now.
- With the man?

938
00:52:59,234 --> 00:53:01,191
- Yes.
- What are you having?

939
00:53:01,191 --> 00:53:02,652
Banquet noodles.

940
00:53:02,677 --> 00:53:04,264
Banquet noodles?

941
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,329
Why are you having banquet noodles
on your birthday?

942
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:09,845
Apparently, I'll live longer
if I have noodles on my birthday.

943
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:15,267
All right, then. Enjoy your noodles.

944
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:16,536
Okay.

945
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:23,616
I hear that it's really hard to run
small businesses nowadays.

946
00:53:25,137 --> 00:53:29,115
Is this man going for my mom's house
and her pension?

947
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:38,034
This will really be my last time.

948
00:53:38,034 --> 00:53:41,128
I promise.
This is my last time ever.

949
00:53:46,907 --> 00:53:48,237
Hi Fridge.

950
00:53:48,526 --> 00:53:50,715
Yes, please go on.

951
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:52,333
A man in his 40s.

952
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:54,133
Owns the MBS Bookstore
in Gorae-dong.

953
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:56,361
He's having banquet noodles tonight.

954
00:53:56,386 --> 00:53:59,248
What should he have tomorrow?

955
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,616
Mr. Yeon Ha Jun, I'd recommend
gimbap and fish cake soup.

956
00:54:04,724 --> 00:54:06,373
I guess his name is Yeon Ha Jun.

957
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:10,407
Mr. Yeon, you're a hopeless romantic
who's a self-made man.

958
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:17,241
How many bank accounts does he have?

959
00:54:17,241 --> 00:54:21,020
You usually use Johan Bank,
Rocket Bank, and Haru Bank.

960
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,171
You're a very rare saver
who saves quite a bit.

961
00:54:24,388 --> 00:54:27,947
Why does he only eat
street food with my mom, then?

962
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:31,585
You most-frequently visit
this private blog on Naver.

963
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:33,585
You're a man who journals.

964
00:54:34,266 --> 00:54:36,855
She's like a young girl
who loves street food.

965
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:42,083
I love looking for recipes online
and cooking together with her.

966
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:47,044
I look at the clock
very often nowadays.

967
00:54:47,044 --> 00:54:51,307
Thirty more minutes,
and I can meet her again.

968
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:53,581
I hope the 30 minutes
will pass quickly.

969
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:57,389
I hope that all 24 hours could be
5 a.m.

970
00:54:57,792 --> 00:55:00,709
This is too cheesy.
Why is he so emotional?

971
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:03,958
Wait, 5 a.m.?

972
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:06,957
That's...

973
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:09,295
when my mom goes to work.

974
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:13,852
So, he's been waiting for her.

975
00:55:20,456 --> 00:55:23,135
What time do you
leave work tomorrow?

976
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,590
- I leave work at seven.
- I'll come here by seven then.

977
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:28,734
That's all?

978
00:55:29,518 --> 00:55:30,874
- Yes.
- Voice recognition?

979
00:55:31,872 --> 00:55:33,412
I was just like that.

980
00:55:34,001 --> 00:55:37,384
I always wished that it'd be 7 p.m.

981
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:48,058
Why do I run into you
at my embarrassing moments?

982
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:49,374
What are you embarrassed about?

983
00:55:49,374 --> 00:55:51,265
You did nothing wrong.

984
00:55:52,828 --> 00:55:55,963
(Summary of the Firefighter Meeting
Regarding the Thermovision Cameras)

985
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,532
Call me directly.

986
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:02,019
I'll just feel a lot better
if I do it myself.

987
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,228
When did he text me?

988
00:56:07,228 --> 00:56:09,679
(Jung Gook Hee:
It's fine. I can wait.)

989
00:56:10,074 --> 00:56:11,201
What time is it?

990
00:56:33,881 --> 00:56:35,247
Is he gone?

991
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:37,541
What time is it now?

992
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,346
What?

993
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:42,894
He left already?

994
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,343
What were you expecting,
Seo Ji Sung?

995
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:48,066
You're the one who told him not
to wait.

996
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,066
Are you coming now?

997
00:57:15,836 --> 00:57:17,645
(Please Don't Date Him)

998
00:57:27,721 --> 00:57:29,067
- Mom?
- Who's the man?

999
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:30,716
I heard that there's a good
fortune teller at Pelican.

1000
00:57:30,716 --> 00:57:32,478
- Wrong person.
- I heard you're an expert.

1001
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:33,618
You got the wrong person.

1002
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:35,846
Hi Fridge. You're here often.

1003
00:57:35,846 --> 00:57:38,054
You're going to date him?
He admitted that he's trash.

1004
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:39,327
Does he think he's the only one
at the table who can eat?

1005
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,204
Does he only see me
as a one-night-stand?

1006
00:57:42,204 --> 00:57:43,950
His eyes drive me crazy!

1007
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,429
You can have this.

1008
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,327
The glamor-body
firefighter calendar.

1009
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,065
Delete it, please. Delete it.

1010
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,231
Does he have multiple personality
disorder or what?

1011
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:53,231
- Is he Dr. Jekyll or something?
- Is it all done?

1012
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:55,905
Hey! We're still inside!

1013
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,627
No!

1014
00:57:59,662 --> 00:58:00,739
It's...

1015
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:05,341
just nice.
