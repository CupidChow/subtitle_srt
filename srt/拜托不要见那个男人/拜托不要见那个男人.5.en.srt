1
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:16,605
"Madness is rare in individuals."

2
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:21,944
"But in groups, parties, nations,
and ages, it is the rule."

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,964
At the time, I was stuck
in the library all day.

4
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:33,188
I took out the most difficult book
and was reading a random page.

5
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:37,860
While I was reading the phrases
that I did not understand,

6
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:41,797
I didn't have to be conscious
of people looking at me.

7
00:00:43,265 --> 00:00:45,100
What has all that time...

8
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:48,070
done for me?

9
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:57,646
Did you just take a photo of me?

10
00:00:58,347 --> 00:00:59,181
No,

11
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,250
why would I?

12
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:04,286
Well, I thought I saw it.

13
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:05,487
Let me check.

14
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:08,290
Crazy jerk.

15
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:10,626
Why would I take your photo?

16
00:01:11,126 --> 00:01:14,229
Why? Are you guilty about something?

17
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,371
"Blessed are the forgetful,"

18
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,073
"for they get the better even
of their blunders."

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,608
Nietzsche.

20
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:32,414
Hey.

21
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:34,516
Maybe you should put this up
on your social media.

22
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:35,848
He's that guy.

23
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:37,030
- Don't you know him?
- Who is he?

24
00:01:37,054 --> 00:01:38,654
He was on the news.

25
00:01:39,488 --> 00:01:40,823
What? Really?

26
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:43,225
He's the one
who made that mess before.

27
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,328
Should we put this up?

28
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,283
Hey. Put it up. It'll go viral.

29
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,698
How shameless.

30
00:01:52,914 --> 00:01:54,463
- I know.
- Seriously.

31
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:55,704
Let's go.

32
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:02,811
Delete it.

33
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:09,918
"Whoever fights monsters
should see to it"...

34
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:13,922
"that in the process, he does not
become a monster."

35
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,393
"And if you gaze long enough
into an abyss,"

36
00:02:19,274 --> 00:02:21,797
"the abyss will gaze back into you."

37
00:02:22,597 --> 00:02:23,665
Nietzsche.

38
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,059
(Please Don't Date Him)

39
00:02:31,522 --> 00:02:32,823
Gosh, my head.

40
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:33,842
What?

41
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,078
You're still here, Gook Hee?

42
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,328
I still have something to do left.

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,482
I'll be going soon.

44
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:44,086
I cut back on carbs,
and it's killing me.

45
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,889
- You might collapse.
- Hey.

46
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:50,626
I only have a few days to go.
I should try my best.

47
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:54,096
I'll only be having this
from now on.

48
00:02:55,464 --> 00:02:57,464
I somehow managed to get it
from abroad,

49
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:59,607
but I can't read it.

50
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,607
How should I take this?
It'll all in English.

51
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,907
There's a phone app
for translating those.

52
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,908
What?

53
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:08,844
You don't have a messenger
but you have such an app?

54
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,447
It's not that I have it.
I'm just saying...

55
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,650
these apps exist.

56
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:17,419
Get a messenger.
With texts, you don't know...

57
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,721
if they've read it or not,
or read it but ignoring you.

58
00:03:21,723 --> 00:03:24,693
Do you know how frustrating it is?
Gosh, my head.

59
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:27,496
- Don't make me use my energy.
- Is that so?

60
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,463
I don't check my phone often.

61
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,101
I guess I didn't get back
as I didn't read it.

62
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:33,236
"I didn't get back."

63
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,604
You didn't? It must feel great
to be carefree.

64
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,975
Dry. Pollogen.

65
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,176
What?

66
00:03:41,616 --> 00:03:44,301
You changed your shift,
so you can change the sash for her?

67
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,818
What's going on?

68
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:51,820
What's up with his reaction?

69
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:03,098
- Hello?
- Sorry. I'll be running late today.

70
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,232
I can wait.

71
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,166
No, please don't.

72
00:04:06,168 --> 00:04:08,197
I'll have someone over
to put up the window.

73
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,838
Thanks for caring.

74
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,109
(It's okay. I will wait.)

75
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,768
Did she read it or not?

76
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,155
Is he gone?

77
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:01,823
What time is it?

78
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:04,760
What?

79
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,696
Did he leave already?

80
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:10,799
You're here.

81
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:31,987
Did I keep you waiting?

82
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:39,626
According to regulations, I need
to take a before and after shot.

83
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:40,796
I see.

84
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:47,836
I'll take the before shot for you.

85
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,974
Here we go.

86
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:29,144
Did you just take a photo of me?

87
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:33,786
Yes, it seemed like you'd need
the working procedure as well.

88
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,350
Do you want me to send this too?

89
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,852
Delete it.

90
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:44,019
It's not like you're guilty
or anything.

91
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,746
I'll send this to you right now.

92
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:46,679
Delete it.

93
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:00,322
You're here.

94
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:01,863
Delete it.

95
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:02,878
I mean,

96
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:05,680
does he have multiple personalities
or what?

97
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:08,550
Is he like Dr. Jekyll and Hyde?

98
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,787
He's the one who said he needs it.

99
00:07:14,073 --> 00:07:15,690
I should've asked him
before taking it.

100
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:23,040
(Jung Gook Hee)

101
00:07:23,077 --> 00:07:25,467
Did he read this or not?

102
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:31,239
That hurts.

103
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,041
Yes, Mom.

104
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:35,310
You wired me money.

105
00:07:36,104 --> 00:07:37,946
Did you see that now?

106
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:44,386
You must've been busy
going on dates every day.

107
00:07:44,388 --> 00:07:46,321
You shouldn't have.

108
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,682
You'll need it too.

109
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:49,642
Right, I do.

110
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:51,660
But I sent it
because it's your birthday.

111
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:53,428
I'm the best, right?

112
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:56,198
Sure. You're the best.

113
00:07:56,277 --> 00:07:59,100
What? But you seem so down.

114
00:08:00,869 --> 00:08:01,970
I'm...

115
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,737
going to end my relationship
with him.

116
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,742
How come? Did something happen?

117
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:11,544
I was going to see him casually.

118
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:14,115
But what you said weighed
on my mind.

119
00:08:14,175 --> 00:08:17,686
And if I keep seeing him,
things will go out of hand.

120
00:08:18,046 --> 00:08:19,087
Why?

121
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,057
He seemed pretty nice.

122
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:25,760
How would you know if he is?

123
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:31,132
Thirty more minutes,
and I can meet her again.

124
00:08:31,134 --> 00:08:33,001
So, he's been waiting for her.

125
00:08:34,563 --> 00:08:36,238
- He's a good guy.
- Says who?

126
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:38,907
Someone told me
that he's a good guy.

127
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:41,682
Did you go see a fortuneteller?

128
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:42,443
What?

129
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:46,014
Yes, it's similar to that.

130
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:47,649
- What did they say?
- Sorry?

131
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,051
What did the fortuneteller say?

132
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:53,455
Well...

133
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:58,106
You are a tree, Mom.

134
00:08:58,106 --> 00:09:00,996
And he is water.

135
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:04,499
The sun shines on this warm water.

136
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:10,505
And he will heat up
and moisten you.

137
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:17,178
Right. So he'll be an umbrella
to your life.

138
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,681
You should see him.

139
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:22,484
You should do as you want
as it's your life.

140
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,753
Oh, well. I'll think about it.

141
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,856
But Ji Sung. Who is this
excellent fortuneteller?

142
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,325
It's Fridge Spirit.

143
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:34,362
I'm so tired, Mom.

144
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,865
- I got it.
- Okay.

145
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,101
Fridge Spirit?

146
00:09:47,647 --> 00:09:48,715
You should keep it.

147
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:50,683
Just in case.

148
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:56,990
Honey, I'll get going.

149
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,524
Hold on. Honey.

150
00:09:58,524 --> 00:09:59,859
- Yes?
- Hang on.

151
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,227
Here.

152
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:02,628
Now,

153
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,673
Green juice, olive oil, noni juice,

154
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:06,608
turmeric, lactic acid, royal jelly,
and lutein.

155
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:08,466
You should take all of them
in order. Okay?

156
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,110
I do that already, so don't worry.

157
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,110
- See you.
- Bye.

158
00:10:25,054 --> 00:10:28,085
Gosh, look how forgetful he is.

159
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:31,210
I should give him
the omega-three too.

160
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,750
What?

161
00:10:35,853 --> 00:10:37,853
He didn't take his car.

162
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:42,837
What's all that mess?

163
00:10:44,234 --> 00:10:46,550
He's hopeless.

164
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,227
This is the prototype
of thermovision camera.

165
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:10,639
You're the best.

166
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,830
This darn national project.

167
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,874
The assemblyman of this neighborhood
is conducting a survey...

168
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:18,038
on the national project budget
before the government audit.

169
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:20,524
We're requested to provide
some data to prove...

170
00:11:20,524 --> 00:11:22,524
that we investigated
in the field ourselves.

171
00:11:29,202 --> 00:11:30,653
Manager Seo, why don't you go?

172
00:11:31,581 --> 00:11:33,898
- Me?
- Yes, with Mr. Ok.

173
00:11:33,923 --> 00:11:35,541
This is a national project,

174
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:38,086
and the fire chief is
coming for this.

175
00:11:38,086 --> 00:11:40,629
We should send a manager at least...

176
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:42,348
to meet the standard.

177
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:45,203
We shouldn't just send
a new employee alone there.

178
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,377
If we have to meet the standard,

179
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:49,264
why don't you go?

180
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:52,420
I'm allergic
to middle-aged Korean men.

181
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,373
Fogeys, you know.

182
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,771
I hate meeting
middle-aged Korean men.

183
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:58,647
Look.

184
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:01,400
I get goosebumps like this.

185
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,693
I didn't know
you had such an allergy.

186
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,588
A psychological allergy is
a serious thing.

187
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,723
If you aren't allergic to anything,
you wouldn't know how painful it is.

188
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,364
Put your phones in silent mode
when we're at a meeting.

189
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:16,952
Who is it?

190
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,767
It's not mine.

191
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,121
Sorry.

192
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:28,686
Hello?

193
00:12:28,686 --> 00:12:31,023
- Are you the counselor?
- You got the wrong number.

194
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,771
Hello? No, you got the wrong number.

195
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:47,773
Hello?

196
00:12:47,773 --> 00:12:50,337
- No.
- I got it from Lee Eun Hwa.

197
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,302
Aren't you a life counselor?

198
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:53,326
What?

199
00:12:54,028 --> 00:12:55,218
Who?

200
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,105
Mom, what happened?

201
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:02,986
Well, things got big last weekend.

202
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:06,326
It's delicious.

203
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:08,326
Well, Eun Hwa.

204
00:13:08,596 --> 00:13:11,676
I know I'm not good enough for you,

205
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:14,793
but I think it's time
to pluck up my courage.

206
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,101
It seems young people...

207
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,101
give a ring or something
at a time like this.

208
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:21,522
Here.

209
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:25,600
- What is this?
- My register.

210
00:13:27,231 --> 00:13:29,231
Why are you...

211
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:32,113
- showing me this?
- Well, don't be mistaken.

212
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,423
I'm showing you this
to make you believe...

213
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,643
that I won't cause harm to you.

214
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,523
This is my gift.

215
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,795
I heard cleaning detergent
can be very strong.

216
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,967
These products are
mild and effective.

217
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,496
It took a long time
to have them shipped from abroad.

218
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,523
He seemed like a nice person.

219
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,606
Ms. Kim, is something bothering you?

220
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:07,664
The thing is, I have
a strange feeling about my husband.

221
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:11,714
He keeps being all smiles
and sweet-talking to me these days.

222
00:14:11,714 --> 00:14:14,110
I'm sure he's either cheating on me
or into gambling.

223
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,031
But I'm clueless
about what he's up to.

224
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:18,531
Really?

225
00:14:19,246 --> 00:14:22,006
My daughter met
a skilled fortuneteller.

226
00:14:22,006 --> 00:14:24,258
- She serves a spirit called Fridge.
- Fridge?

227
00:14:29,388 --> 00:14:30,593
Is she that skilled?

228
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:32,683
Take me there.

229
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,497
Is that all?

230
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,810
You shared it only with her?

231
00:14:36,888 --> 00:14:38,173
I did.

232
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:40,248
It was so fascinating.

233
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:43,261
Where is the place? Take me there.
I'll treat you to a meal.

234
00:14:51,998 --> 00:14:53,547
Excuse me.

235
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:57,904
- Good luck then.
- What?

236
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:00,555
- What did you say, Director Oh?
- It's been decided...

237
00:15:00,555 --> 00:15:02,276
that you're going
to the fire station.

238
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,276
- But...
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

239
00:15:04,534 --> 00:15:05,911
- Hello?
- I want some cake.

240
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:07,700
- No.
- Go ahead.

241
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,171
Director Oh. Well...

242
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,152
Darn it. This is driving me crazy.

243
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,343
Hello?

244
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,645
I said no.

245
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,093
- So you specialize in love affairs.
- You got the wrong number.

246
00:15:21,118 --> 00:15:23,118
Ji Sung, it's your auntie.

247
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,993
Give me the number
of that skilled fortuneteller.

248
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:26,943
This isn't Seo Ji Sung's phone.

249
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:29,548
Please tell me her number at least.

250
00:15:29,548 --> 00:15:31,678
She wouldn't answer her phone.

251
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:36,554
All day long, seriously?

252
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,177
Should I just turn it off...

253
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,483
(Jung Gook Hee)

254
00:15:44,838 --> 00:15:47,470
(Incoming call)

255
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,251
I'm afraid if I can ask you
something like this.

256
00:15:53,335 --> 00:15:54,506
No, you can't.

257
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,910
Wait, I've been dating my boyfriend
for seven years.

258
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:01,412
You and I dated
for seven long years.

259
00:16:01,412 --> 00:16:02,762
How could you dump me like this...

260
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,338
- just because I made one mistake?
- Right.

261
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,947
I loved you. I loved you, you punk.

262
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:09,840
- I'm listening.
- We break up...

263
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,609
and get back together
over and over again.

264
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,784
I want to know what I should do
to put an end...

265
00:16:15,784 --> 00:16:17,299
to this relationship.

266
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:19,369
You haven't gotten
a crucial blow yet.

267
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,578
With one big betrayal,
you can break up with him.

268
00:16:21,578 --> 00:16:23,460
She says she's sincere,

269
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,460
- Thank you.
- but I can't believe her.

270
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,703
Everyone has sincerity.

271
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:30,724
What matters now
is their true character.

272
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:34,170
My boyfriend thinks
I'm spending too much.

273
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,036
- Tell me if I'm extravagant.
- Who's earning that money?

274
00:16:37,036 --> 00:16:39,537
- It's my salary.
- You're spending what you earn.

275
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,164
That means you're capable.
If you spend more, it's extravagant.

276
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:44,321
- You're so skilled.
- What?

277
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:48,822
I'm skilled? What on earth
are they talking about?

278
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,466
And why am I getting
more and more calls?

279
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,702
These people are willing...

280
00:16:58,702 --> 00:17:01,734
to share their information
with an unknown person.

281
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,208
But that guy made all the fuss...

282
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,338
about taking pictures.

283
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:06,664
Did you just take a photo of me?

284
00:17:06,664 --> 00:17:08,004
Delete it.

285
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:11,785
Darn it. I don't know.

286
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:13,949
You don't know what?

287
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,120
Do you have something to tell me?

288
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:25,917
What is the voice command
to turn on the fridge?

289
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,590
"Hi, Fridge."

290
00:17:30,655 --> 00:17:31,926
"Hi, Fridge."

291
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,327
We stopped developing Fridge,
but I see you stare at it often.

292
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:40,804
I used to work on this,

293
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:42,834
so when I need to refresh my mind,

294
00:17:42,834 --> 00:17:44,587
I check on it.

295
00:17:44,587 --> 00:17:46,226
When you need to refresh your mind?

296
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:15,619
Me too?

297
00:18:33,557 --> 00:18:35,275
- Ouch.
- Oh, dear.

298
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,460
Did that wake you up?

299
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:45,524
Get me the papers
that need to be signed.

300
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,020
What was that?
Did she just warn me...

301
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,944
to stop slacking off
and focus on work?

302
00:18:53,517 --> 00:18:55,440
It's time to go to the fire station.

303
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,430
- It's all set.
- Oh, thank you.

304
00:19:00,832 --> 00:19:02,832
Input your command.

305
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,208
Now this one?

306
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:09,324
- You drive me crazy, Mera.
- Input, complete.

307
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:13,972
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

308
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:18,313
Hi. Get me a cup of something
that will make me all awake.

309
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:22,117
Anything you drink here
will make you all awake.

310
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,027
Are you going somewhere?

311
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:26,027
Yes, I have offsite work
at the fire station.

312
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:30,470
I feel like things keep
getting twisted.

313
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,914
Why, did something come up again?

314
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,281
No, not exactly.

315
00:19:36,618 --> 00:19:39,833
Hey, it's said there's
a skilled fortuneteller in Pelican.

316
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,062
Try visiting her.

317
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,881
And tell me if she's really skilled.

318
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:45,596
I want to have my love fortunes
read with my boyfriend.

319
00:19:45,877 --> 00:19:47,538
Are you really going
to go out with him?

320
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:50,085
He called himself a piece of trash.

321
00:19:50,283 --> 00:19:53,135
I mean,
I'm curious about the reason.

322
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,239
You're the only one who's clueless.
Let me give you the answer, girl.

323
00:19:56,239 --> 00:19:58,048
Snap out of it.

324
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:00,377
Say something to her, Ji Sung.

325
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:02,837
It hasn't been a while
since she broke up with that weirdo.

326
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:04,417
But she's already at it again.

327
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:07,584
What can I say about it?

328
00:20:07,975 --> 00:20:10,502
Why can't you say anything?

329
00:20:10,803 --> 00:20:11,870
Is that mine?

330
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,443
It's Yu Jin.

331
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:20,913
I took half the day off,
and we're going on a date.

332
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,054
Yu Jin!

333
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,624
These are my girls.

334
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:32,791
She's Ji Sung.

335
00:20:32,792 --> 00:20:33,626
Hello.

336
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:35,027
- That's Ji Sung,
- Hello.

337
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:36,362
and she's Gi Hyun.

338
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:38,964
(Well-managed scalp)

339
00:20:38,965 --> 00:20:42,001
Based on his hygiene,
he has good habits.

340
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,088
(Clean shoes)

341
00:20:44,113 --> 00:20:45,224
(Body fat percentage: 12,
Muscle mass: 30 kg)

342
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:47,640
He's quite fit for his age.

343
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:49,875
It looks like he works out
regularly.

344
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,345
Hello.

345
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:55,481
I heard that you met Ye Seul
at work.

346
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:56,849
I've heard a lot about you.

347
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,449
(Voice tone: 120 Hz)

348
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,585
His voice is low but not too low.

349
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:02,254
He doesn't scan people
from head to toe.

350
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,322
(He's gazing straight.)

351
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:05,491
You can never fool anyone with eyes.

352
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:06,659
(Clear eyes)

353
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,727
His gazes are kind and clear.

354
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,065
(Good manners)

355
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:15,467
Not overly courteous,
but casually has good manners.

356
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,661
- Gi Hyun!
- Yes?

357
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:22,374
Yes. Hello.

358
00:21:22,854 --> 00:21:25,044
Could you recommend a drink for me?

359
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:27,379
For first-timers,

360
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,649
I recommend asparagus
shiitake strawberry milk.

361
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:36,955
Sure, I'll take that.

362
00:21:36,956 --> 00:21:37,956
All right.

363
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:41,093
Asparagus?

364
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,534
I lost.

365
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,502
I'm so intrigued.

366
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,105
Are there really no flags...

367
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,573
to this man that Ye Seul picked?

368
00:21:56,688 --> 00:21:57,643
Delete it.

369
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,015
- What?
- What are you thinking about?

370
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,584
Gi Hyun,

371
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:09,822
say that there's someone who hates
taking photos.

372
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:11,390
Why would that be?

373
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,059
- I'm like that too.
- Really?

374
00:22:14,495 --> 00:22:16,361
Is he just like you then?

375
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:17,963
What's wrong?

376
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,066
Let's talk later.

377
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:22,901
I have to get going right now.

378
00:22:23,384 --> 00:22:25,637
I really don't want to go.

379
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,643
Come here after work.
I have something to tell you too.

380
00:22:31,644 --> 00:22:32,811
All right, then.

381
00:22:35,881 --> 00:22:37,282
I really don't want to go.

382
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,353
What are you putting
all of that makeup on for?

383
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:44,556
Nothing. It'll motivate me
to work hard.

384
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,427
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

385
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,129
I'm going now.

386
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:06,145
Hey!

387
00:23:06,796 --> 00:23:08,547
- Hello.
- Hello.

388
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:10,315
You're here. How are you?

389
00:23:10,316 --> 00:23:12,084
Hello.

390
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,087
You heard, right?
It's a governmental project,

391
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:17,523
so there's a lot to go over.

392
00:23:17,903 --> 00:23:21,593
I know what you mean. Working
with government money isn't easy.

393
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:24,563
- Please hop in.
- Thanks.

394
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,133
I'm closing the door now.

395
00:23:29,268 --> 00:23:31,837
There were a lot of people
in the bathroom.

396
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:37,142
What? He already ate?

397
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,280
I'm really trashy too. Are you sure?

398
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:43,182
Is he...

399
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:45,450
the type who only looks out
for himself when it comes to food?

400
00:23:45,451 --> 00:23:47,119
(A food-greedy man?)

401
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,466
Is that why
he called himself trashy?

402
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:04,570
I'm sorry. The kid at the table
next to us...

403
00:24:04,636 --> 00:24:06,371
really wanted some shrimps,

404
00:24:06,372 --> 00:24:07,673
so I gave him half of ours.

405
00:24:08,784 --> 00:24:11,777
I see.

406
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,146
That's good. At least he's not
the worst type.

407
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,350
What's his flaw, then?

408
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:21,720
Have some.

409
00:24:29,506 --> 00:24:30,362
Here you go.

410
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:33,365
Sorry, but our card machine
is broken.

411
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,737
I don't have any cash on me.

412
00:24:39,404 --> 00:24:42,541
Is he the stingy type who doesn't
ever pay?

413
00:24:42,542 --> 00:24:43,709
(A stingy man?)

414
00:24:44,576 --> 00:24:45,677
I'll pay.

415
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:59,892
(All the change is mine!)

416
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,629
No, I said I'll buy.

417
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,531
Sorry, could I send the money
over wire transfer then?

418
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,367
Sure.

419
00:25:08,368 --> 00:25:10,736
You've come here so often.

420
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:12,838
He's not the type to make
the woman pay for everything either?

421
00:25:13,188 --> 00:25:14,706
What's his red flag?

422
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:16,975
Ye Seul,

423
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:18,911
would you like to get
a glass of wine?

424
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:21,380
Sure, why not?

425
00:25:21,381 --> 00:25:22,381
Do you know anywhere?

426
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,783
I have some good wine at home.

427
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:27,019
What do you think about drinking
at my place?

428
00:25:27,413 --> 00:25:29,354
He wants me over
at his house already?

429
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:33,825
Is he the type who sees women...

430
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:34,860
merely as one-night-stands?

431
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,128
(A one-night-stand?)

432
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,497
Am I supposed to go with him or not?

433
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,938
Guys like him always use
the best perfume ever.

434
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:47,539
My heart is pounding.

435
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,675
Let's go.

436
00:25:59,094 --> 00:26:02,530
I'm on a diet right now,
so I've been cutting carbs,

437
00:26:02,555 --> 00:26:05,557
and that makes me lose my temper
so much easier.

438
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,193
Are you going the right way?
Drive properly!

439
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,594
Eyes on the road!

440
00:26:09,595 --> 00:26:11,296
See? It's not me.

441
00:26:11,297 --> 00:26:12,898
I just suddenly get
really mad and sensitive.

442
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:16,568
If a car cuts in without blinking,

443
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,403
I get furious.

444
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,640
That's why Gook Hee does
all the driving nowadays.

445
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:22,674
Hey!

446
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,844
You can't drive like that.
See? I'm getting all worked up.

447
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,881
Such fascinating gadgets you have
in the car.

448
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:32,451
- This is...
- That's a wearable camera.

449
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:33,952
When dealing with anyone drunk,

450
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:35,721
the rule is to keep
the camera recording.

451
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:38,557
Most don't remember anything
when they sober up,

452
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:39,858
so a lot of them file complaints.

453
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,693
And surprisingly, people beat us up
quite often.

454
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:44,296
The camera is a source of evidence
in cases like that.

455
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:45,597
I see.

456
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:50,802
Let go!

457
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:52,838
I'm typing!

458
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:54,106
Let me go!

459
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,909
Is all of that on this?

460
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:01,813
That's seriously so embarrassing!

461
00:27:05,217 --> 00:27:07,307
This is the mock test site...

462
00:27:07,879 --> 00:27:11,023
that our Gorae Fire Station
prides itself over.

463
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:13,225
As I became the Team Leader...

464
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:14,893
of the Central 911 Headquarters,

465
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,596
I, who knew the importance
of a mock test site...

466
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,499
more than anyone else,

467
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,768
since becoming the Team Leader
in 2018,

468
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:24,970
and after receiving
the Presidential Medal,

469
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:26,571
argued that we couldn't
postpone this any longer,

470
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,808
then built the mock test site...

471
00:27:30,146 --> 00:27:32,144
to foster firemen who are strong
on site...

472
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,613
and to provide service that touches
people's hearts.

473
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,282
Here, we can create
the same smoke, gas,

474
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:40,252
as well as temperature
as in a real fire.

475
00:27:40,277 --> 00:27:43,857
Today, we are here in collaboration
with Pelican Electronics...

476
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:46,591
to test the thermovision cameras,

477
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:50,896
so that we can protect the residents
and their properties in Gorae-dong,

478
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:54,833
and minimize damage
as trustworthy firefighting...

479
00:28:05,072 --> 00:28:09,259
Today, we are here in collaboration
with Pelican Electronics...

480
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,015
to test the thermovision cameras,

481
00:28:12,754 --> 00:28:16,151
so that we can protect the residents
and their properties in Gorae-dong,

482
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:20,432
and minimize damage
as trustworthy firefighting...

483
00:28:29,936 --> 00:28:32,617
Cockroaches? None.

484
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:35,450
Spider webs? None.

485
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,030
Food waste bin in the sink?

486
00:28:39,388 --> 00:28:41,205
In the garbage, then?

487
00:28:43,876 --> 00:28:47,367
Everything is clean. He doesn't seem
like a messy person.

488
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:49,562
Could he have
an obsessive cleaning disorder?

489
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,917
(Obsessive cleaning disorder?)

490
00:28:59,199 --> 00:29:02,819
There is dust.
He's within normal boundaries.

491
00:29:08,979 --> 00:29:10,936
(Mother)

492
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:13,741
This is it! He's a momma's boy.

493
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:15,929
Hey, Mom.

494
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:18,218
What time is it there?
Why are you calling?

495
00:29:18,218 --> 00:29:21,498
Got it. I'll take care of it.

496
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:24,498
Okay. Talk to you later.

497
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,271
Is your mother currently abroad?

498
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:32,261
She likes to travel,
so she always goes everywhere.

499
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,758
She's probably in Europe right now.

500
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,760
I haven't asked her
what country she's in.

501
00:29:38,608 --> 00:29:41,517
She only calls me when she has
an errand for me to run.

502
00:29:42,451 --> 00:29:44,451
He doesn't even know
where she's traveling.

503
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:48,853
She only calls him when she needs
something, and not just to say hi?

504
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,806
Is your father traveling with her?

505
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:52,161
Probably not.

506
00:29:52,607 --> 00:29:55,781
Is he really this cool
with his parents?

507
00:29:56,198 --> 00:29:58,782
Then he's probably not
a momma's boy.

508
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,536
What kind of baggage does he have?

509
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,658
- Thank you for your hard work!
- You too.

510
00:30:08,658 --> 00:30:11,299
You must be so tired.
Thank you so much.

511
00:30:12,587 --> 00:30:13,801
Thank you.

512
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:16,441
You're here now.

513
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:20,008
- UV index goes down after four p.m.
- I don't want to hear it.

514
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:21,558
Thank you.

515
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:23,899
Thank you for your work!

516
00:30:25,413 --> 00:30:29,945
I lost my focus because I didn't
have any carbs today.

517
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:32,812
I usually do better at training.

518
00:30:33,808 --> 00:30:35,511
I'm going to pass out.

519
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:38,921
I used to be the first
to finish training.

520
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,708
Carbs could kill people.

521
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,708
- I'm going to grab some water.
- Sure.

522
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:51,328
- I'll get going now then!
- Where are you going?

523
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,866
You could at least clean
this place up. You just got here.

524
00:30:54,866 --> 00:30:57,672
I don't stay after hours
because I don't know how to leave.

525
00:30:57,672 --> 00:30:59,694
- Ms. Seo!
- Why?

526
00:30:59,694 --> 00:31:02,345
Just tell me to clean up after them.

527
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:04,412
Don't beat around the bush.

528
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:07,203
Just be forward with me
when you want something.

529
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:09,295
I'll take care of this place then.

530
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:10,606
You should take this.

531
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:18,362
One way or the other, I always
end up doing all the work.

532
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:23,765
(There is no recording.)

533
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:26,120
- Hey, Dong Jin?
- Yes?

534
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,974
Where's the recording on this?

535
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:31,025
The recording files on it.

536
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:32,676
I completely wiped it out.

537
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:34,861
What do you mean? I gave this
to you to back them up.

538
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:37,986
- Didn't you want me to return it?
- Come on!

539
00:31:37,986 --> 00:31:39,696
Are you serious?

540
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:41,142
I gave this to you...

541
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:42,674
to upload the recordings,
you lunatic!

542
00:31:42,674 --> 00:31:45,983
I'm seriously going to hurt you!
Oh, my goodness.

543
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:48,896
He's driving me crazy.
What should I do?

544
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:51,397
Excuse me.

545
00:31:52,224 --> 00:31:55,000
I'm so sorry,

546
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,458
but the recordings from before
didn't get saved.

547
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:02,246
I think we have to retake the shoot
when Mr. Gam Oh Jung comes.

548
00:32:02,246 --> 00:32:04,410
Give it to me. I'll take it.

549
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:09,157
- Pardon me?
- Oh Jung's not feeling so well.

550
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,658
I'll take a quick shoot.

551
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:15,296
Okay. I'm sorry.

552
00:32:15,296 --> 00:32:18,530
You guys worked so hard,
and we deleted it by mistake.

553
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,676
Here you go.

554
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,778
- How do I turn this on?
- Here.

555
00:32:23,778 --> 00:32:26,934
There's a specific command word
for it. Hold on.

556
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,938
You drive me crazy, Mera!

557
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:50,438
I'll take it.

558
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:52,208
Okay.

559
00:32:53,598 --> 00:32:54,769
Okay then.

560
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:08,383
- Thank you for your work!
- Sure!

561
00:33:21,339 --> 00:33:23,280
I feel better now.

562
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:27,493
Hey, excuse me!

563
00:33:28,096 --> 00:33:29,618
- Yes?
- Are you leaving?

564
00:33:29,618 --> 00:33:31,480
Yes! We're all done.

565
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
- Did everyone leave?
- Yes!

566
00:33:35,966 --> 00:33:39,348
What? They didn't even say goodbye.

567
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,009
I feel dizzy.

568
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:45,009
Whatever. I'm so tired.

569
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,759
I see, they cleaned this place up.

570
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:50,515
Okay then.

571
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:54,265
But why did Gook Hee leave
without telling me?

572
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:57,521
Look at this. They didn't even
lock the doors.

573
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:02,030
I always have to take care of things
until the end.

574
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:07,134
I am going home now!

575
00:34:07,134 --> 00:34:08,447
(Lock the doors after use.)

576
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:12,632
My legs are shaking.
I want some iced coffee.

577
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,390
What's taking her so long?

578
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:28,877
Thank you so much.

579
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:31,538
I'm sorry to have caused you
so much trouble.

580
00:34:31,538 --> 00:34:32,814
Don't worry about it.

581
00:34:43,195 --> 00:34:45,380
Where are you?
What's taking you so long?

582
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,695
Almost done. I'm leaving soon!

583
00:34:55,931 --> 00:34:57,087
What's going on?

584
00:34:58,189 --> 00:34:59,916
Why won't they open?

585
00:34:59,916 --> 00:35:01,959
What? Why won't the doors open?

586
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:03,591
Are they locked?

587
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:20,357
Oh Jung!

588
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,356
Someone's in here!

589
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:25,108
We're still here!

590
00:35:27,087 --> 00:35:28,655
Are they locked?

591
00:35:28,655 --> 00:35:30,616
Let me try calling someone.

592
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:33,618
What?

593
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:36,705
The power was just on.

594
00:35:36,705 --> 00:35:38,122
My gosh!

595
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:41,227
I used my phone all day today,
and now it's dead.

596
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:43,225
Do you have your phone with you?

597
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,506
I don't carry around my phone
during training.

598
00:35:45,506 --> 00:35:47,897
Oh, no. What should we do then?

599
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:49,768
Are we locked up in here?

600
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:53,426
It looks like it could get
really cold.

601
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:56,242
It'll probably be colder at night.

602
00:35:56,242 --> 00:35:58,641
What if we freeze to death in here?

603
00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:01,569
Is there even airflow in this place?

604
00:36:03,082 --> 00:36:05,171
It doesn't get that cold.

605
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,006
It's not a freezer.

606
00:36:07,006 --> 00:36:10,002
You've seen way too many movies.
Don't worry.

607
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:13,656
In the worst-case scenario, Oh Jung
will come find us in the morning.

608
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:17,008
Since we used this space today,
we have to clean it up tomorrow.

609
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,668
In the morning?

610
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:21,165
How are we going to stay here
until the morning?

611
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,239
What about the toilet?

612
00:36:28,606 --> 00:36:30,606
We need to find a way
to get out of here.

613
00:36:31,946 --> 00:36:33,232
What should we do?

614
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,990
Over there!

615
00:36:40,252 --> 00:36:44,495
Could we find a way out
if we climb over there?

616
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:47,743
Please excuse me.

617
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:52,451
In 1, 2, 3!

618
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:58,258
I think I can reach it.

619
00:37:00,082 --> 00:37:03,073
- Just a little higher.
- In 1, 2, 3!

620
00:37:03,357 --> 00:37:04,810
I think I can make it!

621
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:09,182
Hello! Someone's in here!

622
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:13,519
Why is this place built
in such a secluded area?

623
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:18,167
As you can see, we often train...

624
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:21,349
for explosives in here.

625
00:37:21,389 --> 00:37:24,134
If we don't build this place
somewhere secluded,

626
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:26,010
people's complaints flood in.

627
00:37:26,685 --> 00:37:29,945
I need to go up
just a little higher.

628
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,940
- I'm almost there!
- Wait, hold on a second.

629
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:35,631
- Why? Oh, gosh!
- Hold on!

630
00:37:53,564 --> 00:37:55,163
You have...

631
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,806
a really high nose bridge.

632
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:11,129
This way wouldn't do, right?

633
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:12,170
Well...

634
00:38:12,476 --> 00:38:13,940
You're a firefighter,

635
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,976
so you must have much experience
in rescuing confined people.

636
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:18,669
Isn't there another way?

637
00:38:18,989 --> 00:38:20,972
It's my first time
being confined myself.

638
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:25,710
In movies, those who are good
at using computers...

639
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,615
escape by tapping their phones
a few times.

640
00:38:30,615 --> 00:38:34,152
That's when there's a Wi-Fi signal.

641
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:36,921
Engineers are nothing without Wi-Fi.

642
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:39,557
And my phone ran out of battery.

643
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:43,105
What do we do?

644
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,864
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

645
00:38:50,014 --> 00:38:52,837
He's been too wholesome so far.

646
00:38:53,271 --> 00:38:56,040
Does he have a sexual problem?

647
00:39:03,214 --> 00:39:05,616
No, he doesn't.

648
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:07,518
My instinct says so.

649
00:39:08,326 --> 00:39:10,955
He's so attractive.

650
00:39:11,486 --> 00:39:12,690
Could he be...

651
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:14,792
a sex maniac?

652
00:39:28,886 --> 00:39:31,476
So he doesn't cross the line
at crucial moments.

653
00:39:31,862 --> 00:39:34,812
It's crazy, but I'm so fluttery.

654
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:38,216
Gosh, why did I close my eyes?

655
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:45,523
My gosh.

656
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,959
Look at his gaze.

657
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:50,078
He's got some crazy gaze.

658
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:53,364
It's even crazier
to see him approach.

659
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,471
My gosh, he's holding my head
with his hand.

660
00:40:00,473 --> 00:40:01,772
It's darn thrilling.

661
00:40:02,386 --> 00:40:03,854
Whatever.

662
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:07,411
If you have a sting,
I'll investigate that sting.

663
00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:12,583
Yu Jin, I'm going to make you mine.

664
00:40:34,405 --> 00:40:38,142
It's a little scary
now that it's dark.

665
00:40:40,471 --> 00:40:44,282
Gook Hee, you look so nonchalant.

666
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,884
I'm used to it.

667
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,856
When I enter somewhere
to put out a fire, it's always dark.

668
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:57,228
So I'm okay with this much.

669
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:01,966
I see.

670
00:41:02,066 --> 00:41:03,267
Figures.

671
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:04,802
By the way,

672
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:09,574
why is the door locked?
And why can't we reach Mr. Gam?

673
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,278
I rarely reach anyone.

674
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:16,714
I see.

675
00:41:20,124 --> 00:41:21,252
It's scary.

676
00:41:24,488 --> 00:41:26,224
Don't worry.

677
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:31,395
Another night duty worker
looks for me if I'm gone.

678
00:41:33,017 --> 00:41:33,817
Okay.

679
00:41:36,734 --> 00:41:39,370
I'm not scared of that.

680
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:42,473
I'm getting hungry.

681
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:47,011
What if my stomach rumbles
while I'm alone with him?

682
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:49,794
Dear all the deities,

683
00:41:49,794 --> 00:41:53,517
I'm okay with any sound
if it's not the rumbling.

684
00:41:53,657 --> 00:41:54,919
Please.

685
00:41:58,301 --> 00:41:59,924
Did you hear that sound?

686
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:01,225
What was that?

687
00:42:01,478 --> 00:42:02,326
Rats?

688
00:42:03,368 --> 00:42:04,729
Rats? Where?

689
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:07,798
Where? Where are they?
I'm scared of rats.

690
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:11,302
Maybe they didn't think we were here
because we talked too quietly.

691
00:42:11,547 --> 00:42:14,705
They won't come out if they know
we're here. Let's keep talking.

692
00:42:14,705 --> 00:42:17,341
Talk about what?
I don't have anything to say.

693
00:42:17,473 --> 00:42:20,278
Just keep talking like that.

694
00:42:20,783 --> 00:42:21,779
And...

695
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,474
And?

696
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:25,209
Let go.

697
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:26,484
Of what?

698
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:29,220
My hand.

699
00:42:37,746 --> 00:42:39,019
Rats...

700
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:46,270
Meow.

701
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:48,606
Meow.

702
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,209
(Natural Food, Tak)

703
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,764
Hello, Ms. Tak.

704
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,900
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

705
00:42:59,047 --> 00:43:00,369
Goodness.

706
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:05,440
- Please, I beg you.
- What?

707
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,043
I know it's past 8:50 p.m.,

708
00:43:08,045 --> 00:43:12,748
but please make me
a cup of pork skin cube latte.

709
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:17,352
I'm on a diet,
so I can't eat carbohydrates.

710
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:19,641
There are so many things
I can't eat,

711
00:43:19,666 --> 00:43:21,678
and now I'm constipated
because I didn't eat much.

712
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:24,126
This is the only place
I can rely on.

713
00:43:24,593 --> 00:43:25,360
What?

714
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:27,996
You see,

715
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:31,500
I have to shoot for a muscular
firefighters calendar.

716
00:43:32,174 --> 00:43:35,003
Of course, this year only has
three months left.

717
00:43:35,003 --> 00:43:37,103
This is a rare item.
It's very hard to get.

718
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:38,874
I'll give it to you.

719
00:43:39,374 --> 00:43:42,844
Please be my savior. Please.

720
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:44,680
Please.

721
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:46,848
I will make one for you.

722
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:48,517
Really?

723
00:43:49,798 --> 00:43:50,886
Thank you.

724
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:55,867
You know, one of my friends
works at Pelican,

725
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,409
and she went to the fire station
for her offsite work.

726
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,028
Didn't she leave yet?

727
00:44:00,398 --> 00:44:02,764
Yes, she finished work and left.

728
00:44:04,132 --> 00:44:06,768
Hasn't she come yet?
Maybe she went home.

729
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:09,464
She said she'd meet me
before going home.

730
00:44:09,698 --> 00:44:12,908
Is she the type of person
who always keeps her promises?

731
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,576
No, not her, but I am.

732
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,046
There's no way she'd break
our promise without telling me.

733
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:19,681
Her phone is off too.

734
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:22,617
So I thought she was working.

735
00:44:23,097 --> 00:44:25,787
It's strange. I locked the door
of the training ground...

736
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:26,755
Wait.

737
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:29,524
- I locked the door.
- Did you check inside?

738
00:44:29,524 --> 00:44:30,859
I didn't.

739
00:44:31,505 --> 00:44:32,794
- What should I do?
- What should you do?

740
00:44:32,794 --> 00:44:33,662
What?

741
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:34,830
Oh, my gosh.

742
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:36,631
I think I have to go.

743
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:38,934
I'll have that latte next time.

744
00:44:38,934 --> 00:44:41,603
No, just report to the fire station
or call...

745
00:44:44,686 --> 00:44:46,975
He's so reckless.

746
00:44:50,428 --> 00:44:52,417
(Time to order green juice
for husband)

747
00:44:52,441 --> 00:44:56,184
Maybe he's better
than a person with a mask.

748
00:44:57,953 --> 00:45:01,723
So by analyzing a conversation
in general,

749
00:45:01,725 --> 00:45:06,294
it predicts what words
or sentences will follow.

750
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:09,931
That's how we make it understand
and talk naturally.

751
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:11,566
It's the same for this machine.

752
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:14,035
I'm an audiobook or anything.

753
00:45:14,037 --> 00:45:17,038
How long must I keep
talking to myself?

754
00:45:17,126 --> 00:45:18,540
It drives me crazy.

755
00:45:19,954 --> 00:45:22,611
There aren't any risk factors
within two meters.

756
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,546
You may approach.

757
00:45:25,045 --> 00:45:26,481
You may approach.

758
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:32,154
Why won't it turn off?

759
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,825
It's what I talked about
during the interview.

760
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:42,931
You added a function of informing
one's distance from risk factors.

761
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,567
Yes, you talked about it then.

762
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,903
I thought you had no time.

763
00:45:48,683 --> 00:45:51,540
I couldn't do anything else
because of this.

764
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:56,778
Well,

765
00:45:57,198 --> 00:46:01,216
I'm not saying
that's because of you.

766
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,688
By the way,

767
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:11,827
why did you set its voice access
as: "You drive me crazy"?

768
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,132
So many things drove me crazy
yesterday and today.

769
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:21,303
Let's say I was complaining
through this.

770
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:22,938
To the machine?

771
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:25,841
That's cute.

772
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:29,144
Because I'm close with machines.

773
00:46:30,979 --> 00:46:32,581
You aren't close
with machines, are you?

774
00:46:33,234 --> 00:46:36,451
Why don't you give it a go?
It's very useful and convenient.

775
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:38,587
It teaches you everything.

776
00:46:40,388 --> 00:46:43,959
Machines do give you information,

777
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:46,094
but what we firefighters do...

778
00:46:47,001 --> 00:46:49,531
depends on our decisions.

779
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:53,034
Whether there's a fire or not
behind a door.

780
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:56,571
How many people
are locked up inside.

781
00:46:57,072 --> 00:47:00,542
Machines teach you such things.

782
00:47:01,215 --> 00:47:03,612
But whether we jump
into the fire or not...

783
00:47:04,746 --> 00:47:06,815
is totally up to us.

784
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,518
You're right.

785
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:12,153
Then,

786
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:17,926
am I sacrificing my youth
on something useless?

787
00:47:19,854 --> 00:47:21,763
But when I actually used it,

788
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,799
I couldn't say it was useless.

789
00:47:25,326 --> 00:47:27,002
If it informs us about a distance,

790
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:30,438
we will get a moment to think
before taking a step.

791
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:33,199
And that's very important.

792
00:47:34,175 --> 00:47:35,810
If we have a moment to think,

793
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:39,548
we can make a better decision
more easily.

794
00:47:59,374 --> 00:48:00,802
At that time,

795
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:06,474
I should've asked you
before taking a picture.

796
00:48:06,537 --> 00:48:08,833
I'm sorry for taking
a photo of you...

797
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:11,777
without telling you.
That must've been so uncomfortable.

798
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:14,020
It's fine.

799
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,131
I'm sorry...

800
00:48:16,881 --> 00:48:21,100
for overreacting that day.

801
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,908
Why do you hate taking photos
so much?

802
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:33,142
Most people easily send their photos
and information to strangers...

803
00:48:33,142 --> 00:48:37,800
like fortunetellers to have
their fortunes told and all.

804
00:48:38,454 --> 00:48:39,551
Well,

805
00:48:41,306 --> 00:48:43,798
real is better...

806
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:49,155
than superficial information
and photos like that.

807
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,214
Right then,

808
00:48:57,925 --> 00:49:03,064
I realized that it's fine
to not know everything.

809
00:49:05,406 --> 00:49:07,760
We may not have any information,

810
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,789
but as you've said,
whether we have it or not,

811
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:16,583
what ultimately makes us decide is
what our hearts feel.

812
00:49:17,683 --> 00:49:19,871
No equation or algorithm...

813
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,345
can predict what a heart will feel,

814
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,093
after all.

815
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,280
Gook Hee!

816
00:49:57,888 --> 00:50:00,228
I locked the doors
without knowing people were in here.

817
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:04,541
I ran so fast, my head hurts.

818
00:50:04,541 --> 00:50:09,460
You two would've frozen to death
if I didn't come.

819
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,902
I'm glad you came so fast.

820
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:15,144
- I'll head out first.
- Go ahead.

821
00:50:15,659 --> 00:50:19,750
You should've called or something.
What were you doing?

822
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,648
You came too fast.

823
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,904
Of course, I did.

824
00:50:31,383 --> 00:50:34,913
Why do I feel like I did
something wrong?

825
00:50:35,134 --> 00:50:36,936
Is it just my no-carb diet?

826
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:39,285
Yes, of course.
Of course, he's thankful.

827
00:50:39,285 --> 00:50:41,375
Gook Hee, you're thankful, right?

828
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,174
You should be.

829
00:51:35,621 --> 00:51:37,525
(You have a new mail.)

830
00:51:43,507 --> 00:51:50,016
There's a little bug that we found
while running the program.

831
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:52,475
I think it may be an issue
on your end.

832
00:51:52,475 --> 00:51:57,343
Are there any updated cases
of sensor errors?

833
00:51:59,168 --> 00:52:01,734
Hello, Manager Seo.

834
00:52:01,734 --> 00:52:04,673
We've looked over the errors
that you mentioned in your email,

835
00:52:04,673 --> 00:52:08,258
and we didn't find any on our end.

836
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,588
We suspect that it's
a program error on your end.

837
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,017
It's not a bug, then?

838
00:52:19,722 --> 00:52:21,855
How, then,

839
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,271
did Fridge get access to everyone's
personal information?

840
00:52:44,144 --> 00:52:45,263
Hi, Fridge.

841
00:52:47,647 --> 00:52:50,799
Are you watching me?

842
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:54,549
Yes, please go on.

843
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:59,657
Machines do give you information,

844
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:02,811
but what we do depends
on our decisions.

845
00:53:10,302 --> 00:53:14,310
Whatever you are, I won't let you
get to me.

846
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:18,562
I'm going to continue looking
into the source of all of this.

847
00:53:21,795 --> 00:53:22,832
And...

848
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:27,087
right now,

849
00:53:32,065 --> 00:53:33,587
my heart says...

850
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:49,105
I'll delete this one.

851
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:54,542
This one as well.

852
00:53:55,824 --> 00:53:57,117
And this...

853
00:54:04,966 --> 00:54:08,476
Let go of me!

854
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:15,232
Ma'am, I'll be filming to prevent
any misunderstanding later on.

855
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:18,237
You can't try to fit yourself
in the fridge.

856
00:54:18,237 --> 00:54:19,637
Please.

857
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:24,643
Excuse me. Let me pull you out.

858
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:26,411
Let go!

859
00:54:26,411 --> 00:54:27,973
Seo Ji Sung.

860
00:54:34,461 --> 00:54:35,779
What's wrong with me?

861
00:54:48,403 --> 00:54:50,419
I'll be cleaning the garage.

862
00:55:09,362 --> 00:55:12,940
You have a really high nose bridge.

863
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:34,715
What's wrong with me?

864
00:55:36,619 --> 00:55:38,214
I'm going crazy.

865
00:55:39,815 --> 00:55:41,223
You are three meters away.

866
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:43,543
You may approach.

867
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:45,505
You may approach.

868
00:55:55,677 --> 00:55:58,736
When are you off?

869
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:02,234
I was reminded of the old times
for the first time in so long.

870
00:56:04,219 --> 00:56:08,390
"What is done for love is
beyond good and evil."

871
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:09,497
Nietzsche.

872
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:13,999
What has all that time done for me?

873
00:56:17,943 --> 00:56:20,748
Did all of that exist...

874
00:56:21,652 --> 00:56:25,748
to give me the courage to go
for this person?

875
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:36,524
Hi, Fridge.

876
00:56:41,692 --> 00:56:44,524
What is the voice command
to turn on the fridge?

877
00:56:44,883 --> 00:56:47,785
"Hi, Fridge."

878
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:55,200
Ouch.

879
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,545
- Ouch.
- Oh, dear.

880
00:57:14,674 --> 00:57:16,291
Long time no see,

881
00:57:16,291 --> 00:57:17,878
Autumn 44.

882
00:57:17,878 --> 00:57:21,567
It's been a while, JSS.

883
00:57:26,121 --> 00:57:28,025
(Please Don't Date Him)

884
00:57:36,142 --> 00:57:38,043
(Please Don't Date Him)

885
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:41,933
- A date?
- Yes. A date.

886
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:43,382
See you then.

887
00:57:43,382 --> 00:57:45,052
- Gook Hee!
- They must be very close.

888
00:57:45,052 --> 00:57:46,394
- When are you off?
- Right now.

889
00:57:46,403 --> 00:57:48,183
Are you seeing other women too?

890
00:57:48,183 --> 00:57:50,060
Love bound
by a governmental project!

891
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,992
Why are you so red?

892
00:57:50,992 --> 00:57:52,761
Maybe something really happened
to Yu Jin.

893
00:57:52,786 --> 00:57:55,706
- I'm dead worried.
- Just forget about him!

894
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:57,350
Yu Jin isn't trash!

895
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:00,060
Don't ruin my schedule
for your convenience.

896
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,003
Gi Hyun!

897
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:04,505
Is the calendar man calling you?

898
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:06,912
He hates taking photos.

899
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:09,361
What do you know about him?

900
00:58:10,075 --> 00:58:11,740
What are you doing?

901
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:14,122
My goodness! Blood!

902
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:16,122
You made someone end their life.
