1
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:18,653
(I'm in the office. Shall we meet
on the weekend, sweetheart?)

2
00:00:18,653 --> 00:00:24,306
(Sorry. I'm going on a business
trip to Hong Kong with my boss.)

3
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:28,062
(We haven't seen for a month.)

4
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:30,865
(I'm dying to see you too.
I'll see you after the project.)

5
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,768
(When does it end?)

6
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:37,419
(In a month?)

7
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:40,077
(Okay. Love you, sweetheart.)

8
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:48,354
Your boyfriend is a family man.

9
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:51,628
He is going on a family trip
to Hong Kong this weekend.

10
00:00:51,628 --> 00:00:54,768
His weekends will be filled
with time with his family...

11
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,274
for a month.

12
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:00,455
He's married?

13
00:01:02,368 --> 00:01:04,672
Who would send me something
like this?

14
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:15,025
I pray...

15
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:17,590
to all the spirits out there,

16
00:01:17,615 --> 00:01:23,642
I hope this technology
will benefit humanity.

17
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:24,911
Geez.

18
00:01:25,196 --> 00:01:28,163
Do I have to pray before using this?

19
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,403
Right.

20
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,987
I tried to do without it, and things
could've gone wrong for someone.

21
00:01:39,987 --> 00:01:42,551
I got my haircut
at a salon in Gorae-dong.

22
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,047
Don't come closer.

23
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:56,671
Lord, allow me to become
a righteous identity thief.

24
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,173
With my magic wand, Fridge,

25
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:03,589
I have decided to make others happy.

26
00:02:05,185 --> 00:02:08,146
Your boyfriend is into online chats.

27
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:11,202
He's been talking to many teenagers.

28
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:12,908
How about reporting him?

29
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:14,683
Your wife is a big spender.

30
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:16,530
She gambled with the deposit money.

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,530
- Your girlfriend...
- Your boyfriend...

32
00:02:18,543 --> 00:02:23,298
(Please Don't Date Him)

33
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:26,754
(Episode 8. Perfect Coding)

34
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,124
You're here.

35
00:02:45,058 --> 00:02:46,780
Ji Sung.

36
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:49,038
Why is it so hard to smile?

37
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,381
Hey.

38
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,908
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

39
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,076
What are you doing?

40
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,458
Stop looking at the mirror.

41
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:08,143
If you become more handsome,
I'm in trouble.

42
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,709
I'll go get some coffee.

43
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,933
Wait a minute.

44
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:31,266
I forgot to ask what you want.

45
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,852
Stop putting it on.

46
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:40,027
If you become prettier,
it'd be trouble.

47
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:43,702
You're too generous.

48
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:45,932
What do you mean?

49
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,685
Hold on.

50
00:03:49,613 --> 00:03:52,678
Can a human be radiant?

51
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:57,793
If you keep saying that,
it'd be trouble.

52
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:03,225
I'm in trouble too.

53
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:06,555
- It'd be trouble.
- I'm in trouble.

54
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,950
Stop it!

55
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:11,425
What do I do?

56
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:13,821
I'm in such trouble.

57
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,454
How can you be so adorable?

58
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:20,470
We've been dating
for almost a month now.

59
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,673
That's insane.

60
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,896
Days went by and each day felt like
looking at beautiful codes.

61
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:29,896
You've always been pretty...

62
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,603
but you're especially lovely today.

63
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,248
Where do you want to go?

64
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,769
We always go where I want to,

65
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:39,986
so how about doing something
you want today?

66
00:04:44,052 --> 00:04:46,360
He sure knows how to do things.

67
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,481
Dating at home is the best kind.

68
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,248
But is he...

69
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,755
Are you sure we're on a date?

70
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,947
You cleaned the bathroom
as soon as you got here.

71
00:05:06,947 --> 00:05:08,977
You cleaned the air conditioner
and the fan too.

72
00:05:08,977 --> 00:05:11,001
Now you're washing the sink too?

73
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,768
It'd be tough to do this
on weekdays as you work.

74
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,874
Let me help you.

75
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,793
You'll get dirt on your sweater.

76
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:29,234
Oh, fine.

77
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,279
Then I'll go over to your place
next time...

78
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:37,241
and upgrade all the programs
on your computer.

79
00:05:39,282 --> 00:05:40,853
Okay.

80
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,532
This is a big statement.

81
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,795
The one thing
that engineering majors never do...

82
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,827
is checking someone else's computer.

83
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:48,942
I got it.

84
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:49,859
(You have a new message.)

85
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,799
It's Director Oh.

86
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,058
He tells me to work on the sample
test on my day-off.

87
00:05:56,058 --> 00:05:58,430
Gook Hee, can you come here
for a bit?

88
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,430
What is it?

89
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:04,297
My boss is hooked on bio,

90
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,074
so we've been working on this.

91
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,174
It specializes in the features
of a smartwatch.

92
00:06:17,174 --> 00:06:19,869
We input the basic information
of the user's physical traits,

93
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,274
and if something goes wrong with it,
911 will come right over.

94
00:06:22,274 --> 00:06:25,694
As for the one I developed,
you can add personal contact here...

95
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:27,694
and you can call your own 911.

96
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,198
That's pretty cool.

97
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:31,947
Ta-da.

98
00:06:31,947 --> 00:06:33,947
I got your number on it.

99
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:37,706
But it only works when we're
within 100 m from each other.

100
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,834
But would you need this?

101
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:43,861
You can call me when I'm nearby.

102
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:48,467
The thing with technology is that
you start from something small...

103
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,467
and you advance from there.

104
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:55,058
Right.

105
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:58,476
If it's not within 100 m,

106
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,629
but say,

107
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:04,132
- within a centimeter...
- It works.

108
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,367
I didn't say what it is yet.

109
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:08,241
It works.

110
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,405
- How about 0.5 centimeter?
- That close?

111
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,491
How about 0.4 or 0.3?

112
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,491
Maybe 0.2 or 0.1?

113
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:18,831
Let's try it.

114
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:21,003
I got this in elementary school.

115
00:07:21,248 --> 00:07:25,006
It was a contest where you make
science boxes, and I got a prize.

116
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:28,793
- You were good at this as a kid.
- Sure.

117
00:07:28,818 --> 00:07:33,008
I never missed prizes in contests
for creating or inventing things.

118
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:37,409
I'm curious to see
what you were like as a kid.

119
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:44,895
- What's that?
- That?

120
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,204
I came first place
in an anti-hacking contest.

121
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:50,352
Is that a contest for hackers?

122
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:53,290
No. It's an anti-hacking contest,
not hacking.

123
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,775
It's not breaking the security...

124
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:57,786
but about finding its weak point
and solving it.

125
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:03,077
But why change the subject
when I want to see...

126
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,393
what you were like as a kid?

127
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:07,876
You didn't go through...

128
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:09,338
a drastic change, did you?

129
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:11,338
That can't be.

130
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:16,132
Can't you bring your photo album
next time and show it to me?

131
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,986
- I'll show you later.
- Later when?

132
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:21,742
I show it later.

133
00:08:23,955 --> 00:08:25,280
It's getting late.

134
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,647
I'll get going.

135
00:08:29,855 --> 00:08:31,404
Before I go,

136
00:08:33,595 --> 00:08:36,157
- here's a present for you.
- A present?

137
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:45,622
I'm off.

138
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:02,420
Ms. Byun, the report on Myeonsu-ri
is tough, isn't it?

139
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,123
I will look into the software from
our side and the Chinese hardware...

140
00:09:06,123 --> 00:09:07,353
and report to you by afternoon.

141
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,262
We're not at fault here, right?

142
00:09:09,262 --> 00:09:10,689
- No, we're not.
- Okay.

143
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:12,087
(Jung Gook Hee)

144
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,001
Excuse me.

145
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,767
(Jung Gook Hee sent you a gift.)

146
00:09:24,796 --> 00:09:27,302
Did something come up, Ms. Seo?

147
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:34,561
It's just that someone sent me
a coffee gift voucher.

148
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,317
Geez. Seriously.

149
00:09:38,092 --> 00:09:43,049
He didn't use to have KakaoTalk,
but now he's sending me a gift.

150
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,101
You know how complicated it is
to pay with your smartphone.

151
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:47,826
And he can do it all now.

152
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,111
Is this about her father?

153
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,333
I'm sorry. Let's keep going.

154
00:09:52,975 --> 00:09:54,710
Please make her work less.

155
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,083
She's losing it.

156
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,339
What?

157
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:04,089
Hey. Why send me a gift voucher
for an 80-cent water bottle?

158
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:07,345
Are you doing this
because I asked you to get me water?

159
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:08,478
It's fun.

160
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:11,018
Is it fun? Look at that smile.

161
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,416
You never liked
using a mobile phone,

162
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,237
but now you're addicted to it.

163
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,392
Why did I bother nagging you
to install a messenger app and all?

164
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:21,652
I should've found you a girl.

165
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,123
- Don't you agree?
- Right.

166
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,856
Hello?

167
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,878
You look so excited.

168
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,115
So when are you going
to introduce him to us?

169
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,041
Come on, you already know who he is.

170
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:45,592
Even so, you can just
introduce him to us.

171
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,025
Why are you trying to hide him?

172
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:50,003
I'm not. It's not like
I'm dating someone at a young age.

173
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,421
I'm just embarrassed.

174
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,494
Here comes the food taster.

175
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:08,539
He comes here almost every day.

176
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,855
Oh, hello.

177
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:13,639
Food taster, really?

178
00:11:13,766 --> 00:11:16,329
Others might think
I'm selling poison here.

179
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,457
What kind of brilliant juice
do you have today?

180
00:11:22,298 --> 00:11:24,998
Why didn't you come with Gook Hee?

181
00:11:26,372 --> 00:11:28,059
He took his day off this morning.

182
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:29,408
What?

183
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:34,299
So that's today.

184
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,499
It wasn't all of a sudden?

185
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:39,809
He came to work and left,
so I thought it was sudden.

186
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:41,025
Well...

187
00:11:42,886 --> 00:11:44,148
Here you go.

188
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:47,187
As expected.

189
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,536
The organic appearance of your juice
never disappoints me.

190
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,887
Let me put this bracken to the side.

191
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:03,114
Gosh, it feels like
this juice is paving a road...

192
00:12:03,114 --> 00:12:05,413
from my throat to my stomach.

193
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:07,612
- What does that mean?
- Once it goes in,

194
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:09,284
I sense a road.

195
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:12,464
It wiggles down
to my large and small intestines.

196
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,464
Then I get a signal
for number two right away.

197
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:17,824
It's really coming.
Let me go to the bathroom.

198
00:12:18,554 --> 00:12:19,513
You got dust.

199
00:12:21,469 --> 00:12:23,557
He's so funny.

200
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:30,316
Gi Hyun, why are you
so kind to Mr. Gam?

201
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:32,908
I am? You think?

202
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:35,709
I always make jokes
to my customers...

203
00:12:35,734 --> 00:12:39,411
and catch up on each other, don't I?

204
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:41,037
- You do?
- Really?

205
00:12:41,631 --> 00:12:44,505
You talked about getting divorced
the other day,

206
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,177
so I thought you two were dating.

207
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,530
What's the problem with that?

208
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:53,640
Dating? Getting divorced?
What is this about?

209
00:12:53,866 --> 00:12:57,290
While you were in love,
Gi Hyun was torn to get divorced.

210
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,662
Really?

211
00:12:59,243 --> 00:13:02,777
Well, it's not that abnormal...

212
00:13:02,777 --> 00:13:05,734
for a married couple
to consider getting divorced.

213
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,734
Why? Did you have a fight with him?

214
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,629
No, I think it's because of Mr. Gam.

215
00:13:11,923 --> 00:13:13,311
What are you saying?

216
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,589
I saw it at the hospital
from the other day,

217
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,075
but he's overly kind
to married women.

218
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,942
I don't feel good about him.

219
00:13:22,012 --> 00:13:23,495
Be careful.

220
00:13:23,495 --> 00:13:26,700
No, don't be mistaken about him.
He's not like that.

221
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:30,138
Gosh, forget it.

222
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:32,790
Just worry about this girl.

223
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,807
She wants to marry that man
she dated only for a month.

224
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:37,050
What is this about now?

225
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:39,994
Hey, are you getting married
with that dentist?

226
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,735
- Yes.
- Don't get me started.

227
00:13:41,735 --> 00:13:44,570
While love was budding
between you and Gook Hee,

228
00:13:44,776 --> 00:13:47,224
she grilled me so much.

229
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,765
(A new message has arrived.)

230
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,287
I bought your favorite chocolate.

231
00:13:53,287 --> 00:13:54,726
I miss you.

232
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:59,136
Again, as if nothing happened?

233
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:03,288
I'm telling you. I mean,
he disappears and shows up...

234
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:05,288
as if he's Do Min Joon or something.

235
00:14:05,364 --> 00:14:07,075
I told you to dump that guy.

236
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,796
No, I can't! I really can't.

237
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:11,467
Why do you think the reason is?

238
00:14:11,467 --> 00:14:14,607
You're good at this. Please tell me.

239
00:14:14,607 --> 00:14:16,298
Please.

240
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:20,018
Tell me every detail
about what happened so far.

241
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:23,215
The weather is wonderful outside.

242
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:24,522
(Driving at around 4 p.m.
on October 18, 2020)

243
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,779
Let's go outside the city often
from now on.

244
00:14:30,184 --> 00:14:33,064
It'd be nice to build a house
at a place like this for us...

245
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:34,560
later when we get old.

246
00:14:34,587 --> 00:14:36,269
It's so pretty.

247
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,055
He went off the grid
as soon as he dropped me off.

248
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,332
Was it because I pestered him
to go outside the city?

249
00:14:48,046 --> 00:14:49,371
Where should we go today?

250
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,690
Well, to eat something delicious.

251
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:53,922
- Delicious?
- Yes.

252
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:57,028
Kids, it's dangerous.

253
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,222
Don't worry. I'm not going
to overprotect our kid.

254
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,514
- Let me go to the bathroom.
- He said he'd go to the bathroom...

255
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:12,072
and went off the grid.

256
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,264
Did he perhaps misunderstand
that I hated kids?

257
00:15:15,316 --> 00:15:18,189
I just thought
it was dangerous for them.

258
00:15:19,977 --> 00:15:24,567
(Having a meal at around 8 p.m.
on November 1, 2020)

259
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:27,768
What's in this dish?

260
00:15:27,768 --> 00:15:29,548
It's unique.

261
00:15:31,282 --> 00:15:34,375
So those who are good at cooking
have such thoughts.

262
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:36,889
I'm not so good at cooking.

263
00:15:37,053 --> 00:15:40,193
We'll have to pay so much
for delivery food later.

264
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,647
I'm just too curious
about the recipe.

265
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,767
Let me go talk to the chef.

266
00:15:50,376 --> 00:15:51,914
(At around 8:30 p.m.,
he left to ask about the recipe.)

267
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,930
Since then, I haven't been
able to reach him.

268
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,930
Was he annoyed
because I couldn't cook?

269
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,697
Why on earth
does he go off the grid?

270
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:05,188
That guy is avoiding.

271
00:16:05,188 --> 00:16:08,155
What? A serious relationship.
And the answer is given.

272
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,948
- He's a relationship avertor.
- What?

273
00:16:10,948 --> 00:16:13,949
It'd be nice to build a house
at a place like this for us...

274
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:15,173
later when we get old.

275
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:17,408
Don't worry. I'm not going
to overprotect our kid.

276
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:20,226
We'll have to pay so much
for delivery food later.

277
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:22,079
What do your remarks have
in common?

278
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,998
Future and settlement.
That's his trigger.

279
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,329
- His what?
- Trigger.

280
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:27,813
Like pressing a button.

281
00:16:27,813 --> 00:16:30,414
When he feels like his future will
get involved with a certain woman,

282
00:16:30,414 --> 00:16:32,853
when he feels like he will
get serious with a certain woman,

283
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:36,143
or when he hears such words,
he gets triggered to run away.

284
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:37,275
Gosh.

285
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:41,461
I barely told her the reason
why he went off the grid,

286
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,168
and she proposed to him.

287
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,753
I missed you.

288
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,203
I can't go on like this.

289
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,719
Let's now...

290
00:16:58,029 --> 00:16:59,325
get married.

291
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:02,911
I've figured out your pattern.

292
00:17:03,115 --> 00:17:04,377
Your tri...

293
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:10,354
Anyway, the more we get closer
to each other,

294
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:12,434
you will run away from me for sure.

295
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:14,652
Then the answer is marriage.

296
00:17:14,652 --> 00:17:17,646
If we get married,
we will stop getting close.

297
00:17:18,443 --> 00:17:21,555
Because marriage is the limit
of getting close.

298
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:27,024
Hey, what made you want to marry
a man you dated only for a month?

299
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,870
Did you know Jung Han was a scum
during those seven years?

300
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:35,872
Were you happy marrying your husband
after knowing him from A to Z?

301
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,736
Marriage is like gambling anyway.

302
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,345
I'll have to bet my life
on anyone anyway.

303
00:17:42,592 --> 00:17:45,003
So what's wrong with doing it
on someone handsome?

304
00:17:45,003 --> 00:17:47,643
His looks aren't the matter here.

305
00:17:47,643 --> 00:17:49,819
Of all those men out there,

306
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,550
why does it have to be someone
who goes off the grid?

307
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,605
Sometimes, you can't stop watching
a drama when it's super weird.

308
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,303
Why? Because Won Bin stars in it.

309
00:17:59,391 --> 00:18:00,670
Think of it the same way.

310
00:18:04,421 --> 00:18:06,421
- Bye.
- Hey.

311
00:18:06,872 --> 00:18:09,682
Are you really going
to hold this get-together?

312
00:18:09,682 --> 00:18:12,404
- Yes.
- Is this for real?

313
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:13,742
Yes, for real.

314
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:16,402
We have to eat together
before I get married anyway.

315
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:17,751
- Right.
- I'll tell you when.

316
00:18:17,751 --> 00:18:18,974
Okay.

317
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:20,660
- Bye.
- I'm off to the office.

318
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,382
- Bye.
- At that time, we felt like...

319
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:25,763
everything was completely coded.

320
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:29,078
That there wouldn't be any errors.

321
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,828
But even a perfect code...

322
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:35,411
can't stop
a malignant code's attack.

323
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,793
So we shouldn't have given
a cause for a malignant code...

324
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:42,847
- to break in.
- The number is not available...

325
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,592
Why are you acting out now?

326
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:46,592
- Why keep raising your voice?
- Why look down only on me?

327
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,274
- It's all burnt.
- Ji Sung!

328
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:51,914
- Ji Sung.
- What's wrong with you guys?

329
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:56,432
That get-together
shouldn't have been held.

330
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:01,087
(Gangnang to Jeonsung)

331
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,817
This is Kang Sang Jun.

332
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,668
Hello.

333
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:09,151
I've found where he is
a few days ago.

334
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:10,475
Really?

335
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,709
Then can I go visit him now?

336
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,312
Do you not know the location
of the one you're looking for?

337
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,478
You can find it
if you go to the office.

338
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:37,232
No, I'll come again next time.

339
00:19:44,698 --> 00:19:47,557
(Call history)

340
00:19:57,551 --> 00:19:59,966
(Jung Gook Hee)

341
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,786
Sorry I couldn't pick up.

342
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:14,322
I'll wait in front of your office
around when you're done.

343
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,190
Give me a call when you can.

344
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:30,171
You're here.

345
00:20:33,302 --> 00:20:35,743
You must be mad
because I didn't pick up.

346
00:20:37,248 --> 00:20:38,212
I'm sorry.

347
00:20:39,076 --> 00:20:40,247
It's nothing like that.

348
00:20:40,955 --> 00:20:44,251
I always get anxious
since you're a firefighter.

349
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:47,154
I don't like it
when I can't reach you.

350
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:50,057
You always do this. You did this
another time recently too.

351
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,792
You do this all the time.

352
00:20:51,957 --> 00:20:54,061
I didn't have any time to explain.

353
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:57,765
There was someone I urgently had
to go and see.

354
00:20:58,054 --> 00:20:59,974
Who is it?

355
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,937
It's hard to explain.

356
00:21:04,505 --> 00:21:06,207
I'll tell you everything one day.

357
00:21:06,274 --> 00:21:07,842
When?

358
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:11,145
I won't know anything
until you tell me.

359
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:14,749
You don't even use social media,

360
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:18,719
so I have no idea what you do
other than work.

361
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:20,955
Do you think...

362
00:21:21,743 --> 00:21:23,491
it's a good idea to find out
what I'm up to...

363
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,126
through my social media
if I used any?

364
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,963
Taking guesses at what
other people's lives are like...

365
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:30,631
through social media is abuse.

366
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,433
Abuse?

367
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:36,837
I'm not saying
that you're abusing me right now.

368
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:41,242
Snooping into other people's lives
is abuse.

369
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,477
That's what I'm trying to say.

370
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,151
I'm sorry.

371
00:21:50,472 --> 00:21:52,420
This is all my fault.

372
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,655
I won't let it happen again.

373
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,828
So, are you not going to tell me
who you met?

374
00:22:03,793 --> 00:22:05,232
I'll tell you...

375
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:07,535
over a cup of tea by your house.

376
00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:28,856
How many times have you listened
to this that the tape stretched?

377
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:30,858
Seems like you'll need to buy
another one.

378
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:34,695
Do you want to go to a record store
that I go to often?

379
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:35,896
Yes.

380
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:40,370
Why are we heading
towards my dad's store?

381
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,569
By any chance,

382
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:44,305
is the owner of that store...

383
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:47,141
a tall, bald man?

384
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,945
And his eyes become like this
when he smiles?

385
00:22:52,046 --> 00:22:54,515
I don't know. Don't all
elderly people look like that?

386
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:58,085
No, he has a big belly.

387
00:22:58,443 --> 00:23:00,554
What? Ji Sung!

388
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,991
Oh, my.

389
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,597
Sir?

390
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:12,366
What?

391
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,405
Have some!

392
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,943
I announced that I'd be closing
the store today on Moonstargram...

393
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,779
because I'm cleaning the store.

394
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:26,947
Right.

395
00:23:27,486 --> 00:23:29,984
You said you don't have
a Moonstargram.

396
00:23:31,613 --> 00:23:33,554
No, sir. I'm sorry.

397
00:23:34,468 --> 00:23:36,023
No need to be sorry.

398
00:23:36,343 --> 00:23:38,659
Having a Moonstargram isn't
an obligation.

399
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,361
It's fine to not use it.

400
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:43,564
Let me know if you need any help
lifting things.

401
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:49,203
It's fine. You're a precious son
to someone else too.

402
00:23:52,106 --> 00:23:52,973
How funny.

403
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:55,609
I had no idea you two were dating.

404
00:23:57,578 --> 00:23:58,946
- Ji Sung,
- Yes?

405
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,981
didn't you tell me before...

406
00:24:01,282 --> 00:24:05,286
that you hate old-fashioned men...

407
00:24:05,575 --> 00:24:07,321
that listen to records and all?

408
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:09,657
Dad! That was when I was a kid.

409
00:24:09,658 --> 00:24:11,959
I was merely a teenager.

410
00:24:12,126 --> 00:24:14,228
Why are you bringing up the past?

411
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:17,031
Just keep drinking.

412
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:23,237
No!

413
00:24:23,238 --> 00:24:26,640
Gook Hee doesn't like soda.

414
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:29,510
I offered him so many drinks,
and he turned them all down.

415
00:24:30,611 --> 00:24:32,112
He likes juice.

416
00:24:33,414 --> 00:24:34,882
You like juice?

417
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:40,187
Did you just start dating yesterday
or something? How do you not know?

418
00:24:55,903 --> 00:24:56,937
So,

419
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,746
are both of your parents alive?

420
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:02,550
Dad!

421
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:12,887
Is this inappropriate
in this day and age?

422
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,853
It's fine, sir.
They both live abroad.

423
00:25:18,459 --> 00:25:20,160
As a father of a daughter,

424
00:25:20,194 --> 00:25:21,862
that's great news.

425
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:27,768
Dad! I told you not to say things
like that.

426
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,437
I'm just saying.

427
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:32,740
Anyway,

428
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,975
I hope that you two...

429
00:25:35,342 --> 00:25:37,678
will have a wholesome relationship.

430
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,215
Does Mom know?

431
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:42,850
Not yet.

432
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:47,454
Right. Your mom must be busy
nowadays.

433
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:58,632
Your mom is way too busy!

434
00:25:58,868 --> 00:26:01,735
Why are women so cold?

435
00:26:01,736 --> 00:26:03,070
What are you talking about?

436
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,105
Did your mom have to post...

437
00:26:05,494 --> 00:26:08,876
that she's in a relationship
on her Enjoybook?

438
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:11,946
She even posted a photo of the man
for the public!

439
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:15,382
The photo is so filtered,

440
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:18,185
you can't even see a wrinkle
on his face!

441
00:26:18,186 --> 00:26:20,321
What a sissy man!

442
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,289
It's not filtered.

443
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:24,658
He's just young,
so he doesn't have wrinkles.

444
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,493
Why would a man that young...

445
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,358
date your mom?

446
00:26:28,662 --> 00:26:30,297
I bet he's jobless.

447
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,499
He's not jobless.
He owns a bookstore.

448
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,871
So he's just a lazy bum
who owns a bookstore!

449
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:40,174
He's not a lazy bum.

450
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:41,875
He treats Mom well.

451
00:26:42,093 --> 00:26:46,280
He treats her like a woman.

452
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:53,153
Have you gotten that close
to that man too?

453
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,722
No, it's nothing like that.

454
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,757
Are you betraying me?

455
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:59,226
- No, it's nothing like that!
- If it's nothing like that,

456
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,128
how do you know...

457
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,697
- whether he treats her well or not?
- All right! Calm down.

458
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:04,965
Calm down.

459
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:08,268
This is why having children doesn't
mean anything!

460
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,204
Dad!

461
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:12,773
Dad, stop!

462
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,109
Mom, meet Ye Seul.

463
00:27:15,309 --> 00:27:17,177
Ye Seul, meet my mom.

464
00:27:20,481 --> 00:27:24,284
Yu Jin's father is busy,
so he couldn't make it today.

465
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:26,620
Why...

466
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:29,556
do you want to marry this woman?

467
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:34,762
When I'm with her,

468
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:36,697
it's fun.

469
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:41,235
And I don't want to spend time
away from her.

470
00:27:41,836 --> 00:27:44,004
That's what you want to get
married for?

471
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,775
I don't approve of this marriage.

472
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,881
That's too bad.

473
00:27:58,352 --> 00:27:59,453
That's all you have to say?

474
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:04,391
Yes. Will you not be coming
to the wedding then?

475
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:08,996
Did you not hear? I don't approve
of this marriage.

476
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,232
Yes. I heard you.

477
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,702
But that doesn't mean that we can't
get married.

478
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,772
She's funny, isn't she?

479
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:22,042
This lady...

480
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,280
I like her.

481
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,748
Sorry?

482
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,686
I don't approve of this marriage...

483
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:36,390
because I really like you, Ye Seul.

484
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,460
You want to marry
this amazing woman...

485
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:43,063
just because you don't want
to spend time away from her?

486
00:28:43,564 --> 00:28:45,265
Write an oath or something.

487
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:49,236
Sorry? What do you mean?

488
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:00,681
I'm on time!

489
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:03,016
- Dad!
- Honey!

490
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:07,121
I came right after seeing your text.

491
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:23,728
I came right after seeing your text.

492
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:29,495
How long has it been
since we last saw each other?

493
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:32,128
About a year and a half?

494
00:29:32,128 --> 00:29:35,795
I think it's been about 2 years
and 2 months for me.

495
00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:39,362
Then does his father also...

496
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,095
He goes off the grid very often.

497
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:56,028
I could have bought an apartment
in Gangnam...

498
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,162
with the money I spent
on trying to get him to stop.

499
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:01,262
I wasted my money
on hiring a shaman...

500
00:30:01,262 --> 00:30:03,195
and offering to the church
and Buddhist temple.

501
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,528
I see.

502
00:30:07,195 --> 00:30:10,862
What did you do when he went
off the grid?

503
00:30:11,395 --> 00:30:13,662
I couldn't just wait around,

504
00:30:13,662 --> 00:30:17,095
so I started traveling
once I got used to it.

505
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:19,228
I've been to Cuba, Argentina,

506
00:30:19,228 --> 00:30:22,462
and Machu Picchu.
I've traveled everywhere.

507
00:30:22,462 --> 00:30:28,062
French embroidery, sangmo dancing,
and even sword dancing.

508
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:32,528
He spent so much money
on learning all of them.

509
00:30:33,228 --> 00:30:34,962
That must have been hard.

510
00:30:35,628 --> 00:30:39,062
After he was born, I was happy
enough just to watch him grow.

511
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:41,562
But he grew up
to be just like his father.

512
00:30:41,562 --> 00:30:44,795
He went off the grid as soon
as he went to middle school.

513
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:46,995
My goodness.

514
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:51,095
I know how you feel.
I've been through it all.

515
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:54,462
As a woman, I can't allow you...

516
00:30:54,462 --> 00:30:56,328
to marry someone like him.

517
00:30:56,328 --> 00:30:57,828
That's why I'm against you
marrying him.

518
00:31:00,128 --> 00:31:02,895
I'm actually fine with it, though.

519
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,295
Really? You're okay?

520
00:31:05,295 --> 00:31:09,628
I have a plan after we get married.

521
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:14,262
That scumbag.

522
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:17,695
I thought I was the only one
who chased after a good look.

523
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:20,562
But I was wrong.

524
00:31:24,662 --> 00:31:28,162
To be honest,
when I look at his face,

525
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:30,695
I don't get as upset as
you think I would.

526
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:33,004
Look at him...

527
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,995
riding his bike
in his cycling pants at his age.

528
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,362
It's hard to be as cool as him
being how old he is.

529
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:40,762
Don't you think so?

530
00:31:40,762 --> 00:31:43,462
I agree.
A handsome face is the best.

531
00:31:44,428 --> 00:31:47,928
Before his father goes
off the grid again,

532
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:50,628
should we get this over with?

533
00:31:50,628 --> 00:31:51,828
Yes!

534
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:55,962
Eun Hwa, I didn't think you would...

535
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,162
betray me twice like this again.

536
00:31:58,162 --> 00:32:00,862
- Come on.
- I didn't!

537
00:32:01,528 --> 00:32:03,328
I thought...

538
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:07,595
of remarrying you.

539
00:32:07,595 --> 00:32:11,562
Us living in the same house
and the same room.

540
00:32:12,362 --> 00:32:14,362
Okay, I get it.

541
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:16,728
Gook Hee.

542
00:32:17,362 --> 00:32:19,928
Don't leave me.

543
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:20,995
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, Dad!

544
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,695
- Please stop.
- I'm feeling good.

545
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:24,995
- Let's go for a second round!
- Please, no!

546
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:26,295
It's late.

547
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:28,662
Please stop, Dad.

548
00:32:31,262 --> 00:32:33,428
My foot!

549
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:35,162
My foot's been cut off!

550
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:38,228
My foot.

551
00:32:38,228 --> 00:32:40,328
I lost my foot!

552
00:32:40,328 --> 00:32:42,962
Oh, no! My foot!

553
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,395
- Dad!
- Hold on.

554
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:46,995
Here's your foot, sir.

555
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:50,095
I'm sorry, Gook Hee.

556
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,262
No worries.

557
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:54,728
I'll take him with me.
You should go home.

558
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:56,562
You have to get up early tomorrow
for work.

559
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,962
No, it's fine. I'll take him home.

560
00:32:58,962 --> 00:33:01,162
I can take care of him.
I'm your boyfriend.

561
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:02,628
Let's go, sir.

562
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:04,928
I hate you, Dad! Go blow your nose.

563
00:33:04,928 --> 00:33:06,528
Watch the stairs.

564
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:09,162
Let's grab more drinks, Gook Hee.

565
00:33:09,662 --> 00:33:11,395
Come! Hurry!

566
00:33:11,395 --> 00:33:13,828
I'll clean this place up. Bye.

567
00:33:15,628 --> 00:33:16,895
Oh, right.

568
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:20,395
I'll tell you over a cup of tea
by your house.

569
00:33:20,862 --> 00:33:23,062
What was he going to tell me?

570
00:33:24,295 --> 00:33:26,962
My gosh, Dad.
You're not helping at all.

571
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:36,662
Here comes the food taster!

572
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:37,695
Ta-da!

573
00:33:39,928 --> 00:33:40,962
Hi.

574
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:48,362
Ms. Tak, what's fresh today?

575
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:50,462
Where do you think this is,
a fish shop?

576
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:51,762
Hold on a second.

577
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:52,795
Sure.

578
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,328
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

579
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,528
I guess you didn't need
to go to work early today.

580
00:34:01,528 --> 00:34:03,028
I heard you were
a government employee.

581
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:04,328
Where do you work?

582
00:34:05,762 --> 00:34:08,595
In the Public and Energy Division
at the Ministry of Science and ICT.

583
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:11,695
If you work in Public
and Energy Division,

584
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:13,328
you must know Yoo Jae Seung.

585
00:34:13,328 --> 00:34:15,895
I play soccer with him.
He's bad, though.

586
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:20,862
I've just been transferred from
the Policy Division, so I don't.

587
00:34:20,862 --> 00:34:24,637
If you work in the Policy Division,
do you know Gi Jang?

588
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:27,328
He's a very close friend of mine
from high school.

589
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:30,862
You know a lot of people, don't you?

590
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,528
Here you go.

591
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,495
I have a large network of people.

592
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:40,928
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

593
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:45,728
I'm in a hurry,
so I'll drink it bottom-up.

594
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,328
- Sure.
- Looks good.

595
00:34:51,195 --> 00:34:52,562
Take it slow.

596
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,595
It's so good.

597
00:34:59,428 --> 00:35:01,328
I'll eat this on my way out.

598
00:35:01,328 --> 00:35:03,195
Thank you. It's delicious.

599
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:10,295
He only asked you where you work.

600
00:35:10,295 --> 00:35:11,928
Why are you mean to him?

601
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:16,095
Are you jealous?

602
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,095
No, I'm not.

603
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:23,828
He seems like a good person.
Keep him around.

604
00:35:23,828 --> 00:35:25,428
Since I'm so busy all the time,

605
00:35:25,428 --> 00:35:28,228
you could call him in an emergency
like the last time.

606
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:40,714
Why? Am I doing this wrong?

607
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:44,014
You did it wrong.

608
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Very wrong.

609
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Very wrong?

610
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,180
I see.

611
00:35:56,014 --> 00:35:58,547
(You have a new message.)

612
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,914
Couples' night
at Yu Jin's place today.

613
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:06,580
Bring your boyfriend. I'll be
giving out wedding invitations.

614
00:36:07,447 --> 00:36:09,580
My goodness, Ye Seul.

615
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,747
(There is a new post.)

616
00:36:16,914 --> 00:36:17,947
(Gook Hee's Moonstargram)

617
00:36:19,247 --> 00:36:20,347
Gook Hee.

618
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,147
Hello?

619
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:27,214
What's that picture you posted
on Moonstargram?

620
00:36:27,214 --> 00:36:28,547
You're so cute.

621
00:36:30,214 --> 00:36:32,147
Did you get home safely that night?

622
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:34,480
Yes, I brought him home safely.

623
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,414
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It was fun.

624
00:36:37,414 --> 00:36:39,670
Ye Seul wants all of us,
including Gi Hyun, to come over.

625
00:36:39,695 --> 00:36:42,814
She's going to give us
her wedding invitations.

626
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:45,614
Would you be okay going with me?

627
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:47,014
Are you free?

628
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:50,214
I am. I'll pick you up
at your office, then.

629
00:36:50,214 --> 00:36:51,280
Let's go together.

630
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,247
- Okay. Call me.
- Okay.

631
00:36:57,714 --> 00:37:00,547
Hey, what made you want to marry
a man you dated only for a month?

632
00:37:00,547 --> 00:37:01,580
Ye Seul.

633
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,847
Of all those men out there,

634
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,247
why does it have to be someone
who goes off the grid?

635
00:37:06,247 --> 00:37:08,247
Is she going to be okay?

636
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,347
Were you happy marrying your husband
after knowing him from A to Z?

637
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:25,014
Why aren't you giving me
my medicine and juice these days?

638
00:37:25,014 --> 00:37:26,447
Since we're on the topic,

639
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,480
I want to stop trying
to have a baby.

640
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,214
Don't try to negotiate with tuna.

641
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:32,080
Maybe he's at the Mediterranean Sea.

642
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,180
What do I know of him?

643
00:37:34,814 --> 00:37:35,914
Nothing.

644
00:37:42,814 --> 00:37:44,414
- One black Americano, please.
- Yes.

645
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,614
Here you go.

646
00:38:06,747 --> 00:38:09,414
It's not an ordinary coffee.

647
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,480
It's made of rich soybean paste.

648
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,814
It's good for people who work
sitting down for a long time.

649
00:38:18,247 --> 00:38:19,280
Excuse me.

650
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,614
Did you use to work
as a government employee before?

651
00:38:25,614 --> 00:38:26,614
No.

652
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:31,502
Then did you use to work
at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs?

653
00:38:33,314 --> 00:38:34,314
No.

654
00:38:46,314 --> 00:38:50,347
Yu Jin is a very outgoing person!

655
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:54,947
I knew something was up with him.

656
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,747
What is this?

657
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:58,947
He enjoys volunteering, hiking,

658
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:02,247
farming, tracking, and others.

659
00:39:02,247 --> 00:39:04,280
He has a lot of different interests.

660
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,147
He is...

661
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:10,680
too wholesome.

662
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:17,214
Something seems to be off.

663
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:20,371
He goes off the grid,

664
00:39:20,396 --> 00:39:24,736
But he doesn't make any fault.
What on earth is this?

665
00:39:25,857 --> 00:39:27,935
Once we begin judging,

666
00:39:27,935 --> 00:39:30,545
it's no longer a fact.

667
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,463
Make some sound. You startled me.

668
00:39:33,463 --> 00:39:35,222
What do you mean by that?

669
00:39:35,222 --> 00:39:38,066
I'm sure you already know.

670
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:42,677
- Stop accessing the program now.
- What...

671
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:44,902
I was going to tell you sooner,

672
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:49,640
but I didn't because I knew
it wasn't for your personal sake.

673
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:54,975
More people know about the program
other than me, so stop.

674
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:00,449
I can't tell you the details now.

675
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:02,539
Let me put this easily.

676
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,087
If you keep a tuna
that you didn't catch yourself,

677
00:40:06,456 --> 00:40:09,602
groups of sharks will
smell the blood and swarm in.

678
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:12,800
What?

679
00:40:18,173 --> 00:40:19,309
What?

680
00:40:19,652 --> 00:40:21,456
How does she know about Fridge?

681
00:40:21,456 --> 00:40:23,456
Did she see me use it?

682
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,313
Or...

683
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:27,564
did she know it from the beginning?

684
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,469
(A new message has arrived.)

685
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,571
- I'm in front of your office.
- Gosh.

686
00:40:40,382 --> 00:40:43,426
So there are more people...

687
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:45,788
- who know about Fridge.
- Ji Sung.

688
00:40:45,813 --> 00:40:50,272
Besides, it wasn't an error,
but a faultless program.

689
00:40:50,644 --> 00:40:52,223
- Then for what...
- Ji Sung.

690
00:40:52,223 --> 00:40:55,783
- was it developed?
- Ji Sung?

691
00:40:55,783 --> 00:40:57,097
Ji Sung.

692
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,196
Can't you see me?

693
00:41:10,044 --> 00:41:11,362
Look.

694
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,114
It's about a friend of mine.

695
00:41:14,674 --> 00:41:18,848
His ex walked past him on purpose
when she clearly saw him.

696
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,468
Does it mean she has
some feelings left for him?

697
00:41:21,468 --> 00:41:24,094
Who thinks it was on purpose?

698
00:41:24,094 --> 00:41:25,375
Me.

699
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:29,154
Then it wasn't on purpose.
I don't think she saw him.

700
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:32,752
It's about 98 percent sure
that a woman wouldn't...

701
00:41:32,752 --> 00:41:34,607
care a thing about her ex
once she breaks up with him.

702
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:38,619
- How can she?
- Yes, she can.

703
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:41,074
To a woman, her ex is
less of an interest...

704
00:41:41,074 --> 00:41:43,639
than a week's menu
at her company's cafeteria.

705
00:41:44,623 --> 00:41:46,315
What about the two percent?

706
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,830
There's that much
of a possibility, right?

707
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,648
That two percent means...

708
00:41:53,589 --> 00:41:56,831
she even forgot about his face.

709
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:59,383
She saw him,
but she didn't recognize him.

710
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:01,649
Like a memory loss.

711
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:05,075
She remembers everything
except for her ex.

712
00:42:05,075 --> 00:42:07,414
She completely forgot about him.

713
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:09,418
Happy now?

714
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:13,272
No.

715
00:42:13,536 --> 00:42:14,922
You don't know anything.

716
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,883
You surely don't.

717
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:23,882
(Moon Ye Seul and Han Yu Jin,
Congratulations on your marriage.)

718
00:43:49,144 --> 00:43:52,150
You two have some amazing teamwork.

719
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:56,123
They're a perfect match
to click even in this situation.

720
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:05,131
- I'm happy that you found the one.
- Thanks.

721
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:07,792
It's time for the climax of today.

722
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,028
Ta-da.

723
00:44:09,028 --> 00:44:12,053
We're going to follow the trend
and make ours small and luxurious.

724
00:44:12,053 --> 00:44:13,891
So we only have
a few wedding invitations.

725
00:44:13,891 --> 00:44:16,283
I've designed and printed them all.

726
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:18,146
Here, take one each.

727
00:44:18,146 --> 00:44:20,899
Here. Here you go.

728
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:23,985
Make sure you come.

729
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:27,389
Gosh, you look even more handsome
under the lights.

730
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:41,049
Since when was Hwang Ga Eul
aware of it?

731
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:43,321
How much does she know?

732
00:44:46,629 --> 00:44:48,629
You did a good job alone.

733
00:44:49,958 --> 00:44:53,517
His father went off the grid too,
and that means it's in the blood.

734
00:44:53,517 --> 00:44:56,184
Would it be okay
if I give birth to his daughter?

735
00:44:56,184 --> 00:44:58,998
Is it from the X chromosome?

736
00:44:58,998 --> 00:45:01,689
No, the Y chromosome?

737
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:05,348
Hold on. Is it an X or an XY
for a man?

738
00:45:05,348 --> 00:45:07,348
Darn it. I'm confused.

739
00:45:10,445 --> 00:45:13,559
Kim Sang Sik, are you
a robot or what?

740
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:16,952
How can you not be jealous
of another man?

741
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,858
Am I just your partner
who gets along with you?

742
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,862
(Bang Jung Han)

743
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:28,466
Hello?

744
00:45:28,466 --> 00:45:30,466
Yu Jin, it's me.

745
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:32,422
Let's have a drink.

746
00:45:32,447 --> 00:45:33,800
I'm busy. Bye.

747
00:45:41,136 --> 00:45:42,921
Hwang Ga Eul, that woman...

748
00:45:42,921 --> 00:45:44,481
Is it the X chromosome?

749
00:45:44,481 --> 00:45:46,734
Kim Sang Sik, are you a robot?

750
00:45:56,567 --> 00:45:58,567
So Gook Hee,

751
00:45:59,919 --> 00:46:01,052
how old are you?

752
00:46:03,329 --> 00:46:04,907
I'm 29.

753
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:07,664
Are you in your 20s?

754
00:46:08,005 --> 00:46:10,758
What? Didn't you know about his age?

755
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:13,511
Well, that's not important.

756
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:15,890
Right, honey.

757
00:46:15,890 --> 00:46:18,257
Asking someone
about their age and address...

758
00:46:18,257 --> 00:46:21,494
is to set the seniority
and know about their connections.

759
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,020
This has to be gotten rid of.

760
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,423
You, get rid of it first.

761
00:46:27,423 --> 00:46:29,721
You asked him first.

762
00:46:29,721 --> 00:46:31,766
People don't know each other...

763
00:46:31,766 --> 00:46:33,356
even after living together
for years anyway.

764
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:34,782
What's the use in asking?

765
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:36,782
It's useless.

766
00:46:37,036 --> 00:46:39,544
Some people are getting married
only after dating for a month.

767
00:46:40,439 --> 00:46:41,616
Gi Hyun.

768
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,791
- What's wrong?
- What?

769
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:47,004
Did you mean us?

770
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:50,777
That day,

771
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,941
everyone was sensitive.

772
00:46:53,284 --> 00:46:59,554
So a tiny thing caused
everyone's time bomb to explode.

773
00:47:01,304 --> 00:47:06,311
Well, Gi Hyun can be direct
at times.

774
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:11,814
What about it?

775
00:47:13,804 --> 00:47:15,889
I mean,

776
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,957
it's not just once or twice...

777
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:20,336
that I got back-stabbed
after siding with her.

778
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,086
Why would you use me as an excuse?

779
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,968
- It's just your way of talking.
- Ye Seul.

780
00:47:29,415 --> 00:47:31,777
We're putting up with you.

781
00:47:31,777 --> 00:47:34,476
It's not pleasant to hear you
even on occasions like this.

782
00:47:34,516 --> 00:47:36,226
You're putting up with me?

783
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,026
Are you saying you forced yourself
to hear my wrong comments?

784
00:47:40,026 --> 00:47:42,053
Forget it. I'm sorry.

785
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:43,642
I was being thoughtless.

786
00:47:43,642 --> 00:47:46,713
Why talk without thinking?
Think before you say anything.

787
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:48,877
Some people talk without thinking.

788
00:47:48,877 --> 00:47:50,316
Not everyone is like you.

789
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:52,005
Don't say I'm wrong
just because I'm different from you.

790
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:55,111
According to "The Interpretation
of Dreams" by Freud,

791
00:47:55,111 --> 00:47:57,364
everything isn't a mistake.

792
00:47:57,364 --> 00:48:02,116
Everyone's words and behaviors
are from their unconscious thoughts.

793
00:48:02,648 --> 00:48:04,560
Wrong. You're wrong.

794
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,699
Stop acting all smart.

795
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:10,690
- Am I acting smart?
- Well, Ye Seul.

796
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,027
She's saying this
out of good intention.

797
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:16,427
You're putting your dark history
behind for this new decent guy...

798
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,350
Don't call it my dark history.

799
00:48:18,375 --> 00:48:20,128
I chose all those guys.

800
00:48:20,128 --> 00:48:21,890
Why would you raise your voice?

801
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,816
I think that's wrong.
You chose them.

802
00:48:27,848 --> 00:48:29,834
Those who are bad at directions
tend to walk straight confidently...

803
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:31,730
when they don't even know
where they're going.

804
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:35,263
Whether I'm lost or taking my time,

805
00:48:35,295 --> 00:48:37,342
who are you to judge me?

806
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:39,704
Why do you look down
on my ex-boyfriends?

807
00:48:39,713 --> 00:48:42,729
Then can you say
all your ex-boyfriends were decent?

808
00:48:42,729 --> 00:48:45,562
Ji Sung dated a scumbag,
so why look down only on me?

809
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:50,918
Hey, why would you bring me up here?

810
00:48:51,104 --> 00:48:53,922
It's not like I knew
my ex was a piece of trash.

811
00:48:53,922 --> 00:48:56,923
At least, I didn't date
a piece of trash every single time.

812
00:48:57,016 --> 00:48:59,196
Are you saying
you're better than me?

813
00:48:59,196 --> 00:49:01,561
You're stupider for being ignorant
throughout the seven years.

814
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:03,433
Do you call me a fool
for identifying scumbags right away?

815
00:49:03,433 --> 00:49:05,698
Why keep raising your voice?

816
00:49:05,698 --> 00:49:07,186
Please check inside.

817
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:08,959
Okay, enough.

818
00:49:08,984 --> 00:49:10,828
Let's stop now.

819
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:12,188
Well...

820
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:16,120
I shouldn't have crossed the line
with Yu Jin here with us.

821
00:49:16,145 --> 00:49:17,298
Let's stop.

822
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:19,197
- You started it.
- Who do you think you are?

823
00:49:21,636 --> 00:49:23,569
You're the one who started it.

824
00:49:23,569 --> 00:49:25,436
What's wrong with you all?

825
00:49:25,436 --> 00:49:28,536
You guys are the ones who always
come and tell me about your men,

826
00:49:28,536 --> 00:49:31,836
and tell me to decide for you.

827
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:33,136
Why are you acting out now?

828
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:37,469
Do you know how tiring it was
to listen to your men problems?

829
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:41,202
Were you forcing yourself
to listen to us all along?

830
00:49:41,202 --> 00:49:42,402
Did we ask you to listen to us?

831
00:49:42,402 --> 00:49:44,536
And we listened to you too!

832
00:49:44,536 --> 00:49:46,336
Why are you saying it as if you're
the only one who listened?

833
00:49:46,336 --> 00:49:49,502
That's right. You don't know
how talkative you are, do you?

834
00:49:49,502 --> 00:49:51,236
You're the one who talks
the most here.

835
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,736
Honey, let's stop.

836
00:49:56,736 --> 00:49:58,602
This isn't like you.

837
00:49:58,602 --> 00:50:00,302
What is like me?

838
00:50:00,302 --> 00:50:02,069
What do you know about me?

839
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,802
You don't know anything.

840
00:50:03,802 --> 00:50:06,436
You were busy working
even when I fainted.

841
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,936
Please check inside.

842
00:50:07,936 --> 00:50:09,302
Yes, Sang Sik.

843
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:11,902
You crossed the line.
You shouldn't have done that.

844
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:13,969
Yes, we were so disappointed
in you when that happened.

845
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:16,836
We ran to the hospital as soon
as we heard that she fainted.

846
00:50:16,836 --> 00:50:19,269
Who do you think you are?
Why are you scolding my husband?

847
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:20,569
I scold him when I want.

848
00:50:20,569 --> 00:50:23,869
We're defending you!

849
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:24,936
Why are you being so sensitive?

850
00:50:24,936 --> 00:50:26,236
Come on.

851
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,902
I think we're a little heated up.

852
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,336
Let's stop here.

853
00:50:32,336 --> 00:50:33,936
You're still here?

854
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:35,969
You haven't ghosted yet?

855
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:40,636
Why are you being mean to my Yu Jin?

856
00:50:40,636 --> 00:50:43,836
Tell your husband not to ghost
when you're sick!

857
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:45,602
You said that he always ghosts.

858
00:50:45,602 --> 00:50:47,402
You said that he disappears
all the time.

859
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:50,977
Whatever. Just stop.

860
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:52,936
- Ji Sung,
- What?

861
00:50:52,936 --> 00:50:55,869
don't act like you know our men.
Keep your eyes on yours.

862
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:58,169
You don't even know how old
your boyfriend is.

863
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:00,569
Don't get fooled into marriage
and consider a divorce like me.

864
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:02,836
Make sure to get to know him well
in the first place.

865
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:04,502
Why do you have to say it like that?

866
00:51:04,502 --> 00:51:05,869
I just want you to know your man...

867
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:07,869
- so that you don't get fooled.
- I'll take care of my relationship.

868
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,836
Why do you have to talk like that?
It's unpleasant.

869
00:51:09,836 --> 00:51:11,769
She's right, you know.

870
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:14,236
You don't even know your boyfriend's
age and you were giving me advice?

871
00:51:14,236 --> 00:51:16,202
- Stop it now.
- Be quiet.

872
00:51:16,202 --> 00:51:17,336
She's right.

873
00:51:17,336 --> 00:51:19,536
Do I have to know everything
about him?

874
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,069
Why is everyone being
like this today?

875
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:22,569
Please check inside.

876
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:24,136
Turn that off!

877
00:51:25,102 --> 00:51:26,469
It's smoking.

878
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:28,002
My goodness!

879
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:31,402
Divorce? What are you talking about?

880
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:35,869
It's all burnt.

881
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:38,036
Why are you talking
about getting a divorce again?

882
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:39,336
Are you actually trying to get one?

883
00:51:39,336 --> 00:51:40,636
Why not?

884
00:51:40,636 --> 00:51:42,202
I'm all for it.

885
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:45,902
You do need to rebel a little.

886
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,202
- Get out.
- Get out.

887
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:49,036
Why do you always say that to me?

888
00:51:49,036 --> 00:51:51,502
You two are always leaving me out,
including in fights!

889
00:51:51,502 --> 00:51:53,436
Why am I always the lone one?

890
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:54,469
Yu Jin!

891
00:51:55,469 --> 00:51:58,036
Why won't you pick up?

892
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:02,769
Hey!

893
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:04,802
Yu Jin!

894
00:52:16,569 --> 00:52:17,602
Okay.

895
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:22,802
Ji Sung,

896
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:25,769
when I asked you...

897
00:52:25,769 --> 00:52:30,969
to join me for couples' dinners
over and over again,

898
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:33,402
you said that you were too busy.

899
00:52:33,402 --> 00:52:37,769
So how can you attend one
so early into a new relationship?

900
00:52:38,736 --> 00:52:43,202
What does that firefighter have
that I don't?

901
00:52:44,802 --> 00:52:47,102
Right. That?

902
00:52:54,602 --> 00:52:58,569
Not being the most-searched name
on the web?

903
00:52:59,102 --> 00:53:02,936
I didn't know you had greed
for fame.

904
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:05,102
You're dating him...

905
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:08,002
- for all the attention?
- What's this?

906
00:53:08,002 --> 00:53:09,402
Your name is still hot on the web.

907
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,269
You love him?

908
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:14,536
- You love him?
- It's all over the web.

909
00:53:17,536 --> 00:53:19,236
Goodness.

910
00:53:19,236 --> 00:53:20,836
I'll get going first.

911
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:24,102
Gook Hee!

912
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:26,836
- Gook Hee!
- Where are you going?

913
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,102
- Get out of my way.
- Ji Sung!

914
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:30,769
- I need my shoes!
- Ji Sung!

915
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:32,669
Don't go.

916
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:34,202
Gook Hee!

917
00:53:34,202 --> 00:53:36,669
<i>What a life</i>

918
00:53:37,936 --> 00:53:40,269
<i>It's like a popular song</i>

919
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,802
Gook Hee!

920
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:47,269
Gook Hee!

921
00:53:48,669 --> 00:53:50,136
What's wrong?

922
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:53,169
I'm sorry.

923
00:53:54,236 --> 00:53:56,936
I'm too flustered.

924
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:58,902
Tell me. What's wrong?

925
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,269
I'm fine. It'll be all right.

926
00:54:01,269 --> 00:54:02,469
What are you talking about?

927
00:54:04,336 --> 00:54:06,836
I'm sorry. I'll get going first.

928
00:54:07,836 --> 00:54:10,202
- What?
- Get home safe.

929
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:11,269
Gook Hee!

930
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,269
What's wrong?

931
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:18,036
(Who's this hot firefighter
on the firefighter calendar?)

932
00:54:18,602 --> 00:54:20,902
It doesn't look
like it's anything bad.

933
00:54:28,236 --> 00:54:29,269
Honey,

934
00:54:31,669 --> 00:54:34,502
you were just joking
about the divorce, right?

935
00:54:39,169 --> 00:54:41,269
I told you that I just don't want
to keep trying for a child.

936
00:54:41,269 --> 00:54:43,369
It's not that I don't want to live
with you anymore.

937
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:48,502
You haven't read "The Interpretation
of Dreams" either, clearly.

938
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:52,269
"There is no mistake
in human behavior."

939
00:54:52,769 --> 00:54:54,702
"Every word they say
and every action they take..."

940
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:57,469
"reflect the person's
subconscious mind."

941
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:02,869
Of all things I've said to you
all this time,

942
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:04,502
have I ever said anything jokingly?

943
00:55:08,302 --> 00:55:09,402
You can go first.

944
00:55:10,636 --> 00:55:12,002
I'm going to take a walk.

945
00:55:12,636 --> 00:55:13,636
Honey...

946
00:55:33,602 --> 00:55:35,136
(Gam Oh Jung)

947
00:55:35,136 --> 00:55:36,869
What are you doing, food taster?

948
00:55:37,736 --> 00:55:39,169
You want to grab a drink?

949
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:08,869
Why do you keep talking
about divorce?

950
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:10,169
Are you actually trying to get one?

951
00:56:10,169 --> 00:56:12,669
- Why not?
- Nightingale.

952
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,169
Ms. Nightingale.

953
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:16,336
- No.
- May I have your number?

954
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:19,369
This is for the photoshoot
this weekend.

955
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:20,402
You got dust.

956
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:25,369
No. Don't take it the wrong way.
He's not like that.

957
00:56:26,836 --> 00:56:29,136
Whatever. I don't care
if she gets a divorce or not.

958
00:56:31,402 --> 00:56:33,569
Did Mr. Gam miss the photoshoot...

959
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:37,469
because of Gi Hyun?

960
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,902
Ultimately, yes.

961
00:56:39,902 --> 00:56:41,502
What...

962
00:56:41,502 --> 00:56:43,969
- is he like?
- Sorry?

963
00:56:43,969 --> 00:56:46,502
He's married, right?

964
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:50,936
He seems very friendly to women.

965
00:56:50,936 --> 00:56:54,269
That's his personal life,
so I can't say.

966
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:08,769
Stop accessing the program now.

967
00:57:13,802 --> 00:57:17,136
Yes. Think of it like being
on a diet.

968
00:57:17,136 --> 00:57:19,602
Let's just say that I talked
to Ms. Hwang tomorrow morning...

969
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,502
instead of this morning.

970
00:57:21,502 --> 00:57:22,536
So,

971
00:57:23,702 --> 00:57:25,302
one last time.

972
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:27,236
Hi, Fridge.

973
00:57:27,236 --> 00:57:28,769
Yes, please go on.

974
00:57:28,769 --> 00:57:31,002
A man in his 30s.
Lives in Gorae-dong.

975
00:57:31,002 --> 00:57:32,502
A firefighter
at the Gorae Fire Station.

976
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:33,669
A father of three.

977
00:57:35,769 --> 00:57:39,002
Mr. Gam loves his wife so much.

978
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:44,236
What? He's so sweet
with his wife too.

979
00:57:44,236 --> 00:57:45,469
Then why?

980
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:48,269
He loves his friends too.

981
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:50,536
The friend he contacts
the most is...

982
00:57:50,536 --> 00:57:51,836
Jae Min?

983
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:57,369
That's Gook Hee.

984
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:03,769
Why is his name Jae Min?

985
00:58:18,169 --> 00:58:19,202
(jatsuperman is entering
the administrator mode.)

986
00:58:20,402 --> 00:58:21,836
(Has Ms. S, whose wedding was
called off recently,)

987
00:58:23,502 --> 00:58:25,502
(already found a new man
through the national project?)

988
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,869
(Who is...)

989
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:33,269
(Who is that firefighter?)

990
00:58:37,836 --> 00:58:41,736
(Special thanks to Noh Sa Yeon
and Lee Mu Song.)

991
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,217
(Please Don't Date Him)

992
00:58:49,302 --> 00:58:51,836
Your boyfriend is all over the web!

993
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:54,136
You don't even like it when I'm
taking interest in you?

994
00:58:54,769 --> 00:58:56,402
What more do you want to know?

995
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:58,169
You can look him up
without him knowing.

996
00:58:58,169 --> 00:58:59,936
Right. You have Fridge!

997
00:58:59,936 --> 00:59:01,402
Can't you get Fridge to help you?

998
00:59:01,402 --> 00:59:02,602
We're not what you think we are.

999
00:59:02,602 --> 00:59:04,102
- Are you cheating on me?
- Honey, that's...

1000
00:59:04,102 --> 00:59:07,002
You two look like you have a lot
to talk about. I'll leave.

1001
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:08,236
Husband.

1002
00:59:14,402 --> 00:59:17,102
But when I saw his face,

1003
00:59:17,102 --> 00:59:18,502
all my fear went away.

1004
00:59:18,502 --> 00:59:19,802
Did you snoop around behind my back?

1005
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:21,302
No, it's not that.

1006
00:59:21,302 --> 00:59:24,636
I don't know who you are anymore.
