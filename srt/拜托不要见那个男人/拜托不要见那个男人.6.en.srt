1
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,175
It's been a while.

2
00:00:15,508 --> 00:00:17,144
You were the youngest,

3
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:19,018
but time flies, and now you're
the manager.

4
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,387
I miss the on-site duties
that would make my adrenaline rush.

5
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,958
I didn't know scrapping the JSS
authentication chip would be...

6
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,894
the last mission
of Counter-terrorism Team One.

7
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:41,873
The inspection system, JSS,
made to prevent terrorism,

8
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,304
was misused for the fights in
the political and financial circles,

9
00:00:44,864 --> 00:00:46,958
so the authorities
who distrusted one another...

10
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,802
decided to close off the system.

11
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,778
But...

12
00:00:52,546 --> 00:00:55,816
the authentication chip to be
discarded had vanished.

13
00:00:55,818 --> 00:00:57,451
Where did you hide the chip?

14
00:00:58,004 --> 00:00:59,019
I do not know.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,520
- Why did you hide it?
- As you may know,

16
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:05,125
the key members of Counter-terrorism
Team One had scattered after that.

17
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:08,495
And I came to Pelican Electronics.

18
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:11,465
But...

19
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,867
was it fate?

20
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,371
I didn't imagine that I would get
a hint of JSS here.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,810
Who is this person who turned JSS on
supposed to be?

22
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:25,746
Perhaps she is...

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,682
a spy from another force.

24
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,327
Long time no see, Autumn 44.

25
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,589
It's been a while, JSS.

26
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:41,321
I need more time until I get proof.

27
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:43,664
I, Autumn 44,

28
00:01:43,776 --> 00:01:47,467
will be vindicated
and go back to where I belong.

29
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,270
It won't be long before...

30
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:54,775
the tuna is in the can.

31
00:01:55,348 --> 00:02:00,160
(Please Don't Date Him)

32
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,964
(Episode 6. What Is Your Name)

33
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:10,297
My gosh.

34
00:02:15,809 --> 00:02:18,512
You have a really high nose bridge.

35
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,335
What's wrong with me?

36
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,638
I'm going crazy.

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,042
You are three meters away.

38
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,843
You may approach.

39
00:02:46,344 --> 00:02:47,912
You may approach.

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,692
When are you off?

41
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,301
Ms. Seo.

42
00:03:11,869 --> 00:03:12,870
Tell me...

43
00:03:14,072 --> 00:03:15,239
when you are off.

44
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:19,877
Okay. Hold on.

45
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,121
I'm off on Friday.

46
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,522
Friday.

47
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:32,494
(Friday's schedule)

48
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:33,178
(Delete)

49
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,525
That's good.

50
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,128
I'm taking my annual leave
on Friday too.

51
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,174
I see.

52
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,154
Thank you for today.

53
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:47,531
So I wanted to treat you
to lunch, and we could talk.

54
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,533
I was hoping we could do that.

55
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:51,568
Yes.

56
00:03:57,883 --> 00:03:59,883
- What do I do?
- What is it?

57
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,220
Can't you make it?

58
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:05,323
I have a schedule that day.

59
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:10,862
You have things to do, I see.

60
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,031
That can't be helped.

61
00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:15,767
Does...

62
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:18,703
Friday afternoon work for you?

63
00:04:18,903 --> 00:04:20,204
Instead of lunch.

64
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:23,041
I have to shoot for a muscular
firefighters calendar on Friday.

65
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:26,611
And it ends around two p.m.

66
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:29,681
- So that's on Friday.
- Yes, it is.

67
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:34,519
Then how about meeting up
near the studio on Friday at three?

68
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:36,387
I'll look for a good place.

69
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:37,784
All right.

70
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:43,428
If it's too far, I can go over
to your area.

71
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,698
No, you can't do that.
We'll be meeting too late...

72
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,434
Won't we?

73
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,273
Okay.

74
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,008
Then...

75
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:58,776
you can...

76
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,578
come to me.

77
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,246
I'll do that.

78
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:08,824
So I'll see you on Friday.

79
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:10,688
Sure.

80
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,891
Get home safely.

81
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,254
This is what being attracted
to someone must be like.

82
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,426
It makes you want to know
more about them.

83
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:52,650
Not getting to know everything
at once,

84
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:55,633
but a little bit at a time
while cherishing it.

85
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:58,302
As if to sink into one another.

86
00:06:12,183 --> 00:06:13,251
Fire Marshal Jung.

87
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,353
Any good news?

88
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:19,657
It's a secret.

89
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:29,400
- Now I have someone like that.
- Manager Seo.

90
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:30,902
Ms. Byun.

91
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:32,199
What brings you here?

92
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,956
I guess your outside duty ended now.

93
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:37,275
Are you going for a workout?

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,076
No, it's because of this.

95
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:41,979
Gook Hee left his bicycle with me
on the weekend.

96
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,761
Gook Hee?

97
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,552
Where did he leave it?

98
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,953
In front of my house.

99
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,488
Your house?

100
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,292
Firefighter Jung went over
to your house?

101
00:06:55,685 --> 00:06:57,728
Well, it's...

102
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,172
You guys must be really close.

103
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:02,266
Right?

104
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:04,435
Yes, we are.

105
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:09,941
What is that?

106
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:13,811
I baked him some cookies
to have during his night duty.

107
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:15,313
Cookies.

108
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:17,415
Be on your way.

109
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:20,017
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- See you.

110
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,691
To her house?

111
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,856
You were so hot even back then.

112
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:01,732
I've seen all your photos
from the sonogram.

113
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:04,562
But how come you've always
been so handsome?

114
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:09,767
My gosh. Bang Jung Han.

115
00:08:10,468 --> 00:08:11,802
Look at him.

116
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,337
Oh, my gosh.

117
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,641
He's become much better now.

118
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:22,113
I didn't know you and Jung Han
were classmates in high school too.

119
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,015
Who was a better student?

120
00:08:25,322 --> 00:08:27,064
Jung Han was slightly better.

121
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:28,771
Really?

122
00:08:28,773 --> 00:08:29,921
I wouldn't have expected that.

123
00:08:30,293 --> 00:08:34,825
But Jung Han was the type
who would sit and study all day,

124
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,425
while I had some fun in between.

125
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,648
As expected.

126
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,230
You're the real winner.

127
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,918
I used to be a winner too.

128
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
I got so many gold medals
with taekwondo.

129
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:44,602
Really?

130
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:46,370
- Yes, do you want to see it?
- Sure.

131
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:50,675
Taekwon girl Moon Ye Seul.

132
00:08:51,248 --> 00:08:52,483
How long have you practiced?

133
00:08:52,485 --> 00:08:54,712
It was about eight years.

134
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:57,602
I had to do spinning kicks
whenever I came across jerks...

135
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,118
and that helped keep my skills.

136
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,384
Isn't that such a good angle?

137
00:09:03,894 --> 00:09:04,922
Are they your parents?

138
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,592
That's my mom and dad.

139
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:11,595
- They look so much in love.
- No.

140
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,065
They're pretending to look happy.

141
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:17,301
And I was like an accessory
that had to be there.

142
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,408
It's like that with my parents.

143
00:09:25,763 --> 00:09:27,011
Really?

144
00:09:28,232 --> 00:09:30,314
They didn't seem like it.

145
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:35,353
Let's not pretend to be happy later.

146
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:43,561
This one's adorable,
so I'll save it.

147
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,064
Is that all right?

148
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:49,433
Ye Seul, do you want some more wine?

149
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:52,303
I'm good. But if you want
another drink that's fine with me.

150
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,604
Get some rest here.

151
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,092
Our photoshoot will be used
in April, the climax of a calendar.

152
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:14,280
Your new year's plans
grow out of your attention...

153
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,630
and stop looking at the calendar.

154
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,455
And that starts from April.
You stop turning pages from then on.

155
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,858
You're right.

156
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:24,624
But you're becoming muscular
day by day.

157
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,247
Thank you.

158
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,611
Gook Hee.

159
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:30,988
You might get love calls
from model agencies.

160
00:10:31,574 --> 00:10:34,072
- No way.
- That's not going to happen.

161
00:10:34,072 --> 00:10:36,072
- He will be wearing a helmet.
- Why?

162
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:37,903
Why cover your face
for the calendar photoshoot?

163
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,762
That'd be a waste
of your looks, Mr. Jung.

164
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:44,969
What's wrong with you guys today?

165
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:48,009
If that's how you're going to use
your looks, don't be handsome.

166
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:50,009
Or don't be lucky at least.

167
00:10:50,075 --> 00:10:51,255
You have everything
except for a girlfriend.

168
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:55,876
What?

169
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:57,839
What was that cough? Am I
the only one who finds it strange?

170
00:10:59,153 --> 00:11:00,239
What?

171
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:02,849
- What? I got you.
- What do you mean?

172
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,231
You coughed right
when I mentioned a girlfriend.

173
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:07,562
Why all of a sudden?
And what's that note?

174
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:08,999
What is this?

175
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:10,685
What is this note? Let me see.

176
00:11:10,685 --> 00:11:13,543
You're suddenly getting tense.
Why are you sniffing?

177
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:15,543
What's wrong with you?

178
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:17,175
Why are you chuckling?

179
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:19,199
- Why are you flaring your nostrils?
- I'm not!

180
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,659
Am I the only one excited right now?

181
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:22,704
- What...
- Hey, come clean already.

182
00:11:22,704 --> 00:11:24,750
- This is not like you at all.
- Stop it.

183
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,110
Say it now, you punk.

184
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:27,944
Let's go.

185
00:11:28,992 --> 00:11:31,141
Director Oh, I'm done
with the pamphlet...

186
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,813
- you talked about before.
- Oh, I see.

187
00:11:32,813 --> 00:11:34,576
Will you take a look?

188
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:37,803
- Byun Ha Ri. She's cute.
- About today's lunch...

189
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:39,595
Everyone would like her kind looks.

190
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:40,988
Why don't we play ghost leg
and decide?

191
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:42,898
- She's even sweet.
- Fine.

192
00:11:43,342 --> 00:11:45,428
If she calls him with a smile,

193
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:48,608
- it'd be pleasing, I guess.
- What do you want, Mr. Oh?

194
00:11:48,937 --> 00:11:50,306
Well, I want...

195
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:51,763
Gook Hee.

196
00:11:52,937 --> 00:11:54,937
- Cookies.
- Cookies?

197
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,525
Seriously.

198
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:11,617
Gook Hee.

199
00:12:12,338 --> 00:12:14,076
When is your day-off?

200
00:12:14,659 --> 00:12:15,781
Right now.

201
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,613
Let's do the meeting right now.

202
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:27,376
- Let's do the meeting.
- Okay.

203
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:32,811
I'm being too childish.

204
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:35,295
Snap out of it, Ji Sung.

205
00:12:38,229 --> 00:12:39,635
(Dalgona equals bio.)

206
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:40,901
Guess what?

207
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:44,547
Just to make a cup of coffee,
people do this more than 500 times.

208
00:12:44,547 --> 00:12:47,341
But it's not delicious.

209
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:49,882
They still make this...

210
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,338
and post pictures of it online.
They go crazy about it.

211
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,881
In order to stand out
among other solid fridge products,

212
00:12:56,248 --> 00:12:58,415
we need something like this dalgona.

213
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:00,415
Something old, but new.

214
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:01,750
(Mr. Oh is so boring.)

215
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,750
And dalgona means...

216
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,290
bio for us.

217
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:09,861
Bio? What kind of function
do you mean in specific?

218
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:11,509
What I'm saying is...

219
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:14,663
that dalgona coffee doesn't actually
have dalgona in it. That's a hint.

220
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,081
You've got to come up with it.

221
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,647
An event for the national project
is to be held today, right?

222
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,297
The thermovision camera is
almost done.

223
00:13:23,297 --> 00:13:25,386
Mr. Ok, you're going there
to film a promotional video.

224
00:13:25,606 --> 00:13:27,900
In that case... Right!

225
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,999
Ms. Byun, you majored in bio.

226
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:34,005
- Biotechnology.
- Exactly.

227
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:37,226
You two should work together.

228
00:13:37,636 --> 00:13:40,036
Okay, I'll work hard.

229
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:42,149
All right.

230
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,125
Why don't you hand me
the report on this...

231
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:47,096
by Friday?

232
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:49,096
That's too soon.

233
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:51,747
And I'm taking my day off on Friday.

234
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,370
- Are you?
- Yes.

235
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,872
That's from my smartwatch.

236
00:13:57,872 --> 00:13:59,642
Let me stretch my body a little.

237
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:02,110
Good. Everyone, stand up.

238
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:05,447
You need to increase blood flow
in your brain...

239
00:14:05,447 --> 00:14:07,270
for you to come up
with good ideas like this one.

240
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,923
- Let's exercise.
- Okay.

241
00:14:10,302 --> 00:14:12,789
Two, three... That's nice.

242
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:32,491
Bravo!

243
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,055
We're done searching
the entire building.

244
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:41,055
Good work. We just have
to take care of the embers now.

245
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:43,045
- The rescue team can stand aside.
- Okay.

246
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:45,297
We will be going inside
because it's dangerous.

247
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:47,275
Are you sure
your children are inside?

248
00:14:47,275 --> 00:14:50,462
- He doesn't have any children.
- That's not what I mean.

249
00:14:51,344 --> 00:14:53,344
Move. Let me go do it myself.

250
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:55,574
You can't go inside.

251
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:57,261
Whom are you trying to rescue?

252
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,268
Move!

253
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:01,501
Guys!

254
00:15:01,905 --> 00:15:04,454
I need to rescue my masks!

255
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:07,400
- Masks?
- He hoards things up for a living.

256
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,782
Masks and hand sanitizers.

257
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,034
Did you just say hand sanitizers?

258
00:15:12,436 --> 00:15:14,624
There might be
about 100 boxes of them.

259
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,241
What, 100 boxes?

260
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,978
A large number of hand sanitizers
are said to be on the second floor!

261
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:23,175
- Everyone, come outside!
- Hand sanitizers are...

262
00:15:23,175 --> 00:15:25,440
made of ethanol. They're inflammable
and could explode!

263
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,122
- It's dangerous!
- Let go.

264
00:15:27,122 --> 00:15:28,997
- You can't go inside.
- You people.

265
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:31,112
Pull yourselves together.

266
00:15:31,112 --> 00:15:33,112
There could be another virus.

267
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,325
- You can't go inside.
- Move!

268
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:54,819
(Youngjin House)

269
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,247
No.

270
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:07,983
It's blood!

271
00:16:08,038 --> 00:16:10,727
- Are you okay?
- Oh, no.

272
00:16:17,618 --> 00:16:19,618
I'm going to sue you!

273
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,725
- Did he get hurt?
- Is he okay?

274
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:25,284
I told you to stand aside.
What are you doing?

275
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,628
The fire is completely out!

276
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,806
(119 Firefighting)

277
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,106
Gook Hee, has it been three years?

278
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,186
Yes, sir.

279
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,164
Are you really a firefighter?

280
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:45,632
No, you still have a long way to go.

281
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:48,954
What did I tell you
about the scariest fire?

282
00:16:50,297 --> 00:16:52,116
An invisible fire.

283
00:16:52,776 --> 00:16:55,397
Right, a hidden fire.

284
00:16:55,802 --> 00:16:58,455
You can't see it, but the smoke
keeps getting bigger.

285
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:00,171
And it suffocates you more and more.

286
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,318
It puts everyone in danger
by pulling things down in a moment.

287
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:06,409
I saw that fire at the site today.

288
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,925
It reminded me of you.

289
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,360
It's hidden in your heart.

290
00:17:11,518 --> 00:17:13,518
It's suffocating you.

291
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,528
You need to find it and put it out.

292
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,592
That's your duty as a firefighter.

293
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,219
I feel so chilly.

294
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:27,347
Is it the superovulation injection?

295
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,739
- What's with her this time?
- The phone is turned off.

296
00:17:30,826 --> 00:17:32,855
You will be directed to voicemail.

297
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:35,512
An extra fee will be charged
after the beep.

298
00:17:37,635 --> 00:17:40,649
Gi Hyun, I can't reach Yu Jin again.

299
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:43,946
- How long has it been?
- It's 40 hours and 47 minutes.

300
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:46,146
It's 48 minutes now.

301
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:48,759
It's taking long this time.

302
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:51,159
Right? It's taking way too long.

303
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,383
I think something happened to him.

304
00:17:53,383 --> 00:17:55,085
I'm worried sick.

305
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,610
He posted this picture
on his Moonstargram page.

306
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:02,610
What could possibly happen
that stopped him from answering you?

307
00:18:04,753 --> 00:18:07,956
What? When did he post this?
Five minutes ago?

308
00:18:09,843 --> 00:18:12,017
Maybe something happened
between you two.

309
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:14,567
No. We didn't fight.

310
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,931
Everything was great.

311
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:21,220
- I wonder what the problem is.
- Give me all the details.

312
00:18:23,806 --> 00:18:26,645
When he 1st disappeared,
he showed up after 4 hours.

313
00:18:26,988 --> 00:18:29,925
I thought he had his reasons
because it was the first time.

314
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,513
An issue about his bowels
or something like that.

315
00:18:31,538 --> 00:18:33,708
Anyway,
things were great after then,

316
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,211
but he suddenly wanted
to go buy wine.

317
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,937
Do you want some more wine?
Get some rest here.

318
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:41,465
He left and didn't come back
all night long.

319
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:42,581
And?

320
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:45,102
So I kept waiting.

321
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,937
He came back the next day
in the evening.

322
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,187
Did you have dinner?

323
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:58,142
He seemed so natural...

324
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,521
- that I happened to smile.
- Yes.

325
00:19:00,624 --> 00:19:03,418
Why did you smile there?

326
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:06,270
I know. I was so stupid.

327
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,104
I was being an idiot.

328
00:19:09,812 --> 00:19:12,972
- And he can't be reached again?
- No.

329
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,905
Maybe he has something
like hypnolepsy.

330
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,425
Or sporadic dementia.

331
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,331
I thought about that too,

332
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:21,896
but that might not be the case.

333
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,197
He posted a picture on social media
just five minutes ago.

334
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:28,751
I'm trying to reach him like crazy,
but he doesn't answer at all.

335
00:19:29,243 --> 00:19:30,325
(Yu Jin, call me when you see this.)

336
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:33,144
You've sent so many texts.

337
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:40,137
I get it now.
He goes off the grid habitually.

338
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,812
He goes off the grid?

339
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:47,490
I mean, he can't be reached...

340
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,175
and he disappears all of a sudden.

341
00:19:49,175 --> 00:19:50,897
He's professional at this.

342
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,532
I can't believe
my radar failed to catch this.

343
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:57,572
Isn't he usually
good-mannered and neat?

344
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,572
Yes. He's perfect.

345
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:04,435
That means he has
high demands for others.

346
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:06,721
He doesn't ask me anything.

347
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:08,465
He's just really nice to me.

348
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,155
He's amazing. Then once things go
wrong, he'll ghost.

349
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:15,092
But he's a really good man.

350
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:18,524
He's ghosting! For the third time!

351
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:20,897
How long have you been dating him?

352
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,680
What do I do then?

353
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,002
What do you mean?
It's time for him to go!

354
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,870
That's a little extreme.
I don't want to do that.

355
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,672
Han Yu Jin has said...

356
00:20:28,672 --> 00:20:33,610
that he's trash himself,
so why would you even date him?

357
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:35,712
Because he's not trash!

358
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,151
And what, are you perfect?

359
00:20:41,151 --> 00:20:42,860
You got completely hammered
last time,

360
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,255
and told me that I'm charming
because I'm lacking.

361
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:47,157
You said you'd take in
my weak side too!

362
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:50,360
I want to take in
Yu Jin's weak side too.

363
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,029
Take what in?

364
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:54,331
You can't fix a man who has a habit
of ghosting.

365
00:20:54,331 --> 00:20:58,635
Are you going to be an idiot
and let him control you?

366
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,337
What? Control?

367
00:21:00,633 --> 00:21:01,605
Yes.

368
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:03,516
I'm going to let him control me,

369
00:21:03,516 --> 00:21:05,742
and we're going to fly in the sky.
You hear that?

370
00:21:05,883 --> 00:21:07,077
Just wait and see.

371
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,653
What...

372
00:21:16,653 --> 00:21:18,121
a confusing woman she is.

373
00:21:21,337 --> 00:21:22,532
Goodness.

374
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:23,927
Tak Gi Hyun!

375
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:25,562
She always knows the right thing
to say.

376
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:34,712
(Hanbang Dentist)

377
00:21:38,391 --> 00:21:40,977
When did you come back?

378
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:46,665
How did you know that I came back?

379
00:21:47,938 --> 00:21:49,786
How did you know?

380
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,583
- What?
- What?

381
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,399
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, my!

382
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:57,594
Who are you?

383
00:21:58,001 --> 00:22:00,297
You're not Seo Ji Sung!

384
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,232
What are you talking about?

385
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:04,367
Why are you here, Jung Han?

386
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:07,237
I work here from now on.

387
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:08,972
Well,

388
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,526
I'm more like the co-owner.

389
00:22:10,574 --> 00:22:12,142
- I have half of the shares...
- Whatever.

390
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:14,911
Where's Yu Jin?

391
00:22:14,911 --> 00:22:16,613
I don't know. I just talked to him
over the phone.

392
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:18,548
Wait,

393
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:20,784
how long have you been dating
Yu Jin?

394
00:22:21,118 --> 00:22:22,141
You really don't know?

395
00:22:22,141 --> 00:22:23,157
I really don't.

396
00:22:23,157 --> 00:22:26,256
He always ghosts when things
aren't going in his favor,

397
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,024
and it seems like that habit never
went away since high school.

398
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:30,827
How did you end up
with a terrible man like him?

399
00:22:30,962 --> 00:22:32,863
You have no right to say that.

400
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,665
So he's not hurt or anything?

401
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:38,301
Are you seriously worried about him?

402
00:22:38,462 --> 00:22:40,270
Let me know if you can get
in touch with him.

403
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:42,038
Ye Seul, hold on.

404
00:22:43,383 --> 00:22:45,175
I'll find out where Yu Jin is.

405
00:22:45,776 --> 00:22:48,311
In return, tell me about Ji Sung.

406
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:49,412
How petty.

407
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,814
I don't want to do that.

408
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:53,250
I know which temple Yu Jin goes to.

409
00:22:53,813 --> 00:22:55,185
Where is it?

410
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,921
It'll be impossible for you to find
on your own.

411
00:22:59,523 --> 00:23:02,259
I can just look it up
on social media.

412
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:04,427
- You don't have to tell me.
- Heungguksa Temple in Haesung-si.

413
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:06,163
Goodness.

414
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:08,398
You have to tell me something
in return. Hurry!

415
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,767
Did you get a job at this office
for Ji Sung?

416
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:16,072
You're so stupid.

417
00:23:16,706 --> 00:23:18,708
Being this childish only works
on your mother.

418
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:22,746
Ji Sung is glowing these days.
She looks beautiful.

419
00:23:23,013 --> 00:23:24,347
Maybe she has a man.

420
00:23:24,347 --> 00:23:27,017
What? No way. There's no way
she has a man yet. Hold on!

421
00:23:28,418 --> 00:23:29,519
Ye Seul!

422
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:31,388
Ye Seul, is that really true?

423
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,532
Ms. Park,

424
00:23:39,696 --> 00:23:40,831
no, sorry,

425
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,332
you're Ms. Choi.

426
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,668
Well,

427
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,536
this is a story about a friend.

428
00:23:47,871 --> 00:23:49,039
There's a rumor...

429
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,408
that his ex-girlfriend
got pampered...

430
00:23:52,108 --> 00:23:54,578
to look good...

431
00:23:54,578 --> 00:23:56,213
for my friend.

432
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:57,881
Does that mean...

433
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,450
that he should...

434
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,686
just go visit her and pretend
that he hasn't heard any of this?

435
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:06,890
Whose idea is it that the ex got
pampered for the man?

436
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,326
That means she has a new man.

437
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,061
No way.

438
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:13,129
She's not the type to move on
so fast.

439
00:24:14,969 --> 00:24:16,266
That's what I hear.

440
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:17,868
- Your friend so full.
- Sorry?

441
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:21,972
Your friend is so full of himself.

442
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:25,542
There's no "right" speed
to moving on.

443
00:24:25,542 --> 00:24:27,677
She's fond of this new man so much,

444
00:24:27,837 --> 00:24:29,746
the speed at which she's moving on
doesn't matter to her.

445
00:24:30,847 --> 00:24:31,815
Who?

446
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,266
(Jung Gook Hee)

447
00:24:35,518 --> 00:24:37,120
Hello, sir.

448
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,388
Hello.

449
00:24:40,196 --> 00:24:43,093
- Thanks for coming such a long way.
- It's nothing.

450
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:45,829
Let's go.

451
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:47,430
Get out of the way.

452
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,704
The thermovision camera beta test
went very well,

453
00:24:55,071 --> 00:24:56,306
and at last,

454
00:24:57,107 --> 00:24:58,875
we've signed the contract.

455
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,250
Let's give ourselves
a round of applause!

456
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,082
- To celebrate the day, I have...
- What's...

457
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,684
with all the macarons?

458
00:25:07,684 --> 00:25:09,986
Director's wife opened
a macaron shop.

459
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:12,626
- What?
- He paid with company money.

460
00:25:13,523 --> 00:25:14,557
With company money?

461
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:16,297
He bought all of these?

462
00:25:16,297 --> 00:25:17,294
Yes, he did.

463
00:25:17,294 --> 00:25:19,029
The camera is like our child.

464
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,666
Thanks for all of your hard work,
everyone from Gorae Fire Station.

465
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,524
- Thank you.
- Great work.

466
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:25,702
- Yes.
- Thank you.

467
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:28,004
And please promote...

468
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:31,341
our thermovision camera
on your firefighter calendar.

469
00:25:31,608 --> 00:25:32,776
All right. Will do.

470
00:25:32,776 --> 00:25:35,145
And have as many macarons
as you'd like!

471
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:42,219
Nice.

472
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:43,420
Sir,

473
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:46,690
I think we'll need to take a photo.

474
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,325
- I'll take one for you.
- Thank you.

475
00:25:48,325 --> 00:25:49,426
You can just...

476
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:53,229
Would you like a macaron?

477
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:56,333
Thank you.

478
00:26:02,649 --> 00:26:03,873
It's so good.

479
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:05,408
You're right. It is.

480
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:08,378
Have some of this.

481
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:10,213
Thank you so much.

482
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:15,919
Those two must be really close.

483
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,388
I don't think I've seen him
be so friendly...

484
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:20,290
in a professional setting.

485
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:21,424
It's so good!

486
00:26:21,424 --> 00:26:23,093
- Is it?
- Yes!

487
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:26,763
Yong Hee,

488
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:28,331
try this.

489
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:30,300
Thank you.

490
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,735
This one is the best one.

491
00:26:32,035 --> 00:26:34,437
It's Yong Han, actually.

492
00:26:36,239 --> 00:26:38,141
Yong Hee, have some coffee as well.

493
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,409
Thank you.

494
00:26:41,411 --> 00:26:42,579
But sorry, I don't drink coffee.

495
00:26:49,188 --> 00:26:50,854
This one is good.

496
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:54,591
They're both 36.5 degrees Celsius.

497
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:57,794
How cute.

498
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:00,196
Very ideal.

499
00:27:01,266 --> 00:27:04,134
If you two end up together,
it'll be love made by the country!

500
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:09,472
You know you can't say things
like that nowadays, right?

501
00:27:09,774 --> 00:27:11,841
Yes, the world has changed
quite a bit.

502
00:27:11,841 --> 00:27:15,512
But Director Oh says things
he shouldn't say nowadays too.

503
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:17,380
Love made...

504
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,648
by the country?

505
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:23,563
Love made by the country?

506
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:28,191
Why are you so red?

507
00:27:37,516 --> 00:27:38,935
Ms. Seo,

508
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:47,064
Have I done anything to offend you?

509
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,430
Ms. Seo,

510
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,192
Have I done anything to offend you?

511
00:28:23,503 --> 00:28:24,386
Ji Sung...

512
00:28:24,386 --> 00:28:26,229
You know how we agreed
to see each other...

513
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:28,708
What's going on
with that firefighter?

514
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:34,405
Do you always say yes to girls
who ask you out?

515
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:35,512
Excuse me?

516
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:39,930
I was wondering if your schedule,
except for Friday afternoon,

517
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:44,225
was full of seeing other girls
on your day-offs.

518
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:49,440
I'm not that kind of person.

519
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:53,264
The window frame!

520
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,696
I'm not sure if you heard me.
This is my girlfriend's house.

521
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:57,182
I heard that you guys broke up.

522
00:28:57,637 --> 00:28:58,841
Very clearly.

523
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,491
Then what kind of person are you?

524
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:08,742
I'm not sure what kind
of person I am.

525
00:29:09,786 --> 00:29:12,241
But I don't date just anyone.

526
00:29:14,196 --> 00:29:16,196
Date?

527
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:18,509
Yes. Date.

528
00:29:20,016 --> 00:29:21,264
What's going on, Ji Sung?

529
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:24,517
You make that smile when you're shy.

530
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:28,391
Is he the guy Ye Seul was
talking about?

531
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:32,123
- Did you think I was a player?
- Tell me it's not true, Ji Sung.

532
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,446
Why are you in a motel room?

533
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:36,960
Ji Sung. No, right?

534
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:39,128
It's not what I imagine it is,
right?

535
00:29:39,128 --> 00:29:40,772
You went there
to wash your feet, right?

536
00:29:40,772 --> 00:29:42,634
Sir, that's not it.

537
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:44,537
The motel!

538
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:52,642
(You have a new text message.)

539
00:29:53,262 --> 00:29:55,646
Ji Sung, this is Jung Gook Hee.

540
00:29:55,646 --> 00:29:58,298
It was nice talking to you today.

541
00:29:59,156 --> 00:30:01,208
Hey, Ji Sung! This is Jung Han.

542
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:03,263
- Come up to the rooftop now.
- What the...

543
00:30:03,263 --> 00:30:04,556
The rooftop?

544
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,821
Are you serious?

545
00:30:20,828 --> 00:30:22,612
Are you out of your mind?

546
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,917
Why are you at my company's rooftop?

547
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,079
Seo Ji Sung!

548
00:30:27,889 --> 00:30:29,976
- Were you cheating on me?
- What?

549
00:30:29,976 --> 00:30:32,053
I knew there was something wrong.

550
00:30:32,053 --> 00:30:34,694
You only used my group chat
as an excuse...

551
00:30:34,694 --> 00:30:36,694
so you could date that firefighter!

552
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:42,844
Did you really have to break up
with me like that?

553
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:46,399
You're delusional.
You should visit the hospital.

554
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:49,497
I even moved my hospital here
in hopes of getting you back.

555
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:50,591
Your hospital?

556
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,320
- Why did you move your hospital?
- Because I wanted to!

557
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,870
I have my rights on this land.

558
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,565
I don't need to get permission
from anyone to move my hospital!

559
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,959
Unbelievable.

560
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:01,889
You haven't changed!

561
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,155
Don't you ever think that I would
be uncomfortable seeing you here?

562
00:31:05,214 --> 00:31:08,726
- You have no idea how rude this is.
- Rude?

563
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,331
You're the one being rude, Ji Sung.

564
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,331
How could you cheat on me?

565
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,085
If I knew, I wouldn't have
moved here.

566
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:18,143
If I knew you went to motels
with anyone you meet...

567
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:20,069
Despicable. Are you
that kind of girl?

568
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:21,706
I didn't go to a motel!

569
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:22,734
What?

570
00:31:24,555 --> 00:31:25,645
I...

571
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,027
Whatever.

572
00:31:27,027 --> 00:31:29,991
Whether I go to motels or date
around is none of your business.

573
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:33,167
I don't care what you say.
I have no intentions...

574
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:35,361
to stop seeing him.

575
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,650
Then what about me?

576
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:39,609
What about my life
that you've ruined?

577
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:42,001
- That's because of me?
- Yes, it is!

578
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:49,831
- Jung Han.
- What?

579
00:31:49,831 --> 00:31:53,912
Seeing you, I can tell why
I'm attracted to him.

580
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,768
I was confused for a bit.

581
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:58,864
Thank you for opening up my eyes.

582
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:08,286
Do you honestly believe
that he is going to be different?

583
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,766
What do you even know about him?

584
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:13,535
You're right.

585
00:32:13,535 --> 00:32:15,045
I don't know anything.

586
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:17,953
That's why I'm dating him.
I want to learn more about him!

587
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:20,565
Are you serious?

588
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,652
You're despicable!

589
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:24,469
Good! You can move again!

590
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:27,298
No, I won't! The location here is
much better.

591
00:32:42,245 --> 00:32:44,815
- Manager Seo.
- Hey.

592
00:32:45,142 --> 00:32:48,719
I've had too many macarons.
I need something bitter.

593
00:32:48,743 --> 00:32:49,571
Me too.

594
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:52,572
- I've heard about the rumors.
- What rumors?

595
00:32:53,184 --> 00:32:54,958
Of me being pregnant?

596
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,844
People are wrong about that.

597
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,844
No, not that one.

598
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,708
Could you analyze my compatibility
with someone?

599
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:05,230
I heard there was someone
that only you could see.

600
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:06,158
Compatibility?

601
00:33:06,183 --> 00:33:09,840
Does she seriously like Gook Hee?

602
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,959
I've dated my boyfriend for a while.
I'd like to ask something.

603
00:33:12,959 --> 00:33:14,634
We're two years apart,
and he's a teacher.

604
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,545
You have a boyfriend, Ms. Byun?

605
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,864
Good for you!

606
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,273
You have a boyfriend!

607
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:23,603
A teacher is a stable job.
That's amazing!

608
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,397
I'm so happy for you!

609
00:33:25,397 --> 00:33:27,007
I hope you guys date
for a long time.

610
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:30,283
You're happier than my mother is.

611
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:36,739
I'm just happy
that you have a boyfriend.

612
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:39,786
You know, the Fridge Spirit!

613
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:42,279
I heard he was very good.

614
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,376
Why would an engineer believe
in fortune-telling?

615
00:33:44,376 --> 00:33:46,664
But why? Is there a problem?

616
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:50,882
- It's a sensitive topic.
- Sensitive?

617
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,887
Did your boyfriend cheat on you
by any chance?

618
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,905
No, he's very nice to me.

619
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,892
Then, what else? Money problem?

620
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:06,623
If I tell you, would you ask
the Fridge Spirit for me?

621
00:34:06,623 --> 00:34:08,994
I'm telling you,
there's no such thing.

622
00:34:08,994 --> 00:34:12,269
I just want to be of help to you.

623
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:13,806
What is it?

624
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:16,769
It's...

625
00:34:19,581 --> 00:34:22,663
- about my cat.
- Your cat?

626
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,307
He's pretty rough with my cat.

627
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,307
The way he talks too...

628
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:33,092
My cat hisses at him too,
very intensely.

629
00:34:34,413 --> 00:34:38,675
I was wondering if that meant
there was a problem with him.

630
00:34:38,792 --> 00:34:41,009
I don't think so.

631
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:44,328
From what I hear, your boyfriend
seems like a dog-person.

632
00:34:44,328 --> 00:34:46,140
A friendly dog-person.

633
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,438
I see. You're the type
to overthink stuff.

634
00:34:51,093 --> 00:34:54,897
You guys must be so happy together.
So happy.

635
00:34:56,031 --> 00:34:59,699
Let's go. We need to finish up
before Director Oh gets mad.

636
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,708
You know how I've messed up
my bowel while I was on a diet?

637
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:12,768
I hope you to recommend me
something good for my body.

638
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,778
Olive seaweed beet smoothie.

639
00:35:14,778 --> 00:35:16,778
It's a cure for constipation.

640
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,469
Thank you.

641
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:26,164
- Do you have any coupons?
- No.

642
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:30,012
Here's your olive seaweed
beet smoothie.

643
00:35:30,036 --> 00:35:31,083
You can call it Oliv-be.

644
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:33,428
Oliv-be! It looks very nice.

645
00:35:33,428 --> 00:35:36,331
I'll have this every day
until our shoot.

646
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:39,137
You're on a diet while suffering
from constipation.

647
00:35:39,668 --> 00:35:41,109
You're pushing too hard.

648
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:44,143
Is that photoshoot
that important to you?

649
00:35:44,751 --> 00:35:46,374
Do you want to be popular?

650
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:47,735
That's partially true.

651
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:50,039
It's nice to capture a young
and healthy moment.

652
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,666
You're a narcissist, I see.

653
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:53,666
That's also partially true.

654
00:35:53,928 --> 00:35:55,928
I want to look good to my kids.

655
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:59,510
My kids are proud of me
for being a firefighter.

656
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,012
Even though we became
government employees,

657
00:36:02,012 --> 00:36:04,514
there's not much we can do
for our kids.

658
00:36:04,928 --> 00:36:06,928
We're always at risk.

659
00:36:07,495 --> 00:36:09,597
I want them to like me
for as long as they can.

660
00:36:09,597 --> 00:36:11,425
You're a good dad.

661
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:13,749
I want them to remember me as one.

662
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:18,991
It's a bit awkward for you
to suddenly act all warm-hearted.

663
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:21,210
Do you always tell women this story?

664
00:36:21,234 --> 00:36:23,096
Bingo. You've caught me.

665
00:36:28,655 --> 00:36:29,861
What?

666
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:33,545
What is this?

667
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,586
Who put this here?

668
00:36:43,633 --> 00:36:46,309
Why is the Fridge on?

669
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:54,966
(I'm watching you. It's dangerous
to leave more traces behind.)

670
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:56,559
What kind of traces?

671
00:36:56,937 --> 00:36:58,470
Who wrote this?

672
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:05,980
What's going on, Dong Jin?
Did you turn on the Fridge?

673
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,186
It's been on.

674
00:37:07,186 --> 00:37:08,829
But I turned it off.

675
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:12,660
- Macarons are tasty, right?
- Yes, they are.

676
00:37:15,588 --> 00:37:17,721
Did someone come by my desk?

677
00:37:17,721 --> 00:37:20,497
No. Nobody comes over to your seat.

678
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:24,367
Aren't you the only one
who can turn the Fridge on and off?

679
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,750
Right.

680
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:31,929
Then why does the Fridge
keep turning on?

681
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:33,729
Who's touching it? Why?

682
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:36,465
I'm the only one who has access.

683
00:37:36,465 --> 00:37:39,357
What traces am I leaving behind?

684
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:48,736
Maybe...

685
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:52,208
I'm getting anxious.

686
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,777
This can't happen anymore.
I need to make sure it's blocked.

687
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,857
(Firewall activated)

688
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:08,010
(Firewall activated)

689
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:44,578
I need to get it done quickly
and go back to the office.

690
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,215
Are you going to be okay alone?

691
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:47,483
We can postpone this.

692
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:52,788
I've prepared everything
to have my egg collected.

693
00:38:53,074 --> 00:38:56,659
I've had injections, gotten tested,
exercised, and quit drinking.

694
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,595
I don't want to do it
all over again for nothing.

695
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,932
It's a common case
that husbands leave first.

696
00:39:03,012 --> 00:39:06,102
Don't ruin my schedule
for your convenience's sake.

697
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,773
Okay.

698
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:11,040
By the way, why don't you
give me anything these days?

699
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:12,508
Medicine and food extracts.

700
00:39:31,006 --> 00:39:32,395
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

701
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,363
Okay, let's go.

702
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,454
Pink.

703
00:39:59,255 --> 00:40:00,189
This one is pretty.

704
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,131
It's trending these days.
I don't want to run into girls...

705
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,133
in the same dress, so not this one.

706
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:34,123
Did you wake up?

707
00:40:38,574 --> 00:40:40,796
Mr. Jung, did you wake up?

708
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:42,364
Good luck with the shooting today.

709
00:40:49,749 --> 00:40:51,405
Your husband got his process done.

710
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,875
He paid the fee and left first.

711
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:56,112
Read this guideline thoroughly
and prepare for the transplant.

712
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,045
Are you sure I'm okay?

713
00:40:59,047 --> 00:41:01,047
The results say you are.
Are you feeling unwell?

714
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,319
I don't feel good.

715
00:41:03,459 --> 00:41:05,040
Is it okay to go home now?

716
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,387
Go home and get rest.

717
00:41:07,389 --> 00:41:09,465
Take two painkillers
once the anesthesia wears off.

718
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,728
If it's still painful,
come to the hospital tomorrow.

719
00:41:14,884 --> 00:41:16,265
Goodbye.

720
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,944
Why are the lights off?
Hasn't she come to work yet?

721
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:04,613
Ms. Tak.

722
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:07,716
The door is open.

723
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,486
Oh, Gi Hyun!

724
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:12,788
Gi Hyun, are you okay?

725
00:42:13,075 --> 00:42:16,192
- It hurts too much.
- Gi Hyun, let me carry you.

726
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,106
(Emergency Center)

727
00:42:29,051 --> 00:42:31,407
- Ms. Tak Gi Hyun's guardian?
- That's me.

728
00:42:32,094 --> 00:42:33,509
Are you her husband?

729
00:42:33,622 --> 00:42:35,371
No, her husband is...

730
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:36,405
I'm her guardian.

731
00:42:36,863 --> 00:42:39,481
- She needs to get hospitalized.
- What's her problem?

732
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:41,016
Shock caused by low blood pressure.

733
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:44,019
Due to her retrieval today,
her ovary became swollen.

734
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,122
She suffered from severe bleeding,
so we must check how she recovers.

735
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:48,850
If she was a little late,

736
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:50,703
the inflammation could've led
to a serious situation.

737
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,628
Is she all over the hump?

738
00:42:56,152 --> 00:42:59,702
All right. Good. More.

739
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:01,557
More.

740
00:43:01,643 --> 00:43:04,859
There you go. More.

741
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:08,191
Two, three, four.

742
00:43:08,193 --> 00:43:11,080
One, two, three.

743
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:13,676
Thank you for the interview.

744
00:43:13,678 --> 00:43:15,884
Good work. What was your name again?

745
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,053
Sorry, I forgot to give you
my business card.

746
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:20,749
I'm Reporter Woo Gi Ja
of "Firefighter Monthly."

747
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:23,259
I've been working for 20 years now.
I'm like the AI in this field.

748
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:25,060
The living history.

749
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:28,030
History?

750
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:30,072
I have 25 years of experience.

751
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,035
Does that mean I'm the universe
in the photoshoot industry?

752
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:33,902
Excuse me then.

753
00:43:34,276 --> 00:43:35,337
- Well...
- Let's go that way.

754
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:39,773
He's too talkative.

755
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,944
I mean, no one reads
"Firefighter Monthly."

756
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:44,313
Moon Jung,
let's take some test shots.

757
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,614
Stand there.

758
00:43:51,293 --> 00:43:53,989
Excuse me. What time
will the shooting end today?

759
00:43:54,142 --> 00:43:55,391
I'm not sure.

760
00:43:55,393 --> 00:43:58,560
It's scheduled up to two,
but that's never happened before.

761
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,195
I guess after two.

762
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:02,531
I see.

763
00:44:09,719 --> 00:44:11,307
Hey.

764
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,477
Who's that guy?
He looks like a celebrity.

765
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,479
This is so exciting.

766
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:18,827
Hey, let's get started right away.

767
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:20,849
- Right away.
- The emergency team.

768
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:23,185
- Please get ready first.
- Nice. Okay.

769
00:44:23,433 --> 00:44:24,233
More.

770
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:28,023
Where are you, Oh Jung?

771
00:44:28,242 --> 00:44:30,392
- We're getting started soon.
- Hey, Gook Hee.

772
00:44:30,394 --> 00:44:31,760
Are you still in the bathroom?

773
00:44:31,926 --> 00:44:33,696
Something came up,
so I can't make it.

774
00:44:33,698 --> 00:44:34,630
What?

775
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:38,133
You don't have to worry about it.

776
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:39,735
Good luck with the shooting.

777
00:44:40,175 --> 00:44:41,637
Take some cool pictures for me.

778
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:43,472
- Bye.
- Oh Jung.

779
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:49,965
(Calendar photoshoot)

780
00:45:03,318 --> 00:45:05,508
(Husband)

781
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:10,766
The phone is turned off.
You'll be directed to...

782
00:45:13,207 --> 00:45:14,536
She called him 13 times.

783
00:45:17,473 --> 00:45:20,876
How could he not answer her calls
when she's this sick?

784
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,191
Gi Hyun.

785
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:39,261
You acted like you were all strong.

786
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:42,498
But you're so weak.

787
00:45:45,567 --> 00:45:46,902
You're so lonely.

788
00:45:58,612 --> 00:45:59,768
Oh, my.

789
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:01,717
Show off your arm muscles.
There you go.

790
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:02,598
Gosh, this is crazy.

791
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,680
Look at your nose ridge.

792
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:05,868
Open your shoulders.

793
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,857
There you go. This is crazy.

794
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:10,659
Very good.

795
00:46:10,672 --> 00:46:12,201
- Crazy.
- It's my first time.

796
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:14,396
It's okay. Goodness.

797
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,597
Goodness.

798
00:46:16,131 --> 00:46:17,299
You're good to go.

799
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:21,130
Goodness. Oh, gosh.

800
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:25,152
I feel like
I have boosters on my heels.

801
00:46:25,154 --> 00:46:26,875
I came super fast.

802
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:29,484
What?

803
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:33,849
(Ji Sung, take it
a little slow to come.)

804
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:37,453
Ms. Seo, this is an emergency.

805
00:46:37,455 --> 00:46:39,221
Please come here
as soon as possible.

806
00:46:40,389 --> 00:46:42,858
I told him not to contact me
on my day-off.

807
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,462
No, should I go in there early...

808
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:48,754
and behave naturally?

809
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:51,266
Ms. Seo?

810
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,168
Ok Dong Jin?

811
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:56,605
I texted you like ten seconds ago.
How did you come so fast?

812
00:46:56,732 --> 00:46:57,532
Well,

813
00:46:57,906 --> 00:46:59,942
I was passing by just in time.

814
00:47:06,068 --> 00:47:07,289
What are you doing outside?

815
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:09,823
This guy got heated,
so I'm out to cool it down.

816
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:10,759
Why?

817
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:13,455
My gosh, you're driving me crazy.

818
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:14,530
Crazy.

819
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,824
Very good.

820
00:47:15,826 --> 00:47:17,159
You drive me crazy.

821
00:47:17,161 --> 00:47:19,361
My gosh, it's crazy.

822
00:47:19,363 --> 00:47:22,064
Crazy. I love it.

823
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,200
That's why the battery is low.

824
00:47:26,021 --> 00:47:28,303
I asked her to stop...

825
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,765
saying crazy.

826
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:31,273
But she's doing it even more.

827
00:47:31,275 --> 00:47:33,542
- Crazy!
- Then turn it off.

828
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:36,845
My gosh. Oh, my. You drive me crazy.

829
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:38,914
What? Is the power button broken?

830
00:47:38,914 --> 00:47:41,149
You shouldn't have pressed it
too many times.

831
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:42,184
Where's the charger?

832
00:47:42,186 --> 00:47:44,453
I thought it'd be over soon,
so I didn't bring it.

833
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:51,627
Mr. Oh said he was okay
with everything,

834
00:47:51,629 --> 00:47:54,796
but he wanted a close-up shot
with this machine on.

835
00:47:54,957 --> 00:47:58,039
Nothing works without me,
doesn't it?

836
00:47:58,064 --> 00:47:59,672
Oh, my!

837
00:47:59,672 --> 00:48:01,392
Here.

838
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:03,879
It's unlocked now. You can do
whatever you'd like.

839
00:48:03,879 --> 00:48:05,242
- Ms. Seo,
- Yes?

840
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:07,611
- are you leaving right now?
- Yes.

841
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,684
- What?
- What?

842
00:48:09,709 --> 00:48:11,904
Yes. I have to leave.

843
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:14,772
You look amazing!

844
00:48:16,104 --> 00:48:17,843
Stunning!

845
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:19,249
My goodness.

846
00:48:19,274 --> 00:48:20,781
Hello.

847
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,933
Hello.

848
00:48:28,016 --> 00:48:30,016
I'm here for the camera.

849
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:35,021
I shouldn't have asked to meet up
today. I'm sorry.

850
00:48:35,021 --> 00:48:36,448
It's fine.

851
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:41,059
Mr. Jung Gook Hee, where are you?

852
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,980
- I'm right here.
- Please get ready.

853
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:46,867
- And the stylist over there!
- Sorry?

854
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:48,956
Please get makeup on him already.

855
00:48:48,956 --> 00:48:52,062
You need to do a good job on it.
You missed some spots in the back.

856
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:54,110
I'm not a stylist.

857
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,175
I'm here
for the thermovision camera.

858
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:59,445
Come on. You're the only one
who's late.

859
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,672
Quick.

860
00:49:49,463 --> 00:49:51,886
I think it's good now.

861
00:49:53,922 --> 00:49:55,374
Thanks.

862
00:50:00,194 --> 00:50:01,538
Look at that!

863
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:03,383
My goodness.

864
00:50:03,722 --> 00:50:05,480
This is too good.

865
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,637
I can't breathe.

866
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:09,637
Oh, my goodness.

867
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:13,141
He doesn't like having photos
of himself taken.

868
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:14,997
Is he okay with this?

869
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:17,091
Nice! That's awesome.

870
00:50:17,091 --> 00:50:19,443
Look at you!

871
00:50:19,443 --> 00:50:21,151
You look amazing.

872
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:25,348
Sir, you have a great face.

873
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:27,348
Why don't we take your helmet off?

874
00:50:27,407 --> 00:50:30,160
You can stand sideways
if you don't feel comfortable.

875
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,507
You can show off your nose
or jawline instead.

876
00:50:32,507 --> 00:50:35,413
I don't think people will recognize
your face from the side.

877
00:50:35,913 --> 00:50:37,806
I'll just keep the helmet on.

878
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:40,554
Come on.

879
00:50:40,554 --> 00:50:44,301
It's hard for me to get a good photo
when you're shooting on your own.

880
00:50:44,301 --> 00:50:46,198
All of the ones we have so far look
the same.

881
00:50:46,198 --> 00:50:48,198
Just trust me on this
and take the helmet off!

882
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:51,019
I'll just keep it on as we agreed on
in the first place.

883
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:53,980
I'll come up
with better poses instead.

884
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,335
I'm sorry.

885
00:50:56,115 --> 00:50:57,766
I can't say no to that.

886
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,938
Even your rejection sounds so kind.

887
00:51:04,189 --> 00:51:07,273
All right then.
Let's just keep going.

888
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:10,699
That looks great. Nice!

889
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:13,032
That's it!

890
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:14,595
Right on!

891
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:17,823
Please turn right. Just a little.

892
00:51:17,823 --> 00:51:19,639
You look awesome.

893
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:22,162
Please straighten
your shoulders out.

894
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,711
That's good. This is amazing.

895
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:27,858
Stay still!

896
00:51:27,858 --> 00:51:30,371
Tilt a little further.
This is too good!

897
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:36,132
This is awesome!

898
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:38,860
Firefighter Kang Sang Jun
has arrived.

899
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,449
- Hello.
- Hello.

900
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:41,880
Great work today.

901
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:45,625
- Hello.
- Hello.

902
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:48,237
- Mr. Kang?
- Yes?

903
00:51:48,237 --> 00:51:49,738
Do you remember me?

904
00:51:49,738 --> 00:51:53,491
I'm Reporter Woo. I interviewed
you for the Milhwa-dong case.

905
00:51:54,943 --> 00:51:57,896
I can't remember since it's been
too long.

906
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:04,535
I'm sorry. Please get out
of the way.

907
00:52:04,535 --> 00:52:07,406
What do I do?

908
00:52:08,156 --> 00:52:10,352
Glad to see you again, though.

909
00:52:10,352 --> 00:52:12,010
I understand.

910
00:52:12,548 --> 00:52:16,014
Mr. Kang, we'll start shooting
right away.

911
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,392
Mr. Gam.

912
00:52:56,728 --> 00:52:58,728
You're awake! Are you okay?

913
00:52:59,113 --> 00:53:01,560
Why are you still here?

914
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,813
I know you're busy.

915
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,747
I couldn't get in touch
with your husband yet.

916
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,544
That's because he's busy.

917
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:13,648
I'm fine on my own.
Why did you stay?

918
00:53:14,214 --> 00:53:17,591
Who's ever okay with being alone
when they're sick?

919
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:21,830
It's not like I'm dying.

920
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:29,238
Why are you holding my hand?

921
00:53:31,423 --> 00:53:33,360
I guess you're feeling better now.

922
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,248
You held my hands and begged me
to help you live.

923
00:53:36,248 --> 00:53:38,746
I'd take my hands out,
and you'd hold them again.

924
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,526
Thank you.

925
00:53:45,527 --> 00:53:47,394
I'm so sorry.

926
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:50,327
No need to feel sorry.

927
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,761
There's always next year.

928
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:54,619
You need to keep warm,

929
00:53:54,619 --> 00:53:56,179
so keep this on.

930
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,500
- It's fine.
- No. Come here.

931
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,010
The doctor said that you need
to keep your neck warm.

932
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:02,447
- I'm really fine.
- I'll wrap your neck for you.

933
00:54:02,905 --> 00:54:04,374
- I'm really fine.
- Just stay still.

934
00:54:04,374 --> 00:54:07,565
- It's a little too tight.
- As it should be.

935
00:54:07,565 --> 00:54:08,570
But I'm sick today.

936
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:10,129
This is really good, isn't it?

937
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:12,562
- Good work.
- Good work.

938
00:54:12,562 --> 00:54:14,493
You're all true heroes!

939
00:54:14,493 --> 00:54:17,802
- Great work, everyone!
- Good work.

940
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,023
Goodness.

941
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,445
- This was such a great shoot.
- Great work.

942
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:23,948
You can head home after cleaning up.

943
00:54:23,948 --> 00:54:25,779
- Don't be late tomorrow!
- Sir.

944
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,977
Could I get a look at the photos
from this camera, please?

945
00:54:33,653 --> 00:54:37,806
I'm Jung Jae Min and I used to live
in Milhwa-dong.

946
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:42,575
I go by Jung Gook Hee now.

947
00:54:43,874 --> 00:54:45,367
I see.

948
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,821
Is that right?

949
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:53,822
You're Firefighter
Jung Gook Hee now?

950
00:54:56,925 --> 00:54:58,591
I've been worried about you.

951
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,680
I'm so glad you've grown
into such a fine young man.

952
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:05,943
- You must've gone through so much.
- I still have a lot to learn.

953
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,296
I'll save this one.

954
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,691
I want to see the sideway shot.

955
00:55:10,691 --> 00:55:13,005
Is there anything that's more
front-facing?

956
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,562
- This one?
- Yes.

957
00:55:15,752 --> 00:55:18,696
I think this is a good one.

958
00:55:19,946 --> 00:55:22,824
How's your mother doing?

959
00:55:23,368 --> 00:55:25,856
She went through a lot too.

960
00:55:29,457 --> 00:55:31,109
Do you still live in Milhwa-dong?

961
00:55:33,648 --> 00:55:34,966
No.

962
00:55:37,176 --> 00:55:40,693
I can't believe that we met again.

963
00:55:40,826 --> 00:55:42,222
You were just a kid.

964
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:48,419
You've been through so much.
I'm glad you've grown so well.

965
00:55:48,419 --> 00:55:49,730
You're too kind.

966
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:54,733
Everything has been going too good
for me,

967
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:58,564
and I feel bad about it.

968
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:00,740
I'm sorry.

969
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:05,903
He's that kid from Milhwa-dong.

970
00:56:06,604 --> 00:56:07,904
Milhwa-dong?

971
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:09,834
Who?

972
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:14,501
Him. The guy who's talking
to Mr. Kang.

973
00:56:15,141 --> 00:56:17,757
And now he's being called
the strongest firefighter?

974
00:56:19,257 --> 00:56:21,457
How dare he represent firefighters?

975
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:23,754
He ruined someone's life.

976
00:56:43,029 --> 00:56:47,333
(It's been a while. Time flies,
and now you're the manager.)

977
00:56:59,146 --> 00:57:02,652
(Wife,
Hwang Ga Eul)

978
00:57:02,652 --> 00:57:05,553
(Hwang Ga Eul)

979
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:13,811
It's been a while, Winter 50.

980
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:16,567
It's been a while, Autumn 44.

981
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:25,575
(Please Don't Date Him)

982
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:28,827
(Thank you to Hong Yun Hwa
for making a special appearance.)

983
00:57:35,536 --> 00:57:37,414
I'm Kang Hyun Soo
and I'm Ha Ri's boyfriend.

984
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:39,986
You promised with me that you'd
break up with your boyfriend.

985
00:57:39,986 --> 00:57:42,114
What are you doing right now?
She's my girlfriend.

986
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:44,836
I'm sorry, but could you step out
for a moment?

987
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,767
I feel like I'm the only one
knocking at your door.

988
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:48,826
I won't call or text.

989
00:57:48,826 --> 00:57:49,975
Let's end this.

990
00:57:49,975 --> 00:57:52,897
- Are you saying you want a divorce?
- I mean...

991
00:57:52,897 --> 00:57:54,352
Is that your husband?

992
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:57,114
I missed you.

993
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:59,359
I can't continue on
with our relationship like this.

994
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:00,953
Let's end this.

995
00:58:00,953 --> 00:58:02,759
My goodness!

996
00:58:02,784 --> 00:58:05,793
You held my hand
because of the boar?

997
00:58:05,793 --> 00:58:06,590
No.

998
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:11,129
Jung Gook Hee. What's this man like?

999
00:58:11,129 --> 00:58:15,120
Will he be another heartbreak
in my life?
