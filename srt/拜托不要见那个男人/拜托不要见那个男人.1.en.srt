1
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:39,158
Guys, come with me.

2
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:41,059
Let's have some fun together.

3
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:42,899
Are you crazy?

4
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,529
Didn't you just invite us to your wedding in two weeks?

5
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:46,793
He is out of his mind.

6
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:50,245
Saturday at 11am in Gangnam? Why is it so early?

7
00:00:50,245 --> 00:00:53,514
You really need to stop going to all those sleazy places.

8
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,709
You're an addict.

9
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:56,709
That's not the only problem.

10
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:59,043
Saying he'll do everything he wants to do before getting married,

11
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:01,878
he took one of his part-timers to Wolma Island.

12
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:04,184
Gosh, you're crazy.

13
00:01:04,288 --> 00:01:05,744
If she's a part-timer, isn't she young?

14
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,459
She must be at least 20 years younger than you.

15
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:08,783
Hey, come on.

16
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:11,983
That's exactly why I took her.

17
00:01:12,388 --> 00:01:14,799
I told her I'd take her for a ride in a sports car,

18
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,498
and she got all excited.

19
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:17,868
She didn't even know it was a lease.

20
00:01:17,868 --> 00:01:19,469
Few expect...

21
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,734
to receive a piece of trash when they order a product.

22
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:25,034
Dating is the same.

23
00:01:25,238 --> 00:01:27,269
When you start going out with someone,

24
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:30,478
you don't expect to be fooled by that person.

25
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:31,903
Come with me, guys.

26
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,273
(Bluetooth earphones)

27
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,184
It's just that you never know...

28
00:01:41,418 --> 00:01:45,224
what the person is really like until you open the box.

29
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,554
Let's finish this and go. Cheers.

30
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:58,608
(Moon Jong Ho and Park Min Joo)

31
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,538
Is someone getting married on the Saturday after next at 11am?

32
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,079
The groom has a tattoo on his left wrist.

33
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,639
He drives a leased sports car,

34
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:06,079
runs a business, and is in his mid-30s.

35
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,748
The wedding will be in Gangnam.

36
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:08,819
(From Seoul to Wolma Island)

37
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:11,748
Reconsider marrying him.

38
00:02:11,748 --> 00:02:13,213
(New post, Share)

39
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:15,259
If you happen to know the bride,

40
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,784
please do let her know.

41
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,689
Right after inviting his friends to his wedding,

42
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:22,823
the man pestered his friends to come with him to sleazy bars.

43
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:25,399
He apparently even took one of his female part-timers...

44
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:28,963
to Wolma Island recently.

45
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:33,538
(Trash Detected)

46
00:02:33,538 --> 00:02:34,639
(Is the guy crazy?)

47
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,608
(A Psycho I Saw Today)

48
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:38,643
(This guy is clearly out of his mind.)

49
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,044
Sometimes,

50
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,843
you miraculously see through the person before it's too late.

51
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:47,418
(The wedding of Moon Jong Ho and Park Min Joo has been canceled.)

52
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,784
When that happens and you manage to avert misfortune,

53
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,724
you take a deep sigh...

54
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:56,494
and thank your ancestral spirits.

55
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,224
One day, my ancestral spirits...

56
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,263
came to my rescue.

57
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,604
(Please Don't Date Him)

58
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:10,808
Hi, Janggo.

59
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:12,009
(Episode 1, JSS Reload)

60
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,918
Pelican Electronics' speech recognition smart home appliances.

61
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:16,579
Ubiquitous and Innovative Development Team's new product...

62
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,984
to be released early next year.

63
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,684
Let me introduce to you, Janggo.

64
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,488
Janggo analyzes and categorizes...

65
00:03:24,488 --> 00:03:27,728
the behavior and consumption patterns of its users...

66
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:30,058
and informs the users...

67
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:33,624
of the most suitable dishes for them using words.

68
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,393
Here's Janggo.

69
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:38,668
Put your gender, age, and other information...

70
00:03:38,668 --> 00:03:40,868
along with your past meals in Janggo,

71
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:42,238
and it'll analyze your condition...

72
00:03:42,238 --> 00:03:45,248
and the ingredients in the fridge...

73
00:03:45,248 --> 00:03:49,073
and let you know the perfect dish for your next meal.

74
00:03:49,748 --> 00:03:51,519
Do you have to put in the information every time?

75
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,548
No. You just need to do it once.

76
00:03:53,548 --> 00:03:56,383
After that, Janggo will recognize you in personal mode.

77
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:57,889
(General Manager Oh Byung Gil,)

78
00:03:57,889 --> 00:03:58,959
(old fart, master of contradicting himself)

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,994
So I'll put in some information about me.

80
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:05,629
A woman in her 30s. Living in Gorae-dong.

81
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:08,399
Acting manager of R and D at Pelican Electronics.

82
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:11,738
I had an Americano and bagel set for lunch today.

83
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,174
Janggo, what should I have for dinner later?

84
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,773
You have warm iced water in your fridge.

85
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,118
You also have some eggs.

86
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:27,348
- 1, 2, 3, - What's going on?

87
00:04:27,348 --> 00:04:29,453
4, 5...

88
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:33,253
I'm sorry. It's a bug again.

89
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,554
It was working last night. Stop laughing.

90
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,298
(Ok Dong Jin, independent, believer in work-life balance)

91
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:40,368
Young people these days think...

92
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:42,794
all problems can be solved by saying sorry.

93
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:47,839
If I say that, you'll think I'm an old fart. So I won't.

94
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:50,639
It's okay. Maybe it's a good thing.

95
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,079
Do you think this is good enough?

96
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,019
In addition to recommending dishes,

97
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,048
it could even order delivery...

98
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,889
and recommend ingredients that suit the user's financial situation.

99
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:02,519
Even better if it's from our partners.

100
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,083
Shouldn't it at least do that much?

101
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:06,629
Am I wrong?

102
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,358
(Byun Ha Ri, manager's pet)

103
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:11,129
For all those services to work,

104
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:13,393
the personal information we have is not enough.

105
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,139
We need a lot more user data.

106
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,839
But it's tricky to obtain personal information these days.

107
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,908
(Manager Jegal Soo Won, planner with a big mouth, Team Byung Gil)

108
00:05:18,908 --> 00:05:21,279
No such negative words are allowed in our meetings.

109
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,108
Then I'll follow up on this project...

110
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:24,509
with Ms. Seo.

111
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:26,509
Mr. Jegal, but you don't know how to code.

112
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:29,048
Of course not. I majored in liberal arts.

113
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:31,488
Ms. Seo, I know you can pull this off.

114
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:33,148
Maybe you could ask the HR team...

115
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,184
for the employee information.

116
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:38,388
Well, there might be some privacy issues.

117
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:39,829
I know.

118
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:43,429
find a way to make use of personal information...

119
00:05:43,429 --> 00:05:45,493
without invading the customers' privacy.

120
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,738
(Assistant Manager Jo Yong Hwan, quiet, the only sane one)

121
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,394
How much time do you need?

122
00:05:49,939 --> 00:05:52,703
You should get it done before your honeymoon.

123
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:54,508
- Ms. Seo? - Yes?

124
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,304
Don't feel pressured. Just tell me how much time you need.

125
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,743
(Acting Manager Seo Ji Sung, breadwinner of the team, worker ant)

126
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:02,943
- I can meet the deadline. - I knew it.

127
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:05,914
Let's wrap up the meeting here.

128
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:09,154
- Thank you. - Thank you.

129
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,089
Where's the executive director's family's funeral later?

130
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:12,184
It's in Paju.

131
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:13,789
We should probably get going.

132
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,123
- We're finally getting together. - Let's drink.

133
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:17,794
Let's go.

134
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,564
What is it?

135
00:06:22,098 --> 00:06:23,934
You worked on it with me. Why did you laugh?

136
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:25,268
Because it was funny.

137
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,904
Gosh, I can't believe you.

138
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:28,804
I'm letting it slide...

139
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,144
Cleaning started.

140
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:32,909
You also have some eggs.

141
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:35,679
- 1, 2, - I really need to recharge.

142
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,684
3, 4, 5, 6...

143
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,128
In this day and age, that could lead to a lawsuit.

144
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:48,728
It has to reflect the customers' personal information accurately...

145
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:51,524
without invading their privacy?

146
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:53,799
What does that even mean?

147
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,638
So much of what he says is nonsense.

148
00:06:56,638 --> 00:06:58,969
Hasn't he changed at all since I left the company?

149
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:00,103
No.

150
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:06,108
Hey.

151
00:07:06,108 --> 00:07:09,113
Are you making juice with that alien-looking thing?

152
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:12,018
No. I'm making coffee, not juice.

153
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,213
I'm going to make a cappuccino with cactus and doenjang.

154
00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:18,223
She's definitely a bit of a pervert.

155
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:21,659
I don't give a darn about AI.

156
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:24,469
I just want the basic functions to work properly.

157
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:27,469
Who needs different-shaped ice cubes?

158
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:29,398
It only makes the fridge guzzle up electricity and breaks down.

159
00:07:29,398 --> 00:07:32,363
The person who came up with that should be fired.

160
00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:34,733
- It's me. - What?

161
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:37,434
I'm the one who came up with that.

162
00:07:40,108 --> 00:07:42,518
Do you think I don't get many customers...

163
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:44,014
because I'm too straightforward?

164
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:47,213
On the plus side, you don't get annoying customers either.

165
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,254
Sorry.

166
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,248
Gosh, why does this tiny cafe...

167
00:08:11,248 --> 00:08:13,243
need to be disinfected every two weeks?

168
00:08:13,778 --> 00:08:15,674
It's not like I get paid more to do this.

169
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:18,743
How many times have I disinfected this place already?

170
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:21,789
Who knows what kind of filthy riffraff come here?

171
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:23,784
I can't go a whole month without disinfecting the space.

172
00:08:25,228 --> 00:08:26,953
Do you grow aliens in your fridge?

173
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:29,123
I said the exact same thing.

174
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,839
Hey, is that your milk?

175
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,934
My gosh.

176
00:08:38,008 --> 00:08:40,534
I'm sorry. The milk at my place has gone bad.

177
00:08:42,108 --> 00:08:43,108
Ji Sung.

178
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,878
You talked about a fridge that tells you when a food item goes bad.

179
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:47,203
Have you not invented it yet?

180
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,243
Step up your game. I'm off.

181
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,394
I think something's up with her.

182
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:10,534
She's way too quiet today.

183
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:13,809
Whenever you see kids and Ye Seul too quiet,

184
00:09:13,809 --> 00:09:15,579
it means they're getting themselves into trouble.

185
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:16,934
I'm scared right now.

186
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:22,144
I know. A big storm is coming.

187
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:28,884
Dong Jin, let's keep it up.

188
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:31,358
- I'm leaving for the day. - What?

189
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:33,223
After that brutal meeting? You're leaving on the dot?

190
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,794
The new edition of my favorite game is coming out today.

191
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:39,863
The launch begins at 7pm, so I should head out now.

192
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,733
This is mine. I can take it, right?

193
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:44,593
I'll eat it while waiting in line.

194
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:47,764
Gosh. Ham and cheese, again?

195
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:53,943
I should live like that too.

196
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,343
(Chats)

197
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:02,819
(I love you too.)

198
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,953
(I changed my profile photo.)

199
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,073
Sorry, sweetie. I just saw your messages.

200
00:10:23,638 --> 00:10:24,878
I guess you're busy again.

201
00:10:24,878 --> 00:10:27,573
There are many things we need to discuss and decide on.

202
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:29,579
First, I'm going to send you...

203
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,044
a few options for the main photo we'll hang in the lobby.

204
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:34,644
(Sweetie)

205
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,123
I like all of them except for the second one.

206
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:48,134
What? I already put in an order for the second one.

207
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:51,634
Then why bother asking me? You had already made your choice.

208
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:56,103
I thought you'd like the one that I picked.

209
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:58,648
I told you that the left side of your face is prettier.

210
00:10:58,648 --> 00:11:00,743
The second one is the only photo that shows the left side.

211
00:11:02,648 --> 00:11:03,843
All right.

212
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,518
And we still need to find someone to sing at our wedding.

213
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:09,319
I told you that my colleagues...

214
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,154
had already promised me to do that.

215
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,128
Oh, really?

216
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:15,228
But all our parents and elders will be there,

217
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:18,463
so I don't want it to be like a silly event.

218
00:11:21,398 --> 00:11:23,199
There's a male voice choir at the college.

219
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,634
They sing reverent songs. They're pretty good. What do you think?

220
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:28,473
Sure. Let's do that then.

221
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:30,778
Then we've decided on everything.

222
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:32,373
You must be busy. Get back to work.

223
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:35,743
- I love you, babe. - Love you too.

224
00:11:40,348 --> 00:11:41,659
Why did I bother practicing the song?

225
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,853
I wanted to sing it at our wedding and surprise him.

226
00:12:13,018 --> 00:12:14,919
- My gosh. - We should call 119 Rescue.

227
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,014
- Yes, I'll call. - Okay, hurry.

228
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:20,083
- My goodness. - Is she going to be okay?

229
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:23,554
- Hello? There's been an accident. - Gosh.

230
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,598
- Please hurry. - Goodness.

231
00:12:26,598 --> 00:12:27,799
Tell them to hurry.

232
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:30,398
- Are they on their way? - My gosh.

233
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:31,664
What do we do?

234
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:35,203
Oh, dear.

235
00:12:37,608 --> 00:12:38,679
- Is she okay? - Gosh.

236
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,378
Someone's in the car.

237
00:12:41,378 --> 00:12:43,073
- Gosh, what should we do? - Do something!

238
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:46,743
- What's he doing? - What?

239
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:48,953
Hey!

240
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,514
Come, quick!

241
00:12:54,488 --> 00:12:56,953
Ma'am, can you hear me?

242
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:04,564
I'm in pain.

243
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,108
Help me.

244
00:13:07,108 --> 00:13:09,079
I'm from 119 Rescue Service. Don't worry.

245
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,473
I'll get you out.

246
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,514
Do you have family at home?

247
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:20,443
My mom... Gosh, this hurts.

248
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:24,254
What's my mom going to do if I die?

249
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:28,128
I'll get you out so your mother won't have to worry.

250
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,623
You'll feel the impact but stay with me. Okay?

251
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,473
(119 Rescue Service)

252
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,758
I'm firefighter Jung Guk Hee,

253
00:13:56,758 --> 00:13:57,959
from Gorae Fire Station's Life Safety Rescue Squad.

254
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,184
I made space for you to get her out.

255
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:01,059
She's conscious...

256
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,228
but is experiencing chest pain even though there is no bleeding,

257
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:04,528
so I'm suspecting internal hemorrhage.

258
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:05,764
Okay, thank you.

259
00:14:12,038 --> 00:14:15,034
You'll find another way out behind the building.

260
00:14:15,109 --> 00:14:16,379
- There's another route? - Yes.

261
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,738
It's a small road, so it won't show up on GPS.

262
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,278
It goes through the park, so you can avoid...

263
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:20,673
the main road and save time.

264
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,873
Okay.

265
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:30,883
Thank goodness.

266
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,823
1 million and 22!

267
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,863
1 million and 23.

268
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:44,169
I can do this. 1 million and 24!

269
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:45,264
Hey, you!

270
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:50,034
Did you tell me to come early so we could work out together?

271
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:53,403
Hey, I'm taking that photo in less than a month.

272
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:55,643
I can't waste even a minute.

273
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,714
One more.

274
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,814
- Nice posture. - Hey, can you...

275
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:01,954
Can you help me?

276
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:03,913
Help me, please!

277
00:15:06,088 --> 00:15:07,183
There!

278
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,454
Gosh, my goodness.

279
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:14,123
Hey, didn't you just get to work?

280
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,034
You look like you've responded to a few calls.

281
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,139
I helped a traffic accident victim on my way here.

282
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:19,869
Really? Are you all right?

283
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:22,534
Was there any announcement in the team's group chat?

284
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:26,444
That new smartphone you got at the end of last year.

285
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:29,078
Why don't you give it to me if you aren't going to use it?

286
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:30,474
Maybe I should really give it to you.

287
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:32,389
Can you please just download the chat app?

288
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,318
We mainly use it for the team to bond more,

289
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:36,954
but I can't be your messenger forever.

290
00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:38,823
Sorry.

291
00:15:39,588 --> 00:15:41,189
By the way, you're taking that photo with me.

292
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:42,593
How come you never work out?

293
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:44,754
You'll regret it big-time.

294
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:46,964
- Come here. - Don't.

295
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:48,268
- Come here. - Don't come near me.

296
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,439
- Take it off. - No.

297
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:50,568
- Just take it off. - No!

298
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,209
Come here. I'm going to do it.

299
00:15:52,209 --> 00:15:54,163
- No, don't! - Hey, come here!

300
00:15:55,709 --> 00:15:56,939
(27 hours before JSS reload)

301
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,373
Hi, Janggo.

302
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:00,449
Yes, go ahead.

303
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:03,048
Great. It's always perfect up to this point.

304
00:16:03,048 --> 00:16:04,314
Okay, good job.

305
00:16:04,518 --> 00:16:07,248
Now, I'm going to tell you the user's information.

306
00:16:07,248 --> 00:16:09,988
You just need to tell me what kinds of dishes you recommend, okay?

307
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:12,724
I'll start now. Okay, Janggo?

308
00:16:13,328 --> 00:16:16,929
All right, a female in her 30s. She lives in Gorae-dong...

309
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,823
and works for Pelican Electronics.

310
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,738
She has reflux esophagitis.

311
00:16:21,738 --> 00:16:23,833
She had a sandwich for dinner.

312
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:26,363
What should she have for breakfast tomorrow?

313
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:29,578
Please, please...

314
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:33,004
How about a sandwich and a strong cup of Americano?

315
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,573
Seriously!

316
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,173
For goodness' sake.

317
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,149
You can't get it right even once!

318
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,518
I told you she already had a sandwich.

319
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:42,659
And she has reflux esophagitis.

320
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:44,714
Why do you keep recommending coffee?

321
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,683
Ok Dong Jin, this jerk.

322
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:51,058
What on earth did he change to connect it...

323
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:52,969
with the health app?

324
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:54,964
It never works, not even once.

325
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:58,333
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

326
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,004
What should I do?

327
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:03,133
Gosh...

328
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,308
I'm so stressed out.

329
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:09,449
I'm burnt out. I mean, how can I not be?

330
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:11,944
I'm burnt out. So burnt out!

331
00:17:13,518 --> 00:17:14,683
I really am burnt out.

332
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,564
Janggo. Janggo!

333
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:35,873
Fire! Janggo is on fire!

334
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:38,903
Wait! What was it? Hold on! Hang on a second.

335
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:42,419
This is 119 Rescue Service, right? Janggo is on fire.

336
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,518
I'm calling from Pelican Electronics.

337
00:17:45,518 --> 00:17:47,349
Yes, please hurry. Janggo is on fire.

338
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:48,459
Okay, thank you.

339
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:51,853
Hold on. Where's the fire extinguisher? Wait.

340
00:17:52,659 --> 00:17:54,153
There it is!

341
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,629
A fire at 119-1 Gorae-dong.

342
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:00,593
A fire at 119-1 Gorae-dong.

343
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,964
119-1 is near here.

344
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:05,169
Let's go there right away.

345
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,333
Okay. Let's go there.

346
00:18:09,008 --> 00:18:11,774
Gorae-dong 119-1, we're coming to the scene.

347
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:14,304
Requesting assistance from the Fire Team.

348
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:16,573
Come on.

349
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,889
The navigation isn't working properly.

350
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,048
Open the navigation app.

351
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,459
Okay. Enter the alley.

352
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,883
- Over there? - Yes.

353
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:31,454
As soon as you enter, turn left at the small corner over there.

354
00:18:35,768 --> 00:18:36,933
Turn right.

355
00:18:40,139 --> 00:18:41,863
- Now turn left. - Okay.

356
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:44,873
Turn right.

357
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:54,183
(119 for Fire, Rescue, and Emergency)

358
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,353
- I'll follow you. - Okay!

359
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:00,859
Hold on a second. Hold on!

360
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:02,459
A fire is breaking out, Janggo.

361
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,754
I should stop the fire, Janggo.

362
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,599
Come on!

363
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:08,064
I should take this out.

364
00:19:08,328 --> 00:19:09,564
Gosh.

365
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,423
Thank you.

366
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:46,633
Pelican Electronics' Mystery, Hwang Ga Eul.

367
00:19:47,109 --> 00:19:49,278
Nobody knows her position and duty exactly.

368
00:19:49,278 --> 00:19:51,504
The one in the middle of all sorts of strange rumors.

369
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,343
Have you heard her voice?

370
00:19:58,179 --> 00:19:59,343
Oh, no!

371
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:01,044
Are you okay?

372
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:03,318
- Are you okay? - Hot coffee was spilled on her arm,

373
00:20:03,318 --> 00:20:05,083
but she didn't scream at all.

374
00:20:05,758 --> 00:20:08,323
- What's her job exactly? - I don't know.

375
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,129
The rumor says she's a secret mistress of the CEO.

376
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:12,964
- Really? - No way.

377
00:20:13,099 --> 00:20:16,969
Why did I get caught by her of all?

378
00:20:16,969 --> 00:20:20,109
It's obvious my performance review will be bad as I get married.

379
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,234
What if I have a disadvantage for this?

380
00:20:36,018 --> 00:20:38,484
- Did you call to report a fire? - Yes.

381
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:42,653
Are you okay?

382
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,194
Yes.

383
00:20:45,268 --> 00:20:46,363
Liu?

384
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:48,964
It's all burnt.

385
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:54,369
It's all burnt. It can't be burnt.

386
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,538
I called you earlier.

387
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:57,308
It would've been fine if I had put out the fire right away,

388
00:20:57,308 --> 00:20:59,078
but the pin on the fire extinguisher wouldn't come out.

389
00:20:59,078 --> 00:21:02,314
So someone came and put it out.

390
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:04,149
But I should've done it faster.

391
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:05,919
But the safety pin didn't work.

392
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,244
So I did this, but...

393
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:12,288
You can't hold the fire extinguisher like that to pull the safety pin.

394
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,383
Sorry?

395
00:21:13,528 --> 00:21:14,784
Would you like to hand it to me?

396
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:17,224
Here.

397
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,224
You can't hold it like this.

398
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,494
Hold here and just pull it.

399
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,903
So it's not broken? Then...

400
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,913
Oh, no! I'm sorry!

401
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,224
What do I do? I'm so sorry!

402
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,893
I'm not exactly okay.

403
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:54,728
But...

404
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,794
I'm so sorry.

405
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:59,333
Now you will never forget how to use a fire extinguisher.

406
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:02,709
Although the fire is put out,

407
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,804
I'd like to check it before the Fire Team comes.

408
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,073
Please. Thank you.

409
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:16,514
The power distribution board got overheated and caused the fire.

410
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:17,814
Sorry?

411
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,123
I don't think there was an external impact on the machine.

412
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:23,524
Seriously!

413
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:26,494
I guess there was an excess current inside.

414
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:29,768
I assembled the parts from the existing model...

415
00:22:29,768 --> 00:22:31,538
and was testing the prototype.

416
00:22:31,538 --> 00:22:34,469
If you connect a computer here...

417
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,978
and install an AI program,

418
00:22:35,978 --> 00:22:37,838
there could be an excess current inside the fridge,

419
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:40,379
which is stronger than what it's used to be.

420
00:22:40,379 --> 00:22:41,544
But...

421
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,649
But it's boring, isn't it?

422
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:47,214
You wouldn't be interested in it.

423
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,613
It's fascinating, actually.

424
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:51,058
So you made this...

425
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:53,859
like you would assemble...

426
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:55,954
- block toys, right? - You're right!

427
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:00,869
I think you should clean up this place.

428
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:03,469
Right! Kane will do it.

429
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,564
Just a second. Hi, Kane!

430
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:08,234
I'll clean up the dust.

431
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:10,478
This guy works in the same way with this fridge.

432
00:23:10,478 --> 00:23:12,548
An AI program is installed here,

433
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,109
so if you select the type of dust,

434
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:16,078
Kane will clean up by itself. Look.

435
00:23:16,078 --> 00:23:18,413
Hi, Kane. Powder from the extinguisher.

436
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,383
There are no matching data.

437
00:23:21,518 --> 00:23:23,413
Powder from the extinguisher.

438
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,024
There are no matching data.

439
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,554
It worked fine until yesterday.

440
00:23:29,828 --> 00:23:31,694
I guess it's not working for now.

441
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:33,363
I didn't mean cleaning up the floor.

442
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,639
I meant your hair and clothes.

443
00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:36,794
Right.

444
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,034
- I'll get going. - Okay.

445
00:23:45,109 --> 00:23:46,504
Thank you.

446
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:50,014
I'm sorry.

447
00:23:53,449 --> 00:23:56,853
Seriously... Janggo!

448
00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:00,959
Hey! I'm the one who is angry, why did you catch fire?

449
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:02,528
You're driving me crazy.

450
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,028
It's all burnt.

451
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:06,568
It will take at least three days to replace it!

452
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:07,964
I hate this company!

453
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:11,764
Seriously!

454
00:24:11,838 --> 00:24:14,209
This is a disaster!

455
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:15,903
Did I look like this the whole time?

456
00:24:19,508 --> 00:24:20,879
I guess the fire is put out.

457
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:23,478
I heard they used a fire extinguisher.

458
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:24,613
I'm glad to hear that.

459
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,814
Are you the owner of the cafe?

460
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:30,018
Yes.

461
00:24:30,018 --> 00:24:32,328
There are many unique menus.

462
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:33,389
Yes.

463
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,288
If you don't mind,

464
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:37,923
can I have Curry Yuzu Juice?

465
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,163
I'm sorry. I'm closing at nine.

466
00:24:41,268 --> 00:24:43,893
But it's 8:55 now.

467
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:47,264
If I make it and clean up, it'll be over nine.

468
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:49,838
You're so accurate with time.

469
00:24:49,838 --> 00:24:51,534
For a person who is not a fire official like me.

470
00:24:51,639 --> 00:24:53,343
My husband is a public official.

471
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:56,444
Excuse...

472
00:24:58,778 --> 00:25:02,014
She's self-centered for the worker in the service sector.

473
00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:03,984
She's charming.

474
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:07,058
- I'm done with the building. - Well done.

475
00:25:07,058 --> 00:25:08,883
But why is your face so wet?

476
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:11,558
Something got on my face.

477
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:14,669
Hey, but this cafe has many unique menus.

478
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:16,338
It's a perfect place for a person like me...

479
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,169
who doesn't drink to prevent muscle loss...

480
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:20,008
and doesn't take caffeine for health.

481
00:25:20,008 --> 00:25:22,163
Is the owner a woman?

482
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,274
You know me too well.

483
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:28,474
I will have a drink here someday.

484
00:25:28,748 --> 00:25:31,214
"Natural Table".

485
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:33,014
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

486
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,954
Sweetie!

487
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:42,494
What? Sweetie! Why are you here?

488
00:25:46,328 --> 00:25:47,494
Sweetie!

489
00:25:48,498 --> 00:25:50,068
What's the matter?

490
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:51,833
You said you're working overtime but didn't pick up my call.

491
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,804
Are you a cleaning lady or what?

492
00:25:56,578 --> 00:25:58,833
No, there was an accident.

493
00:25:58,838 --> 00:26:01,008
Why did you come unannounced?

494
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:03,974
You can't say that to a person who came to pick you up as he's worried.

495
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:08,444
I don't know what happened, but wash up quickly and come out.

496
00:26:08,488 --> 00:26:10,984
It's not like the country is at stake, why working all night?

497
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,524
I can't. I'm not done yet.

498
00:26:13,828 --> 00:26:15,284
What on earth is that?

499
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,859
That one? It's a fridge.

500
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:20,469
If I make it by assembling the parts, it becomes a fridge.

501
00:26:20,469 --> 00:26:22,399
Then I install a program,

502
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:23,738
and input user information,

503
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:26,333
- it recommends a menu for the user. - Have you tried mine then?

504
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,673
No, not yet.

505
00:26:32,578 --> 00:26:34,573
I'm disappointed.

506
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,274
You should've tried your boyfriend's information first.

507
00:26:39,219 --> 00:26:42,383
I keep a clear line between my work and private life.

508
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:45,784
You go home first.

509
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:48,254
Okay.

510
00:26:48,528 --> 00:26:51,298
Do as much as you want when you can do it.

511
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:53,923
You won't be able to do it after getting married anyway.

512
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:03,873
Right.

513
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:06,343
You can't come to the gathering tomorrow looking like this.

514
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,044
Tomorrow?

515
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:10,413
Did you forget?

516
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,413
The gathering of dentists from Hanguk University?

517
00:27:13,288 --> 00:27:14,488
Right. GDH?

518
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,159
I told you not to call it like that.

519
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,459
- GDH? - Stop it.

520
00:27:17,459 --> 00:27:21,228
Why? You're the one who said it's funny and taught me.

521
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:22,328
I didn't forget.

522
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:23,899
We're going to a bar and have fun.

523
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:25,024
Yes.

524
00:27:25,058 --> 00:27:27,629
I got lots of information about what we need for our wedding from them,

525
00:27:27,629 --> 00:27:29,338
and they're the ones I talk to the most.

526
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:30,899
So I think you should come for me.

527
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,469
Okay. I will.

528
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,738
It's too late. Go home.

529
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:35,808
Okay.

530
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,409
- I'll go first. - Okay.

531
00:27:37,409 --> 00:27:38,804
- Don't be too late. - I got some work to do.

532
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,278
- Don't go home too late. - Okay.

533
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:41,444
- Go. - Text me.

534
00:27:41,709 --> 00:27:43,143
No.

535
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:46,214
- Okay. Finish it quickly and go. - Okay.

536
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,714
- I'm going. - Bye.

537
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:59,224
(24 hours before JSS reload)

538
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,974
(Don't work too late. Go home soon.)

539
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:43,439
(Completing synchronization)

540
00:28:43,439 --> 00:28:46,244
I told you not to worry.

541
00:28:50,318 --> 00:28:52,883
What? It's already done?

542
00:28:52,949 --> 00:28:56,214
Did I start it before I messaged him?

543
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,828
I'm so out of it because I didn't get much sleep.

544
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:02,954
Let's see.

545
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:25,173
Janggo.

546
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:28,014
If Mr. Oh...

547
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:32,083
finds out tomorrow that I started a fire...

548
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,488
and made a mess in the office,

549
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:36,494
he'll give me a hard time.

550
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:38,798
So please get your act together...

551
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:41,994
so we can both win some points tomorrow.

552
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:44,162
Okay? Please?

553
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:51,333
Hi, Janggo.

554
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:53,774
Yes, go ahead.

555
00:29:55,778 --> 00:29:58,078
A man in his 50s experiencing male menopause symptoms.

556
00:29:58,078 --> 00:30:01,484
He lives in Hasil-dong and has worked for an IT company for years.

557
00:30:02,048 --> 00:30:05,454
For dinner, he had... He went to a funeral,

558
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:06,889
so he had spicy beef soup.

559
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:09,254
What should he eat tomorrow?

560
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:21,421

561
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:28,778
I recommend almond milk and egg salad for your breakfast tomorrow,

562
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:29,944
Mr. Oh Byung Gil.

563
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,244
Janggo, you did it?

564
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:36,459
My gosh, look at you.

565
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,683
The fire must've taught you a lesson.

566
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:40,954
Hold on.

567
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,393
Did he say "Oh Byung Gil" earlier?

568
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:46,929
Janggo said his name?

569
00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:48,863
(Almond milk and egg salad for Mr. Oh Byung Gil)

570

(Corporate credit card)

571
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:55,879
Mr. Oh struggles to draw a line between work and personal matters...

572
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:58,173
because he's softhearted and social.

573
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:01,873
His corporate credit card is the card he uses most often.

574
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,248
In the past month, the card was most frequently used...

575
00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:06,814
at Goguryeo Hotel.

576
00:31:06,988 --> 00:31:08,083
What?

577
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,588
What is this?

578
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:13,783
Why is it showing data that I never entered?

579
00:31:13,829 --> 00:31:16,294
Did Mr. Oh really connect it with HR's database?

580
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,564
But my computer never received access.

581
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,309
Let's see when the transactions were made. It's 7pm today...

582
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,438
at the sauna at Goguryeo Hotel. Then the hotel buffet at 8pm.

583
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:30,838
And the bar at the hotel at 11pm.

584
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:32,108
He said he was going to a funeral.

585
00:31:32,108 --> 00:31:35,473
Why did he go to a hotel sauna?

586
00:31:38,838 --> 00:31:42,749
Let's see when the transactions were made. It's 7pm today...

587
00:31:42,749 --> 00:31:45,719
at the sauna at Goguryeo Hotel. Then the hotel buffet at 8pm.

588
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,143
And the bar at the hotel at 11pm.

589
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:48,648
He said he was going to a funeral.

590
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:51,853
Why did he go to a hotel sauna?

591
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:55,853
Hi, Janggo.

592
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,929
A man in his 20s. He lives in Gorae-dong...

593
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,194
and works for an IT company. He's a new hire.

594
00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:03,964
I'll eat it while waiting in line.

595
00:32:04,438 --> 00:32:06,869
He had a sandwich and orange juice for dinner.

596
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:08,364
What should he eat tomorrow?

597
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:12,639
How about a warm bowl of soybean sprout soup with rice,

598
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,008
Mr. Ok Dong Jin?

599
00:32:14,008 --> 00:32:16,103
What? Ok Dong Jin?

600
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,444
Janggo said the name again.

601
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,889
(Notification, Details of Expenditures)

602
00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:23,789
Mr. Ok Dong Jin is an early adopter who highly values his personal time.

603
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:27,659
At 7pm, he purchased the new edition of a game that came out today.

604
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,654
Then at 8:30pm, he watched a movie that was released today.

605
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,199
He maintains a healthy work-life balance.

606
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,924
This is real-time data.

607
00:32:35,568 --> 00:32:36,734
What's going on?

608
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:38,893
What's with Janggo?

609
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:43,533
(13 hours before JSS reload)

610
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:54,444
Gosh, my back.

611
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:56,884
My back is killing me.

612
00:32:59,219 --> 00:33:01,084
I worked all night,

613
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:05,524
so I look awful right now.

614
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:07,294
I should go wash up.

615
00:33:12,338 --> 00:33:14,309
Hey, did you log into Janggo's backend...

616
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:15,969
using your admin account after work yesterday?

617
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:17,404
No, why would I?

618
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,103
Is that even possible?

619
00:33:19,978 --> 00:33:23,174
Right, you'd never do that after work anyway.

620
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:31,314
By any chance, did you watch a movie in Yongsan last night?

621
00:33:31,688 --> 00:33:33,453
Oh, were you there too?

622
00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:35,723
Gosh, I guess everyone knows that place now.

623
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:38,353
You actually went there last night?

624
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:40,694
Aren't you asking because you saw me there?

625
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:47,904
(Ubiquitous and Innovative Development Team)

626
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:50,438
Ji Sung, I'm disappointed in you.

627
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:52,174
Is this all you can do?

628
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,478
You even caused trouble last night.

629
00:33:54,478 --> 00:33:57,179
Now you're saying you need more time? What am I supposed to do?

630
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,219
I kept dissecting and reworking the code all night long...

631
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:02,688
- but couldn't figure it out. - Why are you all quiet?

632
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:05,353
- I know Dong Jin's data is real. - Are you too ashamed?

633
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,128
Mr. Oh, I'm not trying to defend her,

634
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:09,999
- but her performance... - So,

635
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,898
if Mr. Oh's data is also real,

636
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:15,199
it means we have an algorithm in the server that can figure out...

637
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,999
and even analyze everyone's personal credit card transactions...

638
00:34:18,999 --> 00:34:20,703
and messages in their messengers.

639
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:22,838
That is a big problem.

640
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:25,108
I'd say this is a bigger problem.

641
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:27,303
- Right. - Mr. Oh.

642
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:29,913
What?

643
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:33,214
Someone saw you at Goguryeo Hotel last night.

644
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,659
The person told me you went to the sauna, the buffet,

645
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:38,913
and even the bar there.

646
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:42,683
Did you use your corporate credit card?

647
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:50,294
No.

648
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,774
Ha Ri, did you check all the paperwork I gave you?

649
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:06,884
Hey, Soo Won.

650
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:10,353
Is she trying to blackmail me because I've been picking at her?

651
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:12,584
Seems like it.

652
00:35:14,389 --> 00:35:15,823
I mean, look at that face.

653
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:18,194
She looks so determined.

654
00:35:18,628 --> 00:35:20,163
But how did she know?

655
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:21,893
Did someone really see me?

656
00:35:22,769 --> 00:35:24,769
Hey, everyone stayed up all night at the funeral.

657
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,438
If people find out that we went to the hotel...

658
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:27,539
after stopping by at the funeral,

659
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,303
we'll get on the wrong side of the executive director.

660
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:32,734
Maybe we should've just denied it flat out.

661
00:35:33,008 --> 00:35:35,473
We were too intimidated earlier.

662
00:35:36,648 --> 00:35:38,444
Why are you crying?

663
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:41,344
I'm not crying. This is because my eyes are so dry.

664
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:43,553
- Even now, I see your tears. Stop. - No.

665
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:46,953
Hold on. Maybe I should just play dumb. She has no proof.

666
00:35:48,128 --> 00:35:49,829
Even if there's no proof...

667
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,053
You know...

668
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:53,564
You know about that forum, right?

669
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:57,039
Yes, it's where people anonymously post about random rumors.

670
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,163
That's right.

671
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,409
If anyone mentions your name and says that you use...

672
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,203
your corporate card for personal stuff, you'll be in big trouble.

673
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,079
Gosh, Internal Affairs...

674
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,373
will check that forum, right?

675
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:09,444
Of course, they will.

676
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:15,114
Let's not mess with her for the time being.

677
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:18,154
You said we should use my corporate credit card.

678
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,559
Hey, what are you talking about?

679
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,889
- Listen. Hear me out. - You said we should use the card.

680
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,258
I told you to just put the bill from the sauna on that card,

681
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:28,028
but you got all excited and even used it at the bar.

682
00:36:28,028 --> 00:36:29,123
Whatever!

683
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:31,499
It was your idea. I'm off.

684
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:32,699
You're hurting my feelings here.

685
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:35,004
- You jerk! Don't do this to me. - Hey.

686
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:47,183
Gosh, what is this? What on earth is this?

687
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:50,884
An eggplant cacao smoothie with perilla oil.

688
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,584
Isn't it good?

689
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:55,453
No, it tastes awful. Do not sell this.

690
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:56,754
You'd better listen to me.

691
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:05,068
Here he comes again.

692
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:06,639
Didn't you say...

693
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,338
- he lives in his friend's house? - Yes.

694
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:12,409
- But did he have to drive that car? - Right in front of the company.

695
00:37:12,409 --> 00:37:14,749
You can tell immediately that he isn't the one.

696
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,508
But why can't Ye Seul see it?

697
00:37:16,508 --> 00:37:18,949
When did she ever listen to us?

698
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:21,849
You're right. If she listened to us,

699
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:25,183
she wouldn't have met only those kinds of guys throughout her life.

700
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,823
- Hi. - Hi.

701
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,728
Come on, Ye Seul.

702
00:37:35,728 --> 00:37:37,033
It's okay.

703
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,864
It's because I don't want to see it.

704
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,369
- Hey. - Yes?

705
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:45,703
Why does he drive that car in the neighborhood?

706
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,378
It's not a neighborhood.

707
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:49,944
We took the afternoon off and took a drive to the suburbs.

708
00:37:50,648 --> 00:37:52,274
You know,

709
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,148
there are people who have cars with noisy engines like that,

710
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,188
showing off his presence, right?

711
00:37:58,188 --> 00:37:59,818
I think...

712
00:37:59,818 --> 00:38:02,458
they have low self-esteem,

713
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:05,829
and this area is generally empty.

714
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:07,168
I have a preconception.

715
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:08,294
Hey.

716
00:38:08,728 --> 00:38:10,334
It's just because the engine is big.

717
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:12,539
And if he has a car like that anyway,

718
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,834
isn't it economical to drive it for many occasions?

719
00:38:15,438 --> 00:38:17,803
You and your weird logic again.

720
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,278
Those who have a lot, those who really have everything...

721
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,844
would practice noblesse oblige.

722
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:25,818
Noble what?

723
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:27,389
Is it a matchmaking company?

724
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,544
Never mind.

725
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:31,484
He does care a lot about Ye Seul though.

726
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,088
Of course.

727
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:35,059
He's the only one who buys me...

728
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:38,754
Goguryeo Hotel's mango bingsu every day.

729
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,999
Considering his dedication, I'm going to invest in his business.

730
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:43,163
What?

731
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:44,999
What do you think?

732
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,933
- Seriously... - Unbelievable.

733
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:50,303
I knew something was up when you were being too quiet.

734
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:52,639
Hey, did you forget that you were fired from Pelican Electronics...

735
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:54,504
because you guaranteed your exes' debt?

736
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,179
How can you say that when you're working at a disinfecting company...

737
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:58,878
after studying design?

738
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,413
Sang Hoon is different.

739
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:03,188
The guy he knows well said...

740
00:39:03,188 --> 00:39:04,588
he will return 100 times what he invested.

741
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:06,559
It's exactly what a swindler would say.

742
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:08,188
One, a guy he knows. Two, investment.

743
00:39:08,188 --> 00:39:10,694
Three, he will return more than what you invested. You can't.

744
00:39:11,128 --> 00:39:12,228
Never mind. Don't get mad.

745
00:39:12,228 --> 00:39:13,699
She doesn't even have money to lend.

746
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:15,464
- Your credit is bad. - Right.

747
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:18,798
Talking about that...

748
00:39:18,798 --> 00:39:22,564
Can you lend me 20,000 dollars?

749
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:25,579
Just 20,000 dollars. Please.

750
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:27,249
- Please. - What are you doing?

751
00:39:27,249 --> 00:39:28,679
- Please. - Gosh.

752
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,619
- Gosh! - Stop it!

753
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:31,679
- Hey! - It's so weird.

754
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:33,119
- It's really weird. - Hey, you're really crazy.

755
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,688
- Did he ask you to borrow money? - Get it together.

756
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:37,159
He really is not the one for you.

757
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:39,188
- Right. - He's the worst guy you've met.

758
00:39:39,188 --> 00:39:40,458
He's the worst. The worst.

759
00:39:40,458 --> 00:39:43,628
Why? It's just because I want to lend him money.

760
00:39:43,628 --> 00:39:47,028
Hey, do you know the top three things you should quit?

761
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:48,168
Eating chicken mayo, tuna mayo,

762
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,393
and meeting a guy like him!

763
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,969
You really should listen to us this time.

764
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:54,539
No, you're wrong.

765
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:56,139
It's eating chicken mayo, tuna mayo,

766
00:39:56,139 --> 00:39:59,303
and telling others how to live their life!

767
00:39:59,378 --> 00:40:00,904
If you don't want to lend me money, forget it!

768
00:40:02,409 --> 00:40:03,973
- Get out. - Get out.

769
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:05,743
Why? I don't want to.

770
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:07,588
This is refreshing.

771
00:40:07,588 --> 00:40:09,814
- Let me see it. - Hey, what do you think?

772
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:18,223
It's fascinating, isn't it?

773
00:40:18,528 --> 00:40:21,663
I gave up on Ye Seul a long time ago.

774
00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:22,964
Hi, Janggo.

775
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:24,539
- Yes. - Let me see.

776
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:28,234
Where did that data come from?

777
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:31,174
When will he work?

778
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:34,703
- Why? - Ji Sung.

779
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:37,073
I was too careless earlier.

780
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:40,114
If you can't lend me 20,000 dollars, how about 10,000?

781
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,749
If you don't,

782
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,559
I need to put my house up for collateral.

783
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,053
Ye Seul, wake up.

784
00:40:48,929 --> 00:40:51,893
How can I not tell you how to live when you're acting like this?

785
00:40:51,929 --> 00:40:54,429
Honestly, a 34-year-old guy...

786
00:40:54,429 --> 00:40:56,298
talking about being a golf instructor...

787
00:40:56,298 --> 00:40:58,433
and buying you mango bingsu every night.

788
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,409
And what's the conclusion? He's asking you to lend him money.

789
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:04,174
You don't even realize that and want to take out a loan for him?

790
00:41:04,338 --> 00:41:07,643
Spicy rice noodle soup would be perfect for you, Mr. Jung Sang Hoon.

791
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,719
Your net assets are already at a minus,

792
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:15,249
but you spent a lot and took out many loans.

793
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:16,344
What's this?

794
00:41:18,188 --> 00:41:20,013
I'm hanging up.

795
00:41:23,228 --> 00:41:24,398
Let me see.

796
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,958
(Deposit, Seo Eun Mi, 50,000 dollars)

797
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:28,893
He also borrowed 50,000 dollars from a woman called Seo Eun Mi.

798
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:33,634
And he's going to borrow money from a woman called Oh Jin Young?

799
00:41:34,508 --> 00:41:37,504
And he still tries to borrow money from Ye Seul?

800
00:41:38,608 --> 00:41:40,904
This guy is a total jerk!

801
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:42,973
Wait.

802
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:46,444
The fact that I'm getting this data means...

803
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,019
Hold it. Go forward.

804
00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:52,384
It means it's not from human resources.

805
00:41:56,228 --> 00:41:57,353
What's this?

806
00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:03,094
(Deposit, Seo Eun Mi, 50,000 dollars)

807
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:07,803
Ji Sung.

808
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:10,639
I had no idea you would lend me money.

809
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:11,973
I was just throwing it out there.

810
00:42:12,608 --> 00:42:14,778
Yes. I'm always the one who is fooled by you.

811
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:17,143
I'm always the stupid one.

812
00:42:17,878 --> 00:42:19,913
But why did you want me to meet you here?

813
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:22,548
It's because your boyfriend Sang Hoon...

814
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:25,559
is supposed to meet a woman called Oh Jin Young here.

815
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,289
It's because Gi Hyun will tell me off...

816
00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:31,053
if she knows about lending you money.

817
00:42:33,128 --> 00:42:34,794
You're really meticulous.

818
00:42:35,528 --> 00:42:38,398
Forget it. Where is Sang Hoon again?

819
00:42:38,398 --> 00:42:40,064
He went to meet his investor.

820
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,834
She's a super-rich from China.

821
00:42:43,168 --> 00:42:44,873
Her name is Wang Xie Feng or something.

822
00:42:45,378 --> 00:42:46,533
Is that so?

823
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:48,079
(You have a new message.)

824
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,309
Have a drink.

825
00:42:49,309 --> 00:42:53,743
(Sweetie: What time can you come today?)

826
00:42:53,749 --> 00:42:54,844
Did you forget?

827
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:56,619
The gathering of dentists from Hanguk University?

828
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:57,818
Right.

829
00:42:57,818 --> 00:42:59,084
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

830
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,683
I'm still working.

831
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,853
So I can't tell you the exact time.

832
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:09,964
Ye Seul. Now...

833
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:12,794
- Do you want to switch seats? - What?

834
00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:15,163
Isn't he Sang Hoon over there?

835
00:43:15,168 --> 00:43:16,263
What?

836
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:19,008
You're right. Sang Hoon...

837
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:20,803
Hey, hey. Stay still.

838
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,944
Is Wang Xie Feng that young?

839
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,114
Ye Seul, let's move to that table. Act natural.

840
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:29,389
Bring your coffee. Quickly.

841
00:43:29,389 --> 00:43:31,154
Act natural. Follow me.

842
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:33,254
Okay? Follow me.

843
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:35,323
Ji Sung.

844
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:51,004
Sang Hoon. Why didn't you answer my call this morning?

845
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:54,504
I was meeting an investor.

846
00:43:54,508 --> 00:43:57,044
There's a woman called Wang Xie Feng from China.

847
00:43:57,349 --> 00:43:59,513
She came all the way to Korea...

848
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:01,643
to invest in my business.

849
00:44:02,889 --> 00:44:04,619
Says the guy who took a drive...

850
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,783
to the suburbs this morning.

851
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:09,183
Here.

852
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,228
I want to invest more,

853
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:12,893
but that's all I got...

854
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:15,694
after getting you the red car.

855
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:17,294
What?

856
00:44:17,568 --> 00:44:19,234
Is she the one who bought him that car?

857
00:44:24,139 --> 00:44:26,674
What are you doing? Stop it.

858
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:31,944
You had this much even after buying the car?

859
00:44:33,219 --> 00:44:35,783
You're really frugal, my princess.

860
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,688
You know it's for our wedding, right?

861
00:44:38,688 --> 00:44:39,884
Of course I know.

862
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:44,199
Then shall we plan our wedding...

863
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,728
on this tablet PC you got me?

864
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:46,893
Shall we?

865
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:48,723
- Let's see. - Hold on.

866
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,964
Isn't that the one you got him before?

867
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:56,834
This is crazy.

868
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:58,603
Did you already make a spreadsheet for it?

869
00:44:59,338 --> 00:45:03,143
I'm so proud of you, my princess.

870
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:05,849
Didn't he call you "my princess" as well?

871
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:08,789
He's doing the exact same thing to her and asking for her money.

872
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,814
He did the exact same thing to you!

873
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,353
Ye Seul, what's the matter?

874
00:45:14,528 --> 00:45:16,783
This one is...

875
00:45:23,469 --> 00:45:24,794
What's the matter?

876
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,174
Who is she?

877
00:45:31,778 --> 00:45:32,933
What?

878
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:40,984
I'm Wang Xie Feng.

879
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:43,219
Have you eaten,

880
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:44,584
you son of a gun!

881
00:45:45,858 --> 00:45:47,458
I said, who is she?

882
00:45:47,458 --> 00:45:48,553
What?

883
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:51,094
And who is she?

884
00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:52,924
What?

885
00:45:56,228 --> 00:45:57,464
My girlfriend.

886
00:45:57,769 --> 00:45:58,864
- What? - What?

887
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,573
- My girlfriend. - So who's your girlfriend?

888
00:46:06,739 --> 00:46:09,449
Hey, you gave me a ride in the car she got you,

889
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:11,344
and you gave her the tablet PC I got you.

890
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:14,584
You rob one girl to pay another back?

891
00:46:15,048 --> 00:46:17,453
Hey! Do you think dating is like paying a credit card bill?

892
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:21,154
- Were you a two-timer? - What?

893
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:24,123
Hold on, hold on.

894
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:26,028
Please listen to me.

895
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:27,694
Listen to you for what?

896
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:33,364
Did you just dodge it?

897
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:37,039
Looking at your wrist snap,

898
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,373
it seems like you don't have much experience in this.

899
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,349
Here's your fresh tomato juice with extra cream...

900
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:44,214
and caramel syrup.

901
00:46:46,978 --> 00:46:48,183
Thank you.

902
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:53,453
Wait a second. Ye Seul, wait.

903
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,024
Wait, wait.

904
00:46:56,128 --> 00:46:57,294
Hold on.

905
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:13,834
Are you crazy?

906
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:20,344
I'm sorry I wasted your drink like this.

907
00:47:21,188 --> 00:47:23,743
I aimed as best as I could,

908
00:47:23,918 --> 00:47:26,513
but some splashed on the floor and the table. I apologize.

909
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,898
This is a voucher for my company's cleaning service.

910
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:34,993
Okay.

911
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:36,929
And this is my name.

912
00:47:36,929 --> 00:47:39,763
Just call and ask for me, and I'll be right over.

913
00:47:40,568 --> 00:47:41,734
Okay.

914
00:47:50,249 --> 00:47:52,743
She's a professional.

915
00:47:55,148 --> 00:47:56,743
This is so strange.

916
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:58,758
If the crook's data was right,

917
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:00,858
it's beyond the boundaries of our company.

918
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:03,128
- In China? - No, she's from Seoul.

919
00:48:03,128 --> 00:48:04,424
Don't be ridiculous.

920
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:06,993
- Sweetie. - Sweetie.

921
00:48:07,568 --> 00:48:09,199
- Hi, Ji Sung. It's been a while. - Hello.

922
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:10,798
I haven't seen you since the opening ceremony.

923
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:11,798
That's right.

924
00:48:11,798 --> 00:48:13,909
- You've become even prettier. - No.

925
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:16,334
- She's always been pretty. - You're right.

926
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,573
She must have a meeting somewhere.

927
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:21,778
- I see. - She must be busy.

928
00:48:21,778 --> 00:48:24,079
- Ji Sung, are you coming? - Well...

929
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,473
- Ye Seul, what are you doing here? - Jung Han.

930
00:48:26,978 --> 00:48:28,444
I'm here to see Ji Sung.

931
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:29,814
Okay.

932
00:48:30,088 --> 00:48:32,588
I stepped out to see Ye Seul,

933
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:34,254
but I have...

934
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:39,154
I have some work left.

935
00:48:39,728 --> 00:48:40,864
Okay.

936
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,829
I understand that you were upset back there,

937
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:47,933
but before you splash him, warm up your wrist first.

938
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:50,309
You guys go ahead.

939
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:51,508
- Okay. - Okay.

940
00:48:51,508 --> 00:48:53,179
- Come to the place we talked about. - See you again.

941
00:48:53,179 --> 00:48:54,449
- Bye. - See you.

942
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:56,073
See you again.

943
00:48:57,478 --> 00:48:58,614
Sweetie.

944
00:49:00,048 --> 00:49:02,643
You must be busy.

945
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:05,489
Go back to work when you're done with Ye Seul.

946
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:06,519
I'll get going.

947
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:09,884
No. I'm done now. Do you want me to come with you?

948
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:12,559
No, today's fine.

949
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,223
Let's just meet tomorrow without friends. It's the weekend.

950
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:18,364
You have time this weekend, right?

951
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:22,303
Yes. I'm really sorry.

952
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:26,203
What's with the look? I'm really fine.

953
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,703
It's just... I feel so bad.

954
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:31,573
It's not what you think.

955
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:33,973
- Ji Sung. - Yes?

956
00:49:34,989 --> 00:49:36,683
You want to look like a good person?

957
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,953
I'll be going. Talk to you later.

958
00:49:45,699 --> 00:49:47,154
- Bye, Ye Seul. - Bye.

959
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:48,723
Let me see.

960
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:52,033
What do I do?

961
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:53,734
My gosh.

962
00:49:55,469 --> 00:49:57,774
Listen, Ye Seul.

963
00:49:57,978 --> 00:50:01,203
Don't fall for a guy just because he has good looks.

964
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:02,608
Date a good guy...

965
00:50:02,608 --> 00:50:04,849
even if he isn't good-looking.

966
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:07,588
I don't want to. Dating isn't medicine.

967
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:09,418
I don't want to put up with a guy just because he's good.

968
00:50:09,418 --> 00:50:10,918
Then would you swallow poison...

969
00:50:10,918 --> 00:50:12,984
if it tastes sweet?

970
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,028
After being fooled by good-looking guys so many times,

971
00:50:16,028 --> 00:50:17,599
I'd shudder...

972
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,024
at the sight of any guy with a decent-looking nose.

973
00:50:20,258 --> 00:50:24,533
No. Good-looking guys never cease to excite me.

974
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,668
Take Jung Woo Sung for example.

975
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:27,964
After more than 20 years, he's still handsome as ever.

976
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,004
Anyway, what's with this girl?

977
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:33,533
How could she bring me there as if she knew something?

978
00:50:34,508 --> 00:50:36,844
You talk as if this doesn't concern you.

979
00:50:37,249 --> 00:50:38,373
Gosh.

980
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:41,814
So how come you took her there of all places?

981
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:45,283
Were you really going to lend her money?

982
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:46,588
No.

983
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:50,323
I thought I should persuade her in a quiet place.

984
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:53,694
And the crook just happened to show up?

985
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:55,568
- Yes. - My goodness.

986
00:50:55,568 --> 00:50:58,294
Your ancestors must have helped you.

987
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,933
Hey, you should thank Ji Sung.

988
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,763
Listen, guys.

989
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,904
I hope it wasn't too rash of me.

990
00:51:07,449 --> 00:51:10,473
It didn't seem like he only approached me for money.

991
00:51:11,148 --> 00:51:15,548
Hey, you're flaring your nostrils again.

992
00:51:15,548 --> 00:51:17,513
You're flaring them so much.

993
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,458
What's that forum you like again? Nogari Time?

994
00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:23,188
Why don't you write about this there and see what people say?

995
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:25,524
Come on.

996
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:27,663
She already did.

997
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:29,298
(A Player who Rips Off His Girlfriends)

998
00:51:29,298 --> 00:51:31,639
Even after seeing all the bad things people say about him,

999
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:34,239
she's still not over him.

1000
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:35,739
(You really don't understand? He took advantage of you.)

1001
00:51:35,739 --> 00:51:37,064
I get it.

1002
00:51:37,508 --> 00:51:39,909
But let me just ask you one more thing.

1003
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:40,978
What is it?

1004
00:51:40,978 --> 00:51:43,749
Do you think he ever loved me?

1005
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:45,548
- Gosh. Let's go. - Let's go.

1006
00:51:45,548 --> 00:51:47,079
- Let's go. - I get it!

1007
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:49,289
I'll stop. I won't say anything anymore.

1008
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:50,918
Let's get together tonight.

1009
00:51:50,918 --> 00:51:52,818
Seo Ji Sung. Moon Ye Seul. Tak Gi Hyun.

1010
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,728
Pelican Electronics' 32nd recruits.

1011
00:51:54,728 --> 00:51:56,283
Seo-Moon-Tak!

1012
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,053
- Remember this - Remember this

1013
00:51:59,499 --> 00:52:00,699
- This is getting old. - I have to get back to work.

1014
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:03,429
- Where are you going? - I'm busy until my honeymoon.

1015
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:04,438
Bye.

1016
00:52:04,438 --> 00:52:06,893
I have to get going too. My husband's picking me up.

1017
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:13,533
- Honey. - Yes?

1018
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:15,278
Five minutes. Hurry up, or we'll get a ticket.

1019
00:52:15,278 --> 00:52:16,508
- Okay. - Ye Seul, it's been a while.

1020
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,743
Hi.

1021
00:52:32,798 --> 00:52:35,469
4 minutes and 32 seconds. Let's go.

1022
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:36,594
Let's go.

1023
00:52:46,438 --> 00:52:49,203
They make it look like they're carrying out a mission.

1024
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,973
(10 minutes before JSS reload)

1025
00:52:55,648 --> 00:52:57,659
Ji Sung. You talked about a fridge...

1026
00:52:57,659 --> 00:52:59,088
that tells you when a food item goes bad.

1027
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:00,314
Have you not invented it yet?

1028
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:04,053
That's what I was going to make,

1029
00:53:04,358 --> 00:53:07,769
but I ended up making a fridge...

1030
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:12,094
that tells you whether a person has gone bad instead.

1031
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,809
What kind of bug is this?

1032
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:16,004
Gosh.

1033
00:53:16,909 --> 00:53:19,234
What kind of bug could this be?

1034
00:53:21,008 --> 00:53:22,803
Should I try initializing it?

1035
00:53:24,449 --> 00:53:27,073
Okay, I'll reset the firmware first.

1036
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:34,553
Hi, Janggo.

1037
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:37,453
Yes, go ahead.

1038
00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:40,123
What kind of dish do you want me to recommend?

1039
00:53:40,298 --> 00:53:41,668
A woman in her 30s. Lives in Gorae-dong.

1040
00:53:41,668 --> 00:53:43,663
Works in IT. Has reflux esophagitis.

1041
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,398
I had a sandwich for breakfast...

1042
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:47,068
I mean, for dinner today.

1043
00:53:47,068 --> 00:53:48,464
What should I have tomorrow?

1044
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:51,508
For breakfast tomorrow, how about clear pollack roe soup...

1045
00:53:51,508 --> 00:53:53,973
using the pollack roe in the fridge?

1046
00:53:54,449 --> 00:53:55,674
Is it working?

1047
00:53:56,309 --> 00:53:57,409
Is that all?

1048
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:02,084
(Pollack Roe Soup, A Golden Recipe for Pollack Roe Soup)

1049
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:04,918
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

1050
00:54:04,918 --> 00:54:07,114
I turned it off and on again, and it's working.

1051
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:09,884
Janggo.

1052
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,393
Did my ancestral spirits just help me?

1053
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:17,163
All right. I turned it off and on again, and it's working.

1054
00:54:17,568 --> 00:54:19,134
It's working now.

1055
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:22,208
(You have a new message.)

1056
00:54:22,208 --> 00:54:23,438
Are you still working?

1057
00:54:23,438 --> 00:54:25,674
I just left my friends and am on my way home.

1058
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,219
Sweetie. Seo Ji Sung. I love you.

1059
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:34,413
I love you too.

1060
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:38,913
Sweetie, Janggo just started working normally.

1061
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:42,223
I'm disappointed.

1062
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:46,094
You should've tried your boyfriend's information first.

1063
00:54:47,628 --> 00:54:48,763
He's right.

1064
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:52,639
- Janggo. - Yes, go ahead.

1065
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,168
A man in his 30s. Lives in Gorae-dong.

1066
00:54:55,168 --> 00:54:56,639
A groom-to-be. Allergic to mackerel.

1067
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:57,978
A dentist.

1068
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:00,478
He had beer and chicken today.

1069
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:02,404
What should my love have tomorrow?

1070
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:08,088
I recommend brown rice with wild chive and tofu doenjangguk...

1071
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:09,314
for Mr. Bang Jung Han.

1072
00:55:10,818 --> 00:55:13,683
Is it working? Is it really working?

1073
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,258
Is it?

1074
00:55:15,258 --> 00:55:16,429
(A Golden Recipe for Wild Chive and Tofu Doenjangguk)

1075
00:55:16,429 --> 00:55:17,553
Hold on.

1076
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:21,294
"Bang Jung Han"?

1077
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:23,794
Isn't the bug solved yet?

1078
00:55:27,068 --> 00:55:28,639
(Bang Jung Han's Credit Card Bill)

1079
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,234
(Luxury Bar, Leon Karaoke)

1080
00:55:31,938 --> 00:55:34,778
Mr. Bang Jung Han tries to stay on good terms with everyone.

1081
00:55:34,778 --> 00:55:37,643
He's been very popular in group chats lately.

1082
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:42,489
When the British physicist, Chadwick,

1083
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,614
discovered the neutron,

1084
00:55:44,818 --> 00:55:48,128
he probably guessed that his achievement would...

1085
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:49,889
win the Nobel Prize in Physics...

1086
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:53,393
and bring honor to his family at best.

1087
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:55,499
(Does Ji Sung know about this?)

1088
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:56,594
(What do you think?)

1089
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:01,603
(Jung Han impressed me today. He's such a loyal friend.)

1090
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:04,639
(You guys should quit going to those places.)

1091
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:06,703
Jung Han impressed me today.

1092
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:08,603
- He's such a loyal friend. - I know.

1093
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:10,508
Are you getting married out of loyalty too?

1094
00:56:10,508 --> 00:56:12,349
There are fresher and tastier fish out there.

1095
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:13,619
It's not like she can open a clinic for you.

1096
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:15,749
Guys, I'm picky about body shape.

1097
00:56:15,749 --> 00:56:18,289
Fine, be loyal and hold onto your delisted stock.

1098
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:20,559
Ji Sung is still good in bed.

1099
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,424
That's what's good about oldies.

1100
00:56:34,568 --> 00:56:35,938
(But her breasts are small.)

1101
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,309
(No, they aren't. Look at this.)

1102
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:38,938
(It's too blurry. Send us more.)

1103
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,608
(How about this?)

1104
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:42,278
(She's dressed.)

1105
00:56:42,278 --> 00:56:44,143
(Here you go. Can you see it now?)

1106
00:56:44,148 --> 00:56:46,344
(Here's a close-up.)

1107
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:56,858
The Nobel Prize winner probably had no idea he'd play...

1108
00:56:56,858 --> 00:57:00,094
a key role in the invention of the nuclear bomb.

1109
00:57:00,298 --> 00:57:01,929
Right now, I could have a conversation with him...

1110
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:04,834
and really sympathize with him.

1111
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:08,364
I asked this fridge how fresh food items are,

1112
00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:11,933
and it's telling me what a person is like.

1113
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:14,004
This is lunacy.

1114
00:57:14,878 --> 00:57:17,008
Since he tries to stay on good terms with everyone,

1115
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:19,174
he can sometimes be two-faced.

1116
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:22,913
I was dead tired, and she wouldn't leave.

1117
00:57:24,588 --> 00:57:25,989
Why can't she just go home?

1118
00:57:25,989 --> 00:57:27,659
Did you go somewhere nice?

1119
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:30,188
Yes, I did.

1120
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:32,553
My girlfriend was going to come,

1121
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:36,123
but she couldn't make it. So us guys...

1122
00:57:36,668 --> 00:57:38,033
went someplace nice.

1123
00:57:39,568 --> 00:57:40,663
Are you...

1124
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:44,834
a nuclear bomb that I created without realizing it?

1125
00:57:46,809 --> 00:57:48,103
Or are you...

1126
00:57:48,608 --> 00:57:50,643
ancestral spirits...

1127
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:54,643
who came to destroy my life?

1128
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:01,384
(Please Don't Date Him)

1129
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,294
(Please Don't Date Him)

1130
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:14,809
- What? - What's with the fridge?

1131
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:15,838
It's like a fortune-teller.

1132
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:17,234
It's so accurate.

1133
00:58:17,508 --> 00:58:19,703
Why did you tell me that?

1134
00:58:20,978 --> 00:58:23,378
It wasn't a hidden camera. She was wearing her underwear.

1135
00:58:23,378 --> 00:58:25,349
- Are you in it too? - No, I'm not.

1136
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:27,619
Girls these days have no shame.

1137
00:58:27,619 --> 00:58:29,719
It's not like she was naked.

1138
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:31,783
In a situation like this, you should put your emotions aside.

1139
00:58:32,019 --> 00:58:33,059
Oh, my. What's wrong with you?

1140
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:34,119
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1141
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:36,929
This girl's been suspicious lately.

1142
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:38,654
- No, no! - No, no!

1143
00:58:39,659 --> 00:58:41,769
- You can't go in there. - Get off me!

1144
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,223
- Oh, no. - Gosh.

1145
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,393
This can't be happening. I have to go to work.
