1
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:25,386
How dare he represent firefighters?

2
00:00:25,388 --> 00:00:27,470
He ruined someone's life.

3
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,640
Come to think of it,

4
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:33,109
there were many weird moments.

5
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:34,610
- I wired the money.
- Sorry?

6
00:00:34,612 --> 00:00:36,479
- I sent the money, so check.
- Already?

7
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:38,180
Yes.

8
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,417
"Old lady, this is Oxana."

9
00:00:41,419 --> 00:00:42,752
So you can do that too.

10
00:00:43,112 --> 00:00:44,133
Why don't I have any apps?

11
00:00:44,135 --> 00:00:48,931
He didn't have any apps on his new
phone other than the basic ones.

12
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:49,725
When did the phones switch?

13
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:53,829
He doesn't even use KakaoTalk used
by 90 percent of the population.

14
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,053
If you cross the parking lot behind,
it'll take you five minutes...

15
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:59,435
- less to the station.
- He's not used to digital life.

16
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:01,937
- You'd make it if you run for it.
- But he knows the area so well.

17
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:03,906
Could he be...

18
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:12,615
Bring the developer of South Korea.

19
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:17,720
Don't lie to me, woman.

20
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:20,222
a spy?

21
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:23,993
No.

22
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:27,797
No, a spy can't be a civil servant
no matter how well he is disguised.

23
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,231
Then...

24
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:32,568
Did you just take a photo of me?
Delete it.

25
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:37,139
A former celebrity who wants
to hide his past?

26
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,379
Gook Hee!

27
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:56,158
What if he's living a quiet life
tired of stalkers and bad comments?

28
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,428
What if that's why he hates having
his pictures taken?

29
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,736
That can't be.

30
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,406
There's no way people won't notice
him if he is a celebrity.

31
00:02:11,534 --> 00:02:13,676
If not that...

32
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,646
Is he Kkaburi...

33
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:20,282
that harassed Dong Baek?

34
00:02:21,096 --> 00:02:22,752
Jung Gook Hee.

35
00:02:23,866 --> 00:02:25,921
What's this man like?

36
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:30,860
Will he be another heartbreak
in my life?

37
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:36,185
(Please Don't Date Him)

38
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:40,389
(Episode 7. How to Solve a Bug)

39
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,215
Gook Hee.

40
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:56,652
This is a hot place.
What do you think?

41
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,656
I haven't been to these places,
so I'm not sure.

42
00:03:01,757 --> 00:03:03,425
Is this your first time
in a place like this?

43
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,562
What do you do on your day-offs?

44
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:08,397
I work out,

45
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,734
read books, listen to music,

46
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,369
and go out for walks.

47
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:16,071
I see.

48
00:03:17,773 --> 00:03:20,209
You must've been bored so far.

49
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,145
It seemed like...

50
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:27,449
I shouldn't enjoy my life.

51
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,896
Just now...

52
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,068
It's nothing.

53
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:56,946
But Gook Hee.

54
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:59,048
Do you have bad teeth?

55
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,259
Do you like spicy food?

56
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,495
Yes.

57
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:15,069
I...

58
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,552
really love spicy food.

59
00:04:17,746 --> 00:04:18,901
Hot sauce.

60
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:27,009
I love spicy.

61
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:38,921
Let me take this call.

62
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,257
Yes, Ye Seul.

63
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:43,092
What is it? Why are you crying?

64
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,827
What? Gi Hyun did?

65
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:47,496
Okay. I'll be right there.

66
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:50,239
What do I do? I'm sorry.

67
00:04:50,241 --> 00:04:53,100
I need to go now. It's urgent.

68
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,004
It's okay. You can go ahead.

69
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,506
I'm so sorry. It's very urgent.

70
00:04:59,047 --> 00:04:59,909
Excuse me.

71
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:42,918
Did you forget that I'm a patient?

72
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,387
This is so bad.

73
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,257
When you are sick, you should eat
a lot whatever it is. Here you go.

74
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,725
It's delicious.

75
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,927
Have this when you crave
something sweet.

76
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:54,229
Gi Hyun.

77
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:55,898
Gi Hyun.

78
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,833
What happened?

79
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,336
How and where are you sick?

80
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:00,903
What did the doctor say?
Where's Sang Sik?

81
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,033
It's a temporary hormonal shock.

82
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:04,183
It'll get better
if I have a few days off.

83
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,441
Sang Sik went on a business trip.

84
00:06:05,443 --> 00:06:07,142
Did he go abroad?

85
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:10,005
He should come here right away.
How could he leave you alone?

86
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,146
I know.

87
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:15,651
Gi Hyun.

88
00:06:17,807 --> 00:06:19,021
What happened?

89
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:21,790
Are you all right? What did they say
at the hospital? Where's Sang Sik?

90
00:06:21,792 --> 00:06:23,525
It's a temporary hormonal shock.
I'm fine.

91
00:06:23,527 --> 00:06:25,427
It'll get better if I have a few
days off. He's on a business trip.

92
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:29,264
Did he go to the moon?
He should be here.

93
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,868
Geez. Why are you crying?

94
00:06:33,502 --> 00:06:35,404
Why is everyone overreacting?

95
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:37,172
I'm fine.

96
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:41,577
But what are you girls wearing?

97
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:43,979
Yours surprise us the most.

98
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:46,515
Right.

99
00:06:46,517 --> 00:06:48,417
But who are they?

100
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:50,886
Firefighters.

101
00:06:52,314 --> 00:06:53,288
Hello,

102
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,024
my name is Gam Oh Jung.

103
00:06:57,753 --> 00:06:59,094
What about him?

104
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:01,864
He's a firefighter.

105
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:08,337
Hello.

106
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,447
Yes. He's the best firefighter in
Gorae Fire Station, Jung Gook Hee.

107
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:15,511
He and I have the best teamwork.

108
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:19,248
Anyway, since your friends are here,

109
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:21,417
I'll be going now
as my mission is complete.

110
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:23,417
Thank you for today.

111
00:07:23,499 --> 00:07:24,720
Get some rest.

112
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:26,221
Well, then.

113
00:07:26,902 --> 00:07:28,424
Goodbye.

114
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,565
Gosh. What was that?

115
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,868
Does everyone but me have
a firefighter by their side?

116
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,797
What do you mean?

117
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,407
He brought me here.

118
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,977
Did you fall too
that the firefighter saved you?

119
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,947
No, I was just...

120
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,218
Is he your new boyfriend?

121
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,353
She's not you.

122
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,924
She just broke up with her boyfriend
so she wouldn't have.

123
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,314
We'd need slippers
to care for her all night.

124
00:08:05,314 --> 00:08:07,463
I'll go to get some toiletries.
Wait here.

125
00:08:07,463 --> 00:08:09,731
- I'll go with Ye Seul.
- We'll be back.

126
00:08:12,607 --> 00:08:15,871
You went all the way there
to find Yu Jin?

127
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:17,739
Yes.

128
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:21,310
I'm sure I saw that mountain
on his Moonstargram.

129
00:08:21,783 --> 00:08:23,445
But I guess it's not.

130
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,816
Guys who go off the grid
are the worst trash.

131
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,252
You should break up with him.

132
00:08:33,334 --> 00:08:35,491
Are things going well
with your new boyfriend?

133
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,595
He's not my new boyfriend.
We only had a meal together.

134
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,564
If he's not your boyfriend,
can I hit on him?

135
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,398
Sorry?

136
00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:45,167
Did I not tell you?

137
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,936
I got high scores for my ethics exam
for college.

138
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:50,205
I know ethics.

139
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,107
Where is this going?

140
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:54,009
I don't mess with my friend's men.

141
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:57,479
Is that good-looking firefighter
yours or not?

142
00:08:58,177 --> 00:08:58,981
He's not.

143
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:01,416
- Oh, right. Then I can hit on him?
- Not that.

144
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,386
It's not a complete no.

145
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:05,621
What are you saying?

146
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,889
Well...

147
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:08,595
What?

148
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,527
Is he the boyfriend?

149
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:14,296
- I knew it.
- Ms. Byun.

150
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,432
Ms. Seo, what brings you here?

151
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:19,988
My friend is sick.

152
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,976
Why are you here?

153
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,772
My boyfriend got hurt.

154
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,375
Hyun Soo.
This is Manager Seo Ji Sung.

155
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,421
Nice to meet you.

156
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,886
I'm Kang Hyun Soo
and I'm Ha Ri's boyfriend.

157
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:32,981
- Hello.
- I heard a lot about you.

158
00:09:33,221 --> 00:09:35,215
You've been nice to Ha Ri.

159
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:38,153
Not at all. She's been excellent.

160
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:43,625
I don't know if he made up
with the cat after fighting.

161
00:09:45,427 --> 00:09:48,063
I tried to cut his nails
to make up with him.

162
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:51,366
It's like a tiger scratched you.

163
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:53,969
- Look. He got a bruise.
- I know.

164
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:56,371
You told everyone
that I fought with the cat.

165
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,675
No, we just got to talking.

166
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,144
We'll be going now.

167
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:04,479
- All right.
- See you at work.

168
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:06,034
- Goodbye.
- Let's go.

169
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:07,749
- Get well soon.
- Thank you.

170
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:13,455
He's cute. Is he in college?

171
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,305
He's a school teacher.
Skip him even if he's your type.

172
00:10:16,305 --> 00:10:19,196
Look. He's so dear
to his girlfriend.

173
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,196
Oh, gosh.

174
00:10:22,713 --> 00:10:24,332
Hey, I need to go to the bathroom.

175
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:30,885
But did you really miss the shoot
because of the cafe owner?

176
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:33,818
There's nothing more important
than saving people...

177
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:35,818
to a firefighter, you see.

178
00:10:36,726 --> 00:10:37,820
However,

179
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:41,227
I stopped consuming carbohydrates
since spring and worked out...

180
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:43,314
to build my latissimus dorsi
and pectoral muscles.

181
00:10:43,547 --> 00:10:45,248
Now I don't know
what I should do with them.

182
00:10:45,776 --> 00:10:47,776
Use them to carry your kids
on your shoulders.

183
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:49,854
Right, for childcare.

184
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,721
Oh, right. Did you buy the thing?

185
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,130
I got this at the stationery...

186
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,633
a second before it was closed.

187
00:10:56,633 --> 00:10:58,162
Thank you.

188
00:10:58,162 --> 00:10:59,802
Gosh, my eldest kid...

189
00:10:59,802 --> 00:11:01,802
always tells me what she needs
the day before her class.

190
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,258
It'd be nice if she could
let me know beforehand.

191
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:06,379
My eldest and you are the same.

192
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,475
What about me?

193
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:12,716
Your eyes are shaking again.

194
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,456
You should've let me know
before getting a girlfriend...

195
00:11:15,456 --> 00:11:18,858
for me to be less surprised.
But you showed up out of the blue.

196
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:21,847
Why, is she not your girlfriend yet?

197
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:24,898
I thought you two
enjoyed a date all day.

198
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:30,646
What are you doing?

199
00:11:33,741 --> 00:11:36,714
That firefighter is strange.

200
00:11:36,714 --> 00:11:38,136
What about Gook Hee?

201
00:11:39,225 --> 00:11:41,974
Is that the name of the firefighter
who rescued Gi Hyun?

202
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,476
Oh, you mean Mr. Gam?

203
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:45,852
What about him?

204
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:48,094
It's strange.

205
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,857
He must've rescued countless people.

206
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,174
I bet he didn't keep their side
every time.

207
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:56,209
She isn't the kind of person
who'd cheat on her husband.

208
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:59,358
You can be so naive at times.

209
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,841
Ji Sung, it's the same
for men and women...

210
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,886
that attractive people are popular.

211
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:10,557
Look, I'm right.

212
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:15,543
You saw it earlier.
Ms. Byun has a boyfriend.

213
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:18,715
And the two of them know each other.

214
00:12:19,147 --> 00:12:21,147
A firefighter and a petitioner.

215
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:24,981
The way I see it,

216
00:12:24,981 --> 00:12:27,721
they aren't just a firefighter
and a petitioner either.

217
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,206
What are you waiting for?
Follow them.

218
00:12:42,206 --> 00:12:45,375
I'm not crazy enough
to do such a thing.

219
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,047
I must be out of my mind.

220
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:53,748
What happened?

221
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,805
- What?
- What happened is...

222
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,896
I can't hear
a single thing they say.

223
00:13:02,224 --> 00:13:03,376
This won't do.

224
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,943
You promised me, Ha Ri.

225
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,883
To break up with your boyfriend.

226
00:13:22,439 --> 00:13:24,888
I was going to,
but it didn't work out well.

227
00:13:26,618 --> 00:13:28,618
I think we need more time.

228
00:13:31,622 --> 00:13:34,355
You can't go on anymore.
You clearly know that.

229
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:42,664
What are you doing...

230
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:44,438
- Honey, don't.
- to my girlfriend?

231
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:46,954
It's nothing.

232
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:03,327
Let him go.

233
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:37,013
Ji Sung.

234
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:39,063
Gook Hee.

235
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,905
Well, an acquaintance of mine
passed away.

236
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:51,646
- Let me carry it for you.
- No, thanks.

237
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:54,866
I'm waiting for someone.

238
00:14:55,076 --> 00:14:56,825
I see.

239
00:14:58,748 --> 00:15:03,658
Well, I didn't mean to overhear you,

240
00:15:04,942 --> 00:15:08,285
but when the humidity
and temperature are low like today,

241
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:10,920
the sound waves happen to be high,
making you hear things better.

242
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,774
It seemed you were telling
Ms. Byun...

243
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:16,904
to break up with her boyfriend.

244
00:15:17,795 --> 00:15:19,795
Why did you do that?

245
00:15:20,707 --> 00:15:23,175
It's true I told her
to break up with her boyfriend.

246
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,507
But I can't tell you why.

247
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,504
When petitioners ask you out,

248
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,115
do you go on dates with them all?

249
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:33,853
No.

250
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:38,207
It was the first time today.

251
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,345
If what we did today was a date,

252
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:45,574
shouldn't you explain
this situation to me?

253
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:47,938
It's also about Ha Ri.

254
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,297
What about me?

255
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:54,235
Don't you care about my feelings?

256
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,235
Of course, I do.

257
00:15:57,679 --> 00:15:58,884
Excuse me.

258
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:04,614
I'm having a talk right now.
I'll be there soon.

259
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:09,245
- I'm sorry. Today...
- No.

260
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:11,994
You seem busy, so go on.
I need to get going too.

261
00:16:37,932 --> 00:16:39,620
Is it your husband?

262
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,267
No.

263
00:16:43,888 --> 00:16:45,888
Then whom are you texting with?

264
00:16:46,362 --> 00:16:49,158
- Mr. Gam.
- Mr. Gam?

265
00:16:49,857 --> 00:16:50,732
Yes.

266
00:16:50,732 --> 00:16:53,081
- Hey, I need to go to the bathroom.
- Well...

267
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,486
You look like a typical nurse.

268
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:58,595
Is your surname perhaps...

269
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,026
Nightingale? Ms. Nightingale.

270
00:17:02,762 --> 00:17:04,347
- No.
- In that sense,

271
00:17:04,372 --> 00:17:06,041
can I get your number?

272
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,217
What's your relationship with him?

273
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:17,430
A cafe owner and a customer.

274
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,793
A petitioner and a firefighter.

275
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:19,961
Neighbors.

276
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,139
A man and a woman.

277
00:17:22,139 --> 00:17:23,546
A man and a woman?

278
00:17:23,546 --> 00:17:26,048
He's a man and I'm a woman.

279
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:30,577
What? Then what's your relationship
with that firefighter?

280
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:35,756
I don't know.

281
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:53,624
What? That senior came
to the shooting site?

282
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:56,537
Yes.

283
00:17:57,591 --> 00:18:00,047
I was surprised to see him
out of the blue.

284
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:01,954
Did you say hello to him?

285
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,214
But I didn't get
to talk to him much.

286
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:11,672
I blacked out.

287
00:18:13,815 --> 00:18:15,435
Any news about that person?

288
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,133
He didn't know.

289
00:18:23,954 --> 00:18:25,225
Figures.

290
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,924
It was a long time ago.

291
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:35,665
Don't be like this.

292
00:18:36,517 --> 00:18:39,274
You need to get over it now.

293
00:18:39,274 --> 00:18:41,543
I know it's hard to forget.

294
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:44,493
But you can't dwell on it forever.

295
00:18:47,137 --> 00:18:48,312
Oh Jung.

296
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:51,277
I still dream about that time.

297
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,093
I wonder why I did it.

298
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,636
Only if I can go back in time...

299
00:19:04,493 --> 00:19:06,880
You were just a little boy.

300
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,337
That doesn't give an excuse
for my sin.

301
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:22,661
You must've ruined
your first date with Ms. Seo.

302
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:26,396
I think I made a mistake.

303
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:30,026
First dates are bound to go wrong.

304
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:32,026
It's okay. You can do better
on your second date.

305
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,197
I doubt there will be another date.

306
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,699
It seems
she's quite disappointed in me.

307
00:19:36,949 --> 00:19:39,362
Are you going to stop seeing her
just because she's disappointed?

308
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,249
If you like her that little,
stop it now.

309
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,998
Or how will you start
a relationship like that?

310
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:45,998
Organize your feelings first.

311
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:50,653
And I'm not in the place
to give advice.

312
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:54,234
I can't organize my feelings either.

313
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:58,667
This won't do. Let's just have
some more carbohydrates.

314
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,703
Ma'am, we'll have two more orders
of rice cake ramyeon...

315
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,488
with a cup of iced soda.

316
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:13,058
Hello, everyone.

317
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:18,217
- Ms. Seo.
- Yes?

318
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,894
How can you come so late?

319
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,362
It's exactly 9 a.m. right now.

320
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:22,230
Is that right?

321
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,082
A bug was found
in the air conditioner...

322
00:20:24,082 --> 00:20:25,614
at the institute in Myeonsu-ri.

323
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,502
The higher-ups were calling us
like crazy.

324
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,970
I'll get in touch with them.

325
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:30,605
I should be able to debug
with proxy.

326
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,473
Proxy? Hold on.

327
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:34,537
About the final report
on thermovision cameras,

328
00:20:34,538 --> 00:20:35,584
I think...

329
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:37,912
it should have some more discussion
on the collaboration...

330
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,677
to accentuate that it was
a national project.

331
00:20:39,678 --> 00:20:41,082
Get some data from the fire station.

332
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:43,051
I have to do that too?

333
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:47,255
You seem close to the firemen there.
You can ask.

334
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,160
- Ms. Byun,
- Yes?

335
00:20:52,427 --> 00:20:54,596
could you get me some documents
from the research institute?

336
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,064
Yes, ma'am.

337
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:58,233
- We're done now, right?
- Yes.

338
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,268
All right, then. I'm heading out
to get coffee.

339
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:07,976
You promised me, Ha Ri.

340
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,044
To break up with your boyfriend.

341
00:21:11,346 --> 00:21:12,947
I think we need more time.

342
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:16,851
Should I ask what they have
between them?

343
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,853
No,

344
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:20,221
who am I to do that?

345
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:23,549
(Tak Gi Hyun)

346
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,239
Are you okay, honey?

347
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:44,946
Are you okay?

348
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,484
You were so busy that I couldn't
reach you for over 24 hours.

349
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,052
Are you okay?

350
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:53,988
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:53,988 --> 00:21:56,190
There was something important
at work,

352
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,525
so I couldn't see your calls.

353
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,760
What was it?

354
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,062
Just work.

355
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,897
You wouldn't understand
even if I told you.

356
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:04,999
Of course, I wouldn't.

357
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:07,368
I don't know what you do,

358
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,270
why I can't get in touch
with you ever,

359
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,440
and why you even live with me.

360
00:22:13,908 --> 00:22:15,076
What do you mean?

361
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,547
For me, having our child is
my priority, but not for you.

362
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:23,584
I worry that I'm the only one
so desperate for a baby.

363
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,320
All right.

364
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,122
Let's talk about it
while we're on the topic.

365
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:31,159
Let's stop trying for a kid.

366
00:22:32,725 --> 00:22:33,528
Sorry?

367
00:22:34,128 --> 00:22:36,998
You're overworking yourself.
That's why you ended up here.

368
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,635
Do you know how scared I was
to hear that you fainted?

369
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,937
Were you as surprised as I was?

370
00:22:45,225 --> 00:22:47,408
I really don't know you.

371
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,079
How can you tell me...

372
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:53,781
that we should stop trying
to have a child?

373
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,085
Do you not want to live
with me anymore?

374
00:22:57,685 --> 00:22:58,987
Don't put words in my mouth.

375
00:22:59,084 --> 00:23:00,855
I'm just saying we should stop
trying to have a child.

376
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:02,548
Those two are the same thing for me!

377
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,061
Gi Hyun!

378
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,596
Gi Hyun.

379
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:11,466
Gi Hyun, what I'm saying is...

380
00:23:18,537 --> 00:23:20,842
I guess your husband is
finally here.

381
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:21,909
Hello.

382
00:23:22,176 --> 00:23:23,144
He's the fireman...

383
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:25,313
who saved me yesterday.

384
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:27,081
I see.

385
00:23:28,383 --> 00:23:29,584
Thank you.

386
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:34,155
Ms. Tak's guardian.

387
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:35,757
Please file for her discharge.

388
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,161
I'm her guardian.

389
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:46,534
Right.

390
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:48,736
Thanks for yesterday.

391
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:51,239
You can just take it.
It's cold outside.

392
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:53,508
Here.

393
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:55,243
You can wear this instead.

394
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:11,325
It's cold outside.

395
00:24:25,904 --> 00:24:27,875
- Ms. Byun,
- Yes?

396
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,444
is the proposal ready?

397
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:30,978
I can look forward
to seeing it, right?

398
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:35,583
I was told to get the documents
from the lab first.

399
00:24:35,668 --> 00:24:39,514
You have to do both
even if your hands are full.

400
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:41,422
What is this called?

401
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,491
Ms. Seo, what is it?

402
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,893
Two-timing?

403
00:24:48,014 --> 00:24:49,756
Multi-tasking.

404
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:51,866
Ms. Byun,

405
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:54,502
you need to know how to multi-task.
You can't do that?

406
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,071
Yes, Ms. Seo.

407
00:24:57,561 --> 00:24:58,673
Ms. Seo!

408
00:24:59,107 --> 00:25:01,275
Don't scold your junior colleagues
like this.

409
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:03,111
My goodness.

410
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,812
I'm not scolding you.

411
00:25:05,123 --> 00:25:06,180
Ms. Byun?

412
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:09,507
Ms. Byun!

413
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:11,811
Ms. Byun!

414
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,021
- I'll call the ambulance.
- Are you okay?

415
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,623
What are you doing? Quick!

416
00:25:15,623 --> 00:25:16,991
Maybe I have...

417
00:25:17,303 --> 00:25:18,248
stressed her out,

418
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,161
and that's why she's like that
right now.

419
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:21,928
- Are you okay?
- Ms. Byun!

420
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:23,264
- Ms. Byun!
- It's okay.

421
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:25,037
My goodness.

422
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:29,437
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

423
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:35,409
She'll be fine, right?

424
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,146
(Emergency Center)

425
00:25:38,147 --> 00:25:39,413
Ms. Byun!

426
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:42,350
Ms. Byun, you're awake?

427
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,684
Are you feeling better?

428
00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:46,053
Sorry I caused you to panic.

429
00:25:47,622 --> 00:25:50,358
You should've let me know
if you weren't feeling well.

430
00:25:50,358 --> 00:25:52,160
It was stomach cramps
caused by stress.

431
00:25:52,994 --> 00:25:54,929
You were overwhelmed
with work, weren't you?

432
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:57,798
I should've cared for you better.
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,300
It's fine.

434
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,303
I think it's just something
that I ate.

435
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,372
I see.

436
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:05,973
And...

437
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:10,778
you have a fractured rib.
Did you fall or something?

438
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:12,547
Well,

439
00:26:13,645 --> 00:26:14,982
yes.

440
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,585
Sorry for making you worry.

441
00:26:17,985 --> 00:26:20,188
I'm fine now, so you can head back.

442
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:22,590
No, how can I leave you alone?

443
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,559
You live in Seoul alone, right?

444
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:25,927
Have you called your boyfriend?

445
00:26:25,927 --> 00:26:27,161
- I'll call him...
- No!

446
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,431
Please don't contact that man.

447
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,701
Did you two have a fight?

448
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:37,405
You need someone to take care
of you.

449
00:26:37,405 --> 00:26:38,606
Why don't we give him a call?

450
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:09,971
I'm sorry, but could you
step out for a moment?

451
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,812
Sure.

452
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,961
Are you okay?

453
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:58,019
I had so many thoughts
going on in my head.

454
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,322
What a lame ending this is.

455
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:28,692
(Jung Gook Hee)

456
00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:38,003
The number you dialed is not
available. Please leave a message...

457
00:28:44,831 --> 00:28:47,857
- Ms. Park?
- This is Ms. Choi.

458
00:28:47,857 --> 00:28:49,929
I always get so confused.

459
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:53,148
So many people told me that we look
similar, so I tried something new.

460
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:55,886
I think I've also seen you
somewhere else.

461
00:28:55,886 --> 00:28:56,780
Maybe at a hospital?

462
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,522
You look exactly like the nurse
I saw at Whale Hospital.

463
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,033
There are so many people
like me in the medical field.

464
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:07,030
Maybe this is the face
of a white-robed angel.

465
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,533
Dr. Han isn't here yet.

466
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:11,935
Is that so?

467
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:15,404
Did Jung Han get off work?

468
00:29:15,404 --> 00:29:18,563
Dr. Bang just went to the academy
after receiving Dr. Han's call.

469
00:29:18,588 --> 00:29:21,946
What? Yu Jin called Jung Han?

470
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:25,942
Hello, this is the Hanbang Dentist.

471
00:29:25,942 --> 00:29:27,340
Yes, doctor.

472
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:31,518
Dr. Bang has gone to the academy,
and our new patients are...

473
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:34,676
Hello?

474
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,559
- Yu Jin? Where are you?
- Ye Seul?

475
00:29:38,015 --> 00:29:39,758
I'm just taking a break.

476
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,332
Tell me where you are!

477
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:47,069
I'm sorry. I'll be there soon.
Please wait for me.

478
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,393
No, I won't. I'm done.

479
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:52,476
We're done here. I don't care
if you come or not!

480
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Was I too harsh?

481
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
That was harsh.

482
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,363
Not you, Ye Seul.
I'm talking about Dr. Han.

483
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:06,914
He's called the hospital,
his friend,

484
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,864
and even the manager
of the water purifier.

485
00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:10,889
His girlfriend is the only one
he hasn't called.

486
00:30:11,103 --> 00:30:14,395
- I'm the only one he hasn't called?
- Yes.

487
00:30:18,602 --> 00:30:20,602
Is he cheating on me?

488
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:26,049
I don't know.

489
00:30:26,673 --> 00:30:28,013
I'm just going to work.

490
00:30:28,862 --> 00:30:32,503
First, the report
on the thermovision cameras.

491
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,268
I need to get the pictures
from the signing ceremony.

492
00:30:38,657 --> 00:30:40,062
My gosh.

493
00:30:40,258 --> 00:30:42,258
I can't call him.

494
00:30:43,158 --> 00:30:44,529
What am I going to do?

495
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,585
Hold on.

496
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:49,035
Let me check their website.

497
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,861
Really?

498
00:30:51,886 --> 00:30:53,886
They uploaded the pictures
from the ceremony.

499
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,547
Let's see.

500
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,054
His nose looks nice
even in the picture.

501
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:11,367
My goodness!

502
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:13,243
Seo Ji Sung! What's gotten into you?

503
00:31:13,243 --> 00:31:15,059
Pull yourself together.

504
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,889
You're crazy.

505
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:21,998
What is this?

506
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:27,247
I'm a teacher at Gorae High School.

507
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:30,807
As a teacher who teaches students,
I wanted to report...

508
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,675
a despicable firefighter who tried
to teach my girlfriend a lesson.

509
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:37,086
The last name of
that despicable person is Jung.

510
00:31:37,245 --> 00:31:38,833
His last name is Jung?

511
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:41,234
(Bulletin board)

512
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:43,759
Is he...

513
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,189
Hi. I'm Kang Hyun Soo
and I'm Ha Ri's boyfriend.

514
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:52,665
He approached my girlfriend,

515
00:31:52,665 --> 00:31:56,948
pretending to rescue a street cat,
and threatened her to dump me.

516
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,102
Yesterday, he even hurt my hand.

517
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:03,433
I tried to cut his nails
to make up with him,

518
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,651
but he scratched me like this.

519
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:05,860
But he said...

520
00:32:06,516 --> 00:32:09,611
that he got hurt
from a cat scratching him.

521
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,053
Have you called your boyfriend?

522
00:32:13,053 --> 00:32:14,869
- I'll call him...
- No!

523
00:32:15,969 --> 00:32:17,229
Please don't contact that man.

524
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:20,319
He's pretty rough with my cat.

525
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,727
My cat hisses at him too,
very intensely.

526
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:29,982
I was wondering if that meant
there was a problem with him.

527
00:32:39,183 --> 00:32:40,588
Hey, Fridge.

528
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:43,670
- Yes, please go on.
- Kang Hyun Soo.

529
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,852
A male in his 20s
who lives in Gorae-dong.

530
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:47,151
He's a high school teacher.

531
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,341
(Kang Hyun Soo
has power in the dark.)

532
00:32:50,341 --> 00:32:55,362
He only becomes aggressive
when no one's watching.

533
00:33:09,566 --> 00:33:10,714
How could he...

534
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,888
What is he doing?

535
00:33:29,033 --> 00:33:32,623
What a crazy scumbag.

536
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:34,862
He needs to be taught a lesson.

537
00:33:34,862 --> 00:33:36,862
He's out of his mind!

538
00:33:39,722 --> 00:33:41,455
This is from yesterday!

539
00:33:48,564 --> 00:33:50,565
Are you serious?

540
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:53,099
You should've called the police.

541
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,099
Yesterday wasn't the first time,
was it?

542
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:01,582
Yesterday was his first time
beating me this badly.

543
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,728
He used to abuse my cat before.

544
00:34:09,145 --> 00:34:13,218
I was scared that he might do
something to my cat,

545
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,986
so I let him out on the streets.

546
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:21,750
When I was looking for him later,
I ran into Gook Hee.

547
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:26,602
He told me that he seemed dangerous
and that I should break up with him.

548
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:30,889
You should have broken up
with him then!

549
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:36,664
I relied on him so much
for a long time.

550
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:39,269
It was hard for me to let him go.

551
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,849
He promised not to do it again.

552
00:34:47,778 --> 00:34:49,106
Ms. Byun.

553
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,406
You're not going
to see him again, are you?

554
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,406
You're not going to forgive him,
right?

555
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:57,922
That man is...

556
00:34:58,157 --> 00:34:59,534
a habitual offender.

557
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:02,348
Excuse me?

558
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:06,138
He settled multiple criminal cases
for beating up his ex-girlfriends.

559
00:35:06,622 --> 00:35:08,622
How did you know that?

560
00:35:09,113 --> 00:35:10,395
I asked...

561
00:35:10,395 --> 00:35:12,241
the Fridge Spirit.

562
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:16,785
When you told me he had trouble
with your cat, I got worried.

563
00:35:16,785 --> 00:35:19,303
Fridge Spirit is well acquainted
with prosecutors and policemen.

564
00:35:22,805 --> 00:35:24,805
I wanted to know what to do.

565
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,515
I thought maybe,

566
00:35:29,735 --> 00:35:32,066
the Fridge Spirit could
give me an answer.

567
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:37,812
Fridge Spirit or anyone,
for that matter,

568
00:35:41,238 --> 00:35:43,238
can't give you an answer.

569
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:45,079
You need...

570
00:35:45,931 --> 00:35:47,931
to find the answer yourself.

571
00:36:04,856 --> 00:36:07,101
I went to see Ms. Byun.

572
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:11,855
You should've told me about her.

573
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,861
She didn't want anyone to know.

574
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,617
But it's all my fault.

575
00:36:24,872 --> 00:36:27,619
I took her word
that she would break up with him.

576
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,722
That was irresponsible of me.

577
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:35,431
If I had done something,
she wouldn't have been hurt.

578
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,583
Well,

579
00:36:37,583 --> 00:36:39,585
firefighters aren't supermen.

580
00:36:39,585 --> 00:36:41,585
You can't save everyone.

581
00:36:41,978 --> 00:36:43,978
But I'm mostly responsible...

582
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,639
for what happened to Ha Ri.

583
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:50,993
If you were that worried,
you could've warned me.

584
00:36:50,993 --> 00:36:53,622
I work with her.
I could have helped.

585
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:56,900
I didn't think it was right
to talk to anyone about this.

586
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,655
To anyone?

587
00:37:03,373 --> 00:37:06,407
Am I just anyone to you?

588
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,263
That's not what I meant.

589
00:37:10,263 --> 00:37:12,742
What am I to you, Gook Hee?

590
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:17,222
Am I just a girl you went
on a date with once?

591
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:18,428
No.

592
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:21,675
It seems like I'm the only one
trying to get closer to you.

593
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:27,428
If you're not going to let me in,
don't give me any room.

594
00:37:28,068 --> 00:37:29,299
Ji Sung.

595
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:33,684
I won't call you from now on.

596
00:37:41,725 --> 00:37:45,446
I can't believe he's not calling me
just because I said that.

597
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,409
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

598
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:54,307
- Ms. Byun!
- Hi.

599
00:37:55,675 --> 00:37:58,099
Welcome, Ms. Byun.

600
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:00,455
Director Oh was crying
for the past two days.

601
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:01,958
He's crying again.

602
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,778
I was so worried.

603
00:38:05,429 --> 00:38:08,172
Don't push yourself from now on,
Ms. Byun.

604
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:10,731
- Manager Seo, try a little harder.
- Excuse me?

605
00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:12,407
What should we do about the lab
in Myeonsu-ri?

606
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,673
We keep getting calls.

607
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:17,296
It's a system error, so we will
have to go there and check.

608
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:19,665
Mr. Ok, will you go
on a business trip there?

609
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,888
It's said wild boars show up
in that area.

610
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,804
I'm allergic to wild animals.

611
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:27,440
Can't I go?

612
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:28,808
Ms. Byun, you?

613
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,050
My aunt lives in Myeonsu-ri.

614
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:34,380
I can stay at my aunt's house
as I resolve the problem at the lab.

615
00:38:34,382 --> 00:38:36,655
If you allow me,
I'll go fix the problem.

616
00:38:36,657 --> 00:38:39,485
No, it's too much work alone.
I'll go with you.

617
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:42,021
Let me go alone.

618
00:38:42,023 --> 00:38:44,123
Relying on others,

619
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:46,426
I've missed a chance
to be independent.

620
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:51,230
And I want to prove
that my answer is right.

621
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,032
How touching.

622
00:38:53,672 --> 00:38:56,502
What kind of medication did you take
at the hospital?

623
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:58,604
You've changed so much.

624
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:12,852
Hello?

625
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:16,055
Ms. Byun isn't here.
She went on a business trip.

626
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:19,392
- Where?
- Somewhere.

627
00:39:25,525 --> 00:39:28,468
The number you dialed doesn't exist.

628
00:39:28,681 --> 00:39:31,304
Please check again.

629
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,993
That triangular gimbap
looks delicious.

630
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,129
I don't know.

631
00:39:56,729 --> 00:39:59,031
It's not tuna mayo.

632
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:03,069
Is it not?

633
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,705
It was sold out.

634
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,074
You said they had it.

635
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,209
I thought it was tuna,

636
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:13,045
but it's chicken mayo.

637
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:17,016
- What about tuna then?
- I don't know.

638
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:21,087
Perhaps, in the Mediterranean.

639
00:40:22,407 --> 00:40:24,290
When will it get
to the Incheon Port?

640
00:40:24,984 --> 00:40:27,693
Soon if the weather isn't bad.

641
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:28,995
Let's get in touch then.

642
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:31,497
JS...

643
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:36,235
Don't try to make a deal with tuna.

644
00:40:36,235 --> 00:40:37,703
It's for the country.

645
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:42,241
You can't come back without tuna.

646
00:40:42,501 --> 00:40:43,676
Don't forget that.

647
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:51,984
I'm the only one
who knows where tuna is.

648
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:54,420
Don't forget that.

649
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,878
Do they know each other?

650
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,246
Tuna?

651
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:23,916
Did he work in the Maritime
and Fisheries Team too?

652
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,921
Hold on. It's...

653
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,657
Pelican Electronics
Myeonsu-ri Research Institute,

654
00:41:32,191 --> 00:41:34,293
23-1 Aewon-eup.

655
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,263
Yes, good day.

656
00:41:39,031 --> 00:41:41,601
Who was it that you gave them
the address of the lab?

657
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,502
A deliveryman.

658
00:41:43,882 --> 00:41:46,105
- What?
- He needs Ms. Byun's package...

659
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:47,473
to deliver, but she moved
to a different place.

660
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:50,409
Maybe she was too busy
to take the call.

661
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:51,677
But...

662
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:53,864
it's a little strange.

663
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:55,581
- What do you mean?
- It's a different district.

664
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,851
I doubt the deliveryman would
go all the way there to deliver it.

665
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:00,732
Wait.

666
00:42:01,921 --> 00:42:04,023
I'll try calling the number.

667
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:10,529
Hello, this is Gorae High School.

668
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:12,398
It's Gorae High School.

669
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,934
Gorae High School?

670
00:42:22,327 --> 00:42:23,858
(A global laboratory that creates
an innovative business value)

671
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:33,072
The number you dialed...

672
00:42:33,074 --> 00:42:34,920
- is not available.
- She wouldn't pick up.

673
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:48,701
If you're done working,
stop annoying me and go home.

674
00:42:49,628 --> 00:42:50,736
Okay.

675
00:42:56,142 --> 00:42:57,458
(Seo Ji Sung)

676
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,614
Hi, Ji Sung.

677
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,885
Okay, I'll be right there.

678
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:09,322
Oh Jung, I need to borrow your car.

679
00:43:11,143 --> 00:43:13,143
Make sure you do well
with this date.

680
00:43:16,769 --> 00:43:18,464
Why isn't she answering?

681
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:26,138
Can you still not reach Ha Ri?

682
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,574
No, someone has to be on duty
even if it's the weekend,

683
00:43:28,574 --> 00:43:30,009
but no one is answering.

684
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:32,211
Are you sure
that man went to see her?

685
00:43:32,437 --> 00:43:34,347
Yes, he's on his way
to Myeonsu-ri now.

686
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:37,016
How do you know?

687
00:43:38,331 --> 00:43:40,252
I'm a computer expert, you know.

688
00:43:41,247 --> 00:43:43,556
I wonder if the police
will come right away.

689
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,788
I've called
the police station nearby.

690
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,927
But I'm not sure
because we have no direct evidence.

691
00:43:48,347 --> 00:43:49,695
Let's hurry up a little more.

692
00:43:55,874 --> 00:43:57,603
I better call Ms. Seo.

693
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:03,809
Ms. Seo, I've finally resolved...

694
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,680
Kang Hyun Soo is on his way there.
Run away now.

695
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,216
The last signal was around here.

696
00:44:44,791 --> 00:44:46,352
- Let's try going this way.
- Okay.

697
00:44:50,636 --> 00:44:51,657
Ha Ri.

698
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:54,660
I reflected on myself
while you were away.

699
00:44:56,942 --> 00:44:58,798
I'm really sorry.

700
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,860
I don't know why
I made such a mistake.

701
00:45:04,377 --> 00:45:06,105
I regret it so much.

702
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,673
It wasn't a mistake.

703
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:09,642
You beat up other women too.

704
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:15,214
How did you know?

705
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,716
How?

706
00:45:19,105 --> 00:45:20,653
I don't have to answer you.

707
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:23,355
We're over now, so please stop.

708
00:45:25,163 --> 00:45:26,425
Who says we're over?

709
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,793
Well?

710
00:45:27,793 --> 00:45:30,529
- I'm going to scream.
- Go ahead.

711
00:45:30,749 --> 00:45:34,033
Wild boars and elks
might come to help you.

712
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:35,601
Help.

713
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,471
Help!

714
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,640
- I think it's there. Hurry.
- Let's go.

715
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:43,676
- Help!
- Stop.

716
00:45:47,693 --> 00:45:49,882
Sorry.

717
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:51,817
It was a mistake.

718
00:45:52,304 --> 00:45:53,419
Did it hurt?

719
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,159
Let's not do this, please.

720
00:46:00,526 --> 00:46:02,194
Like we used to...

721
00:46:02,655 --> 00:46:05,264
When we made up,

722
00:46:05,477 --> 00:46:07,933
we used to go
have tteokbokki together.

723
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:12,338
Let's go back and have tteokbokki.

724
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:17,743
Don't touch me.

725
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:20,546
I won't let you have your way
ever again, you jerk.

726
00:46:22,414 --> 00:46:24,216
I said I'm sorry.

727
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,188
- I said I'm sorry, you little...
- Kang Hyun Soo!

728
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:33,759
Don't come closer.

729
00:46:33,872 --> 00:46:35,494
I'll make you lose
your firefighter job.

730
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:38,197
No, Gook Hee.

731
00:46:39,919 --> 00:46:42,535
You loser. Was beating up women
not enough?

732
00:46:42,535 --> 00:46:43,802
Look at what you're doing.

733
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:45,905
What do you know?

734
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:48,107
I know that you're a total loser.

735
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:53,779
Ji Sung.

736
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:56,982
Bring it on.

737
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:02,922
Ms. Byun, get up quickly.

738
00:47:02,924 --> 00:47:04,490
Get up.

739
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,457
Hey.

740
00:47:06,458 --> 00:47:07,927
Let go!

741
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:13,332
Hey, you scum!

742
00:47:21,808 --> 00:47:23,342
Get up.

743
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,317
You jerk!

744
00:47:27,506 --> 00:47:28,414
Hey.

745
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:32,952
Civilians are allowed to arrest
a criminal in the act.

746
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,053
You know that, right?

747
00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:52,237
Thank you.

748
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:54,473
Don't worry and sleep tight.

749
00:47:54,593 --> 00:47:55,674
Okay.

750
00:48:15,989 --> 00:48:21,363
Tell Mr. Gam's kids that I'll load
the BB guns full.

751
00:48:21,388 --> 00:48:23,206
When did you take that?

752
00:48:23,206 --> 00:48:25,457
I took it just in case.

753
00:48:25,457 --> 00:48:27,209
Don't you ever do that again.

754
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,054
Do you know how dangerous that is?

755
00:48:32,214 --> 00:48:36,839
It often becomes a big issue
when a public servant gets involved.

756
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:39,722
And who knows what nonsense...

757
00:48:39,722 --> 00:48:41,722
Kang Hyun Soo will post
about you online.

758
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:47,782
Did you step up because you wanted
to protect me?

759
00:48:47,782 --> 00:48:48,840
Yes.

760
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:59,140
There's no rule that only men
can protect women.

761
00:49:00,801 --> 00:49:02,801
I sounded cool, right?

762
00:49:03,509 --> 00:49:04,958
Yes.

763
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:06,649
You're really cool.

764
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:20,090
What's wrong with the car?

765
00:49:20,115 --> 00:49:21,660
Is it okay?

766
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,874
It's a little old, but Oh Jung takes
good care of it, so it'll be fine.

767
00:49:30,624 --> 00:49:31,946
What happened?

768
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,369
What's wrong with this?

769
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:35,707
I thought you said
that it'd be fine.

770
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:47,186
The bus stop is somewhere around,

771
00:49:47,841 --> 00:49:50,689
but I can't tell where we are.

772
00:49:52,653 --> 00:49:55,445
Do you know where we're heading?

773
00:49:57,585 --> 00:50:02,701
Yes, I'm following the Big Dipper.

774
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,957
The Big Dipper?

775
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:07,669
Yes.

776
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:13,964
I think my grandmother told me
about it once.

777
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:32,482
This is quite a nice date too.

778
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:37,491
I wasn't calling Gook Hee today.

779
00:50:37,491 --> 00:50:40,332
I was calling Mr. Jung
at the fire station.

780
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:41,493
You know that, right?

781
00:50:51,854 --> 00:50:54,855
This is how you're going
to answer me?

782
00:50:55,151 --> 00:50:57,151
His hand is sweating like crazy.

783
00:50:58,676 --> 00:51:01,011
Maybe he's nervous.

784
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:10,370
<i>A sunny morning</i>

785
00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:14,873
<i>I'm walking in the woods</i>

786
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:19,393
<i>I'm walking through the narrow path</i>

787
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:23,381
<i>That you and I used to walk together</i>

788
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:27,409
<i>I see your face smiling</i>

789
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:31,547
<i>On a purple flower</i>

790
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:36,013
<i>I tried to reach out to touch it,</i>

791
00:51:36,013 --> 00:51:39,899
<i>But you're gone</i>

792
00:51:39,899 --> 00:51:44,215
<i>Oh, how I miss</i>

793
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:48,406
<i>Our good old days</i>

794
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:56,937
<i>Stories of love engraved
in the petals</i>

795
00:51:56,937 --> 00:52:01,473
<i>Oh, how I miss</i>

796
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:05,830
<i>Our good old days</i>

797
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:14,413
<i>Flower petals are showering
down in my heart</i>

798
00:52:18,642 --> 00:52:21,542
(You have a new message.)

799
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:26,283
I bought some chocolates,
your favorite.

800
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:27,661
I miss you.

801
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,469
Hey!

802
00:52:48,007 --> 00:52:49,470
When did you get here?

803
00:52:49,722 --> 00:52:52,428
Come on.
You're making me embarrassed.

804
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:53,905
You have to act
at least a little bit surprised.

805
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:57,967
There are too many surprises
in my life. This is nothing.

806
00:52:58,482 --> 00:53:00,027
What brings you all the way here
at this hour?

807
00:53:00,027 --> 00:53:03,536
What are you doing here?
It's well past your hours.

808
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:06,484
I just have something
I want to think about.

809
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:08,059
Psych!

810
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,842
I also had something on my mind,
so I was taking a walk.

811
00:53:10,842 --> 00:53:14,158
What were you thinking about
that you came all the way here?

812
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:19,832
I'm hungry. What's the best food
I can possibly eat in Gorae-dong?

813
00:53:19,832 --> 00:53:22,753
Everyone is at the camp,
so I got off of work early.

814
00:53:22,753 --> 00:53:26,505
I'm thinking of eating junk food.
Any recommendations?

815
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:27,911
- Junk food?
- Yes.

816
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,362
What about this?

817
00:54:07,761 --> 00:54:12,450
The stop is much closer
than I had expected.

818
00:54:12,878 --> 00:54:15,955
We still walked
for about 30 minutes.

819
00:54:16,305 --> 00:54:17,959
Really?

820
00:54:22,461 --> 00:54:23,957
- I'm sorry.
- What?

821
00:54:23,957 --> 00:54:25,467
For holding your hand.

822
00:54:27,925 --> 00:54:29,657
That's fine.

823
00:54:30,813 --> 00:54:33,724
It'd be weird
if you asked first anyway.

824
00:54:34,995 --> 00:54:39,327
Wild boars often appear around here,
so I held your hand just in case.

825
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,950
You held my hand because of boars?

826
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:49,092
- You sang for the boars too?
- Yes.

827
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:53,592
I heard that boars are
more aggressive when it's quiet.

828
00:54:57,966 --> 00:54:59,500
I see.

829
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,252
They're aggressive.

830
00:55:03,409 --> 00:55:06,256
I'll check when the last bus
is coming.

831
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,349
A moth!

832
00:55:32,878 --> 00:55:34,676
Well,

833
00:55:35,138 --> 00:55:36,221
I...

834
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,540
It was the moth.

835
00:55:47,854 --> 00:55:49,299
What?

836
00:55:49,776 --> 00:55:52,191
Is it the boars again?

837
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:56,619
No.

838
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:01,663
The biggest fear of developers
is bugs.

839
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:05,485
How do we debug them?

840
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,319
I missed you.

841
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:16,714
I can't date you like this.

842
00:56:17,685 --> 00:56:18,890
Let's...

843
00:56:22,518 --> 00:56:23,836
get married.

844
00:56:25,608 --> 00:56:30,508
Developers enter a command
that not even they ever thought of.

845
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:33,093
Have a drink.

846
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:38,950
Is something wrong?

847
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:45,362
Knowing that every code has a bug,
we still believe in them.

848
00:56:45,387 --> 00:56:47,387
I'm thinking of getting a divorce.

849
00:56:49,515 --> 00:56:52,211
We tell ourselves
that the man in front of us...

850
00:56:52,211 --> 00:56:54,211
will not be a bug...

851
00:56:54,597 --> 00:56:56,116
in my life.

852
00:58:13,193 --> 00:58:15,145
(Please Don't Date Him)

853
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,927
That puts me in a difficult place!

854
00:58:27,927 --> 00:58:29,976
Me too!

855
00:58:29,976 --> 00:58:31,805
Your sweater is going to get dirty.

856
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:34,827
I don't approve of this marriage.

857
00:58:35,204 --> 00:58:36,271
I guess I'm not late.

858
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:37,521
- Dad!
- Honey!

859
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:39,384
This is the highlight of today.

860
00:58:39,384 --> 00:58:41,046
We're holding a small
and luxurious wedding.

861
00:58:41,046 --> 00:58:44,847
<i>- Heung Boo is speechless
- Heung Boo is speechless</i>

862
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:50,375
What does that firefighter have
that I don't?

863
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,278
Fame to be the most-searched name
online?

864
00:58:53,513 --> 00:58:54,515
Hold on!

865
00:58:54,515 --> 00:58:56,430
- What happened?
- I'm sorry.

866
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:58,081
Just one last time.

867
00:58:58,106 --> 00:58:59,239
Jae Min?

868
00:58:59,239 --> 00:59:00,279
That's Gook Hee.

869
00:59:00,279 --> 00:59:03,342
Why is his name Jae Min?
