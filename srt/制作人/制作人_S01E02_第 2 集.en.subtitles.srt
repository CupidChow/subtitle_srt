1
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,110
She will be supervising
today's afternoon OJT.

2
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,845
She's the heart
of the entertainment department.

3
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,013
The oldest woman.

4
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,081
Yes...

5
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,384
But seriously, who parks like this?

6
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,819
Talk about manners! Jeez...

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,687
Fight? Who's going to fight?

8
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,890
How could I fight with her?

9
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,158
I'm going to scold her.

10
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,060
According to KBS regulations...

11
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:03,196
I clearly told you to change outfits.

12
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,531
Isn't this pretty?

13
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,866
Yes, it's pretty.

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,770
Someone I like

15
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,173
works in the entertainment department.

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,141
I want to be close to her.

17
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,310
-It's you, right?
-Yes, Hye-ju.

18
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,645
We go to the same church.

19
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,381
-Actually, we went to the same college.
-You used to live in Sillim-dong.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,917
Actually, I have been living
in Yeouido ever since I was born.

21
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:27,053
Isn't that the assistant producer
for Entertainment Weekly? Shin Hye-ju?

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,022
I heard they were dating.
I guess it's true.

23
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:31,491
See? They're dating.

24
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,860
That Jun-mo has game.

25
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,764
-Two Days and One Night!
-Two Days and One Night!

26
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,933
You said shooting a variety show

27
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:42,035
with older women was a good idea.

28
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,671
Yes, that's why you should've done
a better job.

29
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,344
How could I not hit your door?

30
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,846
Shall I back my car out first then?

31
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,348
Forget it! I'm already in.

32
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,206
When I was in elementary school,

33
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,843
I would walk Ye-jin home
every day after school.

34
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:32,385
It wasn't because
I thought she was pretty,

35
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,787
or because I wanted to protect her.

36
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,994
It was the elevator.

37
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,271
I just wanted to ride the elevator.

38
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,744
You're lucky. You live in an apartment,

39
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,646
so you get to ride an elevator every day.

40
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,715
Ask your dad to buy you one.

41
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,918
My dad doesn't have any money.

42
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,555
Then ask your mom.

43
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,766
I begged my mom

44
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,235
to buy Ye-jin's apartment.

45
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,571
My mom actually did it.

46
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,005
YE-JIN'S HOUSE

47
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,807
Ye-jin's family needed money urgently

48
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,210
after business trouble
in the 1997 financial crisis.

49
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,813
My mom bought their apartment
at a ridiculously low price.

50
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,783
The apartment increased in value
several times over.

51
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,587
My mom made a killing in real estate
in the 1990s.

52
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:43,256
She bought property
in the increasingly costly

53
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,791
areas of Yeouido, Bundang, and Banpo.

54
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:48,061
She brought our family the good fortune
that my father could not.

55
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,964
That's how the apartment in Yeouido

56
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,533
became my very own home.

57
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,339
That is,

58
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,209
until the unbelievable incident
happened two months ago.

59
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,046
My lease expires at the end of February.

60
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,316
I move into my new apartment
in Dongtan at the end of June.

61
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,352
That's a four-month gap.

62
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,287
Couldn't they give me

63
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,791
an extension of my lease
for just four months?

64
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,861
But the landlord said no.

65
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:25,665
He said to fully renew the lease
or just move out.

66
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,668
I'm about to end up on the streets!

67
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,204
Renew the lease.

68
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,506
He's raising the deposit
by 200 million won.

69
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,408
By 200 million won?

70
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:38,411
If I took out a loan
for 200 million won...

71
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,947
I'm supposed to move into a new building,

72
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:44,717
so do you think that nasty landlord
would return my money?

73
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,389
Is there a place you can rent short-term?

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,723
For just four months?

75
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,559
Then I have to pay double
for moving fees and a real estate agent.

76
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,230
It's not just stuff that I have to move.

77
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,166
I have to transfer my Internet service,
gas service,

78
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,135
cable TV service, my home phone number...

79
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,371
When I move,
I have to pay a fee to use the elevator.

80
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,207
I have to pay separately
to move in and out.

81
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,677
And some places make you pay a fee

82
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,079
to have the stairs cleaned.

83
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,981
I have to settle all maintenance fees

84
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,483
and the repair allowance
with the landlord.

85
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,920
Hey, you think moving is that easy?

86
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,990
Won't the moving company
do all that stuff?

87
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,126
Oh, you're so lucky you own a home.

88
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,295
I'm so envious of you.

89
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,265
So do you have a plan?

90
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,335
What plan?

91
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,137
I'll just put all my stuff in storage and

92
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:42,742
move into a study room or motel long-term.

93
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,945
Whatever. Just drink.

94
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,117
That's as far as I remember.

95
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,521
-But then...
-Leave that there.

96
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,757
That goes in that room over there.

97
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,991
Where should we put this?

98
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:00,226
Bring it into that room.

99
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,327
-That room?
-Yes.

100
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:04,163
-You have so many books.
-Be careful.

101
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,598
Where should we put the bed?

102
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,100
Put it in that room, too.

103
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,735
Got it.

104
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,672
Jun-mo.

105
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,575
You should use the master bedroom, right?

106
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,079
Bring it all the way in.

107
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,147
-Okay.
-Thanks.

108
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:26,285
"I, Ra Jun-mo, will provide
my friend Tak Ye-jin

109
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,421
free room and board
in my home for four months."

110
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,060
I wrote this?

111
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,063
That's your handwriting.
Even that thumbprint.

112
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,931
That's all yours.

113
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:46,406
Hey, how is your door passcode still 0000?

114
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,674
I'm changing it to my birthday.

115
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,178
Put that further back. Good.

116
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,150
YE-JIN'S HOUSE

117
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,653
Oh, dang it...

118
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,123
The promise I made
that I don't even remember

119
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,360
led to us temporarily living together.

120
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,531
I can't believe
I'm drinking with you again

121
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,734
after what you did to me. I must be crazy.

122
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,103
I need a drink today.

123
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,971
My car door banged into someone's car.

124
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,907
An imported car.

125
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:22,742
Are you kidding me?

126
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,344
The chief director wants to end my show.
What about me?

127
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,350
Wow, that's...

128
00:07:31,517 --> 00:07:33,352
The chief director? He went too far.

129
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,522
That's not right.

130
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:40,193
How could he? He can't do that.

131
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,562
No matter what anyone says,

132
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,832
I know how hard you worked on the show.

133
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:47,200
Forget it.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,136
You managed to cast Youn Yuh-jung,

135
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,672
and that was a huge win for you.

136
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,208
When you made that happen,

137
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,177
I realized that you were really a pro.

138
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,813
Stop it already.

139
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,049
Hey, back then,

140
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,418
how did you convince her to join the show?

141
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,788
She was on the fence when she got an offer
to do that show Three Meals a Day.

142
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,090
Don't you remember?

143
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,195
Who will want to watch you eat
three meals a day?

144
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,331
Anyone can eat three meals a day.

145
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,268
That Yeong-seok chose the wrong concept.

146
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,769
That show will fail big time.

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,905
If you get a good persona going,

148
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:30,309
this will get you
at least five commercial deals.

149
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,580
You know that I'm not concerned
with things like that.

150
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,482
Of course I know that.

151
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,822
Speaking of which,

152
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:46,592
what did she say when you told her
she has to leave the show?

153
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,861
I bet she got really angry.

154
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,030
Of course she would.

155
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,933
I haven't told her yet.

156
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:56,235
What?

157
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:57,670
About leaving the show.

158
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,071
I haven't told her yet.

159
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:01,407
What will you do?

160
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,553
What are you doing right now?

161
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,724
I became an entertainment producer

162
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,826
without really intending to,

163
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,028
and I'll be assigned to a show soon.

164
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,431
I figured I need to do some studying.

165
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,902
I'm looking over
the history of Korean comedy.

166
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,638
Tell us a bit of what you've learned.

167
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,540
Okay.

168
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,677
First, I'm analyzing and comparing the two

169
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:14,614
idiotic characters Young-gu and Maeng-gu.

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,748
There are many differences.

171
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,651
On the phonological side of things,

172
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,753
Maeng-gu speaks with a hoarse voice...

173
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,388
"Hello!"

174
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,558
That's how he sounds saying hello,

175
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:29,629
whereas Young-gu opens his mouth slightly

176
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,299
and speaks with a lisp,

177
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,935
but also, he uses his head voice.

178
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:38,471
"Young-gu isn't here." Like that.

179
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,042
"Young-gu isn't here."

180
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,613
Maeng-gu appears in
a very conventional community

181
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,583
such as Bongsunga School,

182
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,754
where he asks irrelevant questions that

183
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,590
incapacitate the authoritative system.

184
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,793
And as for comedy grounded in nihilism,

185
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,828
Young-gu did Unstoppable Lord Dong-gung

186
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,431
and Tomorrow's Champion.

187
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,901
As you can guess
from the titles of the skits,

188
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,337
he uses his comedy to express the sorrows

189
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,740
of the common people of society,

190
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,509
focusing on the archetype
of an anti-hero...

191
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,489
Hello again, Seung-chan.

192
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,625
You live here?

193
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:35,661
Yes. No. Well...

194
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,929
Actually...

195
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,231
Yes, I do live here.

196
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,002
Do you live here, too?

197
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,171
No. My boyfriend lives here.

198
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,942
Ra Jun-mo,
producer of Two Days and One Night.

199
00:11:50,843 --> 00:11:53,045
Oh, have you been assigned to a show?

200
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,247
Not yet.

201
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,449
Really?

202
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:59,085
Come to Entertainment Weekly.
That's where I am.

203
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,292
I don't know if Jun-mo is home.

204
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,230
Oh, he is.

205
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:13,632
That's his car over there.

206
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,476
I'm okay.

207
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:28,681
I tend to give up quickly
if things are hopeless.

208
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,817
To be honest,

209
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,953
it was a shock
to see them together earlier.

210
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,888
I am human, after all.

211
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:40,760
But it doesn't bother me at all now.

212
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:45,731
I hope the two of them are happy together.

213
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,782
I'm just thirsty.

214
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,185
Okay, here.

215
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,523
Where are you going?

216
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,393
Someone's out front to see me.

217
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,529
Who?

218
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:17,863
Someone.

219
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
So it's a girl.

220
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,401
Who is it? Hye-ju?

221
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,836
Pretend not to know.

222
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,971
If you wanted to keep it a secret,

223
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,073
why did you go public
with your relationship?

224
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,910
What a scene that was.

225
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,645
You saw us?

226
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,814
So did everyone in the control booth.

227
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,050
Hey, are you getting married this fall?

228
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,053
What are you talking about? No way.

229
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,454
It's not that kind of relationship.

230
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:46,325
Hye-ju has been telling everyone
that you two are getting married.

231
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,361
At this rate, she's going to try out
wedding dresses soon.

232
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,630
Why is she in such a rush?

233
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,399
I told her clearly.

234
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,868
-You did?
-Yes. I texted her.

235
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,002
I was very clear.

236
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,307
"Let's focus on work
at the workplace." Like that.

237
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,241
What did she say?

238
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,542
She texted me back.

239
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,212
"I love it that you're so professional.

240
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:07,213
Okay.

241
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,515
We'll keep our love
outside the workplace."

242
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,384
-Jeez...
-Right?

243
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,920
She doesn't seem to get the picture.

244
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,523
Who would understand
when you say it like that?

245
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,924
Are you a dolphin?

246
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,926
Do you communicate through
ultrasonic waves?

247
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,796
Jeez, if you're not that into her,

248
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,632
tell her clearly and draw the line!

249
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,033
But still,

250
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:32,304
I don't know what woman
I'll meet in my life.

251
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,007
To draw the line like that...

252
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,109
That's so...

253
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,979
Fine, I'll tell her.

254
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,914
Guys like you are the worst!

255
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,184
You hate delivering bad news,
so you make other people do it!

256
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,088
Look, there's etiquette
when it comes to breaking up.

257
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,056
I got it! Are you my wife?

258
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:52,191
So much nagging...

259
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:57,096
Hey! If a guy has a messy personal life,
his work won't go well!

260
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:02,601
You're the biggest mess
in my personal life!

261
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,604
And him.

262
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:11,744
You two are
the biggest messes in my personal life!

263
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,080
Hold on.

264
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:16,715
What's wrong, Jun-mo?

265
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,885
Did my big sister tick you off?

266
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,654
Come on!

267
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,791
Jun-mo, do I get on your nerves?

268
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,360
What if I only come once every three days?

269
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,333
Can't you stay on his good side?

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,088
Did anything happen between you two?

271
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,890
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,896
Do you know why I always ring the bell
before entering the passcode?

273
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,266
It's in case you two are up to something.

274
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,669
This is how good my manners are.

275
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,770
You're crazy...

276
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,309
But seriously, we can't forget.

277
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,478
This was originally our house.

278
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,046
We have to get it back.

279
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,218
The easiest way
would be for you to marry Jun-mo.

280
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:27,453
If you want it so much,

281
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,388
make money and buy it back.

282
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:32,024
Ye-jin.

283
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,027
As a future doctor,
I have told you many times.

284
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,563
Being a doctor these days
isn't what it used to be.

285
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,798
Two out of five people who apply for

286
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,500
personal rehabilitation are doctors.

287
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,669
It'll go faster if you seduce him.

288
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:45,971
Stop talking nonsense!

289
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:48,073
But do you have any money?

290
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,708
Do you think I do?

291
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,113
I scraped an imported car today.

292
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,015
I'm going to have to cover the damages.

293
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,784
An imported car? Is it a guy's car?

294
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,120
If he's a bachelor, seduce him.

295
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,355
Is that all you can say?

296
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,491
He's a newbie and my junior.

297
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,161
You think he'd really ask me for money?

298
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,731
It's not his car. It's his dad's.

299
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,201
Would his dad really ask for my money?

300
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,836
We should be compensated.

301
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,639
If you tell her not to pay for it,

302
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,175
she'll think you're an arrogant junior.

303
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,410
It isn't proper etiquette.

304
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:27,379
Yes. She said not to go easy on her

305
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,981
just because I know her,

306
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,949
and that she's not that kind of person.

307
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,317
She's rational.

308
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,552
Of course she should say that.

309
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,023
Oh, right. My high school friend
has something to report to you.

310
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,024
What is it?

311
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,860
He has a successful bakery in Hongje,

312
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,563
but since a franchise is coming in,

313
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,498
the landlord's evicting him
with no premium.

314
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,169
Why would he tell me that?

315
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:51,437
Why?

316
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,905
When I said my son is a KBS producer,

317
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,407
he said this should air on PD Notebook.

318
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,709
That's an MBC show.

319
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,945
Really? There's also In-Depth 60 Minutes.

320
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,780
But I work
in the entertainment department, Dad.

321
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,515
What's that?

322
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:07,286
You know, the shows with comedians.

323
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,421
Where singers goof off and stuff.

324
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,322
What?

325
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,692
Why would you go there?

326
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,295
Is it because he has no connections?

327
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,397
That's unrelated--

328
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,799
Don't you know someone at KBS?

329
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:22,067
I do.

330
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,104
The manager of the parking lot there.

331
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,773
Should I call him?

332
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,548
What loser hung his trash on my car?

333
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,351
Dang it...

334
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,421
There are so many crazy people these days.

335
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:48,193
-This country is a mess.
-How did he tie these on?

336
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,097
Dang it! I can't untie this!

337
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,673
Good work on your training and OJT.

338
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,542
It's time to be assigned to your shows.

339
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:08,814
Once you're assigned to a show,
go say hello to your senior colleagues

340
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,415
and make your dreams come true.

341
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,884
You've been honing your skills for this.

342
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,852
You've all got what it takes.

343
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,554
Yes.

344
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,624
Okay, Ju Jong-hyeon.

345
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,893
-What was your first choice?
-You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook.

346
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,661
-You're going to Let's Go! Dream Team.
-Thank...

347
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,097
-Bang-geul.
-Yes?

348
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,699
-You wanted Happy Together.
-Yes.

349
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,334
You're going to Safety First!

350
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,539
I'll do my best.

351
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,773
That's the spirit.

352
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,411
-Next is Baek Seung-chan.
-Yes.

353
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,614
You wanted Entertainment Weekly?

354
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,586
-Yes...
-What a unique guy.

355
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,587
Very impressive.

356
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,323
You're the first newbie
to sign up for Entertainment Weekly.

357
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,593
It's a tough show,
so most people don't want to do it.

358
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:56,628
I'll do my best.

359
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,163
Good.

360
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,831
You're going to Two Days and One Night.

361
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,303
Things aren't so good with that team now.

362
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,606
Go and cheer up your senior colleagues.

363
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,041
Okay.

364
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:29,861
VIEWER RATINGS

365
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,763
YOUN YUH-JUNG, HWANG SHIN-HYE,
GEUM BO-RA, HYUN YOUNG

366
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,864
FAREWELL PARTY AT BIBONG

367
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,771
Hello. I'm new employee Baek Seung--

368
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,978
Is nobody going to talk?

369
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,314
This is when we need ideas.

370
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,217
Where's Writer Choi? Mapo Bridge again?

371
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:53,819
Seogang Bridge...

372
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:55,821
She lives in Seoraemaeul!

373
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,756
Why is she crossing Seogang Bridge?

374
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:59,491
What's wrong with her?

375
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,362
That chair's broken.

376
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,511
Oh, right.

377
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,748
Youn Yuh-jung got a casting call
from a different variety show.

378
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,649
Right.

379
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:25,350
Oh, that?

380
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,654
We told her Jun-mo wouldn't let her
appear on both shows.

381
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,555
She probably agreed not to do it.

382
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,523
Already?

383
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,294
Since when did you guys work so quickly?

384
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,062
You're not usually like that.

385
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,099
Hey, newbie.

386
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:42,501
What's your name?

387
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,337
Baek Seung-chan.

388
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,706
Okay. You go first.

389
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,207
What should we do?

390
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:52,511
Excuse me? About what?

391
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,946
To sum up the situation,

392
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:58,617
our show was a failure,
and we have to change the entire cast.

393
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,953
How can we minimize getting yelled at
when we break the news to them?

394
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,355
That's the issue.

395
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:06,558
It's okay.

396
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,593
Newbies can say anything on their mind.

397
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,495
I used to say 100 ideas at a time.

398
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,797
Yes, that's right.

399
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,800
If you talk without knowing anything,
good ideas can come out.

400
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:28,480
In this situation...

401
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:34,553
We should just gather them all together...

402
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,056
and tell them honestly...

403
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,060
Hey, don't you know how scary
a bunch of middle-aged ladies can be?

404
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:44,896
How could you speak so thoughtlessly?

405
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,766
I guess they gave us someone slow,
since our show is a failure.

406
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:49,868
Why couldn't it be someone smart?

407
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,406
Hey, print the schedule out.

408
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:55,707
Let's look over it.

409
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,809
We're out of toner.

410
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,579
Newbie.

411
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,247
Go to administration and get some toner.

412
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:03,515
Okay.

413
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:26,638
I'm from Two Days and One Night.

414
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,074
-We need toner...
-No.

415
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,910
Your team got toner last month.

416
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:35,180
I see. Got it.

417
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:41,753
It's important to avoid getting chewed out
when we break the news,

418
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,790
but so is not getting chewed out
at the farewell party.

419
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,625
In terms of risk management.

420
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:47,759
What risk?

421
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,127
The issue of seating.

422
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,529
At the last party,

423
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,265
there was tension
between Shin-hye and Bo-ra

424
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,033
over who would have the better seat.

425
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,768
Isn't Bo-ra older than Shin-hye?

426
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,804
They're actually the same age.

427
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,309
Shin-hye thinks she ranks higher
because her birthday comes first,

428
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,945
and Bo-ra thinks she ranks higher because

429
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,447
she debuted earlier.

430
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,983
Seriously...

431
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,387
In that case, how about we seat Bo-ra

432
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,088
at the head of the table?

433
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,026
Then we'll seat Tae-ho next to Shin-hye.

434
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,762
They won't know which seat is higher.

435
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:25,964
Wait.

436
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,967
We have to print the Bibong seating chart.

437
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:32,137
Where's the toner?

438
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,407
She said no,
since you got some last month.

439
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,043
What? We can't print anything right now!

440
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,244
Go get some now.

441
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,679
Okay.

442
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:46,751
We really need toner right now...

443
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,121
Did you shake it?

444
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:51,590
Excuse me?

445
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,461
Did you shake the toner cartridge?

446
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,696
No. I...

447
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,831
No.

448
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:01,533
Try shaking it.

449
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,471
Okay.

450
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:12,177
FAREWELL PARTY AT BIBONG
TELL THEM THEY ARE LAID OFF

451
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:19,618
Bo-ra likes you, Hyeong-geun,
so you tell her.

452
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:23,555
Well, she'll accept it.
She's gone through it many times.

453
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:24,456
Oh, right.

454
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:26,324
Make sure you tell them all

455
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:29,227
that we booked a room
with floor seating for the party.

456
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,329
If we don't tell them like before,

457
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:34,099
and someone gets annoyed
because they wore long boots,

458
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:35,133
that would be bad.

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,636
And when you break the news to them,

460
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,538
time it after they go to the salon.

461
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,706
Ladies are happy
after getting their hair done.

462
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:44,042
It's better to tell them then--

463
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,212
What are you doing over there?

464
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,017
Well...

465
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,819
She said to shake the toner cartridge.

466
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,926
It's been shaken to death already.

467
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,261
You think we didn't try that already?

468
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,966
Ko Yang-mi in administration.

469
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,068
She's really influential
in our department.

470
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,138
She's the queen of office equipment.

471
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,809
No program has ever survived
after getting on her bad side.

472
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:22,914
Hi, Yang-mi.

473
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,419
Our team's script fees came in today.

474
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,921
Make the assistant producer
post the files on time.

475
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,856
Have I ever been late on payments?

476
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,594
I know. You're very precise.

477
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,165
This is a limited burger set this season.

478
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:41,099
Have you tried it?

479
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,369
You eat it. I don't like junk food.

480
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:49,407
The Return of Superman team
got me a whole box of detox juice.

481
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,712
The successful teams are indeed different.

482
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:57,182
Of course.

483
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:01,386
No wonder you have such a perfect body.

484
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,525
Shall I bring you
organic dried sweet potatoes later?

485
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,929
Hey, come closer.

486
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:14,666
Don't ask me.

487
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,802
Just bring some if you want to.

488
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,572
I better do that.

489
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:22,140
Here, Yang-mi.

490
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:25,877
By the way, Yang-mi.

491
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,213
Can we have a toner cartridge?

492
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,732
Use it sparingly.

493
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:50,602
Of course, Yang-mi.

494
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,637
Thank you.

495
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,046
It was like watching
two martial arts masters fight.

496
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:05,550
I almost applauded at the end.

497
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,662
TONER CARTRIDGE RECYCLING

498
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,038
Hi there.

499
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:29,607
So, have you talked to your dad?

500
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,643
Oh. Yes.

501
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,312
He texted me a little while ago.

502
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,347
He went to a service center.

503
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,016
The repair estimate is...

504
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,155
about 830,000 won.

505
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,729
Are you sure that
your dad isn't getting ripped off?

506
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,832
What I mean is...

507
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,967
There are lots of service centers.

508
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,435
You never know.

509
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,104
Or he could negotiate.

510
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:01,339
Yes.

511
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,374
I'll ask my dad again.

512
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,176
Yes. Do that.

513
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,082
Without a suit, you do look like a newbie.

514
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,486
Nice outfit.

515
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,221
You look good.

516
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:19,691
Something's on your face.

517
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,293
Not there.

518
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:23,828
Oh...

519
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,803
There. All clean.

520
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,774
Thank you.

521
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,076
It was nothing.

522
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,111
Text me when you hear from your dad.

523
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,113
You have my number, right?

524
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:43,581
Yes, I do.

525
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,250
Good.

526
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,418
Tell me if you're ever having a hard time.

527
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,120
Work hard.

528
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:54,092
About 830,000 won...

00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,047
Producer.

533
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,255
Manager Kim, you're here alone?

534
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,590
Yes.

535
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:29,694
I wanted CEO Byun here.

536
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:30,895
Right...

537
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,631
She's overseas.

538
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,667
Where?

539
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:38,670
-Excuse me?
-Where overseas?

540
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,040
The main singer of her agency
just started working

541
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,442
to promote her new album,

542
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,111
so what country did she rush off to?

543
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,279
Japan?

544
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:49,647
China?

545
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,516
She went to South America.

546
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,151
Where in South America?

547
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,426
Just let it go, Producer Tak.

548
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,962
-What?
-It was a good performance.

549
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:07,532
The artist was satisfied, too,
and the reaction has been positive.

550
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,834
Things are noisy on the Internet,

551
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,903
but things like that always happen.

552
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,972
No need to blow things out of proportion.

553
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,341
Where is CEO Byun right now?

554
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,379
Manager Kim,
is it your first day on the job?

555
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:25,083
No need to tell me
what people like her say.

556
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,217
Just end it here.

557
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,420
She's dropping our rookie artists?

558
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,556
Tell her to go ahead.

559
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,625
We just need MBC and SBS.

560
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,527
KBS isn't dropping us.

561
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,730
We're boycotting them.

562
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:42,300
Is the Music Bank producer complaining?

563
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,469
Don't worry about it.

564
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:47,572
Artists shouldn't worry about such things.

565
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:48,706
I'm not worrying.

566
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,814
-Hello!
-Hello!

567
00:31:56,881 --> 00:31:58,850
Oh, hey.

568
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,352
Cindy, these are our trainees.

569
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,522
They're eating just one sweet potato a day

570
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,724
and practicing very hard.

571
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,227
You're working hard, right?

572
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,328
Yes.

573
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,400
But...

574
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,003
Why aren't you losing weight?

575
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,741
You eat one sweet potato a day
and dance for 12 hours.

576
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,543
Mr. Park.

577
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,878
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:32,517
Look through this week's CCTV footage
at the convenience store nearby.

579
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,188
Bring me the list of kids who bought

580
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,057
instant noodles and pastries at night.

581
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:40,591
Yes.

582
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:56,507
Listen, dummies. Order in.

583
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,277
There are no surveillance cameras
at the side door.

584
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,381
And here's my advice.

585
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:08,820
Quit and go home. Don't go through this.

586
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,125
So...

587
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:17,261
My fairies have something to say?

588
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,196
Yes.

589
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,566
Not to you, ma'am. To Cindy.

590
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,869
Cindy, answer us.

591
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:27,505
We're Pinky4 because there are four of us.

592
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,240
How can you drop out?

593
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,976
We've not worked as Pinky4
in over two years.

594
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,611
But this isn't right.

595
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,447
If you release a solo album,
our group will be disbanded.

596
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,915
I know.

597
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,052
And you'll stop getting
that cut of the money

598
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,423
you've been receiving
even when I worked alone.

599
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,292
I feel bad about that.

600
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:52,930
All I've done is just make money.
I didn't have time to spend it.

601
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,968
But you guys got to travel overseas
and go to graduate school with the money.

602
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,569
You've been enjoying life.

603
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:01,439
You think we didn't want to work?

604
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,809
The agency only books gigs for you.

605
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:06,811
What gigs?

606
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,213
You guys want gigs?

607
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,816
Well, something like an event.

608
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,419
It was my birthday last week,

609
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,953
and we didn't have a fan meeting.

610
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:18,222
Oh, a fan meeting?

611
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,158
Okay then.

612
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,994
It was your birthday,
so you're justified in saying that.

613
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,363
However...

614
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,666
Let's do some math. Listen up.

615
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,334
How much is it to book a venue?

616
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,403
At least 5 million won.

617
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,072
Will you just meet the fans?
You have to sing, too.

618
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,675
A band and instruments
will cost 5 million won.

619
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:40,178
Someone will have to introduce you.

620
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,347
You won't introduce yourself.
So you'll need a host, right?

621
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,317
Is that free? No.
That's another 5 million won.

622
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:48,786
The basic cost alone is 15 million won.

623
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:49,720
But...

624
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,458
How many of your fans would come?

625
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,827
I have over 300 people in my fan club.

626
00:34:57,161 --> 00:34:58,362
That's right.

627
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,532
But how many are paying members?

628
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,575
Last month,

629
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:13,111
it was eight people.

630
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,214
That's your current situation.

631
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,583
Even if you perform
at a university festival,

632
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:21,252
they'll only offer you
3 million won without Cindy.

633
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,854
Minus surtax, that's 2.7 million won.

634
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,090
But every time you do anything,
it costs us 5 million won.

635
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:29,627
Should I spend 5 million won
to make 2.7 million won?

636
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,965
If you got us some TV gigs,
our event rates would go up.

637
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:35,366
It's good you brought that up.

638
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,468
What show should I have you do?

639
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,405
You're not funny on talk shows.
You don't try hard on reality shows,

640
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,540
so they refuse to cast you.

641
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,009
I don't know about them,
but I was on the school track team.

642
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,480
Yet you came in last place at the
Idol Star Athletics Championships.

643
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,751
Use your heads, my fairies.

644
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:58,055
Remember to get this before you go home.

645
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,023
Get what?

646
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:01,659
A clue.

647
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,562
Get a clue, okay?

648
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,497
If we're done here, I'm leaving.

649
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:07,765
I have a shoot.

650
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,639
You've gotten so skinny, Cindy.

651
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:18,576
Get an IV at the emergency room
if you feel too fatigued.

652
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,660
All that's left to deal with
is Youn Yuh-jung.

653
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:42,934
Hey.

654
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,170
I really can't be the one to tell her.

655
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:49,507
How can I tell her to leave the show when
I'm the one who convinced her to do it?

656
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,008
I can't, either.

657
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,078
She doesn't like me, because she thinks
I only like Hwang Shin-hye.

658
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,313
I can't, either.

659
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,481
I aired something she said to edit out,

660
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,816
and she really chewed me out.

661
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,687
I told her the wrong schedule once,
and she said to stay out of her sight.

662
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:06,657
She dislikes me for no reason.

663
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,927
She doesn't like young and pretty girls.

664
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:13,631
She hates me.

665
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,002
So who's going to break the news?

666
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,670
Break the news about what?

667
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,343
-Hello.
-Hello.

668
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,577
Hey!

669
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:28,980
Cover that up!

670
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,148
So this is where you all work.

671
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,617
It's not as nice....

672
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,721
as I thought.

673
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:38,723
-I see.
-Yes.

674
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,759
Ms. Youn, what brings you here?

675
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:44,996
Today is our one-year anniversary party.

676
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,098
I'm the oldest one here.

677
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,733
I thought I should do something.

678
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:51,068
Dinner is on me.

679
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,837
No!

680
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:54,672
-Put that back.
-No, it's okay.

681
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,007
You don't have to...

682
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:57,041
-No.
-It's okay.

683
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,143
-I can spend this much.
-No, it's okay.

684
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,679
This show made me famous.

685
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,882
I've done TV dramas for dozens of years,

686
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:08,386
but after doing this show for a year,
everyone on the street recognizes me.

687
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,222
Even little kids point at me like this.

688
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,393
Though pointing is a bit disrespectful...

689
00:38:16,994 --> 00:38:18,696
Anyway, Producer Ra...

690
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,134
I used to look down on variety shows.

691
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,369
But I shouldn't have.

692
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,205
Now I understand what variety is about.

693
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:31,509
Yes. Of course, Ms. Youn.

694
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:33,811
So I'm going to work hard from now on.

695
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,947
Feel free to ask me to do anything.

696
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,082
Okay?

697
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:39,950
-Yes...
-Yes.

698
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:46,524
And I'll treat you all to dinner sometime,
someplace nice.

699
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,027
-See you later. I have to be somewhere.
-Okay.

700
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:50,961
-Okay.
-Okay.

701
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,463
-Goodbye, Ms. Youn!
-Goodbye, Ms. Youn!

702
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,171
Oh...

703
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,440
Okay. I won't look.

704
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,876
You're all planning on sending me
somewhere strange again, aren't you?

705
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:13,084
-See you later.
-Goodbye.

706
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,319
See you in a few hours.

707
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:21,692
Oh God...

708
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,197
Me? How am I scary?

709
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,033
I'm asking because I don't know.

710
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,868
You are a bit scary.

711
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,238
So how am I scary?

712
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,973
What about me is scary?

713
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:40,344
I just don't understand.

714
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,246
Am I scary like Yong-rim?

715
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,348
Kim Yong-rim looks scary without a doubt.

716
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,550
I'm not like that, right?

717
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,461
I'm going to Bibong with
Two Days and One Night team.

718
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,099
The new recruit welcome party
is also today at Second Round Bar.

719
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:04,168
Would you rather eat the course at Bibong

720
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,270
or the garlic chicken at Second Round Bar?

721
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:07,571
Go to both.

722
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,540
They'll run out of garlic chicken
if I go late.

723
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,309
The guy only makes
50 garlic chickens a day.

724
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,779
Why did it have to be the same day?

725
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,382
I should go to Bibong, right?
The food there is more expensive.

726
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,520
But I heard it's a farewell party
at Bibong.

727
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,421
It's true, right?

728
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,157
Things aren't going well
for Two Days and One Night.

729
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,558
Where did you hear that?

730
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:30,060
You have a strange talent
at finding such stuff out.

731
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,462
Look who you're talking to.

732
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,597
I have made it this far
thanks to my quick wits.

733
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:35,666
Is the show switching producers?

734
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,768
Why? Do you want to do the show?

735
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,271
Are you nuts? That show is a pain.

736
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,807
How about Choi Jae-won from Vitamin?

737
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,609
He's got skills.
He could be a new rising star at KBS.

738
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,646
That's unlike you.
Recommending someone else and all.

739
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,116
Send him to Two Days and One Night
and cast me in Vitamin.

740
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,853
It's monsoon season soon.
I'm sick of going to rural areas.

741
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,655
I want an indoor show.

742
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,024
The chief director doesn't like you.

743
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:02,226
How will you get a sweet gig like that?

744
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,862
Talk to the chief director for me.

745
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:05,963
He listens to you.

746
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,600
He only listens to me
because I don't talk to him about you.

747
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,669
You're really going to be like this?

748
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,938
You shouldn't treat me like this.

749
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:18,342
Poetess Lee Chae-nim once wrote this.

750
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,213
"It's hard to get someone to like you,

751
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,516
but easy to get them to dislike you."

752
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,585
It's partly your fault
that he dislikes me.

753
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,520
You're in charge of your life.

754
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:30,921
Don't blame me.

755
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:37,695
Sir.

756
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:42,266
I think the CEO will yell at me
for going over budget.

757
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,502
He doesn't give me much to work with.

758
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,804
How can I be more cost-effective?

759
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,074
That's just not going to work.

760
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:52,843
Just don't be at your desk today.

761
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,613
If you get a call,
say you're out at a meeting.

762
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,285
As long as you don't run into him today,
I think he might just let it slide.

763
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,387
Right? I should do that.

764
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,625
Just a moment! Wait!

765
00:42:07,925 --> 00:42:09,426
-Here you go, sir.
-Just get through today.

766
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:10,995
-Okay.
-I held the elevator for you.

767
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,175
"It's hard to get someone to like you,

768
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,645
but easy to get them to dislike you."

769
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:31,782
I hope Jun-mo has everything ready
for the farewell party.

770
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:33,951
I'm taking the stairs up.

771
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,228
We really have to decide now.

772
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,864
Among our team members,

773
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,599
who can tell Ms. Youn
she must quit the show

774
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:51,035
while offending her the least?

775
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,273
It must be someone
who didn't convince her to do the show,

776
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,076
who's not close with Hwang Shin-hye,

777
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,212
who hasn't been chewed out by her,

778
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,548
who is permitted to appear
in front of her,

779
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:08,419
who's not young and pretty...

780
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,157
Someone who is very unlike
that kind of girl.

781
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,664
We have someone.

782
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,068
How long have you been on our team?

783
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:27,271
Around five hours.

784
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:29,473
You're plenty qualified. Right?

785
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:32,843
Yes, you're pretty sharp.

786
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,944
I think you'll do fine.

787
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,614
This is what producers do.
You should learn.

788
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:38,916
Okay.

789
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,819
Where was Ms. Youn going before the party?

790
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:01,238
And you are?

791
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,539
Oh...

792
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:04,041
I'm with Two Days and One Night.

793
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,676
I'm Baek Seung-chan,
an assistant producer.

794
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,845
Right. You were in the office earlier.

795
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,715
Seeing you up close, you're handsome.

796
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,219
It's a shame you joined such a tough team.

797
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,288
It's not so bad now since it's warm out.

798
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:21,225
It was very tough during winter.

799
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,560
I'm worried about this winter now.

800
00:44:24,528 --> 00:44:26,397
Should I just quit the show?

801
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:28,399
Really?

802
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,335
I'm kidding. Why are you so shocked?

803
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,937
A variety producer can't get a joke?

804
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,807
I'm sorry.

805
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,143
So what did you want to tell me?

806
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:41,412
The thing is...

807
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,648
I have something to tell you.

808
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,084
So what is it?

809
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,923
Well, I think that as an actress,

810
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:58,162
you do much better in movies and dramas

811
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:02,599
than you do in variety shows...

812
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:03,634
Okay.

813
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,868
Excuse me?

814
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,437
I get what you're saying.

815
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:07,871
You can stop right there.

816
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:10,541
Sorry?

817
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,476
Someone must've told Producer Ra that

818
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,178
I got angry
since I didn't get much air time.

819
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,046
But look here.

820
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:18,015
How could I not get angry?

821
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,817
I'm an actress.

822
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,785
It's an hour-long variety show,

823
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:23,821
and I don't get a single solo shot.

824
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,089
Of course I'd get angry.

825
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,026
No, it's not about air time.

826
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,928
It's not?

827
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,430
No, it's not that.

828
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:39,269
Continuing with Two Days and One Night

829
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:41,205
like you're doing now...

830
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:44,475
Now I hear what you're trying to say.

831
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:46,510
Excuse me?

832
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,582
I know he's feeling sorry,
but there wasn't the need to send

833
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,117
his junior to come and tell me this.

834
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,017
I got your message.

835
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,688
Is that okay?

836
00:45:58,388 --> 00:45:59,523
Of course.

837
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:04,261
Go tell him I'll work harder from now on.

838
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:06,396
Excuse me?

839
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,867
You're saying I don't try hard enough.

840
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,736
It's not like that...

841
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,006
We're not saying you didn't try hard.

842
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,941
In fact, it's the opposite.

843
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,844
You try very hard, and you're great.

844
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,281
But recently, we decided that

845
00:46:24,381 --> 00:46:27,684
a major change is needed to the program...

846
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,654
Change...

847
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:34,091
So clever, beating around
the bush like that.

848
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,959
You'll be very successful.

849
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:37,127
Thank you.

850
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,930
Okay. I get it.

851
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,801
Going forth, the show will be
focusing on me, right?

852
00:46:44,568 --> 00:46:47,838
That's why you're telling me privately.

853
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,242
Okay. Go tell them.
I'll try my absolute hardest from now on.

854
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,177
Happy?

855
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,279
-Well--
-Hold on.

856
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:57,514
Hey, Min-hui.

857
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,151
I have a dinner appointment.

858
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,187
Yes?

859
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:04,888
Then I'll see you for just a moment.

860
00:47:05,022 --> 00:47:06,223
Okay.

861
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,560
Before I go to the dinner,

862
00:47:09,626 --> 00:47:11,395
I have to meet someone for a moment.

863
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:13,597
I see...

864
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,599
But Ms. Youn...

865
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,467
What? You want to hitch a ride?

866
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:20,470
No.

867
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:21,905
Then get out.

868
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,009
I said get out.

869
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:30,113
You think I still didn't understand you?

870
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:32,416
The truth is,

871
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:35,786
I know exactly what you wanted to tell me.

872
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,923
The news being this big, you could have
just told me when I visited you guys.

873
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,561
Really?

874
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,030
I've been in this industry for 40 years.

875
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,365
I can tell just by your face.

876
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,800
I know what you're trying to say.

877
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,704
Still not getting out?

878
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:15,092
They're going nuts thinking
that I'm going to leave the show.

879
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:22,099
She said she understood me...

880
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,568
But I don't think she did.

881
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:33,010
Do you know the phone number
of anyone on my team?

882
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,459
What's the phone number for KBS?

883
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,950
And you have your TV drama schedule...

884
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,689
Shin-hye...

885
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:20,624
No.

886
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,462
It's not because I feel regretful.

887
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:31,668
It's not because I'm embarrassed,
upset, or humiliated by being cut.

888
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,071
So don't misunderstand.

889
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,980
I'm really okay.

890
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,315
But what about Ms. Youn?

891
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,185
-You know how she is.
-Yes.

892
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,020
She might kill you guys.

893
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:52,723
How are you going to tell her?

894
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,429
Does she know?

895
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:03,467
Someone went to tell her now.

896
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,471
So as main producer, you didn't go to her.

897
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,374
You came to tell me first?

898
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,242
Yes.

899
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,812
Producer Ra, you're quite thoughtful.

900
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:16,713
Well...

901
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:19,383
Are we still having dinner?

902
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,752
Yes, of course.

903
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,887
Okay. Go ahead. I'm sure you're busy.

904
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:26,723
So I'll see you in a bit.

905
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,758
-See you later.
-Bye.

906
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,100
It's me.

907
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,435
Write an article saying

908
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:41,004
I chose to leave Two Days and One Night
because of my drama schedule.

909
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:45,142
Be sure to emphasize
that it was my choice.

910
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,177
Have it up by tomorrow morning, okay?

911
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,679
-You told her, right?
-Yes, I did.

912
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:51,848
I haven't heard from anyone yet.

913
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,183
I'm sure they're doing a good job.

914
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:57,721
Done.

915
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:02,325
Hey, what happened with the newbie?

916
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,560
We haven't heard from him yet.

917
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:05,896
Will they all show up?

918
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,264
What if they're all angry?

919
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,332
Don't underestimate Korean actresses.

920
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,767
They're great at hiding their emotions.

921
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,305
-Oh! Hello!
-Hello.

922
00:51:15,372 --> 00:51:17,941
Oh, I feel so bad.

923
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,576
Everyone has to leave the show

924
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:21,311
because of my drama schedule.

925
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,413
-Oh, no.
-That's okay.

926
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,582
So where is my seat?

927
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,284
-This one.
-It's here.

928
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:28,852
Next to the chief producer.

929
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,220
-Here?
-Yes, over here.

930
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,055
-Okay.
-Have a seat here.

931
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,392
-Hello.
-Hello!

932
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,594
-Where's my seat?
-This way.

933
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:39,029
-There?
-Yes.

934
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,499
-Ms. Youn will sit over there.
-Okay, sure.

935
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,534
-Hey.
-Hey.

936
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,037
Sorry, everyone.

937
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,406
Everyone has to quit because of me.

938
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:50,974
No, don't be.

939
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,244
I have three movies that I have to shoot

940
00:51:54,578 --> 00:51:57,247
so I was worried about
how I'd break the news.

941
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,582
It's all my fault.

942
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,051
I'm so sorry.

943
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:05,455
Goodness. I'm the one who's sorry.

944
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,225
It wouldn't have ended up
like this if I didn't need

945
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,060
to film a drama in China.

946
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:14,164
I need more than a few days to shoot it.

947
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,234
Wait, you're shooting a drama in China?

948
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:20,437
Oh, please. What's it called?

949
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:23,106
There's a drama.

950
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:25,475
It's in Chinese, so you wouldn't know.

951
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,248
Why isn't Ms. Youn here?

952
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,682
Call the newbie.

953
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,351
I don't have his number.

954
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,186
Does anyone have it?

955
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:37,220
I don't.

956
00:52:38,088 --> 00:52:39,756
-Hello.
-Hello.

957
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,857
-Hello.
-Hello.

958
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,527
-I had to meet someone, so I'm a bit late.
-That's okay.

959
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:46,263
-Have a seat. Sit down.
-Yes, please.

960
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,697
Ms. Youn, here's your seat.

961
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:03,847
Hey, Jun-mo.

962
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,248
Is everything taken care of?

963
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,717
Okay. I'll be right there.

964
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,820
They haven't served
the porridge yet, right?

965
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:15,592
When did you find out?

966
00:53:15,959 --> 00:53:17,160
Today.

967
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,696
The assistant producer called me.

968
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:21,665
Goodness...

969
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:23,633
They're terrible.

970
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:27,604
It's always like that in this industry.

971
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,973
You're going to China?

972
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,876
-Yes.
-Ms. Youn, have a shot.

973
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:34,511
Of course I will.

974
00:53:34,578 --> 00:53:36,880
I agreed to do this show because of you.

975
00:53:36,947 --> 00:53:38,882
-You know that, right?
-Of course I do.

976
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:44,154
I kept saying I wouldn't do it,

977
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:46,356
but he texted me every night.

978
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,226
And he always added a heart at the end.

979
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:50,894
So I ended up giving in.

980
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,066
Goodness!

981
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,768
You went to Bundang to buy this?

982
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:02,839
Yes. Producer Ra knows
you like the cakes from that bakery.

983
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,508
You always bought me cakes from there

984
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,744
when you tried to get me on the show.

985
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:12,415
Their cakes always sell out by noon.

986
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:16,653
Producer Ra, you're so thoughtful.

987
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,122
My pleasure.

988
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,925
Ms. Youn, thank you for your hard work.

989
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:24,995
What's with you acting like
we'll never see each other again?

990
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:26,596
Will you not see me anymore?

991
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,431
No. We'll see each other often.

992
00:54:28,965 --> 00:54:32,802
We made you do so many strange things.

993
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,138
Regardless, thank you for your efforts.

994
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,474
Oh, come on. Don't worry.

995
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,243
I said this earlier.
I'll work even harder.

996
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:48,051
Did you call the newbie?

997
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,497
DOOR SCRAPE

998
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,302
Hey, Seung-chan.

999
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:08,138
What is it? Any changes in the estimate?

1000
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,806
It's not that.
I'm sorry, but can you give me

1001
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:13,677
the phone number for the youngest writer
for Two Days and One Night?

1002
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:15,178
It's very urgent.

1003
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,619
-Hello? Producer Tak?
-No, it's nothing.

1004
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,753
Whose number?

1005
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:27,123
No, it's 8831.

1006
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:28,425
Yes. Not 331.

1007
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,761
Okay. Yes.

1008
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:34,531
Call me anytime if you have questions.

1009
00:55:35,398 --> 00:55:36,232
Bye.

1010
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,304
Dang it! That 830,000-won dude...

1011
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,174
Should I pay him and just kill him?

1012
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:45,775
Okay.

1013
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:49,879
Ladies.

1014
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,214
I can't believe this.

1015
00:55:51,548 --> 00:55:53,717
I'm late after fighting
with the chief director.

1016
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:57,087
-Light the candle.
-Okay.

1017
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,155
Why were you fighting with him?

1018
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,390
Why else?

1019
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,193
How could he do that to you ladies?

1020
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:04,427
What did he do?

1021
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:07,397
Oh, right. Where's the chief director?

1022
00:56:07,464 --> 00:56:10,967
This meeting is to cheer us on.
The chief director should be here too.

1023
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:12,335
What?

1024
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,238
Is Ms. Youn staying on the show?

1025
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,207
What do you mean?

1026
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:19,943
I thought we all had to leave.

1027
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:22,445
What happened?

1028
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:24,948
What is she talking about?

1029
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:29,886
Hold on.

1030
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:36,226
Is this a hidden camera prank?

1031
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,794
It is, right?

1032
00:56:38,194 --> 00:56:39,028
What?

1033
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,230
Is that what this is?

1034
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,599
A hidden camera prank?

1035
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:44,234
-I'm so quick to catch on!
-Is it a prank?

1036
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,635
Right? Am I not right?

1037
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:46,970
What's going on, Producer Ra?

1038
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:50,774
I'm sorry, Ms. Youn.

1039
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,944
The last shoot we did was our final one.

1040
00:56:56,146 --> 00:57:00,650
It turns out
we can't work together anymore.

1041
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,187
We're switching out the entire cast.

1042
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,090
Right? That's what I heard.

1043
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,759
So why didn't Ms. Youn know?

1044
00:57:10,693 --> 00:57:11,928
You all knew?

1045
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,164
We all heard earlier.

1046
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:18,268
Producer Ra came to the salon to tell me.

1047
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:20,470
But seriously...

1048
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,339
you really didn't know?

1049
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,909
Goodness. Really?

1050
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,110
Gosh...

1051
00:57:27,844 --> 00:57:29,212
You didn't tell her?

1052
00:57:31,414 --> 00:57:32,348
What's wrong?

1053
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:37,720
I feel so bad for Ms. Youn--

1054
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,428
So where's the newbie?

1055
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,096
He's on his way by a taxi.

1056
00:57:47,664 --> 00:57:48,665
He's almost here.

1057
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:51,100
This is nuts...

1058
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:53,436
What's wrong with that kid?

1059
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,638
I'll take care of things here.

1060
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,874
Don't worry, and just go home.

1061
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,610
No, my purse is in there.

1062
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:03,646
Is this how you handle things?

1063
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,882
Ms. Youn must be so upset.

1064
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,218
I know.

1065
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,520
Excuse me.

1066
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,188
How many courses do we have left?

1067
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,456
There's still half.

1068
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:16,926
Keep bringing them in.

1069
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,395
To break the tension when she gets mad.

1070
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:23,466
So listen from outside
and go in when she's about to blow up.

1071
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:24,601
Okay.

1072
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,511
Here he is.

1073
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:35,612
What did you do?

1074
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,181
-What happened?
-What did you tell her?

1075
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:41,985
What did you tell her?

1076
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,089
That in the future...

1077
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,892
we would rather see her
in dramas and movies

1078
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,228
than in variety shows.

1079
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,132
I'm sorry.

1080
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,405
He did tell her indirectly.

1081
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:04,641
Why did she misunderstand?

1082
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,111
So...

1083
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:13,316
you told the newbie to tell me
that everyone had to leave the show?

1084
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:16,619
I have nothing to say.

1085
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:20,390
I wanted to handle things
without upsetting you too much--

1086
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,291
"Handle things"?

1087
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,494
Handle things, you said?

1088
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,497
Am I an object?

1089
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,198
Am I trash?

1090
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:30,333
I'm sorry.

1091
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:36,973
Ms. Youn, he's here.

1092
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,743
Hey, you should've told her properly!

1093
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:42,879
How can she understand
if you say it like that?

1094
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,382
Jun-mo, you as well.

1095
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,251
You should have told her personally!

1096
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,554
How could you ask a newbie to do that?

1097
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,924
If you couldn't tell her,
you could have talked to me about it.

1098
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,093
I was too busy fighting
with the chief director,

1099
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,094
so I had no idea about--

1100
00:59:58,161 --> 00:59:59,028
You shut your mouth.

1101
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,664
You're the worst.

1102
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:04,968
Yes, ma'am.

1103
01:00:50,013 --> 01:00:50,947
I'm sorry.

1104
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,616
Jun-mo, I'll teach him a lesson.

1105
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:56,586
How did we end up with you?

1106
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,289
What on earth did you tell Ms. Youn?

1107
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,160
That we would rather see her

1108
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:07,664
in dramas and movies
than in variety shows.

1109
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:12,969
That we needed some change in our team.

1110
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:15,071
And?

1111
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,108
That was it.

1112
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:22,779
Hey, are we dolphins?

1113
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:24,514
Do we communicate via ultrasonic waves?

1114
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,183
How could she understand that?

1115
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:29,419
Who would understand that?

1116
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,853
Are you a dolphin?

1117
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:32,922
You communicate through ultrasonic waves?

1118
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,757
Guys like you are the worst!

1119
01:01:34,824 --> 01:01:36,592
You hate delivering bad news,

1120
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,561
so you make other people do it!

1121
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:42,932
Just stop it.

1122
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,334
Let's drink at the new recruit
welcome party.

1123
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:48,037
Things ended early here.

1124
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,173
If we go now,
we can still get some garlic chicken.

1125
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:51,974
Welcome party?

1126
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,576
New recruit welcome party?

1127
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:55,311
You think I want to go there?

1128
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,180
I don't. Why, you ask?

1129
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,148
Because I don't welcome this guy.

1130
01:01:59,248 --> 01:02:01,184
I don't welcome you!

1131
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:02,852
I'm sorry...

1132
01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,986
Don't even apologize.

1133
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,923
Just don't say anything to me.

1134
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,725
I don't want to see you at all!

1135
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,301
Where are you going?

1136
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,503
Aren't you going to the welcome party?

1137
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:42,792
Oh, Jun-mo.

1138
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,594
I came out to call you.

1139
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,296
It's crowded inside. Let's go elsewhere.

1140
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,538
Hye-ju, I have something to tell you.

1141
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:56,806
Really?

1142
01:02:57,406 --> 01:02:58,441
What is it?

1143
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,312
There's etiquette
when it comes to breaking up.

1144
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:08,951
You're pretty, and I like you...

1145
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:14,590
But we can't be what you want us to be.

1146
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,427
What? What do you mean...

1147
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:21,364
Let's stop seeing each other.

1148
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:22,899
I'm sorry.

1149
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:13,249
RA JUN-MO

1150
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:40,209
Oh, this?

1151
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:42,345
These are leftovers from
The Return of Superman.

1152
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,646
My kids are still babies.

1153
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:46,515
People are asking for you
at the welcome party.

1154
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:47,416
Why didn't you go?

1155
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,753
I didn't think it would be appropriate...

1156
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:51,821
Why not?

1157
01:04:52,455 --> 01:04:53,489
Because you messed up?

1158
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:55,791
You should still go. Come on.

1159
01:04:55,858 --> 01:04:58,394
I have to go home to see my kids.
You should go.

1160
01:04:58,461 --> 01:04:59,862
-You know the place, right?
-Yes.

1161
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,503
What a mess on your first day.

1162
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,143
What should I do now?

1163
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:19,482
Do you know...

1164
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:23,719
what's most important for a producer?

1165
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:28,891
What is it?

1166
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,895
Applying for overtime pay.

1167
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,297
That's key. Apply right away.

1168
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,332
You lose that money after five days.

1169
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:40,503
Anyway, I welcome you.

1170
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:43,539
If you can help me with my work,
I don't care if you're a criminal.

1171
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,042
Don't ever quit.

1172
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:08,230
Hello?

1173
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,099
This is Youn Yuh-jung.

1174
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:12,335
Oh, hello, Ms. Youn.

1175
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,104
This is Producer Ra's desk, right?

1176
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,939
Yes, that's right.

1177
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:19,408
I sent him something.

1178
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:21,610
My manager left it there.

1179
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,678
Do you see something?

1180
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,847
Oh...

1181
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,451
Yes, I do see something.

1182
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,687
It's plum tea I made for Producer Ra.

1183
01:06:32,621 --> 01:06:33,789
If I had known this would happen,

1184
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,559
I would have just pickled
and eaten those plums.

1185
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:38,928
But I already made the tea.

1186
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,531
Drink it when you guys pull all-nighters.

1187
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,401
It's a lot better for you than coffee.

1188
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,069
Coffee is why you guys are so out of it.

1189
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,405
-I'm sorry.
-Be sure you give it to Producer Ra.

1190
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:51,073
He needs to pull himself together.

1191
01:06:51,707 --> 01:06:52,975
-And...
-Yes?

1192
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:55,077
Tell him I had a lot of fun thanks to him.

1193
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:58,748
Hello?

1194
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,150
Yes, I'll be sure to tell him.

1195
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:02,985
Good.

1196
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,121
And who am I talking to now?

1197
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:10,159
You met me in the van earlier...

1198
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,961
Oh, right. You.

1199
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:14,263
I'm going to sue you.

1200
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:16,165
-What?
-Just kidding.

1201
01:07:16,332 --> 01:07:19,101
You're a variety producer
but you sure can't take a joke.

1202
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:22,138
What's your name? I should know your name.

1203
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,706
We worked on the same show.

1204
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:24,907
I'm Baek Seung-chan.

1205
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,643
Okay, Producer Baek Seung-chan.

1206
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,111
That's a hard name to say.

1207
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:31,514
You worked hard today.

1208
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,202
What kind of manager has no umbrella?

1209
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,305
I didn't know it would rain.

1210
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:30,906
Should I get the car?

1211
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,274
And make me wait here alone?

1212
01:08:33,142 --> 01:08:34,310
Should we run together?

1213
01:08:35,344 --> 01:08:36,278
Are you crazy?

1214
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,780
You want me to get wet?

1215
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,149
-Then what should I do?
-Go get the car!

1216
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:41,050
Right...

1217
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:42,017
-Here.
-Yes.

1218
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:56,365
Use this.

1219
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,470
Thank you.

1220
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,441
But the thing is, that's not my umbrella.

1221
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:10,112
-I just borrowed it at the lobby desk.
-Excuse me?

1222
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:14,717
They only let employees borrow these.

1223
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,553
If you open it, it says KBS on it.

1224
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,923
It belongs to KBS,
so if it isn't returned,

1225
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,425
they'll deduct it from my salary.

1226
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:26,262
Please return it to the desk...

1227
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,797
Yes, I'll return it.

1228
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,433
Oh, and...

1229
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:36,205
I'm sure you'll return it,

1230
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:40,643
but things don't always
work out as planned.

1231
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,412
Can you give me your number?

1232
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:46,282
My number?

1233
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:47,650
Yes.

1234
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:49,919
You know who I am.

1235
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:51,554
But I don't know your number.

1236
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:56,959
Fine.

1237
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:59,228
Then you give me your number.

1238
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:04,400
But I need your number in case

1239
01:10:04,667 --> 01:10:07,002
the umbrella isn't returned.

1240
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:09,838
Fine.

1241
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,522
Hello?

1242
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,860
I'm sorry, but...

1243
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,764
I don't think this is your number.

1244
01:10:41,437 --> 01:10:43,372
Please don't misunderstand.

1245
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,808
It's not anything like that.

1246
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:50,412
But in case I end up
paying for the umbrella...

1247
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:54,350
Fine. Put your number in my phone.

1248
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,497
-Happy?
-Yes.

1249
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:11,467
I'm Producer Baek Seung-chan
of Two Days and One Night.

1250
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,068
Please return it under my name.

1251
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:15,638
Two Days and One Night?

1252
01:11:18,407 --> 01:11:20,643
The producer bought this for you to eat.

1253
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:22,544
Who was it?

1254
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,546
The producer of Two Days and One Night.

1255
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:27,316
Please return it within three days.

1256
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,419
For every day of delay, a late fee
will be deducted from my salary--

1257
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,654
I got it.

1258
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,935
I just want to welcome our newbies again.

1259
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:20,836
Cheers!

1260
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,038
-We'll work hard!
-Work hard!

1261
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:24,139
We'll do our best.

1262
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:33,015
So did you all buy
the book I told you about?

1263
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,660
I bet the chief director
won't want to see me.

1264
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,331
Where's the newbie
for Two Days and One Night?

1265
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,367
Did he quit already because he messed up?

1266
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,301
Jun-mo.

1267
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:53,836
I don't know.

1268
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:56,472
Is he not going to show up
because you told him not to?

1269
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,607
That's not right.

1270
01:12:58,774 --> 01:13:01,276
Honestly, was that situation his fault?

1271
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,479
It's your entire team's fault.

1272
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:09,485
What's his number?

1273
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,463
Oh, Seung-chan!

1274
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:24,733
Why are you so late? Sit down.

1275
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:27,169
Okay. Give me a glass.

1276
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:30,806
Hey, I heard you messed up today.

1277
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,574
It's okay.

1278
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,311
It's okay if assistant producers
make the crappiest mistakes ever.

1279
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:39,681
All will be forgiven
once you do a good job

1280
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:41,817
directing your own show later. Okay?

1281
01:13:42,718 --> 01:13:43,552
Here.

1282
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:48,390
So did you hear from your dad?

1283
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,559
Oh, yes.

1284
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,462
And? What did he say?

1285
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:55,497
Did he negotiate a bit?

1286
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:57,332
Well...

1287
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:02,671
my dad said it wouldn't be right
to rip you off,

1288
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:05,374
so he'll only ask
for the essential repair fees.

1289
01:14:06,909 --> 01:14:08,710
It was originally 870,000 won
but he's giving you

1290
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,713
a 40,000 won discount if you pay in cash.

1291
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,317
Oh, really?

1292
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,518
Yes.

1293
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:19,455
You're on probation now, right?

1294
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,057
Yes, for the first three months.

1295
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,627
Did you know you can get fired
for messing up

1296
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:27,029
during the probation period?

1297
01:14:28,697 --> 01:14:29,565
Excuse me?

1298
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:34,503
Company rules state they can fire you

1299
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,805
if you mess up three times
during probation.

1300
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,408
You've already messed up once.

1301
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,743
That's two strikes left.

1302
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,612
Be careful.

1303
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:49,985
They should have let us fire people
after just one mistake.

1304
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,263
Why are you sitting here?

1305
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:02,931
Go to your team.

1306
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:04,666
Okay.

1307
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:53,515
Ms. Youn, you did well.

1308
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,718
I'm so sorry I couldn't tell you...

1309
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,187
in person.

1310
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,864
MS. YOUN, YOU DID WELL

1311
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,300
I'M SO SORRY I COULDN'T TELL YOU IN PERSON

1312
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,649
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

1313
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:33,322
Hey, what is this?

1314
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,792
Did you not hear me?

1315
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:39,361
What is this?

1316
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:42,164
You said not to talk to you...

1317
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,602
Well, you should tell me what this is.

1318
01:16:48,904 --> 01:16:51,673
Ms. Youn told me to give it to you.

1319
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,575
She also said to tell you
she had a lot of fun.

1320
01:16:53,642 --> 01:16:54,476
What?

1321
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,745
Why are you telling me this now?

1322
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,015
You told me not to talk to you.

1323
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:02,250
Well, you should have told me this!

1324
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:04,553
How did we end up with a guy like you?

1325
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,001
MS. YOUN, YOU DID WELL

1326
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:20,569
I'M SO SORRY I COULDN'T TELL YOU IN PERSON

1327
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:47,896
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1328
01:17:51,933 --> 01:17:53,101
This is refreshing!

1329
01:17:56,972 --> 01:18:03,245
02. HOW TO FIRE SOMEONE.
IT HAS TO BE DONE IN PERSON

1330
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,149
ACCOUNT BALANCE

1331
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,885
TOTAL ACCOUNT BALANCE
1.21 MILLION WON

1332
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:20,429
-Hi, honey.
-Oh! Hey there!

1333
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,764
My darlings!

1334
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:25,901
This is so good.

1335
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,134
What's this?

1336
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:02,304
I thought you were going to drink longer.
Why are you back so early?

1337
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,972
Everyone said they were leaving.

1338
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,674
Hey.

1339
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,143
That newbie on your team.

1340
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:10,278
Destroy him.

1341
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,249
I was planning on doing that anyway.

1342
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:17,452
If you can't do it, send him to me.

1343
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:18,653
I'll destroy him.

1344
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:22,224
-That Seung-chan kid is a total psycho.
-I know.

1345
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:25,193
File a claim for damages
for his mishap today.

1346
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,662
For psychological damages.

1347
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,198
Maybe you could get
around 830,000 won, right?

1348
01:19:33,335 --> 01:19:34,536
What is she...

1349
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:37,999
So do you have a plan?

1350
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:41,770
What plan?

1351
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,706
I'll just keep all my stuff in storage

1352
01:20:44,773 --> 01:20:49,444
and move into a study room
or motel long-term.

1353
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,414
Whatever. Just drink.

1354
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:08,230
Hey, don't take this back later.

1355
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,733
Come on. I won't.

1356
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:13,602
Hey.

1357
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:16,438
I can't let you stay
in a study room or motel

1358
01:21:16,504 --> 01:21:18,039
that's full of men!

1359
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,175
How could I let you go there?

1360
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,814
You had better not take this back
because you were drunk.

1361
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,483
I just stamped my thumbprint.

1362
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:30,518
Isn't that enough?

1363
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:32,787
Is this not good enough for you?

1364
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:36,258
Okay.

1365
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:41,196
I'll stamp something else
to seal the deal.

1366
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,064
Come closer.

1367
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:28,743
They got two bottles of milk.

1368
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,279
I don't think it was a one-night stand.

1369
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:33,048
Please edit this out.

1370
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,983
It's like dating.

1371
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,685
You need to play hard to get.

1372
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:38,853
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

1373
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:40,822
We have to reuse our tapes.

1374
01:22:41,089 --> 01:22:42,557
Erase the Haenam episodes and bring them.

1375
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,426
You told me to buy chips.

1376
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:46,261
You're too nimai.

1377
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,029
A producer shouldn't be like that.

1378
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,531
They should be more sanmai.

1379
01:22:50,498 --> 01:22:51,566
What's that?

1380
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:52,834
Sweet pancakes.

1381
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:53,935
You can't have these.

1382
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:55,136
They're for someone else.

1383
01:22:55,203 --> 01:22:56,438
What about Cindy?

1384
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,106
The Cindy we all know?

1385
01:22:58,173 --> 01:22:59,641
How dare you?

1386
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,209
Sanmai?
