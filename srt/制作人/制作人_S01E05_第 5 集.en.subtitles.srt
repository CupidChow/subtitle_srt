1
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,411
Do what you did yesterday.

2
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,413
You pinched my cheeks
and even addressed me as "Ye-jin."

3
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,815
-You shouldn't do that to my Ye-jin!
-Hey!

4
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:49,749
Don't you remember?

5
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,117
-He did that?
-Me?

6
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:54,654
I happened to see the two of you
going home together.

7
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,056
You got two bottles of milk.

8
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,557
We're not living together.

9
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:59,125
We're temporarily sharing
the same address.

10
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,794
Do you really understand?

11
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,695
What were you guys talking about?

12
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:03,763
Just...

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,267
-this and that.
-Like how I'm living with Jun-mo. Right?

14
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,168
No...

15
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,335
I'm a professional.

16
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,538
You think I can't endure all that
for a show?

17
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,972
You spray the water.

18
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,107
Me?

19
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,708
Use this to spray the water on her

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,544
and give her the sand eel extract.

21
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,213
I'm sorry. Drink this.

22
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,082
I don't drink iced coffee
in the morning. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:23,516
If I wanted to,

24
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,686
I could make him totally fall for me
in two days.

25
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,855
Do you know any of my songs?

26
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,190
I'm sorry, but not really...

27
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,558
Did you see my TV drama?

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,792
I'll try to find it and watch it.

29
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,128
If you don't play, you lose
Rock, paper, scissors

30
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,766
I didn't think you'd be so serious playing
rock, paper, scissors with a girl.

31
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:40,967
Oh, my!

32
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,772
Your shoelace is undone.

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,852
Oh, no...

34
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,339
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

35
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,111
How did you decide
who to share the umbrella with?

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,148
Moisture.

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,918
I thought about
who would need the umbrella more.

38
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,554
The camera is vulnerable to moisture,

39
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,690
so I made a quick decision.

40
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,192
Don't you think Cindy got upset?

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,404
Just a moment.

42
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,747
This is tough. I bet it's hard for you.

43
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,252
Pardon?

44
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,521
Just a moment.

45
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,525
Shouldn't there be a tent-pitching scene?

46
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,394
Oh, right.

47
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,097
It would be nice to have, but...

48
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,832
Exactly.

49
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,136
Edit out the footage of you pitching it
and use the scene with me in it.

50
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,237
The caption can say...

51
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,242
"The first tent Cindy's ever pitched.
It's so lovely."

52
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,510
Caption it like that.

53
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:39,412
Use pink letters.

54
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,314
I can't do that.

55
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,382
You can't use pink?

56
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,184
Captions are colorful these days.

57
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,620
I don't mean the pink letters.

58
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,890
The lying part.

59
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,493
-Is this a documentary?
-Excuse me?

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,194
If you want to shoot a documentary,

61
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,531
go deeper into the mountains
and film a raccoon or something.

62
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,801
This is a variety show. It should be fun.

63
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,102
Well...

64
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:06,739
this is a reality show.

65
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:08,608
To be more precise,

66
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:12,612
it's all about reality, in the wilderness,
and on the road.

67
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,518
Oh, my goodness.

68
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,720
It's raining where Cindy is.

69
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,122
They're pitching the tent
where she will be sleeping.

70
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,658
The cameraman said

71
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,796
Cindy carried all the luggage
because she lost at rock, paper, scissors.

72
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,297
She carried those up that steep mountain.

73
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,500
What's wrong?

74
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,102
It should be a good footage.

75
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,970
This brings back memories.

76
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,242
Remember when we were shooting
with the older ladies?

77
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,379
They would never do this.

78
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,615
Of course, they wouldn't.

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,286
They would never sleep outdoors,
especially when it's raining.

80
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,688
They would even call us crazy.

81
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,358
"My knees hurt. I want to go home."

82
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,159
"Manager Kim, start the car."

83
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:05,331
This is what's happening
because Seung-chan is clumsy and naive.

84
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,033
If he was someone more experienced,

85
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,569
he wouldn't dare do that to Cindy.

86
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,271
What if he makes her play

87
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,344
a game of chance for dinner?

88
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,448
He wouldn't do that. No way.

89
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:27,754
Call him.

90
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,855
WRITER MIN-JEONG

91
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,758
Six, seven, eight...

92
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,660
nine, ten.

93
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,740
Fail.

94
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:50,576
But...

95
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,479
This is so hard.

96
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,781
I haven't eaten anything.

97
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,718
Your last chance in the dinner game

98
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,187
is getting a friend to cheer for you.

99
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,488
What?

100
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,524
Since today is the first shoot,

101
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,325
you can call a good friend,

102
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:11,898
and if they say, "Go for it!"
or "You can do it!" within one minute,

103
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,333
you win the mission
and can have your dinner.

104
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,504
Can't I just do elephant spins again?

105
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,810
MANAGER, CEO BYUN, UMBRELLA

106
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,314
PINKY4 YU-JU, PINKY4 CHRISTINE
PINKY4 HA-NEUL

107
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,419
Did you decide who to call?

108
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,360
PINKY4 YU-JU

109
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,597
The person you are trying to reach...

110
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,200
Maybe she's busy.

111
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,002
PINKY4 CHRISTINE

112
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,341
-Hello?
-Why are you calling?

113
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,375
Hey, Christine.

114
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,645
It's my first shoot
for Two Days and One Night.

115
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,913
You're on TV.

116
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,949
-So?
-What?

117
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,017
Well...

118
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:10,189
Is there anything you want to say to me?

119
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,892
What do you want?
Do you want me to cheer for you?

120
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:14,994
You're so shameless.

121
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,195
Never call me again.

122
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,971
Fail.

123
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,983
I'll just set up two cameras in here.

124
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,590
Since it's your first time
sleeping outdoors,

125
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,726
I'm not sure if you'll sleep well...

126
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,100
Well...

127
00:08:56,536 --> 00:09:00,473
I can't sleep well outdoors either,
so I brought a bunch of stuff.

128
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,409
The floor director said
this stuff was useless,

129
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,877
but I brought it just in case.

130
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:11,017
Listening to music should help you sleep.

131
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,792
And try reading this.

132
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,894
I always read this book before I sleep.

133
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,099
You want me to read a book here?

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,570
It will help you sleep.

135
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,045
And this is for tomorrow morning.

136
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,681
Wear it when your hair is a mess.

137
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,482
It's for emergency use.

138
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,488
Well, then...

139
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,157
good night.

140
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,459
Edit it out.

141
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,664
Excuse me?

142
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,266
What happened earlier...

143
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,803
Edit my phone call out.

144
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,842
Editing is a big deal, so...

145
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,180
I can't make that decision.

146
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,816
I'm not a loser.

147
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,419
It's not that I don't have friends. I do.

148
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,659
They're all just too busy.

149
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,765
If that scene airs,
people will think I'm a loser.

150
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:36,936
And Christine will get criticized too.

151
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,139
Please edit it out.

152
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,267
Cindy just got here.

153
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,735
She just arrived?

154
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:12,972
Where is she?

155
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,642
She's doing a speed quiz mission
with her partner for breakfast.

156
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:19,478
But Cindy doesn't have a partner.
She got zero votes.

157
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:21,681
She's partnered with the producer.

158
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,449
The producer? Which one?

159
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,853
The stuffed pancake guy?

160
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,090
It's a type of ocean fish
that lives in the coastal sand.

161
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,024
SAND EEL

162
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,927
The taxonomy
is different from a lance-fish,

163
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,563
but it's called a lance-fish
in Gangwon-do.

164
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,068
It looks like a loach,

165
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,070
but its body is thicker.

166
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,207
It's a fish with a blue back
and a silvery belly.

167
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,745
It could be good or bad.

168
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,014
It's about a person's fortune.

169
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,852
In English, it's "crapshoot."

170
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:01,787
-What?
-I don't know.

171
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,393
After the Stone Age,

172
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,131
people built houses and lived in them.

173
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,333
However, this is the opposite.

174
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,335
-It's not indoors.
-Sleeping outdoors?

175
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:19,205
Correct!

176
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:20,906
We need to change tapes.

177
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,276
Why are you changing the tape?

178
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,911
She got it right.

179
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,748
Cindy got it right
despite those horrible explanations.

180
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,149
How can you change the tape?

181
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:32,284
Shoot it again.

182
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,987
Hey, get her off the set.

183
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,289
Ma'am...

184
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,391
Edit out the part
where she didn't understand the English!

185
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,927
Film the part
where she got it right again!

186
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:43,562
Let go of me.

187
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,398
And you!

188
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,568
Will you keep explaining so poorly?

189
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,937
I've got my eye on you!

190
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:01,347
Producer Ra,
this is Cindy we're talking about.

191
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,384
She's the main content of my company,
the biggest record-seller in Korea.

192
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,221
Our stock goes up
whenever she does anything.

193
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,225
But when Cindy announced
that she would do this show,

194
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,461
what do you think happened to our stock?

195
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,298
It's been dropping lower and lower.

196
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,834
It's low. Really low!

197
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,135
-Excuse me.
-But...

198
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,571
do you want it to drop more
after this show airs?

199
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,575
Do you know how much money that is?

200
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:31,010
Do I have to know?

201
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:32,011
Yes, you do!

202
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,446
There are a lot of things
on the line here.

203
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,984
When you put Cindy
with that know-nothing newbie producer,

204
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,386
what were you thinking?

205
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,721
What are you thinking now, CEO Byun?

206
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:46,091
You said she's your main content.
Is that how you refer to people?

207
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:50,496
No wonder you treat your artists
so poorly.

208
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,264
So...

209
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,733
are you going to make Cindy like that?

210
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,702
Like your other artist in the past?

211
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,738
Why would you bring that up?

212
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,908
For my artists to become stars,

213
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,811
I had to give my entire life
to lay the foundation.

214
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:06,946
Foundation?

215
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,115
Do you think just anyone can do that?

216
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,220
Trash can never lay the right foundation.

217
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,755
Trash is just trash.

218
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,424
The stock is dropping, is it?

219
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,228
If you're going to talk numbers,
go to a racetrack.

220
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:31,804
You're all about viewer ratings too.

221
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,705
What?

222
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,010
Two Days and One Night is a great show.

223
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:39,912
This is good.

224
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,386
I know you're trying to sound grandiose.

225
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:48,954
But for the sake of viewer ratings,

226
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:53,125
you made a kid who's not even 45kg
starve all day and sleep outdoors,

227
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,762
then made her lose that absurd quiz game
so she won't have breakfast.

228
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:04,203
You guys are so pleased
that you got some great footage.

229
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,539
That's all for viewer ratings.

230
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,981
My numbers are superficial,

231
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,419
but your numbers are classy?

232
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,099
-Seung-chan.
-Yes?

233
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,102
Have you been starving Cindy
since yesterday?

234
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:40,673
She failed the dinner mission...

235
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:46,679
You got lost in the rain
and took hours to get to the lodging,

236
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,714
yet she still agreed to sleep outdoors.

237
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,684
You should have skipped
the dinner mission!

238
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,120
How many meals did you make her skip?

239
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,289
Are you trying to kill her?

240
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,025
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

241
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,660
What do you know?

242
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,662
I'm yelling at you right now,

243
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,864
and I don't have anything else
to say to you!

244
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,435
I'm sick of yelling at you all the time!

245
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:16,475
CEO Byun and Jun-mo got into an argument.

246
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,411
Then, Jun-mo got mad
and yelled at the newbie.

247
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,080
The set is a mess.

248
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,216
Hey, this is a poor start
for the new season.

249
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,952
The chief director is totally worried too.

250
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,787
Their team isn't even here yet.

251
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,457
How did you hear all this news already?

252
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,325
From the chief director.
I took him to church.

253
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,560
When he heard that,

254
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:38,931
he got so worried
that he started going to church again.

255
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,499
You go to church?

256
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,301
Ever since he started going.

257
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:47,139
Didn't you go to a Buddhist temple
with the last chief director

258
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,207
and stay at a temple?

259
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,975
That was ages ago.

260
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,378
Many things change with a change in power.

261
00:16:52,878 --> 00:16:54,580
You poor guy.

262
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,549
And why are you at work on a Sunday?

263
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,452
I'm waiting for the deputy director
to be done with Mass

264
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,820
so I can pick him up at the church.

265
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:02,788
What about you?

266
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,859
I have to write a response to the KCC
because of Cindy.

267
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,361
I also have a meeting with my team later.

268
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,731
Yes, Deputy Director?

269
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,466
This is Stefano.

270
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,101
Is Mass over?

271
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,070
Yes, I'll be right there!

272
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,940
-See you.
-Okay. Bye, Stefano.

273
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,609
Stefano...

274
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,714
Jun-mo is such a softie.

275
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,450
I'm sure he will regret
yelling at the newbie.

276
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,457
Jun-mo.

277
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:44,063
Seung-chan didn't eat yesterday or today
since Cindy had to skip all her meals.

278
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:47,866
I got hungry and ate,
but he didn't eat anything at all.

279
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,936
I felt bad when I saw you
yelling at him...

280
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,938
So what if he starved?

281
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,406
Forget it. You messed up too.

282
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,675
You should have called me then.

283
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,306
Has anyone told BIGBANG
that the stage is glass?

284
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:04,143
They need to change their choreography,
so someone tell them--

285
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,210
I told them.

286
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:08,080
You did? When?

287
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,182
Just now.

288
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,354
He said it's okay,
they will change the choreography.

289
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:16,788
Who said that?

290
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:19,892
Are you texting BIGBANG's manager?

291
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,426
No, I'm texting Seungri.

292
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,264
Are you close with Seungri?

293
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,067
I'm closer to G-Dragon.

294
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,704
I've done Music Bank for five years,

295
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,307
but I've never even spoken to them.

296
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,143
You're amazing.

297
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:40,078
Thanks.

298
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,214
Da-jeong.

299
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,984
Are you just working here
to become friends with celebrities?

300
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,054
All you do is stare at your phone
when we have meetings,

301
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:51,890
and you never contribute any ideas.

302
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,259
When did you become friends with them?

303
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,161
And what's with that outfit?

304
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,329
You're not an idol.

305
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,631
Come on, Ye-jin.

306
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,801
Da-jeong is very sociable.

307
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,337
That's a good thing for a writer.

308
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:06,371
You're right.

309
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,841
That's really great. Right?

310
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,723
Hey, Seung-chan.

311
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,091
Yes?

312
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,226
You're back?

313
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,427
Yes.

314
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:31,930
Where's Jun-mo?

315
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
He went straight to the work party.

316
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,268
I'm going after I drop off this stuff.

317
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,039
Hey.

318
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,308
You're still on probation.

319
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,577
You can't go there.

320
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,512
I told you not to drink, right?

321
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,947
You have to watch your mouth.

322
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,184
But...

323
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,654
Everyone will be there
since we had the first shoot.

324
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,689
I have to go.

325
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,760
I'll try not to drink.

326
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,598
I feel nervous about this.

327
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,969
Where are you having the party?

328
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:17,009
Are you really going to the party?

329
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,478
The CEO said you shouldn't go.

330
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,413
She fought with the main producer,

331
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,949
so she will look bad if you go there.

332
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:26,351
That's why I should go.

333
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,153
-What?
-Hey.

334
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,757
What does a producer say the most?

335
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:34,326
"Cut." That's what they say.

336
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,530
-That's true.
-There's a reason for that.

337
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,999
If you want to cut something,
what do you use?

338
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,100
A knife.

339
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:48,140
In other words, they're holding the knife
so they have the upper hand.

340
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:50,275
Is that what it means?

341
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,211
It's especially true with producers
who are about to edit.

342
00:21:53,612 --> 00:21:56,915
They can really flaunt those knives.

343
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,550
That is true.

344
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,623
But the CEO got into a fight
with the main producer.

345
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,026
I should go brighten the mood,

346
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:09,928
for them to use nice footage of me

347
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,031
and for them to edit out some bad shots.

348
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,000
You're right.

349
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:16,435
Let's hurry.

350
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:21,073
We don't have to get there fast.

351
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:22,974
I'm Cindy.

352
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,379
Just park the car near the restaurant.

353
00:22:28,547 --> 00:22:31,416
Let's go in
after everyone else gets there.

354
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:33,552
Okay.

355
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,887
-Eat up.
-Okay.

356
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,560
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

357
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,428
Be careful.

358
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,533
Hey.

359
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,102
Is Cindy not coming?

360
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,404
She's the guest of honor.

361
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,408
-Tae-ho.
-Three servings of pork belly, please.

362
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,711
Isn't that your wife and kid?

363
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,083
Yes.

364
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,355
They were around the area
when I ran into them,

365
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,625
so I told them to eat
since it's dinnertime.

366
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,626
I see.

367
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,228
You ran into them?

368
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,529
Yes.

369
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:21,433
Is Cindy not coming?

370
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,568
My daughter is a fan of Cindy.

371
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:24,803
When is she coming?

372
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,447
I think almost everyone is here.

373
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:37,783
Who is?

374
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,120
Hello.

375
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:45,190
We meet again, Cindy.

376
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,059
And you are...

377
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,428
Me?

378
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:51,897
I'm Producer Tak Ye-jin of Music Bank.

379
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:52,998
Don't you remember me?

380
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,599
You should remember me though.

381
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,134
Right.

382
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,637
I didn't recognize you without makeup.

383
00:23:58,703 --> 00:23:59,604
I'm sorry.

384
00:24:04,543 --> 00:24:06,711
We have a work party here today.

385
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,180
I'm going in now.

386
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,985
Gosh, she's such a jerk.

387
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,555
She's such a...

388
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,326
She's such a jerk.

389
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,465
Hello.

390
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:35,907
Producer Tak is here.

391
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,643
Hey.

392
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,413
What's your team doing here on a Sunday?

393
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,315
We had a meeting.

394
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,821
Thanks to some singer,
I have to go to the KCC again.

395
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,791
I had to prepare for that, so...

396
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,226
Come sit here.

397
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:55,460
That's okay.

398
00:24:56,094 --> 00:24:57,796
We just finished writing
a letter of apology.

399
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,500
You guys are celebrating
so we wouldn't want to intrude.

400
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,069
Let's go, guys.

401
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,145
Why is nobody here?

402
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,529
Hey, Music Bank.

403
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,699
Come here.

404
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:46,845
One, two, three.

405
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:50,482
One more. One, two, three.

406
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,151
-Okay.
-Thank you!

407
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,185
Thank you.

408
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:55,453
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.

409
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,421
Let's go.

410
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:57,889
Let me see.

411
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,526
Hey, look at her. Did you see that?

412
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:05,897
She smiled in front of Tae-ho
since he's the chief producer,

413
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:09,100
but her smile disappeared
as soon as he left.

414
00:26:09,668 --> 00:26:11,002
That's what she's like.

415
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,138
Look at her.

416
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,540
She's so two-faced.

417
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,475
People like that shouldn't be successful.

418
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,277
You're too sensitive.

419
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,882
Does she have to smile 24 hours a day
just because she's a celebrity?

420
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,751
Are you taking Cindy's side?

421
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,487
You're just being ridiculous.

422
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,791
Would you have said this to me
if I chewed out a male celebrity?

423
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:35,427
You don't chew out male celebrities.

424
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:37,095
You only do that to female idols.

425
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:38,997
That's true.

426
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,502
How was she during the shoot?

427
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,806
Did she tell you what to shoot?
Did she boss you around?

428
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:50,442
She didn't do that.

429
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:53,878
Did she refuse to do anything you asked?

430
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,448
Or did say that she was going to quit?

431
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:57,649
She did, right?

432
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:00,418
She didn't.

433
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:06,057
Didn't she get annoyed at you?

434
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,859
Not even once?

435
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,160
Think about it.

436
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,764
-She did get annoyed.
-See?

437
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,634
She takes producers for fools.

438
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,835
Look at her.

439
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,503
You did very well for your first shoot.

440
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,772
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

441
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,275
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

442
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:25,677
You were great.

443
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:27,545
Cindy, you don't have to drink.

444
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,083
-Not the alcohol.
-Oh, okay.

445
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,553
The rest of you guys can drink.

446
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:37,922
Have some soda.

447
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,728
-Good work.
-Good work.

448
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:48,166
Unlike Jun-mo who goes there all the time,

449
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,969
it's my first time to go to the KCC.

450
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,938
What do I wear there, Jun-mo?

451
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,408
You're the expert.

452
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,411
Just dress nicely. Formal wear.

453
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:05,450
How about I wear a hanbok
to really show that I'm self-reflecting?

454
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,851
Maybe the members

455
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:11,589
would like that traditional look.

456
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:14,092
They are going to think
that you're rebelling.

457
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,160
Really?

458
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,065
Anyway, thinking about it
makes me feel so uneasy.

459
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:22,033
It's my first time to go there.

460
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,936
It looks like you're going because of me.

461
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,438
I'm so sorry.

462
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:32,077
I didn't say all that to get an apology.

463
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:35,580
But there is something I don't understand.

464
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,415
Wasn't my outfit pretty that day?

465
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,251
You said it was pretty.

466
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:41,786
Sorry?

467
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,689
I...

468
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,092
Did I say that?

469
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,296
Anyway, I told you then.

470
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,765
Those clothes are too racy
for public broadcasting.

471
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:58,336
That's why our outfits and choreography
are always different for KBS.

472
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,004
Oh, you use special outfits?

473
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,973
Yes. They are usually unfashionable.

474
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:05,777
It looks like Cindy didn't know.

475
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,280
We thought you did it
to get back at Producer Tak

476
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:11,249
since she yelled at you so much that day.

477
00:29:14,352 --> 00:29:15,186
I guess not.

478
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,323
Yelled? Who yelled?

479
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,926
She's right. Who said anyone yelled?

480
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:28,867
You said it yourself
that you scolded Cindy that day.

481
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:31,903
Me?

482
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,404
I got scolded at?

483
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:36,274
No, "scolding" isn't the right expression.

484
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,543
Was I being scolded that day?

485
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:39,811
By you?

486
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:47,752
She said she scolded you
in the green room.

487
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,587
Stop bringing up the past!

488
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,191
-Cindy.
-Yes?

489
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:58,163
I'm not someone
who gets all hung up on the past.

490
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:02,167
Going to the KCC
will be a good experience.

491
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,403
Let's toast and put it all behind us.

492
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:08,840
I don't drink beer.

493
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:15,914
You can toast with me.

494
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,189
You drank a lot.

495
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,792
Drinking is all about mental strength.

496
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:29,961
I'm mentally strong,

497
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:32,864
so I don't get drunk easily.

498
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,500
And even if I do get a bit tipsy,

499
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,502
I'm not a sloppy drunk.

500
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:38,436
How should I say it?

501
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,939
It's like I trust myself when I drink.

502
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,782
No more drinking for you, okay?

503
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,384
I've been watching you
and you've been drinking a lot.

504
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,253
You might slip up at this rate.

505
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,154
Okay.

506
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,991
But you drank a lot, too.

507
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,461
Hey, I can handle my alcohol.

508
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,664
Don't worry about me,
and just control yourself.

509
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,701
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

510
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,292
What? Don't you believe me?

511
00:31:34,592 --> 00:31:36,961
I really don't get drunk.

512
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:41,232
I want to know what it feels like
to be drunk

513
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,635
just like everyone else.

514
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,272
But isn't this the women's bathroom?

515
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,908
You can't come in here.

516
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,842
See?

517
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,211
I'm not drunk at all.

518
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,146
I can tell what's what.

519
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,649
Ye-jin said she wasn't drunk, right?

520
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,018
If she says she isn't drunk, she's drunk.

521
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,553
She said she's not a sloppy drunk.

522
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,858
Everyone is sloppy when they're drunk.

523
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,594
She has no right to say things like that.

524
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,563
Seung-chan, you...

525
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:15,900
Did you tell people
that I live at Jun-mo's house?

526
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,503
Did you, or didn't you?

527
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,705
-Producer Tak, people will find out.
-Why you...

528
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:21,873
You little punk.

529
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,510
Jun-mo! Let's go home.

530
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,611
-Okay.
-Let's go home.

531
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,579
Yes, go to your respective houses.

532
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,449
When she gets drunk, she has no secrets.

533
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,086
She says everything that's on her mind,
and that's not the worst part.

534
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,154
She also starts to act cute.

535
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,790
She usually never acts cute.

536
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,758
But if she gets drunk, she goes overboard.

537
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,127
She has no middle ground.

538
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,362
She just acts extremely cute.

539
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,798
Ye-jin wants a second round of drinks!

540
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,400
Ye-jin wants to go to a cart bar!

541
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,601
Hurry!

542
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,770
Let's go!

543
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,839
Don't be shocked.

544
00:32:55,106 --> 00:32:58,309
If you keep watching her,
you might get an upset stomach.

545
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,277
Be careful.

546
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:01,112
Here she comes.

547
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,214
Guys!

548
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,553
Ye-jin wants chicken skewers!

549
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:11,622
I want gopchang and live octopus!

550
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:13,057
Come on, Jun-mo!

551
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,459
Let's go!

552
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,626
Hurry! Run!

553
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:17,829
Guys!

554
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:20,431
Are you guys going to be like this?

555
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,566
Let's go!

556
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,740
Come on, guys!
Hey, make me fly! Over there!

557
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:31,476
A puddle! Careful!

558
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,161
So, what happened?

559
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:51,629
What?

560
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,865
Didn't you say

561
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,101
that you would make that umbrella producer
fall for you in two days?

562
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,304
Hey.

563
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:05,376
I said I could make him fall for me.
I didn't say I would.

564
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,980
But isn't that the same thing?

565
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,082
How is that the same?

566
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:15,086
I would and I could are totally different.

567
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,687
Totally.

568
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:21,125
So, are you saying that
you could make him fall for you,

569
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,529
but he hasn't since you haven't tried yet?

570
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,764
Yes.

571
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,333
That's right.

572
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:32,870
That's why he hasn't fallen for you yet.

573
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,675
Let's just drive along quietly, okay?

574
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,445
Is the music loud? Should I turn it down?

575
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,146
No!

576
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,449
I want to hear the music and nothing else.

577
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:00,264
What is the world coming to...

578
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,933
I know.

579
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,338
Such a shame that girls appear on TV
with hardly anything on.

580
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,075
-Honey.
-Yes?

581
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:15,113
It's like Sodom and Gomorrah.

582
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,047
You're right.

583
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,949
That's Cindy.

584
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,751
Seung-chan went to film with her, Mom.

585
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,753
-Really?
-What?

586
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,959
This is bad, honey.

587
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:33,831
What if a floozy who wears underwear on TV
falls for Seung-chan

588
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:36,701
and tries to hit on him?

589
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,036
Goodness. That would be bad.

590
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:43,741
I might get nominated in Yeouido.

591
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,544
I can't have my son be in a scandal.

592
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,514
This is serious.

593
00:35:50,515 --> 00:35:52,183
-Do you think Cindy is crazy?
-What?

594
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:54,152
Why would she fall for Seung-chan?

595
00:35:54,218 --> 00:35:58,523
Look, even if it's a floozy like her,

596
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,860
girls can't help but fall for Seung-chan.

597
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,932
It's not like we can stop him
from working for the broadcast station.

598
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,402
He can't hide his face either.

599
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:12,937
Oh boy.

600
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,842
Live octopus.

601
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:20,444
Thank you.

602
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,949
Look at how strong he is.

603
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,918
He's sticking to the plate.

604
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,156
Must you eat this like that?

605
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,358
Can't you see he's just trying to live?

606
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,228
Humans are the cruelest ever.

607
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,665
You were the one
who ordered the live octopus!

608
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,801
You always do this!

609
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,237
You cried your eyes out
when your goldfish died

610
00:36:46,304 --> 00:36:48,873
yet you love sushi like anything.

611
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,441
Let's stop this.

612
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,543
There's no point in talking to you.

613
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,346
-You're cruel.
-How am I cruel?

614
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:56,948
You're cruel.

615
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:57,882
What?

616
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,351
You're going on a blind date?

617
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,620
With a prosecutor?

618
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,689
-She's pretty?
-Yes, she is!

619
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,724
My mom said she's pretty!

620
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,859
Then why did you kiss me?

621
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,900
You play with my emotions
and do whatever pleases you.

622
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:18,436
You date and go on blind dates!

623
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,340
That's why you're cruel! Okay?

624
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,508
Come on, what are you saying?

625
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,578
Producer Tak, you should stop drinking.

626
00:37:32,516 --> 00:37:35,553
What really kills me

627
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:40,024
is that I usually tell you
when I like someone,

628
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,361
but now that I like you,

629
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,231
there's no one I can confide in.

630
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:57,908
That's what...

631
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,978
That's really...

632
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:02,947
That's what really kills me.

633
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:28,105
Oh, what a weird dream.

634
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,109
That was so weird.

635
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,573
Are you going to the bathroom?

636
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:07,378
I drank too much last night.

637
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,952
Thank you so much, Jun-mo.

638
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,888
That drinking habit of yours...

639
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,658
You always blackout when you drink.

640
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,994
Thank you so much, Jun-mo.

641
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,232
Goodness!

642
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,302
Hey, what are you doing?

643
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,704
Why are you sleeping here again?

644
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:38,676
I walked you two home last night.

645
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,812
You should've gone home afterward.

646
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,180
Why did you sleep here?

647
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,217
You come over like you live here now.

648
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,353
Why are you here?

649
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,022
Hey, what are you doing here?

650
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,893
I walked you two home last night.

651
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,064
Hey, is my house a motel?

652
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:01,899
Is this the KBS night duty room?

653
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:08,072
I begged my parents for this house

654
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,908
so I could live freely as a single guy.

655
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:14,145
Why do I keep getting more people here?

656
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,716
See?

657
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:20,551
Always more people.

658
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:28,025
You might think
that I'm some kind of loser

659
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,827
since I'm not welcome here,

660
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,330
but I'm actually a future doctor.

661
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:37,668
Shut up and eat your breakfast.

662
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,838
Can't I even clarify things
so he doesn't think I'm weird?

663
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,706
By the way,

664
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,677
I heard it's not your first time
to sleep here.

665
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,014
My place

666
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,383
is a boarding house now.

667
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:06,130
I hope you don't plan on moving in here
just because it's close to KBS.

668
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:08,566
Just stop it already!

669
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,869
He lives in the building next to us.

670
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,039
You mean Building 12?

671
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,042
Those units are really big.

672
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,511
Do you own it? Is it a lease?

673
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,279
It's my parents' house.

674
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:25,816
I see, your parents own it.

675
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:31,422
So, what do you think about my sister?

676
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,724
Lots of guys date older girls these days.

677
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:34,792
Have you gone nuts?

678
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:38,696
You, do the dishes.

679
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:41,198
You, go home and change for work.

680
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:43,767
Yes.

681
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,939
Give it some thought.

682
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:52,943
A girl like her can actually be a catch.

683
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:02,453
Do you often stay out all night?

684
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:03,821
Me?

685
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,991
Well, since I'm a future doctor,

686
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:08,526
I have to study a lot.

687
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,764
But you should try to sleep at home.

688
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,301
Well...

689
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:22,773
You're not in the position to say that
since you stayed out all night.

690
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,974
That's true.

691
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,578
But if you stay out all night,

692
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,716
you're leaving your sister
alone in the house with a man.

693
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,920
That's a bit... You know...

694
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:40,324
So, you shouldn't stay out all night
so often.

695
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:56,774
Goodness!

696
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,709
-Jeez!
-Did you do something wrong?

697
00:42:58,776 --> 00:42:59,777
Why did you get so scared?

698
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,879
Hong-sun.

699
00:43:03,814 --> 00:43:06,383
I think I should just kill myself.

700
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,752
Did you get drunk and fight someone again?

701
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:12,790
Is that how people see me?

702
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,426
Kind of.

703
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,733
I want to erase yesterday from my life.

704
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,034
I guess it was a big fight.

705
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,970
Do you have to pay a settlement?

706
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,638
It's not like that.

707
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:31,175
When your team asks for paper,

708
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:33,210
do they complain at administration?

709
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:35,079
Paper?

710
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,581
I don't know. They just give it to us.

711
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,685
Is paper a problem for you?

712
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,587
Yes, it is.

713
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,589
I think they only withhold it
from my team.

714
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,627
You're lucky
that your only problem is paper.

715
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,232
Paper...

716
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:00,671
My team said that
you wouldn't give them A4 paper.

717
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,155
What is this?

718
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:23,794
I told your team's writers several times
to use both sides to reduce expenses,

719
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,596
but they threw all these out.

720
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,898
I can't give papers to a team like that.

721
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,600
Jeez.

722
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:31,835
Such a big deal over paper.

723
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,239
Do you own the paper in KBS, Yang-mi?

724
00:44:37,274 --> 00:44:38,742
-No.
-So?

725
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,846
Do you own the paper in KBS, Producer Kim?

726
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:44,982
No.

727
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:46,684
Exactly.

728
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,556
Reuse these papers
by using the other side.

729
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,724
I'll give you more paper then.

730
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:54,892
Here.

731
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:10,174
Come to the rooftop.

732
00:45:18,248 --> 00:45:20,718
What did you hear last night?

733
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,355
Nothing.

734
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,391
I guess you heard.

735
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,228
You heard something
which you've classified as nothing.

736
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,265
Listen up.

737
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:40,037
Whatever you saw or heard yesterday,
none of them are true.

738
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,707
-Okay.
-It was just an accident.

739
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,709
Yes, an accident.

740
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,312
I lie when I get drunk.

741
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,013
My nickname is Drunk Liar.

742
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:54,885
Everything you heard yesterday
were all lies.

743
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:56,820
Okay.

744
00:45:58,722 --> 00:45:59,556
So...

745
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:01,925
did you hear anything?

746
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,093
Yes.

747
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,431
I heard some of your lies.

748
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:09,600
All right.

749
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,736
What kind of lie did I tell?

750
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:17,808
You told Producer Ra that he's cruel.

751
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:20,611
"Why are you going on a blind date?
So what if she's a pretty prosecutor?"

752
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,080
Then why did you kiss me?

753
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,414
"Then why did you kiss..."

754
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:25,983
Stop. That's enough.

755
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,620
Why are you repeating all that?
They were all lies.

756
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:31,522
Right.

757
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,294
So, in your opinion...

758
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,864
do you think Jun-mo heard my lies?

759
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:43,167
I'm not sure.

760
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:47,838
He was awake then,
but I don't know if he heard or not.

761
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,180
This isn't today's payment.

762
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,281
It's an advance.

763
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,284
Excuse me?

764
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,087
I'm going to give you a special mission.

765
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:07,191
-What kind of mission?
-Find out if Jun-mo heard what you heard.

766
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:09,760
I'd say that's a special mission.

767
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,727
Okay.

768
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:16,200
So, you want me to find out
if Producer Ra remembers

769
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:21,071
all the lies you've said
when you got drunk yesterday.

770
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:25,075
Let's call it an accident investigation.

771
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:29,046
I think Producer Ra
was really drunk last night.

772
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,047
I know.

773
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:33,350
He blacks out easily when he gets drunk.

774
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:38,488
That's my only hope right now.

775
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:42,459
So, Producer Ra blacking out
like he usually does

776
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,895
is the happy ending you want?

777
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:49,032
There's over 80% chance
that he won't remember.

778
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:50,167
The problem is,

779
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,103
we drank outside last night.

780
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,338
Yes, the cart bar.

781
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:58,976
Being outdoors sobers you up
because of the cold wind.

782
00:48:00,644 --> 00:48:03,680
That's why I'm not quite sure.

783
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:08,418
Do you think you can find that out for me?

784
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,070
Producer Ra, have this.

785
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:28,338
What's that?

786
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:29,907
I added red ginseng powder to water.

787
00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,541
You seemed really drunk last night.

788
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,844
Right. I was totally wasted last night.

789
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,145
Did I do anything wrong?

790
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,680
Not really.

791
00:48:37,147 --> 00:48:38,148
That's a relief.

792
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:41,385
Do you really not remember
what happened at the cart bar?

793
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,786
I don't.

794
00:48:44,354 --> 00:48:45,188
Wait.

795
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,959
What did we eat there?
Why is our bill 70,000 won?

796
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:49,860
Excuse me?

797
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,129
That's what it said
on the credit card bill.

798
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,268
We had soju, live octopus, and cartilage.

799
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,003
I knew it.

800
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,573
Ye-jin ordered the stuff she wanted.

801
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:05,976
She loves live octopus.

802
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:14,384
What are you looking at?

803
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,054
Nothing.

804
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,370
I don't think he remembers anything.

805
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,974
And why do you think that?

806
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,176
He looked very tired,

807
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:42,612
and judging from the veins in his eyes,
he definitely drank more than usual.

808
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,548
I've also been watching him all day.

809
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,616
He's been going
to the bathroom more often--

810
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,618
Do you watch Sherlock these days?

811
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:51,655
How did you know?

812
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:53,623
Don't deduct.

813
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:57,828
Just tell me what you saw and heard.

814
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:02,399
He doesn't remember
paying at the cart bar.

815
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:03,667
Really?

816
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:05,469
Jun-mo paid at the cart bar?

817
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:07,571
I thought I did.

818
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,207
I have this great habit
of always paying for everything

819
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:12,743
when I get drunk.

820
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:17,180
I'll learn my lesson one day
when I pay for something big.

821
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,649
-What a relief.
-You did pay.

822
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,419
-For the first round.
-I paid for the first round?

823
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,920
Me?

824
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:28,191
Including everything your team ate?

825
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:30,227
Yes, you used two credit cards.

826
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,162
You insisted on it.

827
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,631
I'm never going to drink again.

828
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,505
Anyway, I don't think Producer Ra
remembers what happened last night.

829
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,873
That is what's important.

830
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,142
Right.

831
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,713
How did Jun-mo walk on his way home?

832
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,816
He staggered.

833
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,151
How?

834
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:58,422
Like this.

835
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,727
That means he wasn't too drunk.

836
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:07,631
When he's extremely drunk,
he walks in one direction.

837
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,835
He just walks in one direction like this
until he bumps into something.

838
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,070
He keeps going.

839
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:14,738
But if he was going back and forth...

840
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:18,642
That means he wasn't totally wasted.

841
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,944
It's still uncertain.

842
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,012
Is it?

843
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,515
You start in the editing room
today, right?

844
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,416
Yes.

845
00:51:26,483 --> 00:51:29,352
Stay with Jun-mo
and keep your eyes on him.

846
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,588
You'll find a clue. Go ahead.

847
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:54,277
Producer Tak.

848
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:55,645
Yes?

849
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:03,487
If you're ever having a hard time

850
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,823
because you don't have someone to talk to,

851
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,192
you can always talk to me.

852
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,195
What?

853
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:14,731
You saw how I was
when I knew your living situation,

854
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,234
which shows I'm good at keeping secrets.

855
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:19,703
I also enjoy listening to people.

856
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,104
So...

857
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:23,440
you can always talk to me.

858
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,308
Really? Thanks.

859
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,611
I'll do that if I need to.

860
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,553
This is the editing room.

861
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,389
You'll pull most of
your all-nighters here.

862
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,624
Does this remind you of anything?

863
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:41,892
A study room.

864
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,129
Nice study rooms have windows,
but this doesn't.

865
00:52:46,196 --> 00:52:48,198
It's like solitary confinement in jail.

866
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:49,533
They are similar in size too.

867
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:52,202
It's hard to come out once you're in.

868
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:56,006
It's a type of ocean fish
that lives in the coastal sand.

869
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,809
The taxonomy
is different from a lance-fish,

870
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,745
but it's called a lance-fish
in Gangwon-do.

871
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,746
Il-yong.

872
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:04,147
EVEN IF THE FOOTAGE STINKS,
JUST EDIT IT WELL

873
00:53:06,483 --> 00:53:07,317
What is it?

874
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:09,786
Take down that beach photo.

875
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,854
What is that?

876
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,423
You can't even go. Why look at it?

877
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,824
I didn't put that up.

878
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:18,628
It was a bikini photo before.

879
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,829
Who switched it?

880
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:21,431
See that?

881
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,135
"Even if the footage stinks,
just edit it well."

882
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,271
But it's not easy to edit well.

883
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:31,508
You have to shed sweat, tears, blood,

884
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,044
and you have to dedicate your life
to make it good.

885
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,715
Is it okay to work like that?

886
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,016
No.

887
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,186
Our assistant director, Hyeong-geun,
got gastritis and arrhythmia.

888
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:45,088
Il-yong got a bad back and asthma.

889
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,390
The air is really bad

890
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,093
because the editing rooms
aren't well-ventilated.

891
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:52,596
Yoo Ho-jin, who did Two Days and One Night
for a really long time

892
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:54,364
got swollen testicles and osteoporosis.

893
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,534
The doctor even asked him
if he worked in a mine.

894
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,803
It can happen if you don't get sunlight.

895
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:04,241
That's why the team
started buying vitamin D.

896
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,208
To live.

897
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,743
To survive.

898
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,579
Because we don't want to die.

899
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,748
I've been working at KBS for a while now.

900
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:14,184
I finally get to do something
that a real producer does.

901
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,253
My senior colleagues said this.

902
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,956
"Editing isn't something you finish.
You just stop."

903
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:25,228
It means there's no right answer
and it's endless.

904
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,464
That saying really got me.

905
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,768
Shall I start now?

906
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,941
Isn't it turned off?

907
00:54:38,241 --> 00:54:39,709
Oh, is it off?

908
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,212
Where's the power button?

909
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:47,717
What are you doing?

910
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,621
Nothing. Just...

911
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:04,868
Starting today, my duties will be yours.

912
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,569
Oh, your duties?

913
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:10,140
This is the most important thing
for newbies to do

914
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:11,107
when it comes to editing.

915
00:55:11,508 --> 00:55:13,310
-Okay.
-Bringing the seniors food.

916
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,078
Here.

917
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:16,680
It's the company card.

918
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:21,718
I've had it for a year and a half.
This is bittersweet.

919
00:55:22,018 --> 00:55:23,119
Do a good job, okay?

920
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,622
I took the orders for the last time.

921
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:26,723
You're thankful, right?

922
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,825
Yes.

923
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:34,397
Seafood black bean noodles
for Producer Ra.

924
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:36,032
Dumpling soup for Producer Ryu.

925
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,201
Rolled egg rice rolls for Ji-yeon.

926
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,136
They always do this!

927
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,871
They should just order from one place.

928
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:43,907
Risotto for me.

929
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,812
Mushroom cream risotto.

930
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,182
Okay.

931
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,417
Seafood black bean noodles
for Producer Ra.

932
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:55,919
Dumpling soup for Producer Ryu.

933
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:57,520
Rolled egg rice rolls for Ji-yeon.

934
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:59,789
For you, mushroom cream--

935
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,724
Risotto.

936
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,826
-Risotto
-Risotto.

937
00:56:04,561 --> 00:56:05,395
You got a text!

938
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,030
Three pork cutlets, two fish cutlets.

939
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,064
That's ours.

940
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:09,432
-Thank you.
-Here's your money.

941
00:56:09,499 --> 00:56:10,333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

942
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,234
You got a text!

943
00:56:12,235 --> 00:56:14,037
They will be angry
if the noodles get soggy.

944
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,339
We all have to eat
before the live broadcast.

945
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:17,707
But I keep getting texts...

946
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:19,175
Seongbinjang seafood black bean noodles!

947
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:20,076
Me!

948
00:56:21,111 --> 00:56:22,345
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

949
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,753
Producer Ra, here is
your seafood black bean noodles.

950
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,526
Your dumpling soup.

951
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:39,963
-Did you order from Teolbo's?
-Yes.

952
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,299
Oh, that place went downhill ages ago.

953
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:46,136
Look. They're all swollen and popped.

954
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:48,338
You have a colleague
in Happy Together, right?

955
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:54,911
-Yes.
-I heard he's great at his job.

956
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:58,047
Everyone in the entertainment department
is envious of that team.

957
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,016
They got a great rookie,

958
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,219
so they're happy every time they eat.

959
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:06,956
Humans need food, clothing, and shelter.

960
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,192
But in the editing room,

961
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,594
you have to give up
on clothing and shelter.

962
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:13,263
What is the only thing left then?

963
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,965
-Food.
-Right.

964
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:18,268
But if you fail at getting food,

965
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,403
people will transform.

966
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,105
Where is that rage targeted?

967
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:26,009
The newbie who ordered the food.

968
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,746
Yes, I think you're right.

969
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,348
I got yelled at earlier.

970
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:36,286
Check what they want
before they start getting hungry.

971
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,955
What happens
when people start getting hungry?

972
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,423
They get angry.

973
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:42,025
So what's the important thing here?

974
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:44,694
Don't be the first
to suggest what you want.

975
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:46,463
Someone who hears you might think,

976
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,765
"Is he working here to eat what he wants?"

977
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:50,033
They can say something like that.

978
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,468
Here's another tip.

979
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:53,703
Those convenient places
with 100 things on their menu.

980
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,540
They have kimchi fried rice, raw fish,
even chicken stew.

981
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:58,908
If you order from those places,

982
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,543
it's guaranteed to be bad.

983
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,679
Where should you order from?
Specialty restaurants.

984
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:04,614
Specialty restaurants.

985
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:08,751
The most annoying thing
is when they tell you to order anything.

986
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,589
Your best bet
is to get a lunch box near here.

987
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,490
They're healthy.

988
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:17,527
But those who have a tendency to eat
what kids normally enjoy will say,

989
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,295
"Am I a monk?"

990
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:21,664
They will complain
that the broth is bland.

991
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,968
How do you find out
if they like what kids do?

992
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:28,238
The best way is to see
how they order coffee.

993
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,406
Some order stuff with really long names.

994
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,308
Strawberry caramel frappuccino.

995
00:58:32,375 --> 00:58:35,712
Green tea whipped cream ice blended.

996
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,914
If they order those,
they definitely eat like kids.

997
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,418
Producer Ra ordered
seafood black bean noodles.

998
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,488
Were the noodles soggy?

999
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:48,191
I want anything except black bean noodles.

1000
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,493
I pulled an all-nighter,
so my stomach hurts.

1001
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,728
No flour-based foods.

1002
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:53,429
He told me before

1003
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,065
that he doesn't eat flour
after he drinks a lot.

1004
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,868
But he ordered seafood black bean noodles?

1005
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,537
So, perhaps last night,

1006
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,006
he didn't actually drink that much.

1007
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:08,177
Right, he doesn't usually like
floury food.

1008
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,746
But sometimes,

1009
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:13,016
he craves spicy seafood noodles
the day after drinking.

1010
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,083
Or pizza.

1011
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:16,953
So he's unpredictable.

1012
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:24,060
He doesn't really have set rules.

1013
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,565
Then...

1014
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:30,967
I guess that wasn't a definite clue.

1015
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,504
Right.

1016
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,775
You'll be up all night editing, huh?

1017
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:41,544
They said it would take a few days,

1018
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,846
so I brought spare underwear from home.

1019
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,148
Okay.

1020
00:59:45,315 --> 00:59:46,382
Hope it goes well.

1021
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,025
But Producer Tak.

1022
00:59:56,859 --> 00:59:57,694
Yes?

1023
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,432
Is it important for him not to remember?

1024
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:05,301
What?

1025
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,938
If what you said were lies,

1026
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:12,508
it doesn't matter
if Producer Ra remembers.

1027
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,511
And if, by some chance,

1028
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,015
you were telling the truth...

1029
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:24,821
Then I think Producer Ra
should really remember.

1030
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,124
You'll find out when you start editing.

1031
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:32,462
If someone says something
and the other person didn't react to it,

1032
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,697
then what the first person said

1033
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:37,967
has to be edited out.

1034
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:48,077
Needless to say,
what I said last night were lies.

1035
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:51,481
But like you mentioned earlier,

1036
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,717
let's just say that by some chance

1037
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,122
I was telling the truth

1038
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,558
and Jun-mo heard it.

1039
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:06,362
Up until this point, he hasn't shown
any reaction.

1040
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,431
He's treating me the same as usual.

1041
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:13,169
However, if he's not showing any reaction

1042
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:17,006
despite remembering
what I said to him last night,

1043
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:21,310
doesn't that mean

1044
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:25,081
he edited out that truth?

1045
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:28,918
-So--
-So...

1046
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:32,755
that's why you're hoping
he can't remember.

1047
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:35,958
Because you fear he's edited it out.

1048
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,210
You have makeup and hair at 4:30 p.m.,
and your flight is at 7:00 p.m.

1049
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:56,012
I'll come and get you at 4:00 p.m.

1050
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,413
Get some sleep until then.

1051
01:01:58,047 --> 01:02:00,016
I can't sleep for two hours.

1052
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,985
You should still try.
You will be too tired if you don't sleep.

1053
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,221
I can't make myself fall asleep.

1054
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:06,789
I want to sleep too.

1055
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,658
What will we do about your insomnia?

1056
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:11,094
Are you out of sleeping pills?

1057
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,929
Those make me too sluggish.

1058
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,398
Whatever, I'll figure it out. Bye.

1059
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:52,802
It will help you sleep.

1060
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:14,357
"Nobody loved her.

1061
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,129
Nobody was friends with her.

1062
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,433
She was a good person,

1063
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,703
but she never tried to get anyone
to like her."

1064
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,560
NOBODY LOVED HER.

1065
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,297
NOBODY WAS FRIENDS WITH HER.

1066
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:29,298
Hey, is it 4:00 a.m. or 4:00 p.m.?

1067
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:31,500
It's 4:00 a.m.

1068
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,037
Why is time going so fast?

1069
01:04:35,104 --> 01:04:38,341
This footage is so boring,
I'm going crazy.

1070
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:40,209
Hey, Seung-chan.

1071
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,544
Yes?

1072
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:44,180
Come up with a good idea.

1073
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:47,350
A great caption for this boring footage.

1074
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,720
Something that will make
a family in Dangjin

1075
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:54,023
burst out laughing
while they are eating dinner.

1076
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:59,662
"Cindy is left behind."

1077
01:05:00,229 --> 01:05:01,664
Is this In-Depth 60 Minutes?

1078
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:04,367
"What will happen

1079
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:07,770
to Cindy?"

1080
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,206
Is this Safety First?

1081
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:12,608
What kind of caption is that?

1082
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:16,112
"Cindy

1083
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,182
looks extremely flustered."

1084
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,119
You're making me flustered.

1085
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,255
Do you think that's funny?

1086
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:27,490
You know what?

1087
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,726
I think you're a spy from Running Man
that was sent to ruin me.

1088
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,697
Someone told you to ruin our show, right?

1089
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:38,034
You don't have a name tag though.

1090
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,336
Oh, my goodness.

1091
01:05:43,406 --> 01:05:44,407
Your shoelace is undone.

1092
01:05:53,115 --> 01:05:55,418
Producer Ra,
why do you keep watching this?

1093
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,019
Is it okay

1094
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,689
if you show your face on TV?

1095
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:01,390
Excuse me?

1096
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:05,594
Do you have any loan sharks chasing you?

1097
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:08,097
I don't.

1098
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:11,200
Have you ever been involved
in a strange website?

1099
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,336
No. I don't really go online.

1100
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:14,870
-Do you have social media accounts?
-No.

1101
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,173
Then there's no problem.

1102
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:19,342
We can use this.

1103
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,910
And show Cindy's expression.

1104
01:06:21,277 --> 01:06:23,512
But Producer Ra, I...

1105
01:06:23,846 --> 01:06:24,814
Don't you want that?

1106
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,984
I'm trying to make the show fun,
but you still refuse?

1107
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:29,952
Are you really a spy?

1108
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:33,723
This is good stuff.

1109
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,524
Good.

1110
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:38,461
A producer for this show
has to give up everything.

1111
01:06:38,928 --> 01:06:41,731
Being shown on TV with an unwashed face?

1112
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,767
You can't worry about being seen on TV.

1113
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,269
It's all to save the show.

1114
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,106
Baek Seung-chan is kind of dumb,

1115
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,541
but people might like his innocence.

1116
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:57,380
Of course, some people
actually want to be on TV.

1117
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:00,516
But viewers can always tell.

1118
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,785
They never like those people.

1119
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:09,191
Excuse me.

1120
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:10,726
Yang-mi.

1121
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,964
I was briefly on Two Days and One Night.

1122
01:07:15,031 --> 01:07:20,102
I made a request during the opening
as the chief producer.

1123
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,971
Oh, really? Did you?

1124
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:27,810
I was filmed for 20 minutes,
so that's probably 10 minutes of footage.

1125
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,211
I see.

1126
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:31,447
So...

1127
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,285
do I get an appearance fee?

1128
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,588
Isn't it a cameo appearance?

1129
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:41,123
You don't get an appearance fee for that.

1130
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:47,096
But I'm not close with
the staff of that show.

1131
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,099
Jun-mo is just a junior colleague to me.

1132
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,134
We're not friends at all.

1133
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,536
If that's the case,

1134
01:07:54,703 --> 01:07:56,572
employees get 20,000 won
for their appearance.

1135
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:58,107
Just like announcers.

1136
01:07:58,607 --> 01:07:59,809
What about normal people?

1137
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:00,943
They get 60,000 won.

1138
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,281
But I'm not an announcer.

1139
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,284
I'm more like a normal person.

1140
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,119
No. You're an employee.

1141
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:13,589
Fine.

1142
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:18,861
Can you deposit it in a different account
other than my payroll account?

1143
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:21,797
I'll need a copy of your bankbook and ID.

1144
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,467
Thanks. Will it be taxed?

1145
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,536
Yes, the tax is 3.3%.

1146
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,638
That means you will get 19,400 won.

1147
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,744
So Yang-mi got you too.

1148
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:38,514
She didn't get me--

1149
01:08:38,581 --> 01:08:39,782
She did!

1150
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:42,084
I've been talking to some people

1151
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,720
and it appears many are unhappy with her.

1152
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,558
We should all do something
to put her in her place.

1153
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:51,961
Don't bother.

1154
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,232
GROUP NAME
THE PAPER DEFENDERS

1155
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:57,666
DONG-HYEOK, HONG GYEONG-JUN
HONG IN-GYU

1156
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:02,004
Did you invite me to a group chat?

1157
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:03,539
Yes.

1158
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,407
We have to tell people how we feel.

1159
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:10,546
THIS IS KIM HONG-SUN
WE ARE RALLYING AGAINST KO YANG-MI

1160
01:09:14,517 --> 01:09:16,452
I would like it to be a little bigger.

1161
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:17,653
Okay.

1162
01:09:18,687 --> 01:09:19,722
This is Kim Hong-sun.

1163
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:23,359
We're rallying against Ko Yang-mi
from the administration team.

1164
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:26,795
Who is she to tell us
to reuse paper on both sides?

1165
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:28,731
Is the paper hers?

1166
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:32,401
Yang-mi uses office supplies

1167
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:34,837
to extort coffee and treats from writers.

1168
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,706
I even heard she requested
for organic products.

1169
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,875
What's his deal?

1170
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:42,244
Stefano has too much time on his hands.

1171
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:44,146
Leave the chat room.

1172
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,753
WHY DO WE HAVE TO BRIBE HER
TO GET OFFICE SUPPLIES?

1173
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:54,190
TAK YE-JIN LEFT THE GROUP CHAT
RA JUN-MO LEFT THE GROUP CHAT

1174
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:57,326
Tae-ho!

1175
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,030
There's still one person left.

1176
01:10:03,132 --> 01:10:05,401
I see there is someone who agrees with me.

1177
01:10:05,467 --> 01:10:06,635
May I know who this is?

1178
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,737
This is Ko Yang-mi
from the administration office.

1179
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,843
THE PAPER DEFENDERS GROUP CHAT
LEAVE

1180
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,912
LEAVE THE CHAT?
YES

1181
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,481
Thank you so much
for the tips you gave yesterday.

1182
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:22,284
They praised me for the lunchboxes today.

1183
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,454
I'm glad I can help.

1184
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,698
But I'm worried about
how I'll get through dinner.

1185
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,902
Every meal is so stressful.

1186
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,837
I wish they only eat once a day.

1187
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:44,373
I don't think
you'll have to get dinner today.

1188
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:46,342
Why not?

1189
01:10:50,613 --> 01:10:52,848
-Hello.
-Hello.

1190
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:53,882
Hello.

1191
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,351
Hello!

1192
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,419
-Please be good to Cindy.
-Please be good to Cindy.

1193
01:10:57,987 --> 01:10:59,121
-Hello.
-Hello.

1194
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:00,789
Please treat her well.

1195
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,759
It's a bit...

1196
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,728
-I think they gave some to that team.
-Cindy...

1197
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,129
So good.

1198
01:11:08,197 --> 01:11:09,164
What's all this?

1199
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,868
Cindy's agency gave this out
to the entire entertainment department.

1200
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:13,902
Amazing, right?

1201
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:16,705
The YG folks brought ten iced coffees,

1202
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,641
but they left when they saw all this.

1203
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,676
Have a slice of pizza.

1204
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:21,644
No, thanks.

1205
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,185
You're so generous, CEO Byun.

1206
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,156
Some agencies only give out rice cakes

1207
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:36,458
when their artists win first place
on Music Bank.

1208
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:38,861
Some rice cakes don't even have beans.

1209
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:40,629
It's better to not give them out at all.

1210
01:11:40,696 --> 01:11:41,797
Exactly.

1211
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:46,268
This is why you two
need to be good to Cindy.

1212
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:50,973
She got zero votes and was left behind.

1213
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:55,577
If it's properly edited,
she can get sympathy.

1214
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,279
But if it isn't,

1215
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,548
she will look like a loser.

1216
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:03,752
I'm sure Jun-mo will do a good job.

1217
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:08,090
I'm not on good terms with Producer Ra.

1218
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,592
Come on. That was all in the past.

1219
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:13,562
You haven't fought with him recently.

1220
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,297
It's okay since you didn't fight.

1221
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,366
But I did.

1222
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,168
I went to the filming set.

1223
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:21,870
-Oh, you shouldn't have.
-Oh, you shouldn't have.

1224
01:12:22,237 --> 01:12:23,172
Well...

1225
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:28,977
That's why I'm telling the both of you
that you have to stop him.

1226
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:31,980
It's up to the person in the editing room.

1227
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:34,116
We can't reprimand producers these days.

1228
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:37,820
They'll say we're misusing our authority.

1229
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,724
They get mad and say
they will join a union.

1230
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,959
Right, we didn't do that back in our day.

1231
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,061
Producers these days are scary.

1232
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:47,463
They sure are.

1233
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:02,878
Producer Ra, it looks like you're editing.

1234
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,514
Am I interrupting?

1235
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,450
Did we drink together last night?

1236
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,652
No. Why?

1237
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,589
I was wondering if I got drunk
and made up with you.

1238
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:15,791
Come on.

1239
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,427
Why would professionals like us make up?

1240
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:19,762
That's childish.

1241
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,431
Personal emotions and work are separate.

1242
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,933
Right, newbie producer?

1243
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:31,306
I have something to talk about
with Jun-mo.

1244
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:32,508
Can you please step out?

1245
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,309
Sit down.

1246
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,847
Go ahead and say what you want.

1247
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:41,083
Don't tell him to leave. He's working.

1248
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,951
Okay.

1249
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:46,188
I like you because you're different
from other producers.

1250
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:49,258
Producers with tempers are good workers.

1251
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:57,599
Put this away before someone sees it.

1252
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,771
Will you really stoop this low?

1253
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:05,674
What are you doing?
Should I call the police?

1254
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,509
Open it before you get worked up.

1255
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,146
Jeez.

1256
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:13,015
What's the point?

1257
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:18,787
651ST LOTTERY TICKET

1258
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,056
We should keep in touch often.

1259
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,192
If you don't answer my calls,

1260
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:25,027
I'm going to assume you won.

1261
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,895
I'll tell everyone.

1262
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:32,201
I brought Cindy up
since she was 13 years old,

1263
01:14:32,267 --> 01:14:34,603
and this show is the first thing
she told me that she wanted to do.

1264
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:36,371
So...

1265
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:41,710
be good to her.

1266
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:44,546
I brought plenty of good food,
so be sure to eat.

1267
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:50,118
I'm sorry, but I'm not eating.

1268
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:51,987
Hey, Seung-chan.

1269
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,924
Buy some rice rolls and mussel soup later.

1270
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:57,659
Okay.

1271
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,470
What a pain.

1272
01:15:20,749 --> 01:15:22,150
Hey!

1273
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:23,952
You're Jae-yeong
from Immortal Songs, right?

1274
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:26,321
When I edit next to you,

1275
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,590
I end up memorizing an entire song!

1276
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:30,959
Jeez.

1277
01:15:45,607 --> 01:15:46,842
-Seong-kwang.
-Yes?

1278
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:47,876
What is this?

1279
01:15:47,943 --> 01:15:49,211
They're all soggy.

1280
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:50,579
Tae-hun.

1281
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:52,614
Se-jin.

1282
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:54,016
I'm sorry.

1283
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,151
I'm sorry.

1284
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:58,153
I told you to teach the juniors, didn't I?

1285
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,224
Let's eat. We need energy.

1286
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,326
WHAT IS A VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER?

1287
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,031
05. ABOUT EDITING
INCLUDE ONLY THE IMPORTANT THINGS

1288
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,815
No photos, please.

1289
01:16:27,049 --> 01:16:27,983
I'm sorry.

1290
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:28,984
Excuse me.

1291
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:30,218
You can't take photos.

1292
01:16:30,285 --> 01:16:32,254
You there. Wait.

1293
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:35,123
You can't take photos.

1294
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,358
Please don't take photos.

1295
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:14,396
Hello, ma'am.

1296
01:17:14,763 --> 01:17:16,665
Oh, it's you again.

1297
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,433
Did you get home okay that day?

1298
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,436
I wasn't that drunk.

1299
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,106
What do you mean you weren't?

1300
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:27,442
You and the lady were totally wasted.

1301
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,578
Producer Tak and I were?

1302
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:31,713
What about the man we came with?

1303
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:32,648
Him?

1304
01:17:33,115 --> 01:17:35,250
He wasn't as drunk as you two.

1305
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,753
You two could barely walk.

1306
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:40,489
He must have busted his butt
just to get you two home.

1307
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:58,306
You really don't remember?

1308
01:17:59,041 --> 01:18:02,344
You even yelled at that other guy.

1309
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:04,713
You said something like...

1310
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:08,116
You said you couldn't let
just the two of them leave together.

1311
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,256
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

1312
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:18,794
Hey.

1313
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,696
Let's go home.

1314
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:35,744
Just you two?

1315
01:18:42,884 --> 01:18:43,819
No.

1316
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:45,387
I can't let you do that.

1317
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,622
Why not?

1318
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:50,926
Producer Tak just said she likes you!

1319
01:18:56,865 --> 01:18:57,899
Since Producer Tak said

1320
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,669
she likes you,

1321
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,438
I won't let you two leave.

1322
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:09,978
I can't let you two be alone.

1323
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,548
I don't like the fact

1324
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,586
that Producer Tak likes you.

1325
01:19:38,206 --> 01:19:39,040
Hey, punk.

1326
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:42,577
Why did you leave your phone behind?

1327
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,548
I wanted to ask for sea eel too.

1328
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:48,717
They don't accept credit cards there.

1329
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:51,086
What?

1330
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,889
You said you paid 70,000 won
with your credit card there.

1331
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:56,258
But that cart bar

1332
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:58,460
doesn't accept credit cards.

1333
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:09,471
Do you now remember

1334
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:15,510
what Producer Tak said that night,
which you're consciously trying to forget?

1335
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,818
Do you remember it?

1336
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:41,036
Editing?

1337
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:42,938
It's all about time.

1338
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,241
A TV show is a promise to the viewers.

1339
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:47,609
It's a type of service.

1340
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:50,745
But a service is useless
if it's not on time.

1341
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:51,646
Right?

1342
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,249
Please get the editing done fast.

1343
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:58,186
I always try to pick the funny parts.

1344
01:20:58,253 --> 01:21:01,590
I always try to show a funnier mountain,

1345
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:05,293
and I think of which cloud looks funnier.

1346
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,363
Editing?

1347
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,598
It's an arrow.

1348
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,233
It has to pierce a person's heart.

1349
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:13,869
Of course, it should get through
the viewers,

1350
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:15,337
but more importantly,

1351
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:17,606
it should get through
the chief director and deputy director

1352
01:21:17,672 --> 01:21:19,341
who assigned me to the show.

1353
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,476
I need to pierce their hearts first.

1354
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,612
That way, they will give me
a good show later.

1355
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:24,946
Editing?

1356
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:26,715
It's like makeup.

1357
01:21:26,781 --> 01:21:30,018
Good makeup makes anyone look pretty.

1358
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:33,455
But you also need
confidence and assurance.

1359
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:35,523
This makeup will make me pretty.

1360
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:39,494
This editing will have everyone
in stitches.

1361
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,263
That assurance and confidence.

1362
01:21:41,663 --> 01:21:43,798
It's all about being better than
the other.

1363
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:45,834
Editing is...

1364
01:21:51,473 --> 01:21:52,440
about giving up.

1365
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,344
When there's something good
and something better,

1366
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,547
you choose the better one

1367
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,384
and give up on the good one

1368
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,788
because you can't have everything.

1369
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:10,825
If you get too greedy...

1370
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:15,363
you could lose everything.

1371
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:43,658
Since Producer Tak said she likes you,
I won't let you two leave.

1372
01:22:43,725 --> 01:22:44,960
I decided to forget what happened.

1373
01:22:45,026 --> 01:22:48,129
I thought if I forgot,
it would be like it never happened.

1374
01:22:48,430 --> 01:22:49,798
What's with that woman?

1375
01:22:49,864 --> 01:22:52,267
-Maybe she embezzled toner and paper...
-Move! You're distracting me!

1376
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:54,369
Why did she tell my son to tie her shoes?

1377
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,938
Seung-chan doesn't look so bad on screen.

1378
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:59,674
I thought he was a kid,
but he seems manly.

1379
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:00,608
-Producer Tak!
-Goodness!

1380
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:01,743
I was just happy to see you.

1381
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,813
Will they use the staff from
Two Days and One Night?

1382
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:07,148
It's because of
the umbrella producer, isn't it?

1383
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,918
I bet you're uncomfortable
with me living here.

1384
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:10,986
Do what you want.

1385
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:12,354
There was an accident on stage!

1386
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:14,656
Producer Tak was taken away
in an ambulance!
