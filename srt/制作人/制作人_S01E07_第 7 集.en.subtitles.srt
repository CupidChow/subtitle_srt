1
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,306
You again?

2
00:01:21,714 --> 00:01:25,418
Why do you always happen to be
in moments I make mistakes?

3
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,661
Go. I want to be alone today.

4
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:36,763
I'm sorry about today.

5
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,337
Producer Tak.

6
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:52,812
I'm sorry too.

7
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:57,383
What for?

8
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,221
I think...

9
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,425
I'm going to make a mistake, too.

10
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,217
Seung-chan.

11
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,752
What are you doing?

12
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,722
I'm about to get flustered.

13
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,125
I want you to be able to cry freely.

14
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,529
You might be embarrassed
if people see you.

15
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:49,202
Don't you think doing this
will draw more attention?

16
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,374
Youngsters these days have no shame...

17
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:01,748
What will you do? Will you stay like this?

18
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,783
No.

19
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,091
You made me stop crying.

20
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,461
I've always thought this,

21
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,565
but you really are an oddball.

22
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:22,669
But that's okay.

23
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:24,504
It's cute.

24
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,546
Thanks.

25
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:36,082
Thank you for not leaving
and for staying with me.

26
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:40,320
If you left when I told you to,
I would've felt really lonely.

27
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,692
Crying alone
doesn't suit you at all, Producer Tak.

28
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,230
When you're angry, cursing, or fuming,

29
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,366
you're a lot cooler.

30
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,373
But...

31
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,977
why are you being so casual with me?

32
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,812
Show some respect.

33
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,615
Yes, Producer Tak?

34
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,649
Sure, Producer Tak.

35
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,550
Okay, Producer Tak.

36
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,252
Come on, Producer Tak. What's with you?

37
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,454
I feel like she would hit me.

38
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:15,989
Well?

39
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,690
Why aren't you answering?

40
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,427
Why are you being so casual with me?

41
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:27,800
My colleague, Chang-sik,
speaks freely to you.

42
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:32,305
And Lee Seung-gi and I
are only a year apart.

43
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:37,110
He was very informal with you too.

44
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:41,414
He just talked really casually.

45
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:45,551
So, you're saying

46
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,087
that you are going to drop the formality?

47
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:48,988
Yes, I want to...

48
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,859
be able to talk to you comfortably.

49
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,563
I won't be too formal from now on.

50
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:04,937
You do that then.

51
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,108
Okay, Producer Tak.

52
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,824
The recipient is currently unavailable.

53
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,693
Please leave a message...

54
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,143
I always thought that
the easiest thing in the world

55
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,479
was cheering up Ye-jin when she's angry.

56
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,475
Here.

57
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,314
Yes!

58
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,959
-Jeez.
-Stop!

59
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,199
Here.

60
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:42,135
-What?
-Come on.

61
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,407
Cheers. Cheer up.

62
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,419
But she has to come home
for me to cheer her up.

63
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,189
Dang, that girl.

64
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,858
She should know that staying out
late at night is dangerous.

65
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:11,798
What is it?

66
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,666
I can't do it.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,503
How can I go crawling back
to Jun-mo's house like this?

68
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,205
I can't.

69
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,339
Go home.

70
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,875
Where are you going?

71
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,610
I'll go sleep at the office.

72
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:25,912
Excuse me?

73
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,482
I can sleep in the night duty room
or in my office.

74
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:35,188
I don't think that's a good idea.

75
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,622
Why not?

76
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,559
I pull all-nighters at the office
all the time.

77
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,395
-Move it.
-But still...

78
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,331
I'll go with you then.

79
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,675
Oh, my word. What is this?

80
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,878
Is that a scissor?

81
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:02,815
Jun-mo must have lost his mind.

82
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,785
He wouldn't dare do that to my baby.

83
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,922
If you want this bag to be safe,

84
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,557
get home within 30 minutes.

85
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,960
If you don't come in time,

86
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:16,829
I don't know what I might do to your bag.

87
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,164
Oh, no.

88
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,967
Hey, he chose my most expensive bag!

89
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,068
What will I do, Seung-chan?

90
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,769
That cheap jerk. He better not do it.

91
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,137
You're dead, Jun-mo!

92
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,156
It has been 24 minutes.

93
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,625
Where's my bag?

94
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,597
Sorry about what happened.

95
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,598
Forget it.

96
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,400
Give me my bag. Now.

97
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,135
-Give it.
-I said I'm sorry.

98
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,803
-Jeez.
-I'm sorry about what happened earlier.

99
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,740
I'm also sorry for lying.

100
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
Look.

101
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,946
It's an apology apple.

102
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,381
Are you a kid?

103
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,017
That's so lame, I can't even laugh.

104
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:14,387
Anyway, don't say you'll leave.

105
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:16,956
Just stay here until you move
into your apartment.

106
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,461
It depends on how you act.

107
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:21,654
Cindy.

108
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,790
Someone sent me something
from the stock market reports

109
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,258
this morning.

110
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,462
It says you got hurt
while fighting a producer,

111
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,163
broke your leg,

112
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,966
and all sorts of other nonsense.

113
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:36,869
Why do you care if it's nonsense?

114
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,039
It will all disappear
once she starts working today.

115
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:41,841
Right.

116
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,644
That's why I'm sending you to Japan.

117
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:51,450
I feel bad for sending you far away
when your leg still hurts.

118
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,389
Cindy, you may be upset with me now,

119
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,392
but rumors must be nipped in the bud
the moment you hear about them.

120
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,494
If you just let it be,

121
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,362
it will become reality.

122
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,465
You won't be able to stop it
if it's already spread.

123
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,468
I'm not worried.

124
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,938
You always talk to the press for me.

125
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,342
Cindy, you're all grown up.

126
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,646
You used to cry in the practice room,
saying you wanted to go home to your mom.

127
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,481
You're right.

128
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,819
Now, I don't have a mom I want to see
or a home I want to go to.

129
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,089
I've really changed a lot.

130
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,925
You're departing from Gimpo, right?

131
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:34,860
Let's take my car.

132
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:35,761
No need.

133
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,496
My manager is coming now.

134
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,549
Producer Tak!

135
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,085
Oh, Seung-chan.

136
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,119
Are you going to work?

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,322
No, I'm going to the hospital.
I'm getting my stitches out.

138
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,924
I see. Get in then.

139
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,993
I only have to attend a lunch meeting,
so I can be a little late.

140
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:09,428
Really?

141
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:10,863
Should I ride with you then?

142
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:14,266
It's clean now.
You don't have to clean up.

143
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,770
Oh, it's a lot cleaner than my car.

144
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:19,905
Buckle up.

145
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,307
Okay.

146
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:35,554
Thanks. Let's go.

147
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:04,583
Is there a celebrity here?

148
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,052
Oh, my.

149
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,654
Hey.

150
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:12,291
People are following them.
It must be someone famous.

151
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,460
Might be someone I know.

152
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,719
Yes, sir.

153
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,557
I got the contact information.

154
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,861
I'll contact you
when we get to the airport.

155
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,369
I won't make a mistake again.

156
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,160
Cindy, I bet you're upset.

157
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,829
Honestly, I think CEO Byun went too far.

158
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,065
Why would she make you work
when you're wearing a cast?

159
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,499
But what can you do?

160
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,235
Try to take a break when you get back.

161
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,903
I'll strongly insist on it.

162
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,139
Cindy.

163
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,524
What exactly is this situation?

164
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,226
What do you mean?

165
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,695
Have you guys never laid low before?

166
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,732
I haven't.

167
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,067
You're lying low?

168
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,269
On your way out of the hospital?

169
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,907
Why did you get in this car?

170
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,608
Look here, Cindy.

171
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,543
We're not that close.

172
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:15,381
Am I supposed to provide
your means of escape

173
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,583
and a place to hide out?

174
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,752
I'll just drive for now.

175
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:21,487
Hey.

176
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,657
Drive where? We're not done here.

177
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,159
I paid the parking fee in advance.

178
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:28,928
I have to pull my car out in 10 minutes.

179
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,729
Eight minutes have already passed.

180
00:15:33,065 --> 00:15:34,400
This is nuts.

181
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,168
Go ahead.

182
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:40,005
Producer Seung-chan is very sensitive
about late fees and additional charges.

183
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,711
Fine, pull your car out first.
Let's talk once we're out.

184
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,262
Okay, fine.

185
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,131
It's not like we're strangers,

186
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,567
and you could have been in a rush.

187
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:13,539
But you got in the car,
so we have no ethical responsibility.

188
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:14,974
Do you agree?

189
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,642
Do you have any wet wipes?

190
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,650
Look here, Cindy.

191
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:28,587
I may seem tough on the outside,

192
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:33,158
but just because I seem tough
doesn't mean I'm not scared of your CEO.

193
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,227
I'm scared of her.

194
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,464
I may have been able to talk back to her
at the hospital that day,

195
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,166
but I was scared then.

196
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:46,405
Seung-chan.

197
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,340
You saw it too.

198
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:51,810
When CEO Byun slapped Cindy's manager.

199
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,278
Yes.

200
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:58,183
The other day,
when I called the CEO "sanmai,"

201
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,087
I thought she would start breathing fire.

202
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,522
Right, she's like that.

203
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,260
Wait, did you really call
CEO Byun "sanmai"?

204
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:09,995
Yes.

205
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:12,965
You must be crazy.

206
00:17:13,031 --> 00:17:14,233
Didn't she hit you?

207
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,103
Luckily, Producer Ra showed up just then.

208
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,071
Jun-mo?

209
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,173
He's such a busybody.

210
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,575
So...

211
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:24,910
what happened?

212
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,145
What did Jun-mo say?

213
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,413
Tell me.

214
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,417
Drop me off so I can catch a cab.

215
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,018
You're getting off?

216
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,187
Where are you taking a cab to?

217
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:36,288
I'll take care of myself.

218
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:37,890
Even though I don't have cab fare...

219
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:41,326
You don't even have money!

220
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,262
How irresponsible!

221
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,397
Where do you live, Cindy?

222
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,565
We'll drive you home.

223
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,467
I can't go home.

224
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:51,370
I'm lying low right now.
It would be weird to go home.

225
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,505
Don't go to your house then.

226
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,374
Why don't you go to your parents' house?

227
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,875
It's too far.

228
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,577
Jeez...

229
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,546
What are you going to do?

230
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:02,181
How about a friend's house?

231
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,250
Well, Cindy doesn't have friends...

232
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,052
What did I tell you?

233
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,154
I have friends! I really do.

234
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,156
They're just all busy.

235
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,092
Gosh, this is insane.

236
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:16,662
You have no money,
and your friends are busy.

237
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,363
On top of that, your leg is injured!

238
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,331
I know.

239
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,836
I know you didn't push me on purpose,

240
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:28,407
but my situation would be a lot better
if my leg wasn't injured.

241
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,577
It's not fully healed.

242
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,245
Whenever I move it...

243
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,395
What?

244
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,364
Say that again.

245
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:53,765
Well...

246
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,668
He got her in the car and drove off,

247
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,004
but she wasn't there
when he looked back while driving.

248
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,807
What kind of lunacy is that?

249
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:03,008
Where's Park?

250
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:05,744
Well...

251
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:12,818
I would rather fall
into a pit full of wild animals

252
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,820
than tell CEO Byun that I lost Cindy.

253
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,522
Don't look for me.

254
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,323
He's laying low too.

255
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:19,992
He's afraid of you.

256
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,095
Cindy's phone is off.

257
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,463
What should I do?

258
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,231
What do you mean?

259
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,467
She's going to miss several gigs!

260
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,768
Find her right away!

261
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,436
Check the places she usually goes to!

262
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,404
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,282
You know the situation I'm currently in.

264
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:47,019
I'm in no position to bring people home.

265
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,187
I live with my parents,

266
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,857
and my big brother and his wife
are separated right now.

267
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,026
I have a sister in junior high...

268
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,763
Everything was fine,
but your little sister makes this a no-go.

269
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:58,964
She's going to tell everyone.

270
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,366
Yes, I'm sure she would.

271
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,673
Cindy, we'll lend you some money.

272
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,976
How about you go to a nice hotel

273
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,345
that has a nice view of the Han river?

274
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:15,547
Take a few days off and relax.

275
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,250
Check all the luxury hotels in Seoul.

276
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,686
She's a germaphobe,
so she's going to be picky.

277
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:21,887
If she's not in Seoul,

278
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,223
check all the hotels in Busan and Jeju.

279
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,259
CEO Byun knows me too well.

280
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:30,229
She's probably already looking
at every hotel.

281
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,166
Then what will you do?

282
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:36,668
Just let me crash there for three days.

283
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,273
Ever since I became a trainee,
I haven't had a day off.

284
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,376
It's been ten years.

285
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,280
I just want to take three days off.

286
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,298
Why are you staring at me like that?

287
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:07,432
What is it?

288
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,405
Cindy's agency said

289
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,641
there won't be a problem
for the next shoot,

290
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,110
but I don't think she will make it.

291
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,281
So, let's get a temporary guest
that can be her substitute.

292
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,883
Cindy has an event in Japan today,

293
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,218
and I heard she's going.

294
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,787
Doesn't that mean she can do the shoot?

295
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,456
I heard she didn't make it to Japan.

296
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,659
Really?

297
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,128
Cindy didn't get on the plane.

298
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,530
Reporters who went there
to see her airport outfit

299
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,631
didn't see her at all.

300
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,900
Is she still in the hospital?

301
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,435
She was already discharged.

302
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,103
There are photos of her
all over the Internet.

303
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,072
Maybe she disappeared.

304
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:53,111
What are you doing?

305
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:55,580
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,616
It went down the wrong pipe.

307
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,320
Does that make sense?

308
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,888
CEO Byun is ruthless.

309
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:06,058
Cindy can't escape from her.

310
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,527
She has no place to go if she disappears.

311
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,565
I can't believe this.

312
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,667
I ended up doing it, didn't I?

313
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,470
I helped Cindy escape so she can lay low.

314
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,305
I even provided a hideout.

315
00:22:20,772 --> 00:22:24,509
So, do you live here with Producer Ra?

316
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:25,777
No!

317
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,947
You said you understood
after I explained it a hundred times.

318
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,615
What are you saying now?

319
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,785
I know. You're not living together...

320
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,154
We're just sharing an address, okay?

321
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,255
Temporarily.

322
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:38,423
Okay.

323
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,125
That's my little brother's room.

324
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,193
Do you want to see it?

325
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,561
No, it's okay.

326
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:44,830
I really do understand.

327
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:48,433
That's what you also said earlier.

328
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:53,004
Simply put, you and I
are in a similar situation. Isn't that so?

329
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:55,807
Similar? How so?

330
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,844
We have nowhere to go, so we're
temporarily crashing at this house.

331
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,079
I understood just fine.

332
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:06,151
Seeing that Cindy didn't show up
at the event,

333
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,222
she could be lying low.

334
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,991
If she is lying low,

335
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,694
maybe she has a man.

336
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:17,863
-Yes, that's right!
-Yes, she has a guy.

337
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,232
She got a man,

338
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:21,900
disobeyed her CEO,

339
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,235
and disappeared.

340
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,737
Do you think the guy is a celebrity?

341
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:26,905
An idol?

342
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,110
I know who every idol is dating.

343
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,080
I don't think Cindy is dating one.

344
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,415
Maybe a rich guy then.

345
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:37,983
-I think so.
-Right?

346
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:38,884
That's right.

347
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,819
She's dating a super rich guy,

348
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,288
so she's not worried
about cancellation fees.

349
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,823
That's why she skipped her gig.

350
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,493
Maybe she's at a fancy hotel in Paris
with that rich guy.

351
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,362
Oh, Paris...

352
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,297
She's not with a rich guy.

353
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,066
They don't know a thing.

354
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,872
This is a hemp pillow.

355
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,141
My mom sent it for me to use.

356
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,611
I got it out especially for you, okay?

357
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,014
This is very precious.

358
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,016
I see that you like pink.

359
00:24:14,152 --> 00:24:14,986
What?

360
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:18,390
I didn't think your wallpaper
would be pink.

361
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,691
You don't seem like that type.

362
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:25,197
Do I seem like I would have
leopard print walls

363
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:26,264
or something like that?

364
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:28,467
No, it's not like that.

365
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,101
I just didn't expect this.

366
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:31,369
Jeez.

367
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,004
Producer, I need some water.

368
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,421
Hot or cold?

369
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,422
Cold.

370
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,191
Just drink lukewarm water.

371
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,627
You're injured. Don't drink cold water.

372
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,370
I'm sorry,

373
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,772
but I don't like lukewarm water.

374
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,408
Can you at least add some lime?

375
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,744
Add what?

376
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:14,846
Don't you have any lime at home?

377
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,915
How about lemons?

378
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,119
All we have are tangerines.

379
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:31,463
Producer Ra,
we got a call from the amusement park.

380
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,032
They said we have to pay separately
for staff lodging.

381
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,736
They also want you to see
where the cast will be sleeping outdoors.

382
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,504
You just left last time.

383
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,573
I only have time tomorrow.

384
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,875
If I go after the meeting here,

385
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,546
I can leave by 5:00 pm.
and get there by 6:00 p.m.

386
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,114
Is that too late?

387
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,951
We're shooting at night anyway,

388
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,153
so it will be good
if you see the place at night.

389
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,558
Go to work.

390
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm taking the day off, so I'll stay home.

391
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,462
But you can't tell Jun-mo.

392
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,031
Why not?

393
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:08,266
If Jun-mo hears this,

394
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,635
he won't be able to keep a poker face
in front of people.

395
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:13,405
Can you?

396
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,440
I don't think you can either.

397
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:18,610
No, I can keep a poker face.

398
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,585
Anyway, watch yourself, okay?

399
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,189
Seung-chan.

400
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,624
You're coming with me tomorrow.

401
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,025
We need to take photos.

402
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:35,927
Okay.

403
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,095
See you.

404
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,302
What? Do you have something to say?

405
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,138
Yes, I have something to say.

406
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:48,473
What is it?

407
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,244
You can tell Jun-mo before he goes home.

408
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,481
-Actually, at your house...
-Jun-mo.

409
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,783
Tae-ho wants to get drinks.
Do you want to join us?

410
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,218
I might as well.

411
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,519
What about Ye-jin?

412
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,654
Producer Tak can't go.

413
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,859
I don't think she came to work today.

414
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:10,862
Oh, right.

415
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,398
She took a day off to go to the hospital.

416
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,666
Then we'll just go.

417
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,068
Do you want to come?

418
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:19,871
No, I'm okay.

419
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,172
Weren't you saying something?

420
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,908
It's nothing.

421
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:33,485
What are you doing?

422
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:37,055
The crease wasn't right.

423
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,158
I'll do this.

424
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,629
You're good.

425
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,665
I thought you never did stuff like this.

426
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,068
I don't like seeing things untidy.

427
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,843
Who is it?

428
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,011
Seung-chan.

429
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:11,823
I bought some lime.

430
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:12,857
Thanks.

431
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:16,261
She wants this in her water.

432
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,896
She's so fussy.

433
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:21,099
I'll be on my way now.

434
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,400
-Okay, bye.
-Stay for dinner.

435
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,138
Do you want to stay for dinner?

436
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,707
Yes.

437
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,342
If that's okay.

438
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,777
What are you going to make?

439
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,780
I just need feta cheese and lentils.

440
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,048
And quinoa.

441
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,250
What?

442
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:45,123
There are rumors already.

443
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,357
What rumors?

444
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,928
That our company can't handle Cindy.

445
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,029
That we aren't on good terms.

446
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:52,330
That she won't extend her contract.

447
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,101
And that she ran off overseas
with a rich guy.

448
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,804
There won't be rumors like this
if you find her!

449
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,074
If she goes to her gigs,
these rumors would disappear!

450
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:07,679
Well, there's only so much I can do
to find her without any help.

451
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:12,150
It's not like Cindy has any close friends
or anywhere to go.

452
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,986
But the biggest problem is,

453
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,922
we've never lost touch with her this long.

454
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,959
Maybe something terrible happened.
An accident, perhaps.

455
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,861
Or a kidnapping.

456
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,896
This won't do.

457
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:27,465
Right, we should report this
to the police.

458
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,735
You want to tell the world

459
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,537
that Cindy disappeared?

460
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,808
Then, what should I do?

461
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:44,816
Have you heard anything from CEO Byun?

462
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,451
I already told you I haven't.

463
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,186
I heard from someone

464
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:50,955
that Cindy fell for some rich guy.

465
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:53,458
They're apparently staying
at a hotel in Paris.

466
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,528
She injured her leg, and she's in a cast.

467
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,129
She wouldn't be in Paris.

468
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,731
That's what I heard too.

469
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,634
Someone saw her in Champs-Élysées.

470
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,104
Cindy's contract at her agency
is almost up.

471
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:07,605
Now that she's met a rich guy,

472
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:09,841
she won't let her agency control her.

473
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,476
Maybe that's why she's lying low overseas.

474
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,611
How would I know that?

475
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,413
Let's drop this.

476
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,519
Tae-ho, did you see
what Ko Yang-mi wore today?

477
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,322
I don't have the time

478
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:26,291
to look at Yang-mi's outfit.

479
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,760
I check what she wears every day.

480
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,929
She never wears the same thing twice.

481
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,064
They're not just normal clothes.

482
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,866
She only wears really expensive stuff.

483
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:39,070
Tae-ho, don't you think
he has too much time on his hands?

484
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,706
Why would you check stuff like that?

485
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,075
Hey, think about it.

486
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,245
How can she afford that with her salary?

487
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,414
Her car is really expensive too.

488
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,116
She does whatever she pleases at work.

489
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,520
She's somehow linked to the higher-ups--

490
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,022
Jeez, he's making stuff up again.

491
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,159
Ma'am, please switch out our grill.

492
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,093
Sure.

493
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:13,805
CINDY

494
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:22,513
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

495
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:42,200
Hey.

496
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,836
Do you live here now?

497
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,704
Why are you setting the table?

498
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:49,941
Well, the thing is...

499
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:56,514
Does your arm hurt so bad
that you can't set the table?

500
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:59,050
No. The thing is, Jun-mo--

501
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,019
Then just order in.

502
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,388
Or ask me to buy food on my way home.

503
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,323
Is my house a meeting spot now?

504
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:09,494
Why don't you just invite all your friends
and your old classmates too?

505
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,329
Just invite everyone you know.

506
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:12,864
Move aside.

507
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:21,172
Hello, Producer Ra.

508
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,544
Cindy!

509
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:34,886
I'm just

510
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,388
in so much shock

511
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,995
that I can't even say anything.

512
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,933
How could you bring her here?

513
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,736
I didn't want to.

514
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,572
But I felt sorry for her.

515
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,842
She had nowhere to go.

516
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,011
I know what it feels like.

517
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:03,081
It's great that you can sympathize

518
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,317
with other people's suffering,

519
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,254
but why bring her to my house?

520
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:14,759
You're right since you own the house,

521
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,928
you make the decision.

522
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:19,797
Call CEO Byun
and tell her to pick Cindy up.

523
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,232
That's the easiest way.

524
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:24,502
We'll let her take Cindy
and work her to death.

525
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,973
What's wrong with you all?

526
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,609
Am I the only scumbag here?

527
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,312
Gosh!

528
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,214
What the hell is this?

529
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:40,752
My goodness.

530
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,787
There were rumors of you

531
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:47,525
being at a hotel
in Champs-Élysées in Paris.

532
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:51,029
But you're sitting there,

533
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,731
eating rice with seaweed.

534
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,134
I guess this is a fancy hotel.

535
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,136
I'm actually not supposed
to eat stuff like this.

536
00:33:58,636 --> 00:33:59,704
Spicy and salty foods.

537
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,572
Especially not broth.

538
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,746
Who made this?

539
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,715
What do you mean? Of course, I did.

540
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:12,817
It's really good.

541
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:15,319
Really? Eat up then.

542
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,220
Yes.

543
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,855
Jeez.

544
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,093
Anyway, when I asked earlier,

545
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:26,397
you said you don't have lentils,
chia seeds, feta cheese, or quinoa.

546
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,000
That's why I have no choice
but to eat this today.

547
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,070
However, I would appreciate it
if you could get all that tomorrow.

548
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,240
I can't eat this much sodium.

549
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:39,077
You'll be here tomorrow too?

550
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:46,317
DEMIAN

551
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,021
I'm leaving now.

552
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,490
Okay, go ahead.

553
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,859
Producer Baek.

554
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:58,196
I have a question.

555
00:34:58,930 --> 00:34:59,864
Just a second.

556
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,765
Okay.

557
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,436
Why are these parts underlined?

558
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,271
Oh, that.

559
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,607
Those are parts I like.

560
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:14,278
I can't understand this at all.

561
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,546
It's too difficult.

562
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,849
Well...

563
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:21,886
exactly what part don't you understand?

564
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:25,756
Well, for example, this.

565
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,025
"The bird fights its way out of the egg.

566
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,026
The egg is the world.

567
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:32,063
Who would be born
must first destroy a world."

568
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,037
This is the universal nature of humans.

569
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:44,542
You have to break free of weakness,
laziness, and fear

570
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,713
in order to enter a new world.

571
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,451
So, the bird is like a human.

572
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:57,788
The egg is the society that surrounds us,

573
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,892
the environment, the rules...

574
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:02,727
Human relationships.

575
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,963
It's stable,

576
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:10,334
but it's stagnant at the same time.

577
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,540
Once humans break free of that,

578
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,743
they can obtain a new world.

579
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,045
They can obtain true freedom.

580
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,513
It's like that...

581
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,717
For me, personally,

582
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,220
I think it means that for humans to grow,

583
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:34,158
there must be pain and sacrifice.

584
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:36,761
Pain and sacrifice.

585
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,296
Yes.

586
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,897
That's what I think.

587
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:42,867
It's what you think.

588
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:52,677
Oh no.

589
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:54,946
Who is it?

590
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,647
It's CEO Byun.

591
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,749
What? CEO Byun?

592
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:00,918
I'm scared.

593
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:13,764
-Hello?
-Producer Ra?

594
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:15,466
This is Byun of Byun Entertainment.

595
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,535
I'm in front of your house now.

596
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,502
In front of my house?

597
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,472
Okay.

598
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,945
I'm sorry. I'll just leave.

599
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:29,914
Just stay for now.

600
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,350
I'll go and hear what she has to say.

601
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,359
How did you find out where I live?

602
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,361
Don't you remember?

603
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:46,964
I came here once five years ago.

604
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:47,865
Right.

605
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,201
That's right.

606
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,670
You heard about Cindy, right?

607
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,738
Yes.

608
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,273
Kind of.

609
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,747
Do you know anything
about this incident, Producer Ra?

610
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:04,949
Well...

611
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,485
I don't.

612
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:15,159
You're the producer of the show
that Cindy is on now,

613
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:17,194
so I'll just tell you.

614
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:20,231
Cindy has cut off all contact.

615
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,436
She has never done this before.

616
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,673
Is this late puberty?

617
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,575
Anyway, this upsets me.

618
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,078
Now that she's lying low,

619
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,746
there are rumors
about us not getting along

620
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,583
and that she's eloped
with some rich guy abroad.

621
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,288
There are all sorts of negative rumors.

622
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,489
Well...

623
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,392
as long as they're not true, it's fine.

624
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,830
Producer Ra,

625
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,667
to stop certain headlines
in morning papers from getting out,

626
00:38:57,034 --> 00:39:00,338
I've pulled the power cord
of the rotary press before.

627
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:02,073
That's how long
I've been in this industry.

628
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,774
Times have changed,

629
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:06,077
but this is still the worst-case scenario.

630
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:12,650
Rumors.

631
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,920
The fact that something could've happened.

632
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,988
The fact that someone could be to blame.

633
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:19,090
Suspicions.

634
00:39:20,124 --> 00:39:23,361
Rumors, whispers, or maybe not.

635
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,863
Hearsay.

636
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:28,265
Nobody can stop it.

637
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:34,772
Tomorrow morning,
you'll get a lot of calls from reporters.

638
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,675
We should get our stories straight.

639
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,111
Cindy needed a break,

640
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,980
so she's resting safely at her agency.

641
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,181
Tell them that.

642
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,650
Tell them she is totally safe.

643
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,554
I came here to ask you to tell them that.

644
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,324
Okay then.

645
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:55,926
Because...

646
00:39:56,761 --> 00:40:00,297
Cindy really is resting.

647
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,306
What a relief.

648
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,109
I thought she knew Cindy was here,
and I was really worried.

649
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:16,580
I was also nervous
since I didn't know if she knew.

650
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,149
This is making me thirsty.

651
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:27,591
Who organized all this?

652
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,594
Amazing.

653
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:37,435
Who wants beer?

654
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,473
You said you didn't drink beer.

655
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,642
I had a gig the next day,

656
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,045
so I didn't want to drink
because it would make my face puffy.

657
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,614
It's okay for me to drink today
since I don't have work tomorrow.

658
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:56,754
Cindy, I would've never imagined.

659
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,722
How are you so good at organizing?

660
00:40:59,323 --> 00:41:00,491
Jun-mo.

661
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,727
Cindy organized the disposable chopsticks
in the drawer.

662
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:06,163
She categorized them by restaurant.

663
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,298
Isn't that amazing?

664
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,670
To be honest, you like the fact that
Cindy is tidying up our house, right?

665
00:41:14,538 --> 00:41:15,372
Of course.

666
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,774
And you?

667
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,744
CEO Byun came to see you
because Cindy disappeared on her,

668
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,979
so you're liking this too, right?

669
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,547
Of course.

670
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,718
You're trying to make up
for getting Cindy hurt

671
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,553
by bringing her to my house, right?

672
00:41:31,188 --> 00:41:32,056
Of course.

673
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:34,091
I bet you like the fact

674
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,028
that a pretty young celebrity like this
is sitting in your living room.

675
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,297
-You like it, do you?
-Of course! I do.

676
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:43,667
What are you two doing?

677
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,270
This is how we talk when we drink.

678
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,338
The "of course" game.

679
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,806
It was on X-Man.

680
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,642
You must respond by saying, "Of course."

681
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:54,945
Cindy might be too young
to know about that show, right?

682
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,946
Of course.

683
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:57,915
What was that?

684
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:01,952
Do you want to start with me?

685
00:42:02,753 --> 00:42:03,621
Of course.

686
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:08,993
Okay, let's do this.

687
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,394
Cindy, you...

688
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:12,830
You're here because
you have no friends, right?

689
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:17,935
Of course.

690
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,371
You...

691
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,607
You're living here
because you're broke, right?

692
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:31,882
Of course.

693
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,986
You took your jacket off on air last time
to stick it to me, right?

694
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:36,921
Right?

695
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:38,889
Of course.

696
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:42,226
Jeez...

697
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,462
When you date guys it has never lasted

698
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,197
more than three months, right?

699
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,768
Gosh.

700
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,503
How did you know that?

701
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,471
Jun-mo, did you tell her?

702
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:55,606
No.

703
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:57,508
I'm not that close to her.

704
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,513
Then...

705
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,315
-You really didn't tell her?
-I didn't.

706
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,883
Then how did you know that?

707
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,989
You're supposed to say, "Of course."
You lost your cool.

708
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:16,460
You're laughing?

709
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:18,162
Let's play now.

710
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:19,830
Excuse me?

711
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,832
I bet you hate it
that they used to call you brilliant

712
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:23,567
at Seoul National University,

713
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,536
but they call you an idiot at KBS.

714
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,104
You feel like that's really unfair, right?

715
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:29,607
Of course.

716
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,175
Producer Tak.

717
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,312
May I speak freely with you?

718
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,881
-It's just a game. Go ahead.
-Right.

719
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,351
Ye-jin, you...

720
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,052
Jeez.

721
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,256
You know that you're a lot prettier than
what you think of yourself, right?

722
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,125
Are you drunk?

723
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,460
Of course.

724
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,430
You know that you look kind of dumb,
but you're actually kind of cute, right?

725
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:54,999
Of course.

726
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,901
What are you two doing?

727
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,841
You're more charming
when you're angry, you know that, right?

728
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:04,842
Of course!

729
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:06,644
Give me a break.

730
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,579
You know this is why I like you, right?

731
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:11,515
Of course.

732
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,617
Oh, please.

733
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:15,119
This is nuts.

734
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,988
Do you like me more than Producer Ra?

735
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,502
Of course.

736
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:33,771
Hey!

737
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,506
You haven't known him that long,

738
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,640
yet you like him more than me?

739
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:37,541
Yes.

740
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,143
Jeez.

741
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,978
You like me too, right?

742
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:48,819
Of course.

743
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,055
Hey.

744
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,590
Did you two plan this?

745
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:54,892
We didn't.

746
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,595
You just don't know that the junior staff
love and respect me the most.

747
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,464
Right, Seung-chan?

748
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,867
-See?
-No way.

749
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,436
That's ridiculous.

750
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:22,119
Try to find clues.

751
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,020
Yes.

752
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:24,621
You go look there. You go to Cindy's room.

753
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:25,823
Hurry.

754
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,527
General Manager Kim.

755
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,297
Call Lawyer Hwang tomorrow morning.

756
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,733
Tell him to prepare
the evidential document

757
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:38,469
for the cancellation fees.

758
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,774
That's money we have to get back.

759
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,109
All of it.

760
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,711
Yes, ma'am.

761
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,653
I...

762
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,591
I debuted when I was 13 years old.

763
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:06,697
So I've never been able to do anything.

764
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,867
Right, I bet you haven't.

765
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,903
CEO Byun wouldn't let you do anything.

766
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:16,440
I didn't go to school like a normal kid,

767
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,109
I've never gone on a school trip,

768
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:22,946
I've never even had a proper drink.

769
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:29,419
Not knowing how to drink
is like not knowing life.

770
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,726
What would I know?

771
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,396
I don't even know how to drink.

772
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,964
Here.

773
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:41,865
Okay.

774
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,867
Everyone, have a drink.

775
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:49,406
I bet you've never tasted
anything like this.

776
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,809
What would I know?

777
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,611
I debuted when I was 13 years old,

778
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,080
so I don't know anything.

779
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,726
I debuted when I was 13 years old,

780
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:13,096
so I've been a singer for ten years.

781
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:16,800
In the land of idol singers,
I'm a senior citizen.

782
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,306
I debuted when I was 13 years old.

783
00:47:22,372 --> 00:47:24,274
I was 13...

784
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,814
She keeps repeating herself.

785
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:32,482
That must happen when she drinks.

786
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,385
Yes, that's what I think too.

787
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:39,489
A person shouldn't be a sloppy drunk.

788
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,496
Ye-jin doesn't have
drinking habits like that.

789
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,366
Here she goes again.

790
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,670
Ye-jin really hates

791
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,506
people with bad drinking habits.

792
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:58,976
I think she's drunk.

793
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:01,645
Hey, let's wrap this up quickly.

794
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,046
-Seung-chan.
-Before it gets worse.

795
00:48:03,113 --> 00:48:05,616
Ye-jin wants a second round of drinks.

796
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:07,985
Is this Information Service?

797
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:11,121
-Ma'am.
-Ye-jin wants a second round!

798
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,456
It's me, Cindy.

799
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,460
-Where are you going?
-Ma'am, you still haven't gotten off work?

800
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:17,527
-Yes, ma'am.
-Where?

801
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:18,562
I'm worse off than you.

802
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:20,264
-I don't want to go to the roof.
-I was 13...

803
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:21,431
-I...
-Not the roof.

804
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,267
If only I hadn't gone
to the amusement park...

805
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,568
-What's wrong with her?
-I was 13.

806
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:26,370
What would I know
after debuting at the age of 13?

807
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,704
Did you just laugh at me?

808
00:48:27,771 --> 00:48:30,173
What would a 13-year-old know?

809
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,042
-I debuted when I was 13.
-Come on.

810
00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:34,044
I'm sorry.

811
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,679
-Tomorrow...
-I'm sorry.

812
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,415
-Ma'am...
-Ye-jin wants to go home.

813
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:39,516
You guys...

814
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:40,851
Jun-mo.

815
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,886
-I was 13...
-Ye-jin wants more drinks!

816
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,021
Let's hurry.

817
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,656
-What does a 13-year-old know?
-Let's go!

818
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,724
-Seung-chan!
-Don't do this, Cindy.

819
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:49,693
-Calling Information Service...
-I...

820
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,062
-Seung-chan.
-When I was 13...

821
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,198
-What would a 13-year-old know?
-No!

822
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:56,500
I want to go home!

823
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,935
I don't know anything.

824
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,670
Seung-chan, why are you being like this?

825
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:00,904
Hurry!

826
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,806
-I'm sorry.
-Guys.

827
00:49:02,873 --> 00:49:04,007
-I'm sorry.
-Ma'am.

828
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:17,654
Shouldn't you go back today?

829
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:19,623
She said she wants to stay for three days.

830
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:23,560
If you keep skipping your gigs,

831
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:26,530
CEO Byun won't just let it slide.

832
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,832
She will do something.

833
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,969
I think you should go back too.

834
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,638
It's...

835
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,574
It's been ten years

836
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:42,746
since I last had a home-cooked meal
on my birthday.

837
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,582
It's your birthday?

838
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:48,819
Really?

839
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,591
-It's her birthday.
-It is.

840
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,494
What a good time to be born.

841
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,463
Not too hot or cold.

842
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,866
Congratulations

843
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:06,370
You should have made seaweed soup.

844
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:08,071
I didn't know it was her birthday.

845
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,907
Cindy, what do you want to eat?

846
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,544
Jun-mo, let's give Cindy
a birthday party this evening.

847
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,346
I can't make it tonight.

848
00:50:16,413 --> 00:50:18,348
I have to finish my field investigation.

849
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:20,050
At the amusement park.

850
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,219
Amusement park? Where?

851
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:23,587
Yongin.

852
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,355
Can I come too?

853
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:28,425
How can you go there?

854
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:30,694
Did you forget that you're lying low?

855
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,229
You're going at night.

856
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,132
There's a reason why I have to go.

857
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,000
Please take me.

858
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,104
Really?

859
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,406
Okay then.

860
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,375
How can I say no
when she looks at me with those big eyes?

861
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,612
Do you want to come too?
It's been a while.

862
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:51,581
I have a meeting in the evening.

863
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,384
I'll let you know if I can join you.

864
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,320
Did you contact Reporter Min?

865
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,656
Yes, he's preparing for the interview.

866
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,024
Write this down.

867
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,192
Yes.

868
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:06,229
"Cindy is taking a break
at a certain place.

869
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:10,667
She's relaxing her mind and body
under the supervision of her agency.

870
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,070
We can't tell you the exact reason,

871
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,939
but she suffered
major psychological trauma."

872
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:16,840
Okay.

873
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,543
Oh, and add this at the end.

874
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:20,977
"Meanwhile..."

875
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:21,878
"Meanwhile"?

876
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:28,318
"Recently, at a shoot for a special show
at a broadcast station,

877
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,554
Cindy was..."

878
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,123
"Cindy was injured on stage

879
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,059
due to the mistake
of main producer, Miss. T,

880
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,428
and was hospitalized."

881
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,633
Why is that showing up here?

882
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,904
They always say
what they really want at the end.

883
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,175
This makes it seem like
something happened between you two

884
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:55,312
that traumatized Cindy.

885
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,381
As if you injured her on purpose.

886
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,816
Right?

887
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,751
I'm not the only one who felt that way.

888
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:02,819
Right.

889
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,088
I think everyone feels that way.

890
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,289
What?

891
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,992
Right now, on Cindy's fan club website,

892
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,495
they're all voting.

893
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:12,729
Voting on what?

894
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,967
Whether or not you injured Cindy
on purpose.

895
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,172
INJURY INTENTIONAL OR NOT INTENTIONAL

896
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,678
Why would I do that on purpose?

897
00:52:28,745 --> 00:52:30,280
This is ridiculous.

898
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:35,986
As of now, 85% think that
you did it on purpose.

899
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,455
It was just 60% before.

900
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,057
Things aren't going well.

901
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,330
Do they know that the producer
who goes by Miss. T is me?

902
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:50,133
How many music show producers are there

903
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,270
among the three major networks
whose name starts with "T"?

904
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,305
Right?

905
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,541
I bet I'm the only one.

906
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:02,913
Hey.

907
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,649
I tried to save Cindy!

908
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:08,051
I even got injured in the process!

909
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:11,788
And if they really knew what I was doing,

910
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,124
they would be worshipping me as a hero!

911
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:17,093
What are you doing?

912
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,798
Forget it!

913
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,901
I'm not scared
of negative comments online.

914
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,737
I'm not scared of cowards
hiding behind their monitors.

915
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:38,682
TAK YE-JIN, OUT

916
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:49,426
I think I was rash when I said

917
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:52,062
that those people were cowards.

918
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,965
I see that they actually took action.

919
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,500
They have drive.

920
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,876
That's enough footage.

921
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,780
How could this happen?

922
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:12,716
Right.

923
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:14,884
Ye-jin.

924
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:18,321
It's my first time to hear a producer
pushing and hospitalizing a cast member.

925
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:22,292
It's also my first time to take many calls
because an article was written.

926
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,128
This is so unfair.

927
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,698
Request a correction of the article

928
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,600
or send it to the
Press Arbitration Commission.

929
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,702
What are you all doing?

930
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,739
But it's not that easy.

931
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:39,075
It never says in the article

932
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,645
that this incident was our fault.

933
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:42,779
Sure it does!

934
00:54:42,846 --> 00:54:44,414
That's exactly what they meant!

935
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:46,716
We can't take legal action over that.

936
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,286
They are just guessing
as to what really happened.

937
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:55,058
Rumors.

938
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,961
The fact that something could've happened.

939
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,729
The fact that someone could be to blame.

940
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:00,730
Suspicions.

941
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,500
Rumors, whispers, or maybe not.

942
00:55:03,566 --> 00:55:04,601
Hearsay.

943
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,369
Nobody can stop it.

944
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:11,308
CEO Byun is trying
to take the heat off of her

945
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:13,910
by making Ye-jin the bad guy!

946
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,052
Hello, Producer.

947
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,586
-Hi.
-Hello.

948
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:26,489
Are you okay?

949
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,527
I bet she isn't.

950
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:35,598
Yes, that's right.

951
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:36,766
It's me.

952
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,335
I'm Producer T.

953
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,238
-Isn't that Producer Tak?
-It's okay. I'm really fine.

954
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,873
My car just got a bit banged up.

955
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:47,610
I'm fine.

956
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:55,385
-Producer Tak.
-Yes?

957
00:55:56,453 --> 00:55:57,654
Are you okay?

958
00:55:58,588 --> 00:55:59,889
Why?

959
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,827
People talked about it
after they saw the article.

960
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:05,628
I heard someone damaged your car.

961
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,432
Jeez, Cindy's fans must be strong.

962
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,201
You saw what happened last time.

963
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:15,505
The members of her fan club
are like athletes.

964
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:17,941
They're big guys.

965
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,276
But it's okay.

966
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,846
These false rumors will die down

967
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,948
once people see they're not true.

968
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,750
It's no big deal.

969
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:31,488
What's this?

970
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:37,260
YOU CALL YOURSELF A PRODUCER?
THAT WAS ATTEMPTED MURDER. APOLOGIZE!

971
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:41,164
They're really giving it to me.

972
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:45,568
CEO Byun really manipulated
the media well.

973
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,338
She's really playing with me.

974
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:49,739
My goodness.

975
00:56:50,173 --> 00:56:52,142
How did they know your phone number?

976
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,644
I don't know.

977
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,747
Oh, that.

978
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,283
Your phone number on your car.

979
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,086
Oh, gosh. Did they really see that?

980
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,721
You should take that off.

981
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,523
You should be careful for now.

982
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:09,959
You never know when someone
might pop out to harass you.

983
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:12,662
Oh, please.

984
00:57:12,729 --> 00:57:13,797
Forget it. Let's go.

985
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:40,690
What are you doing?

986
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:46,329
That motorcycle seemed suspicious.

987
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:49,499
Look.

988
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,034
It's not suspicious at all!

989
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,770
How is that suspicious?

990
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,673
Stop overreacting!

991
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,808
You almost got me hurt!

992
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:01,411
Let's go.

993
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:04,848
What are you doing?

994
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:07,016
You're acting so weird.

995
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:23,166
Producer Tak Ye-jin.

996
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:26,636
Yes, that's me. And you are?

997
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:29,072
You don't know me?

998
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:32,742
Well, not really.

999
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,813
Well, that's upsetting.

1000
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,086
I'm trying to recall...

1001
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:47,123
Who is this person?

1002
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,193
Get off me. What's wrong with you?

1003
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,160
Do you know this person?

1004
00:58:51,895 --> 00:58:54,931
Producer Tak,
things must be going well for you.

1005
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,066
I haven't seen you in a while.

1006
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,937
It's Myeong-cheol!

1007
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:03,573
I used to be 4Minute's manager!

1008
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,142
Oh, Myeong-cheol!

1009
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,545
Why did you gain so much weight?
I didn't recognize you!

1010
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:09,479
You startled me.

1011
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,248
But who is this?

1012
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,484
Producer Tak!

1013
00:59:14,684 --> 00:59:16,219
You got yourself a fine boyfriend.

1014
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,889
No, I'm...

1015
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:21,958
I'm nobody.

1016
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,126
I...

1017
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:25,695
Please continue talking.

1018
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,264
See you around, Myeong-cheol.

1019
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,465
Okay, Producer.

1020
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:30,700
Get over here.

1021
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,168
Producer Tak...

1022
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,305
I thought he was someone suspicious.

1023
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:37,307
So what if he was?

1024
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,075
He's twice your size.

1025
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:43,246
But there's a big difference
between taking an action and not.

1026
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,916
And another thing.

1027
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:50,386
"Do you know this person?"

1028
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:51,788
Jeez.

1029
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:55,592
You keep acting so casual with me.

1030
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:01,297
It was just method acting.

1031
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,000
Stop overreacting!

1032
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,902
Someone might think

1033
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:09,439
that I was being seriously threatened.

1034
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,741
I don't want to seem like that.

1035
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,346
But still,

1036
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,449
they wrecked your car
and sent you threat messages.

1037
01:00:19,515 --> 01:00:22,085
That's legally considered threatening.

1038
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:23,920
You really have to be careful.

1039
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:26,556
Producer Tak.

1040
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:34,197
Excuse me, miss.

1041
01:00:34,931 --> 01:00:38,768
You have to separate the bottle and cap.

1042
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,374
That's it.

1043
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,576
Excuse me, miss.

1044
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:49,646
You can't just throw out
those gas canisters.

1045
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,147
I should put a hole in it first.

1046
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,552
Yes, like that.

1047
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,192
Did you wash every single can?

1048
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,093
Yes.

1049
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,295
-Why?
-It's cleaner that way.

1050
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,264
Goodness gracious.

1051
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,099
How come a young lady knows all this?

1052
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,834
Young girls don't know stuff like this.

1053
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:15,204
They throw out eggshells with food waste.

1054
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,306
How absurd. That's regular trash.

1055
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,641
Right.

1056
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,144
-And banana peels?
-Food waste.

1057
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:23,146
-Chestnut and peanut shells?
-Regular trash.

1058
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,847
-Animal intestines?
-Food waste.

1059
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:26,916
Precisely.

1060
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,285
Miss.

1061
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,622
Would you like to work with us?

1062
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:36,993
We do the recycling every Thursday
at the women's group.

1063
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,064
That sounds tempting, but...

1064
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,500
I'm sorry, I'm just
staying here temporarily.

1065
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,653
I can't believe there are
nice young ladies around these days.

1066
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,726
She even took the plastic tags off.

1067
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:11,194
Goodness.

1068
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,397
Oh, my goodness.

1069
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:42,525
He's so annoying.

1070
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,093
He keeps talking badly about you...

1071
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,996
He said I'm tied to the higher-ups?

1072
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:47,897
What else?

1073
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,799
Doesn't she look like
she has a lot of secrets?

1074
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:51,901
She's not bright. She looks gloomy.

1075
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,269
I actually feel bad for her.

1076
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:54,771
She's unhappy,

1077
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,973
so she obsesses over toner and paper.

1078
01:02:58,508 --> 01:02:59,375
Move.

1079
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:14,657
Are you going to the first floor?

1080
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:17,026
Yes.

1081
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:19,929
Canceled.

1082
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:24,100
-Basement Floor 2.
-I'm going to the first floor.

1083
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:32,041
What?

1084
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,309
What did you say?

1085
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:35,144
It means "watch your mouth."

1086
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,280
It's a Russian proverb.

1087
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,714
Okay.

1088
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:40,750
Producer Kim Hong-sun.

1089
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,152
If you go around and talk about me again,

1090
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:48,157
I'm going to tear off your horns.

1091
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:50,259
Got it.

1092
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:55,765
Would you like a taste now?

1093
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:56,999
No.

1094
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,169
I get the point.

1095
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:07,009
Work hard.

1096
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,423
Where's Producer Tak?

1097
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,458
Oh, she went to the auto shop.

1098
01:04:22,725 --> 01:04:24,026
She had to get her car fixed.

1099
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,529
She will come meet us after she's done.

1100
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:27,663
The auto shop? Why?

1101
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,465
Well...

1102
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,366
It's just...

1103
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,236
Something needs to be fixed.

1104
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:35,171
What did you do all day?

1105
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:36,906
Weren't you bored?

1106
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:38,441
Not at all.

1107
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,911
There were so many things
that needed to be organized at your house.

1108
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,780
I recycled and took a nap after.

1109
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:48,184
Also, I didn't even touch my phone

1110
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,019
and didn't use the Internet all day.

1111
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:51,721
That felt great.

1112
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,322
I had so much free time too.

1113
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:55,658
Good.

1114
01:04:56,125 --> 01:04:57,126
Good job.

1115
01:04:57,193 --> 01:05:01,163
I heard that it's your birthday today.

1116
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,232
Congratulations, Cindy.

1117
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:07,637
Is that it?

1118
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,408
Then what?

1119
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:14,243
You should have fun with me.

1120
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:19,081
It's been ten years since I last went
on a non-work related outing.

1121
01:05:23,786 --> 01:05:24,654
I'm excited.

1122
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,208
Sit here.

1123
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:48,945
I can walk a bit.

1124
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:50,279
You can't.

1125
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,714
This place is huge.

1126
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,684
What if you make your injury worse
by walking too much?

1127
01:05:54,984 --> 01:05:55,918
Just get on.

1128
01:05:55,985 --> 01:05:58,721
Sit on that and wear that hat.
Nobody will recognize you.

1129
01:05:58,788 --> 01:05:59,689
Sit down.

1130
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:08,764
-Let's go.
-Okay.

1131
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,016
I'll meet the promotions manager

1132
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,618
and ask about the staff lodging
and some other stuff.

1133
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,955
You go to the place I told you to go
and take photos.

1134
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:36,692
Take care of Cindy.

1135
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:37,760
Got it.

1136
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,061
Go.

1137
01:06:42,231 --> 01:06:44,233
What's taking Ye-jin so long?

1138
01:06:49,905 --> 01:06:50,873
Yes.

1139
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:52,341
It's all done now.

1140
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,210
It took a while to get the writing off.

1141
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,445
I'll call you
when I get to the parking lot.

1142
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:57,480
Bye.

1143
01:06:59,749 --> 01:07:01,050
How much is it?

1144
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:01,984
Well...

1145
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:04,387
-Can I pay with my card?
-Yes.

1146
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,602
How did they know your phone number?

1147
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:22,138
I don't know.

1148
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,273
Oh, that.

1149
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,642
Your phone number on your car.

1150
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,445
Oh, gosh. Did they really see that?

1151
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:31,013
You should take that off.

1152
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,748
You should be careful for now.

1153
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:35,951
You never know when someone
might pop out to harass you.

1154
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:41,791
Seung-chan overreacts too much...

1155
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,251
For real!

1156
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:13,122
She twirled me like a top
and twisted my arm!

1157
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:16,292
Aren't you ashamed that she did that
considering how big your muscles are?

1158
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,360
This is nuts.

1159
01:08:19,128 --> 01:08:20,129
Jeez...

1160
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:23,833
Look at my hand! It's trembling!

1161
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:24,767
Look!

1162
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,203
-Eat.
-I want it with the salt.

1163
01:08:32,975 --> 01:08:34,143
Cindy.

1164
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,113
Where are you?

1165
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:41,016
You're killing me!

1166
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:47,490
Can we pitch a tent
where the train tracks are? I'm kidding.

1167
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:51,560
If they go back and forth on the pirate
ship ride, they won't get any sleep.

1168
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:56,699
ARE YOU HERE YET?
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU GET HERE.

1169
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:19,355
What's going on here?

1170
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:27,196
INJURY INTENTIONAL OR NOT INTENTIONAL

1171
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,831
YES, NO

1172
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:33,636
INTENTIONAL, 90%
NOT INTENTIONAL, 10%

1173
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,738
YOU HAVE VOTED, "NOT INTENTIONAL."
THANK YOU

1174
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,542
07. MEDIA MANIPULATION

1175
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:42,244
THE TRUTH ISN'T ABOUT
WHAT THE MAJORITY BELIEVES

1176
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:39,201
This place is still the same.

1177
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:45,074
I came here today exactly ten years ago.

1178
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,377
You were 13 years old ten years ago.

1179
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,846
You probably came here with your parents.

1180
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:06,695
That day...

1181
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,900
If only I hadn't come here...

1182
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:15,871
Why?

1183
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,789
This is where I first met CEO Byun.

1184
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:36,925
You've heard of it, right?

1185
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:38,627
They scout people on the street.

1186
01:11:39,194 --> 01:11:40,763
If you regret coming here,

1187
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,766
does it mean you don't like your life now?

1188
01:11:45,367 --> 01:11:49,571
You may be busy,
have no time for yourself,

1189
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:52,875
and things may be tough,

1190
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,979
but there are good aspects too.

1191
01:11:59,081 --> 01:12:00,115
Like what?

1192
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:03,352
The only thing left in my life

1193
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,355
is to go downhill.

1194
01:12:08,357 --> 01:12:10,125
Even though I just turned 23 today.

1195
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,665
I've just been climbing upwards.

1196
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:20,936
Now all that's left is to go down.

1197
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,142
So, what do you think is good about that?

1198
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,351
My mom...

1199
01:12:35,984 --> 01:12:38,120
She likes Jeon Young-rok.

1200
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,256
When she listens to songs

1201
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:45,294
like "My Love the Crybaby"
or "Write Love with a Pencil,"

1202
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,463
her heart races,
and she still enjoys them.

1203
01:12:48,230 --> 01:12:51,533
They bring back memories

1204
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:53,302
of when she was dating long ago.

1205
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,040
Being a big star of an era

1206
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,277
is like being a symbol of that era.

1207
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:07,449
Even if you're not as famous later on,
when people listen to your songs,

1208
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,853
they won't just remember you,

1209
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:14,623
but they will also remember
the best times of their life

1210
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:18,327
and will feel nostalgic.

1211
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:23,265
I think that's meaningful.

1212
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:29,405
I guess that's possible.

1213
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,308
I have never thought about that.

1214
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,182
My mom liked Leslie Cheung.

1215
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:42,484
That's why

1216
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:47,222
my dad bought 100 chocolates

1217
01:13:47,289 --> 01:13:49,091
from Leslie Cheung's commercial

1218
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:50,793
to get my mom to go out with him.

1219
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,499
I bet your mom was sad

1220
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,768
when Leslie Cheung passed away.

1221
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,077
But still...

1222
01:14:12,481 --> 01:14:15,117
I wish I didn't come here that day.

1223
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,555
I used to live in Chuncheon.

1224
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,627
I begged my parents
to take me here for my birthday.

1225
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,097
After I met CEO Byun,

1226
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,434
I basically lived
in the practice room in Seoul.

1227
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:40,375
My parents would come to see me in Seoul
once every two weeks.

1228
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:44,880
But then...

1229
01:14:57,993 --> 01:14:59,261
Cindy.

1230
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,164
I'm your mom now.

1231
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,068
Just trust me and follow me.

1232
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:18,580
If...

1233
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:22,784
I hadn't begged my parents
to bring me here that day,

1234
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:26,989
and...

1235
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,960
if I hadn't met CEO Byun,

1236
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:34,596
and...

1237
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,200
if I hadn't lived apart

1238
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,105
from my parents...

1239
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:46,909
and...

1240
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:53,749
if that accident hadn't happened,

1241
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:57,286
everything would have been perfect.

1242
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:09,131
I can think about it thousands of times,

1243
01:16:09,798 --> 01:16:12,034
but it won't undo what happened.

1244
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:19,141
I've thought about it every night
for ten years.

1245
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,177
When I think of that...

1246
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,648
I can't fall asleep.

1247
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:12,194
Cindy, it's not your fault.

1248
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:16,431
I'm sure your parents
didn't think it was your fault either.

1249
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:18,934
Having what-ifs...

1250
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:20,669
I'm sure...

1251
01:17:22,671 --> 01:17:24,373
they don't want you
to think about those anymore.

1252
01:17:25,707 --> 01:17:26,708
They're probably thinking

1253
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,579
that up until now,

1254
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,182
despite being on your own,

1255
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:37,285
you've done well.

1256
01:17:39,788 --> 01:17:40,989
They know how hard you've worked.

1257
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:45,027
That must be what they're thinking.

1258
01:17:53,935 --> 01:17:54,903
Thank you.

1259
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:05,113
Can you hold me?

1260
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:09,384
I want to stand up.

1261
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:27,669
I thought...

1262
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,175
that I won't be able to come here again.

1263
01:18:34,743 --> 01:18:36,712
But I'm glad I came today.

1264
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,515
I'm glad I came with you.

1265
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,323
From now on,
when I think of amusement parks,

1266
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,661
I think I'll be reminded of you.

1267
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:58,600
Me?

1268
01:19:03,672 --> 01:19:04,506
Yes.

1269
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:54,990
I think that from now on
and for the rest of your life,

1270
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,562
amusement parks will remind you of me.

1271
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,651
Don't come out. I'm here.

1272
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:24,319
I got a ticket to get in.

1273
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,188
Where are you and Seung-chan?

1274
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,156
Oh, really?

1275
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,658
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

1276
01:20:36,064 --> 01:20:36,932
Hello?

1277
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,167
Car license plate 6696, right?

1278
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:40,669
You left your light on.

1279
01:20:40,735 --> 01:20:41,970
Really?

1280
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:44,172
Thank you. Bye.

1281
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:47,275
Jun-mo.

1282
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:49,644
I already went in,

1283
01:20:49,711 --> 01:20:52,647
but someone called and told me
that I left my car light on.

1284
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:55,917
Wait.

1285
01:20:57,686 --> 01:20:59,821
But Jun-mo,

1286
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,824
I took down my phone number.

1287
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:05,193
How did this person know my number?

1288
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,402
I bet he was nervous.

1289
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:50,038
Because a celebrity
suddenly did that to him.

1290
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:53,541
It's your birthday.
So, I thought it would be nice for us

1291
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:56,411
to all get together and celebrate.

1292
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,247
Is that a good thing?

1293
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:00,515
It was moving.

1294
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,317
I wish we would do this every quarter.

1295
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:04,753
He's a senior manager
at an investment company.

1296
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,154
I want to set him up with Ye-jin.

1297
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:10,225
They're trying to get him
together with Cindy.

1298
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,126
You never know.

1299
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:13,628
Cindy might like Seung-chan.

1300
01:22:13,895 --> 01:22:17,365
Cindy might end up like that other girl.
