1
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,046
Seung-chan.

2
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,647
Yes?

3
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:55,021
When I was alone in your room...

4
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,024
I know.

5
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,094
You do?

6
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:06,032
When I went into my room,

7
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,569
the stuffed animal
was in a different place.

8
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,238
So I figured.

9
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,575
Really?

10
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:17,911
I see...

11
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:25,118
You're so meticulous.

12
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:27,687
You catch the details quickly.

13
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,658
Just like what your parents said,
you really are smart.

14
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,071
Anyway, I bet you were surprised too.

15
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,141
I was also surprised.

16
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:53,113
I never thought you felt that way.

17
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,483
I had no idea.

18
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,820
Why would you like me?

19
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,957
I never imagined you would like me.

20
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:09,629
Producer Tak.

21
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,165
Yes?

22
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,069
I didn't...

23
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:19,839
intend for that to happen,

24
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,410
so, that counts as a preview, right?

25
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,384
What? What was?

26
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,220
The preview

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,157
I made after mustering up my courage

28
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:42,262
for the first time in my life

29
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,703
to tell you how I feel.

30
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,736
What are you doing?

31
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,238
Well...

32
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:27,040
Oh, gosh.

33
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,142
You...

34
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,344
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:34,480
Sorry for what?

36
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,420
Are you saying sorry for kissing me
or for almost making me fall?

37
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,327
Oh, my goodness.

38
00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:51,598
Hey.

39
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,401
We can't stay here. Let's move.

40
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,404
Yes.

41
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,509
Hey.

42
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,915
From the look on your face,

43
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,951
someone might think
I did something to you.

44
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,391
I can hear your heart pounding from here.

45
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,629
Really?

46
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,300
Of course not.

47
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,970
If you were going to get that shaken up,

48
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:34,641
why did you get so brave
out of the blue and...

49
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,480
For now,

50
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,316
just calm down.

51
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,550
Okay.

52
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,537
Why are you coming toward me again?

53
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,940
Just talk from up there.

54
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,517
What is it? What?

55
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,420
I think...

56
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:26,159
that you only see me as a young, obedient,

57
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,631
and sometimes cute junior colleague.

58
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,634
But I also think

59
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,504
I created the opportunity
for you to see me

60
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:44,177
in a different light from now on.

61
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:50,616
How would I see you differently?

62
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,054
You might be my senior at work,

63
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,359
but I don't think

64
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,195
that human relationships

65
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:05,231
should be solely based
on ranking and seniority.

66
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,433
I wanted to break that structure.

67
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,268
And to do that,

68
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,138
I had to let you know.

69
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:14,540
What?

70
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,478
My feelings.

71
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,420
So, what you are saying is

72
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:33,426
I see you as a young, obedient,
and sometimes cute junior colleague,

73
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,962
which is why you wanted to express
your feelings to me.

74
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:38,664
It's like you threw a stone
to shatter our relationship

75
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,900
as junior and senior.

76
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,102
Right?

77
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm not too crazy

78
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,943
about the word "stone,"

79
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,080
but that's the basic idea.

80
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,816
But after throwing that stone,
you were more shocked.

81
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:04,157
Well, I never knew that I had the courage

82
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,227
to exactly do what I had imagined.

83
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,635
Seung-chan.

84
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,536
Yes?

85
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:22,608
Sometimes, maintaining
the original relationship is better

86
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:26,245
than shattering it to start a new one.

87
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,916
It can be harder to maintain
that original relationship.

88
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,618
Right.

89
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:38,057
But what if by maintaining
the original relationship,

90
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,960
you end up losing your chance?

91
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,399
I've lost my chance before

92
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:52,638
by trying to protect
the original relationship.

93
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,943
But if I think about it now,

94
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,945
I don't even remember

95
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,081
the original relationship

96
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,384
I was trying to protect.

97
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,998
When someone says I like you,
it's like a ball is being tossed to me.

98
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,034
What will I do with this ball?

99
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,670
Should I toss it back or hold onto it?

100
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,074
It's a very tricky situation.

101
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:29,308
What?

102
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,447
It's not because this hasn't happened
to me for a long time.

103
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,383
I've been taking a break
from dating these days.

104
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,752
Men have been telling me
that they like me.

105
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,120
When was it?

106
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,724
Who was it again? That guy...

107
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,435
You're still up? What are you doing?

108
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,603
Nothing in particular.

109
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,206
There's nothing good on TV.

110
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:04,477
Hey.

111
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,280
The moving truck will arrive early.
Aren't you going to bed?

112
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:11,951
I should.

113
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:14,720
But Jun-mo.

114
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,757
I have a question.

115
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:21,027
Go ahead.

116
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,599
It is not that I am coming on strong,

117
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,202
but do I seem defensive or do I overreact?

118
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:33,873
What?

119
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:38,077
Like I act tough
because I don't want to get hurt.

120
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,645
Am I like that?

121
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,618
I'm weak and warm-hearted on the inside,

122
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:47,420
but I act tough on the outside.

123
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,423
So, due to the imbalance of my two sides,

124
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,158
I end up feeling lonely.

125
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,260
Because of that,

126
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,897
do I want someone to be next to me
and to understand me?

127
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,700
What are you talking about? My goodness.

128
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,669
Are you talking about rocket science?

129
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,737
Gosh.

130
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:12,411
What?

131
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,383
Did Seung-chan say that?

132
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,919
Oh, my. How did you know?

133
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:22,221
It seemed like his words.

134
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,122
Jeez.

135
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,192
How much does he know about you
to say that?

136
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,994
I know.

137
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,565
He must have really kept an eye on me
during that short amount of time.

138
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,336
But when I think about it,
he does have a point.

139
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,507
I didn't know about this before,
but I think I'm not really tough.

140
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,342
I've just been acting tough.

141
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,481
When I first started working at KBS,
there weren't many female producers.

142
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,750
That's why I acted tough
to get respect from the managers

143
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,320
and to get my seniors
to assign me to good shows.

144
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,623
I would get angry
and would get into fights

145
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,126
in case the cast members
wouldn't respect me.

146
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,161
I acted really tough.

147
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,333
But I was kind of like that
when I dated someone too.

148
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,704
I act tougher on purpose
because I was afraid of being rejected.

149
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,239
I hear things the way I want.

150
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,374
Yes, you're like that.

151
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,309
You were like that when I told you

152
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,746
to put your place up for lease
and just stay here.

153
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:23,549
How could you interpret that

154
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,252
as me wanting you to stay here

155
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,254
because it's convenient
because you cook and clean?

156
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,992
I said that I didn't want you to leave.

157
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,696
You should've just accepted that
for what it was.

158
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:42,101
You're right.

159
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,038
I think I lack self-esteem.

160
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:48,374
Yes, you do.

161
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,375
A lot.

162
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,879
You have the right to be loved
just the way you are.

163
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,081
You're very lovable.

164
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,817
But you think that's impossible.

165
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,552
You think that's not true.

166
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,021
You're wrong, Ye-jin.

167
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:07,827
Despite what you think about yourself,
you're really...

168
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:10,629
great.

169
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,134
Hey, I have high standards.

170
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,570
I wouldn't hang out with just anyone
for 25 years.

171
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,146
Hey.

172
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,887
No matter where you are
or who you're with,

173
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,722
that won't change.

174
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,826
So don't forget it.

175
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,376
Mom, what are you doing?

176
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:58,944
Son.

177
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,747
Why were you out for so long?

178
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,485
I met up with someone and took a walk
to think something through.

179
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,354
Can you put this facial mask on me?

180
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,860
How refreshing.

181
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,935
Well, Mom.

182
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,204
What?

183
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:32,478
When did you first start
to see dad as a man?

184
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:34,613
What?

185
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,383
Why are you asking that?

186
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,320
I'm just curious.

187
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:46,892
I met your dad on a blind date,

188
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,829
then we got married after six months.

189
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,100
Sometimes I see him as a man,

190
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,436
and sometimes he's a pain in the butt.

191
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,874
What about when you said

192
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,046
that Jeon Yeong-rok's music
reminds you of when you were dating?

193
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,581
That was a different man.

194
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,524
If I married that other man,

195
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,660
would I have been happy?

196
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,162
I think about that sometimes.

197
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,497
But I don't know.

198
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,734
All we did was date.

199
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,538
But at least it's something I'll remember
for the rest of my life.

200
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:35,541
The Road Not Taken.

201
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,109
What?

202
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,680
It's a poem.

203
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,918
A poem? What kind of poem?

204
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,223
It's about the road not taken.

205
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,106
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood

206
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,877
and sorry I could not travel both.

207
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,313
and be one traveler,

208
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:17,249
long I stood.

209
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,520
And looked down one as far as I could

210
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,190
To where it bent

211
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,128
in the undergrowth.

212
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:33,565
YE-JIN'S HOUSE

213
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,535
Then took the other, as just as fair,

214
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,537
and having perhaps the better claim

215
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,709
because it was grassy and wanted wear,

216
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,345
though as for that the passing there

217
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:51,850
had worn them really about the same.

218
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:59,124
I shall be telling this with a sigh

219
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,261
somewhere ages and ages.

220
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,865
Hence, two roads diverged in a wood,

221
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,972
and I took the one less traveled by,

222
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,110
and that has made

223
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,046
all the difference.

224
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,595
YE-JIN'S HOUSE

225
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,035
Excuse me.

226
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:54,440
Are you the ones
who threw away the nightstand?

227
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,409
Yes. I paid the fee to have it collected.

228
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,545
That's not the point.

229
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,081
You should throw it out on Thursday.

230
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,249
How could you throw it out today?

231
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,351
I'm moving out today.

232
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,953
That's your problem.

233
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,621
Put it back on the truck.

234
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,356
You have no common sense.

235
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,958
Yes, then I'll...

236
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,126
Forget it, Jun-mo.

237
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:20,032
I'm moving to Gyeonggi-do right now.

238
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,201
But since recycling day is on Thursday,

239
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,236
you want me to load the nightstand
on the truck

240
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,438
and come back on Thursday to throw it out?

241
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,374
I told you, that's your problem!

242
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,609
What's going on?

243
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,010
Goodness.

244
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,813
Look at that.

245
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,715
Recycling day is on Thursday.

246
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,153
Hello.

247
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,454
Hello, ma'am.

248
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,791
What's going on?

249
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,759
Is there a problem?

250
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,864
No, ma'am.

251
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,366
I'm moving out today.

252
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:58,504
I was just asking this lady

253
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,806
if I should take my nightstand with me

254
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,742
and bring it back on Thursday

255
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,211
since that's when recycling day is.

256
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,513
Oh, goodness!

257
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,182
You didn't say it that politely!

258
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,751
You were totally rude!

259
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,920
I'll handle this.

260
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,492
What's your problem?

261
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,162
A fellow resident is moving far away.

262
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,498
Must you send her off in a bad mood
just because of this?

263
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,201
Well, it's an eyesore.

264
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,370
If you don't want to see it,
I'll keep it at my house.

265
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,304
I'll throw it away.

266
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:33,805
Happy?

267
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:40,913
It's all settled.

268
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,048
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

269
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,483
Thank you.

270
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,519
No, it's okay.

271
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,921
I hope your move goes well.

272
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,725
Please take good care of Seung-chan.

273
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,627
Okay.

274
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:57,162
Okay.

275
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,032
Goodness, why is this thing so heavy?

276
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,466
Gosh.

277
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:03,969
My goodness.

278
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,905
Mom, what's that?

279
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,040
Seung-chan.

280
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,209
It's the bad neighbor's...

281
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,113
This belongs to your senior colleague
in the other building.

282
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,449
Producer Tak is moving today.

283
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,719
I brought it here because she threw it out
when it's not recycling day.

284
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:22,387
Is she leaving now?

285
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,555
I think so.

286
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,257
Now she can't be mean to you.

287
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:29,161
I cooked her a nice meal
and took her side with this furniture.

288
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,930
Seung-chan, help me carry this...

289
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:39,271
Seung-chan.

290
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,277
Jun-mo.

291
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,878
Yes?

292
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:47,813
See you again.

293
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,048
Okay. Drive carefully.

294
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,217
Ye-jin, give me the car key.

295
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,054
-Bye.
-Bye.

296
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,299
Shall we shake hands?

297
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,170
Oh, come on. Why?

298
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,575
I feel like a chapter of my life ended.

299
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:21,113
It feels different
from when I moved in the past.

300
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,249
Why are you blowing things
out of proportion?

301
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:25,784
You're just moving.

302
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,019
Changing locations.

303
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:28,954
So you won't shake my hand?

304
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,725
This is ridiculous.

305
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:41,733
Jun-mo.

306
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,636
What?

307
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,371
I'm...

308
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,175
I'm really glad

309
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,711
that I have you in my life.

310
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:00,652
Bye.

311
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:03,755
Bye.

312
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,438
Go back inside.

313
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,262
What are you doing there?

314
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,632
I heard that Producer Tak was leaving.

315
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,201
I wanted to say goodbye.

316
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,604
She's not gone forever.

317
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,806
You can still see her at work.

318
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,878
Why are you standing there?
Aren't you going to work?

319
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,759
PROGRAM VIEWER RATINGS

320
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,911
STAR WARS PILOT - 10.1%

321
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,183
Dang it.

322
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,652
Come on.

323
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:15,454
I know.

324
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,633
Seeing you reminds me of my younger self.

325
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,901
No...

326
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,703
-Drink this.
-Thank you.

327
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,138
-Work hard.
-I'll be going now.

328
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,039
Go ahead.

329
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,842
Hey, Jun-mo. Let's go eat.

330
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,511
Forget it. I don't have any appetite.

331
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:40,545
What's wrong?

332
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,082
Why is it so tense here?

333
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,686
Is it because the new program
got good viewer ratings?

334
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,823
Get up. I'll buy lunch.

335
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,493
Seung-chan, join us.

336
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,031
Eat up. Go ahead.

337
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:01,666
Eat, Seung-chan.

338
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:06,605
What did you talk about
with the chief director?

339
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,506
What?

340
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:10,876
You were smiling
when you came out of his office.

341
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,011
You must have talked about something.

342
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,981
It was nothing, really.

343
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,916
The new program got double-digit ratings.

344
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,651
It couldn't have been nothing.

345
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:24,689
Jun-mo.

346
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,192
You know I'm always on your side, right?

347
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,094
-I didn't know that.
-You didn't?

348
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,629
Why didn't you know?

349
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,830
Just spit it out already.

350
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,368
Two Days and One Night
is a long-running show.

351
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,704
How long are you going to hold on to it?

352
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:41,806
Does the chief director want to cancel it?

353
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:45,243
No.

354
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:48,179
We can't do that right away.

355
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:53,018
Star Wars will need time
to become a regular show.

356
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,888
If you could buy some time until then...

357
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,659
Oh, come on!

358
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,900
Your viewer ratings will be crucial
for the next two to three weeks.

359
00:26:09,534 --> 00:26:12,070
Show results so the higher-ups
won't cancel your show.

360
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,839
If you guys get good viewer ratings,

361
00:26:15,373 --> 00:26:17,909
we can put Star Wars
in a different time slot.

362
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,812
You guys aren't the only show
hitting the bottom.

363
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,322
Did she forget to bring my soda?

364
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,691
Seung-chan, get some soda.

365
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,125
Okay.

366
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,296
Jun-mo.

367
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,334
Don't be so upset.
Just get really good viewer ratings.

368
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:47,105
Your unique preview
was kind of a hot topic.

369
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:55,747
What's wrong with this thing?

370
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:11,463
When a show isn't getting
good viewer ratings,

371
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,731
it needs some kind of aid.

372
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,200
A so-called respirator idea.

373
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,168
A respirator!

374
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,238
That's right! Our show needs a respirator.

375
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,740
Here's an example.

376
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:24,142
When the old show, Sponge,
was doing badly,

377
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:27,312
they did an episode about instant noodles.

378
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,548
-Instant noodles?
-Yes, that's right.

379
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,850
INSTANT NOODLES

380
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,220
Chicken and soda were popular too,
but not as much as instant noodles.

381
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,089
If instant noodles are shown on screen,
people can't help but watch it.

382
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:42,360
When Vitamin was in a bind

383
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,796
and being pressured by the higher-ups
due to low ratings,

384
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,166
they did a cancer special.

385
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:53,104
When they did that
for five weeks straight,

386
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,306
it totally killed other shows
in the same time slot.

387
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,708
It was nuts.

388
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:57,609
I see.

389
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,079
My mom watches any show
that has to do with cancer prevention,

390
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,281
regardless of the channel.

391
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,083
Right.

392
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,621
In the case of Gag Concert,
if a skit is doing badly and is not funny,

393
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:13,158
but they have to wait a few weeks
before getting rid of it,

394
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:14,392
they put Oh Na-mi in.

395
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:15,360
I am nervous

396
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:17,228
Oh gosh, I am so nervous

397
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:19,898
In the comedy world, that's like cheating.

398
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,533
It doesn't matter what the skit is about.

399
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,334
People automatically laugh
whenever she shows up.

400
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:28,707
So, for our show,

401
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,676
what would be the respirator?

402
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,550
This is the first show I'm doing
as a producer.

403
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,120
I don't want it to get canceled like this.

404
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:45,724
I want good viewer ratings no matter what.

405
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,861
So what should I do to get more people

406
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,264
to watch our show?

407
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,900
I don't know.

408
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:03,408
Even getting one person to look at me

409
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,443
isn't easy.

410
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:09,481
How can I get many people to watch?

411
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,754
Getting viewer ratings

412
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,758
is like capturing people's hearts.

413
00:29:33,304 --> 00:29:34,405
Hello.

414
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,974
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

415
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,075
Who took this down?

416
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:40,078
We reserved this room for our meeting.

417
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:44,349
We also have a meeting,
and our meeting is pretty urgent!

418
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:45,950
I'm sorry.

419
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:49,254
Where's the respect in this department?

420
00:29:49,888 --> 00:29:53,124
You didn't even tell your senior colleague
and just took our meeting room.

421
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,225
Is that okay?

422
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,861
-Ji-yeon.
-Yes?

423
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,030
-Oh, it's you.
-Hello.

424
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,166
Is there a problem?

425
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,535
Our show was on a break.

426
00:30:03,835 --> 00:30:05,403
So we had no meeting last week.

427
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,173
But we're going to air again this week.

428
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:10,508
Hey, your show is getting canceled.

429
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:17,315
That hasn't been officially decided yet.

430
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:19,050
You shouldn't say that.

431
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,488
Producer, we reserved this room first,

432
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,724
but they took down our sign.

433
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:27,826
Hey, Seung-chan.

434
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:29,961
Yes?

435
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,263
What's going on?
Don't you have a meeting room?

436
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,098
Look for another one.

437
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:38,136
We're about to become a regular show.
We've got a fire lit under us.

438
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,641
We reserved this meeting room first.

439
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:47,245
It's an unwritten rule in our department

440
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:49,848
that whoever puts a sign up first
gets the room.

441
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,316
-We should follow that rule--
-Hey.

442
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,084
Why are you talking so much?

443
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,787
Just look for another room already.

444
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,623
Who's your senior?

445
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,524
Me.

446
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,195
Hey, just go.

447
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,564
I'm too tired to fight with you.

448
00:31:06,631 --> 00:31:08,132
That's not my seat.

449
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,167
Got it.

450
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,970
-Clean this up.
-Yes.

451
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,775
Video games have power levels, right?

452
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:19,410
That's what viewer ratings are like.

453
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:22,547
A producer who gets low viewer ratings
has a low power level.

454
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,716
If a producer's power level is low,

455
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,418
his subordinates get pushed around too.

456
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,387
People look down on them,
casting becomes harder,

457
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,855
and they lose their meeting room.

458
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,524
When managers bring snacks,
that team gets excluded.

459
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,093
After going through that
a couple of times,

460
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,662
they just get more aggressive.

461
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,197
How about bikinis?

462
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,266
Nice! Guys will go shirtless.

463
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,167
Have a bunch of guests with nice bodies.

464
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,403
How about K-1?

465
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,541
Let's set up a ring in Gwanghwamun Square
and have a mixed martial arts match!

466
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,543
-Wouldn't people watch?
-Nice.

467
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,880
They just throw out ideas
because they're in a bind.

468
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,715
But you shouldn't do that.

469
00:31:57,782 --> 00:32:03,421
Let's say an old restaurant gets envious
of the new successful restaurant next door

470
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,090
and changes their interior, sign, menu,

471
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,959
and starts selling dishes
they didn't sell before.

472
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,996
Then the regular customers
will stop going to that restaurant.

473
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,800
They will lose their existing customers
as they try to get new ones,

474
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,871
and they end up losing everything.

475
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,439
Seung-chan.

476
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,041
Do you have any ideas?

477
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:28,947
If you look at the history
of Two Days and One Night...

478
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,549
-Right.
-Good. Let's look back.

479
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:37,021
When the show is in trouble,
they do a friend special.

480
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:38,122
We already did that.

481
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:41,960
Going in the water.

482
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,895
In the water for the entire hour?

483
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,497
A viewer tour.

484
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,266
That was a huge hit back in the day.

485
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,234
It got, like, 40% viewer ratings.

486
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,704
All of our ratings combined
aren't even 40%.

487
00:32:54,238 --> 00:32:57,575
But that takes months to prepare.

488
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,644
We don't have time.

489
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,117
But if you think about it

490
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,153
from the perspective
of the restaurant owner,

491
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,889
you can't just sit back and do nothing.

492
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,195
You won't be able to pay your rent
with the few regulars you have.

493
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:19,697
You're on the verge
of going out of business.

494
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,007
I told you that I wanted

495
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:33,945
flashier and fancier clothes.

496
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:36,848
There are all sorts of rumors about me.

497
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:40,018
I'll look like a loser
if I wear shabby clothes.

498
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,254
Yes, I'm trying to work on that,

499
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,223
but CEO Byun...

500
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,525
What about her?

501
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,995
She's giving Jinie
all the sponsored clothes.

502
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:55,533
I don't know if I should tell you this,

503
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:57,935
but this is what CEO Byun
told the sponsors.

504
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,738
She said she won't take responsibility

505
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,074
if they don't make money off you.

506
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:07,311
She said you'll be
out of the picture soon.

507
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:12,183
If I can't get sponsors,
just buy me some clothes.

508
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:13,351
Just do that.

509
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,956
What I need to protect right now
isn't my money.

510
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,758
It's my luxurious image.

511
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:24,495
Cindy.

512
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,664
What?

513
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,433
First ranked of the search engine is...

514
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,967
What is it?

515
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,971
-"Broke Cindy."
-What?

516
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,707
Ranked third is...

517
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,410
"Beggar Cindy."

518
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,115
CINDY AS A SINGING BEGGAR

519
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,016
I'M BEGGAR CINDY

520
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,584
PLEASE WATCH MY SHOW
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

521
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,258
Cindy.

522
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,628
It's a bit early to say this

523
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,831
but things aren't so bad.

524
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,467
There are parodies of you everywhere.

525
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,669
Is that a good thing?

526
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,938
But seriously,

527
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,507
there are no negative comments.

528
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,809
-Really?
-Yes.

529
00:35:13,144 --> 00:35:14,312
They all say you're funny.

530
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:15,980
That it's the perfect image for you.

531
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,053
-Hey.
-Yes?

532
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,388
Those are negative comments.

533
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,364
This is all because
of that umbrella producer.

534
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,433
He made you say those lines.

535
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,002
That's why I told you not to do it.

536
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,343
Right. I should have listened to you.

537
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,982
I should have done what you told me to.

538
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,484
Right?

539
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,886
This won't do.

540
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,354
He makes me so angry.

541
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,989
Right, sure he does.

542
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,357
We have time, right?

543
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,895
I'm so angry right now.
I can't believe this.

544
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,302
UMBRELLA

545
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:15,773
Meet me if you have time.

546
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:19,377
Okay, I'm free now.

547
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,811
Where should we meet?

548
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:23,147
-Hey.
-Yes?

549
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,483
-Go to Yeouido.
-Okay.

550
00:36:26,751 --> 00:36:29,220
I'm going to meet him
and really let him have it!

551
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,455
Why did he make me do something like that?

552
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:32,356
Jeez.

553
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,459
I'm so mad.

554
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,101
This way. Put it against the window.

555
00:36:44,402 --> 00:36:46,204
Careful. Thank you.

556
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,505
Ye-jin.

557
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,907
My professor needs me at school.

558
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,008
Go ahead.

559
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,010
I just need to get some stuff
from the storage.

560
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,980
Will you be okay alone?

561
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,049
There's not much stuff.

562
00:36:58,349 --> 00:36:59,283
You can go.

563
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,220
I don't think this is right.

564
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,855
Instead of being an older sister,

565
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:07,024
why do you seem more like
a reliable older brother?

566
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,360
Just go.

567
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,695
Go and study.

568
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,629
Go.

569
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,370
Let's see.

570
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,774
Hello?

571
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,444
I'm the person who called earlier.

572
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,846
My things from the storage
aren't here yet.

573
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:30,881
Excuse me?

574
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,250
Still?

575
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,852
You said you were on the way.

576
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,055
Okay, please hurry.

577
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,276
Cindy, should I help you yell at him?

578
00:37:58,542 --> 00:37:59,377
No.

579
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,112
You know what I'm like
when I'm angry, right?

580
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,146
You're really scary.

581
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:05,049
I've had it up to here,
and I can't contain myself.

582
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,384
Right. Okay.

583
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,620
This is an empty waiting room, right?

584
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,455
I'll be in here.

585
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,524
Tell Producer Baek to come in.

586
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,030
I don't know what I might do in there,

587
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,732
so make sure nobody else comes in.

588
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:23,701
Don't worry.

589
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,871
I'll make sure nobody gets in.

590
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:35,346
Yes!

591
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,259
Producer Baek.

592
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:52,129
Cindy is furious right now.

593
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,864
Oh, really?

594
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,533
You should prepare yourself.

595
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,968
Words can actually kill a person.

596
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:02,406
A true tongue-lashing.

597
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,541
Today...

598
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,044
you will feel that for real.

599
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,888
What will you do about this?

600
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,825
CINDY AS A SINGING BEGGAR

601
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,693
Broke Cindy, Panhandling Cindy,
Beggar Cindy.

602
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,861
It's all over the Internet.

603
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:26,564
Right.

604
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,401
I saw it at work earlier,
and I was shocked.

605
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:33,270
I didn't expect this at all.

606
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,373
Is that all you have to say?

607
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:38,008
What did you say at the first casting?

608
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:42,213
A star in the sky
becoming less mysterious or whatever.

609
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,448
But I think...

610
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:47,852
it's cute.

611
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,357
I understand that you're very angry,

612
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,261
but rather than seeming distant
from people,

613
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:01,198
it's better to seem familiar and closer.

614
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,802
So that's Broke Cindy?

615
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,807
Beggar Cindy?

616
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:11,776
But...

617
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:17,214
people saying that

618
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,684
could be embarrassing to you

619
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,953
and could be offensive to you.

620
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:27,591
However, they're not saying

621
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:29,527
that you're a dirty beggar.

622
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:30,928
Then what?

623
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,531
How about you accept it as a persona?

624
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,367
As a result, the image you portray

625
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,169
is cuteness.

626
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:42,072
I see.

627
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:44,775
What else?

628
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:53,984
It makes people want to keep you close.

629
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,854
Keep me close and what?

630
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,622
And...

631
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,926
want to see you every day.

632
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,830
See me every day?

633
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,766
Like...

634
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,103
the whole package of loveliness.

635
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,806
That's what Broke Cindy means?

636
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:20,878
See? You can't give me a straight answer.

637
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,380
How will you take responsibility for this?

638
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,484
-Excuse me?
-Why are you so shocked?

639
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,786
I told you this in the beginning,
didn't I?

640
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,255
I joined this show because of you.

641
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,625
But you ruined my image,
and you won't even take responsibility?

642
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:36,260
But...

643
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,330
you're not really ruined.

644
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,632
Look.

645
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,802
Once you're pegged as a certain character
on a variety show,

646
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,303
you're branded for life.

647
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,172
If you're pegged as an airhead,

648
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,207
you have to get questions wrong
on purpose.

649
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:51,408
If you're pegged as rude,

650
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,778
you have to throw a hissy fit on TV
even if you're in a good mood.

651
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:56,514
If you're pegged as a pig,

652
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,650
you have to go nuts over food
even if your stomach is about to burst.

653
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,319
That is true.

654
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,955
That's why one's first image
in variety is critical.

655
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,657
But I've been pegged as a beggar.

656
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:11,128
So, do I have to beg and act pathetic
whenever I'm on TV now?

657
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:15,032
I would feel really sorry about that
if I were you.

658
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,636
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,538
Right?

660
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:22,540
You're sorry, right?

661
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:25,009
Yes.

662
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,782
Then, I'll give it some thought.

663
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,319
I'll think of what you'll have to do
to make it up to me.

664
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:44,061
But it's true that this persona is cute.

665
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,730
I'll get back to you.

666
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,667
I'll let you know
when I think of something.

667
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:55,105
Okay.

668
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,915
She should be shouting right about now.

669
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,986
It's past that point.

670
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,423
Maybe he was so shocked that he fainted.

671
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:22,967
You can go now.

672
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:26,337
See you at the shoot.

673
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,906
Okay.

674
00:43:29,573 --> 00:43:30,407
Goodbye.

675
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:37,715
Hey...

676
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:40,484
Cindy.

677
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,152
What?

678
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:44,989
What is it?

679
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:48,626
Say something.

680
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:52,363
Never mind.

681
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,373
When I was in Spain,

682
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:05,909
the people there were
way more conservative with paper.

683
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:06,944
Really?

684
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,278
-You know using both sides?
-Yes.

685
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,048
They used both sides of the paper,
and they erased everything.

686
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,988
-It's sweet.
-This is delicious.

687
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,891
HONG-SUN

688
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:33,871
What the...

689
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:35,639
-Is it good?
-Yes, it is.

690
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,245
KO YANG-MI

691
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:43,514
Is this high-calorie?

692
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:44,915
I believe so...

693
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,652
Yang-mi, I need to tell you something.

694
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,221
Please contact me. I'll be waiting.

695
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:01,665
You have to drink a lot of water.

696
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,634
Okay. I will drink a lot of water.

697
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:07,404
I didn't drink enough water.

698
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,243
Why won't she pick up?

699
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,347
Did her move go well or not?

700
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:19,016
My goodness.

701
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:23,187
I just drive the truck.

702
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,956
You should've hired more people
if you needed someone to move your stuff.

703
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,559
That's different
from what you guys said at first.

704
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:31,762
You said you would move my stuff too.

705
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,697
Whatever. Take that up with the office.

706
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:34,898
I have to take the truck back.

707
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:38,969
Nobody at your office
is answering the phone.

708
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:41,505
You were supposed to get here
in the morning,

709
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,173
but you got here at night.

710
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,608
If you needed to move your things

711
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,177
you should've hired more people.

712
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,346
So, right now,

713
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:52,449
are you asking for more money?

714
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,323
I can be a bit clueless.

715
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:00,858
I'm sorry. How much?

716
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,126
Hey.

717
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,394
Producer Tak, I'll include this
in the money you owe me.

718
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,868
I told you not to come.

719
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,637
But thanks for coming.

720
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,340
What would I have done without you?

721
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,578
I'll go down
and get the rest of the sofa pads.

722
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:23,213
No, let's carry them together.
They're heavy.

723
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,114
Let's go.

724
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,883
Who's that?

725
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,185
Oh, I ordered rice cakes.

726
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:29,620
What?

727
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,989
You can give them out
to your new neighbors.

728
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:33,423
Oh, my gosh.

729
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,365
Hey, what took you so long
to open the door?

730
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:43,066
This thing is heavy.

731
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:45,502
Producer Ra.

732
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,472
I told you to get the files together.

733
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:50,007
What are you doing here?

734
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,643
I'll get them.

735
00:46:52,709 --> 00:46:54,711
I'll work all night
after I help with this.

736
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:02,386
You said you were
going to meet managers in Gangnam.

737
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:03,887
I'm going to.

738
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,056
I'm going to meet them
after I have dinner here.

739
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:10,727
I told you both not to come,
and you both don't listen.

740
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:15,165
I'm really going to make you two regret
that you came here today.

741
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:16,934
Let's unpack.

742
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,001
I'm hungry.

743
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,103
Let's get this over with and have dinner.

744
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,276
Hey, pass me the scissors.

745
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,315
Seung-chan.

746
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:35,319
-This is for the veranda doors, right?
-Right. That's correct.

747
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,287
No, it's incorrect.

748
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,827
A newspaper is the best for cleaning.

749
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:36,647
Hey, this is a new house!

750
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,183
Hold on. Go that way so this can go in.

751
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,085
Go over there. That way.

752
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,520
Come on.

753
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,392
That hurts! Dang it.

754
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,762
Are you okay?

755
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,431
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

756
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,766
No, I didn't.

757
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,537
Oh, right.

758
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,839
I was going to buy something
on my way here,

759
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:04,007
but there were no stores.

760
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,745
Right, all the stores are empty
since only a few people moved in.

761
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,114
I have to walk for ten minutes
to a different complex

762
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:12,783
if I want to buy something.

763
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,519
Isn't it dangerous at night?

764
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,622
Oh, come on.

765
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,859
Ye-jin, just make sure that your face
is clearly seen in a well-lit area.

766
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:24,661
Then you'll never be in danger.

767
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,564
My gosh. Hey.

768
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:33,370
The street lamps don't come on,
so they might not be able to see my face.

769
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,405
Then it could be a bit dangerous.

770
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:37,774
Come on!

771
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,115
Shouldn't you submit a complaint
at the district office

772
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:46,683
about those street lamps?

773
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,352
Maybe I should.

774
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,021
Hey, you better do that soon.

775
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:54,091
It's dangerous if they can't see you.
Your face has to be seen.

776
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,028
Do you want to die?

777
00:49:58,695 --> 00:50:00,564
No! Don't eat!

778
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:03,800
You didn't bring me anything, did you?

779
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:09,139
It will take you forever to get back.

780
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,342
It's okay, there won't be any traffic.
We'll get back in no time.

781
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:15,779
Jun-mo, Seung-chan didn't bring his car.
You should give him a ride.

782
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,648
I have to go to Gangnam though.

783
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,752
I'm fine. I can just take the bus.

784
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:22,986
Really?

785
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:24,521
Okay then.

786
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:28,058
Have a safe trip back. Thanks, you two.

787
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:30,727
-Bye.
-Bye.

788
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:55,652
Get in.

789
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,455
I'm fine. You're going to Gangnam anyway.

790
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,991
I've decided not to go. Just get in.

791
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,261
-Because of me?
-Are you nuts?

792
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,564
I decided not to go because I'm tired.

793
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,732
Are you getting in or not?

794
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,000
If not, I'll just go.

795
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:26,249
Hey, Ye-jin.

796
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:28,652
The nail clippers?

797
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,188
I only have one set of those.

798
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,422
Just buy one.

799
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,092
I need to clip my nails too.

800
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:37,727
Yes. Just buy one.

801
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:43,667
Yes, that's true. You can have that.

802
00:51:44,468 --> 00:51:45,368
Bye.

803
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:49,072
Gosh.

804
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,916
To me...

805
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:05,255
you're like 40%.

806
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,059
What?

807
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,831
The viewer rating we hope for
that can't be attained

808
00:52:16,666 --> 00:52:18,568
even after adding up the ratings

809
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:21,872
for the entire season.

810
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,541
That's what you're like.

811
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:37,020
I truly

812
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:40,624
envy you.

813
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,305
This is Beggar Cindy.

814
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:59,676
Please watch my show,
Two Days and One Night.

815
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:04,147
THIS IS BEGGAR CINDY

816
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:36,646
SUPER SUNDAY TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT - 6.2%

817
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,316
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT - 6.2%

818
00:53:58,268 --> 00:54:00,203
-Hello.
-Hey.

819
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,139
-Hello.
-Hello.

820
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,208
-Hello, Producer.
-Hello.

821
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,943
Great work.

822
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:09,379
-What brings you here?
-Please be good to us.

823
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,014
I should be the one asking you that.

824
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,983
We should join hands.

825
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,484
You are too kind.

826
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,652
Let's get dinner sometime.

827
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,421
There's no need for that.

828
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,090
No, that's okay.

829
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:21,891
Il-yong, Hyeong-geun, and Seung-chan.

830
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:22,926
Let's all go.

831
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:28,098
The chief director
doesn't treat people that often.

832
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,569
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

833
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,238
Jun-mo, do you want to come along?

834
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,607
Where?

835
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,744
The chief director is buying lunch.

836
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,613
Right, I am. You should come, Jun-mo.

837
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,516
But Jun-mo doesn't like
food made from flour.

838
00:54:47,717 --> 00:54:50,654
We're going to a burger place in Hongdae.

839
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,222
-Sir.
-Yes?

840
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,124
-Are you going now?
-Yes. Let's go.

841
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:01,798
This happens.

842
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:06,536
With the new show launching,
they're going to need more staff members.

843
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:10,273
They're trying to take my team members.

844
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,577
They need to get familiar
with the new producer.

845
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,048
It's a bit inhumane, but it's necessary.

846
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,185
It could be a good thing for my guys.

847
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:28,391
Well, flour gives me indigestion.

848
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,560
Go ahead without me.

849
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,228
Go ahead.

850
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,430
-Okay.
-Okay.

851
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:34,698
Let's go.

852
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,632
Yes.

853
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,435
We'll be back.

854
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:46,543
I'm sorry, but I don't like flour either.

855
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:48,478
Go ahead without me.

856
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:56,219
Hey.

857
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:00,190
Shouldn't you be eating
a fancy handmade burger?

858
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,659
Too bad you're eating this.

859
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:04,928
That's okay.

860
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:16,473
Why won't people watch our show?

861
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,241
I know, right?

862
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:21,678
Why didn't the existing viewers watch?

863
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:24,614
I really can't figure it out.

864
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,819
I wish someone would be blunt
and would just tell me.

865
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,621
Why aren't things working for me?

866
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:34,891
Why are other shows successful
except for my show?

867
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:39,863
Maybe the preview I made was terrible.

868
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,866
Like what you've said before,

869
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,535
maybe the preview ruined the show.

870
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,638
My goodness, this guy.

871
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,507
You're so arrogant.

872
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,411
You and I are on different levels.

873
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:57,480
The main producer
is responsible for the ratings.

874
00:56:57,547 --> 00:56:59,349
This isn't your burden.

875
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,086
But I'm still a producer for this show.

876
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,288
Oh, please. You're a newbie.

877
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:08,691
It's true that I'm a newbie,

878
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:12,896
but I've been through all sorts of stuff
since I've been here.

879
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:13,797
Hey!

880
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:17,000
This is the main producer's privilege.

881
00:57:17,066 --> 00:57:20,937
The glory when the show does well
and the humiliation when the show flops

882
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:23,173
all falls on the main producer.

883
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,608
How dare you try to steal my humiliation?

884
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,485
Do you want some?

885
00:57:41,424 --> 00:57:44,194
I just can't figure it out.

886
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:46,629
Jeez.

887
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,640
Just leave it here.

888
00:57:59,042 --> 00:57:59,876
Excuse me?

889
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:01,878
Isn't that for me?

890
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,181
That.

891
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,150
The gift.

892
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:09,486
No.

893
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,059
Then who is it for?

894
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:18,394
It's for Producer Tak.

895
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,965
Did she go somewhere?

896
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,968
Yes. She went to see the stage set.

897
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,107
Excuse me.

898
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:08,244
When Producer Tak gets here,
please tell her this.

899
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,114
Tell her that it's for her.

900
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,119
Okay.

901
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:34,137
Seung-chan is so detail-oriented.

902
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:40,777
Producer Tak.

903
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,213
can you settle
the rest of your debt tonight

904
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,816
all at once?

905
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:51,955
Is it a love triangle?

906
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:56,225
What?

907
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,363
Your dark circles got worse.

908
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,834
Is it because you're concerned?

909
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:07,971
Hey, Da-jeong.

910
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:10,974
I heard that you're a dating expert.

911
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:11,874
That's right.

912
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,979
You said that with no hesitation.

913
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,715
How many guys have you dated?

914
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,451
I don't know. I never kept count.

915
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:26,656
You're just like a rich person
who doesn't know how much money she has.

916
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,425
Do you want to have coffee with me?

917
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:32,362
So...

918
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,265
you've had a man for over 20 years.

919
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:40,003
Hey, it's my friend. It's not me.

920
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,138
What an obvious thing to say.

921
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:43,873
Just get to the point.

922
01:00:46,242 --> 01:00:47,076
Okay.

923
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,179
So--

924
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,082
You like your guy friend of over 20 years.

925
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,186
But then a new guy showed up.

926
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:00,957
And he's charming.

927
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,227
That's a rough summary.

928
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,197
There are two solutions.

929
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:10,833
Wow, you're very clear.

930
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,402
First.

931
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,105
Just date both of them.

932
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:19,876
You can't do that if you're married.

933
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,346
And the second solution?

934
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:31,387
Reject the one you feel sorry for.

935
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:37,293
If you feel sorry for him...

936
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,699
you can't date him.

937
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:51,407
Yes, I got it. Yes.

938
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,915
Cindy, the CEO is at your house.

939
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,152
But I'm not at home.

940
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,688
How come CEO Byun is there?

941
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:07,990
She has the master key.

942
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,993
Why? Why is she there?

943
01:02:11,661 --> 01:02:14,063
She's there with a reporter.

944
01:02:17,934 --> 01:02:18,901
Come on in.

945
01:02:25,875 --> 01:02:27,376
What is this about?

946
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:30,313
I'm sorry, Reporter Min.

947
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:33,483
I was too protective when I raised her,
so she's a bit rude.

948
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:38,788
Cindy, say hello to the reporter first.

949
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:40,623
Reporter Min.

950
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:46,596
I know that you write all my articles
since you're close with my CEO.

951
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:50,266
But seeing how you're waiting for me
at my own home

952
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,769
is making me uncomfortable.

953
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,805
What is this about?

954
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,075
It's just an interview
to see how you're doing.

955
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,346
In the middle of the night? Why so sudden?

956
01:03:03,412 --> 01:03:05,348
You're done with your album promotions.

957
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,683
You can't do too many interviews.

958
01:03:08,084 --> 01:03:11,187
Reporter Min writes
the best articles for us.

959
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,523
It's a goodbye interview.

960
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:18,361
I thought being interviewed at home
would make you more comfortable.

961
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,097
Don't get all worked up. Sit down.

962
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,138
So, Cindy...

963
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:33,309
will you be taking a break
now that you're done promoting?

964
01:03:33,943 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't know.

965
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,347
I would like to if I have time.

966
01:03:39,515 --> 01:03:41,617
Where do you go when you take a break?

967
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:45,388
Do you go to the States
where your parents are?

968
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,291
Cindy.

969
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,962
You know what a star is, right?

970
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:56,232
It's someone people long for.

971
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,403
But if people find out
that your parents passed away

972
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,071
and that you're all alone,

973
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:04,807
they won't long for you.

974
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,809
They will only pity you.

975
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:11,781
That doesn't suit a star.

976
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:17,220
Your parents are living
in the United States.

977
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:20,089
You're a shining star on stage

978
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:23,226
that has received
plenty of support and love

979
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,294
from your parents.

980
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,230
Got it?

981
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:30,366
I saw in a past interview

982
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,835
that your parents

983
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:37,206
are living in a big mansion with a pool
in Beverly Hills.

984
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:40,509
Just a moment--

985
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,079
If you go to your parents' house
on your break,

986
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:46,449
can you reveal their house to us?

987
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:49,252
Their house has never been seen.

988
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,555
While I'm on the subject,
let me ask you this.

989
01:04:53,155 --> 01:04:57,693
You said your father is a famous professor
at an Ivy League university,

990
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:02,331
and your mother works in the music field.

991
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,934
We looked into this,

992
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,171
and we found out there's no such professor
at that university.

993
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:13,743
And none of the overseas Koreans
living in that area

994
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:16,445
have heard of your mother.

995
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,983
Can you please explain this to us?

996
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,023
We found out after hearing from Cindy.

997
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:31,494
Cindy's parents
are very successful people.

998
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:36,599
Her father is in the United States

999
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:40,836
and is a biotechnology professor
at an Ivy League university.

1000
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:44,173
Her mother majored in classical music

1001
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,543
and now teaches young children.

1002
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,379
It looks like

1003
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:55,117
Cindy takes after her mother.

1004
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,124
There's been a mistake.

1005
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:03,693
Please look into it again.

1006
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:08,064
We've never been to their house
in the States,

1007
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:13,102
but Cindy has been saying this
since she was 14.

1008
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,071
Don't you think she's telling the truth?

1009
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,507
Whenever we talk about her parents,

1010
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:24,480
Cindy always tells us
about how proud she is of them.

1011
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:29,018
Then, have you ever met Cindy's parents?

1012
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,019
Excuse me?

1013
01:06:33,055 --> 01:06:34,957
Oh, I've never met them.

1014
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,328
I only heard about them from Cindy.

1015
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:40,629
CEO Byun.

1016
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,031
What is it?

1017
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,001
What are you trying to do with me here?

1018
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,939
Cindy, don't be so shocked.

1019
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:54,977
Just tell the truth to the reporter.

1020
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,913
You have nothing to hide.
Why are you scared?

1021
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,149
Cindy, what's wrong?

1022
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:03,786
Do you have anything to say
about this problem?

1023
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:05,154
Turn the camera off.

1024
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:12,728
I said

1025
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,564
turn the camera off.

1026
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,268
Why?

1027
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,305
Can't you say it in front of the camera?

1028
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:32,014
My parents...

1029
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,152
aren't in the United States.

1030
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:37,820
Excuse me?

1031
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,557
They aren't anywhere.

1032
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,829
They both passed away when I was young.

1033
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,903
My home

1034
01:07:56,038 --> 01:07:57,206
is not a mansion with a pool

1035
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:00,643
in Beverly Hills.

1036
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:04,280
My deceased parents

1037
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,851
were not a professor or a musician.

1038
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,421
My home...

1039
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,562
was in Chuncheon.

1040
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:23,732
It was very small.

1041
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:28,637
It was also warm.

1042
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:32,875
My parents...

1043
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,848
weren't wealthy,

1044
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:43,352
but they were loving and honest.

1045
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:45,955
But...

1046
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,292
I told that lie

1047
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,429
because when I was 14,

1048
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:55,731
The CEO of my agency--

1049
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,765
Let's stop.

1050
01:08:59,034 --> 01:09:00,936
She's a bit too worked up.

1051
01:09:01,003 --> 01:09:02,705
Okay. Turn the camera off.

1052
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,841
This is a bit too sensitive.

1053
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:09,778
It's also something
our agency didn't know about.

1054
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,715
Getting to the bottom of this
is what's important.

1055
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,485
Reporter Min, go easy on her.

1056
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:23,425
Once people know that she lied
about her background,

1057
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:28,764
they will never forgive her.

1058
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:34,170
Telling them that you lied won't end this.

1059
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,982
My grandmother's house.

1060
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,717
A trip back home.

1061
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,689
-Two Days...
-And One Night!

1062
01:09:57,059 --> 01:10:00,029
-Great job!
-Well done.

1063
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,298
BYUN ENTERTAINMENT MANAGER KIM

1064
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,639
Yes, Manager Kim. What's going on?

1065
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,274
Producer Ra.

1066
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:13,776
Sorry for calling this late.

1067
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:16,045
But I have something to tell you.

1068
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:17,713
Yes, go ahead.

1069
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:22,218
You know that I was Yun-a's road manager
for three years, right?

1070
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:25,387
After she disappeared...

1071
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,723
it wasn't just hard for you.

1072
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,959
It was hard on me too.

1073
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,193
What's wrong?

1074
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:32,861
Did something happen?

1075
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:16,105
UMBRELLA

1076
01:11:24,146 --> 01:11:27,383
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

1077
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:04,320
Show me one more time.

1078
01:12:09,558 --> 01:12:11,760
Hey, isn't this a bit excessive?

1079
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:13,195
Lobster?

1080
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:14,797
You really...

1081
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,535
This is interest.

1082
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,771
The interest will add up
and will be more than the principal.

1083
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,709
Are you a loan shark?

1084
01:12:36,485 --> 01:12:39,254
Hey, wait a minute. Give me the statement.

1085
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:44,193
I didn't keep count because I trusted you,
but I think I should check.

1086
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:49,031
I think my debt has been paid already.

1087
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:52,568
I feel like I'm getting ripped off here.

1088
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,873
If I knew you would do this,
I would have just paid you all at once.

1089
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,308
Something's fishy.

1090
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,313
Seung-chan, you should eat too.

1091
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:06,148
Okay.

1092
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,541
I've paid everything now, okay?

1093
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:35,778
Okay.

1094
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:40,382
What's with that look?

1095
01:13:42,785 --> 01:13:45,087
I'm both happy and sad.

1096
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:48,424
Happy about what?

1097
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:53,595
I've always wanted
to go on a date with you,

1098
01:13:54,296 --> 01:13:56,031
so I'm happy about having done that now.

1099
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:57,833
What are you sad about then?

1100
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,238
Now, I don't have an excuse
to be around you.

1101
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:09,711
Seung-chan.

1102
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,691
You're a really good guy.

1103
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:33,902
You're kind, warm, and handsome.

1104
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:37,806
I feel really bad. What should I do?

1105
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,612
When you stare at me

1106
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,316
with those eyes,

1107
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:48,851
I...

1108
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:51,487
I feel so sorry.

1109
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,266
Seung-chan.

1110
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,339
Thank you

1111
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,041
for mustering up all your courage

1112
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:16,812
for the first time in your life for me.

1113
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:21,517
Thank you for telling me how you feel.

1114
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,022
Having a great guy like you do that for me

1115
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,828
really made me feel like I'm important.

1116
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:42,471
Thank you so much.

1117
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:03,458
I'm going now.

1118
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:05,727
Bye.

1119
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,877
You can still change your mind.

1120
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:25,948
You may feel sorry now,

1121
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,352
then feel thankful later.

1122
01:16:34,222 --> 01:16:35,057
Later on...

1123
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,227
it could become natural.

1124
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:47,169
My feelings for you,

1125
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:49,438
the look

1126
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:51,740
in my eyes...

1127
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,276
all of it

1128
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,346
could become natural.

1129
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,584
And me being there next to you

1130
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,155
could become natural too.

1131
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:21,770
Don't you think...

1132
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,275
you should give me some time too?

1133
01:18:20,128 --> 01:18:20,996
UMBRELLA

1134
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,233
By tomorrow morning,

1135
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:29,237
I'll be living a different life.

1136
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,116
WHY DID CINDY LIE?

1137
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:42,951
CINDY'S AGENCY DIDN'T KNOW
SHE CREATED FAKE PARENTS

1138
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:43,952
CINDY'S FAMILY SECRET

1139
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:49,624
SHOCKING TRUTH ABOUT HER BACKGROUND

1140
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:52,494
HER FATHER IS NOT A PROFESSOR
HER MOTHER IS NOT A MUSICIAN

1141
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,863
CINDY ALWAYS SPOKE PROUDLY OF HER PARENTS

1142
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,236
You told me

1143
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:03,538
that in order to grow,

1144
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,540
there must be pain and sacrifice.

1145
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:07,142
TOP SEARCHES:
CINDY'S PARENTS, ORPHAN CINDY

1146
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,681
I'm going to think of this

1147
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:17,786
as breaking out of my shell a little
to attain a new world.

1148
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,592
This is crazy.

1149
01:19:23,658 --> 01:19:25,460
I know. I didn't think she was like that.

1150
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:28,764
What's up?

1151
01:19:30,332 --> 01:19:31,466
Did you see this?

1152
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,470
CINDY'S FAMILY SECRET

1153
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:38,073
I don't think we'll see each other
for a while,

1154
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,341
so I'm texting you to say goodbye.

1155
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:44,179
BY TOMORROW MORNING,
I'LL BE LIVING A DIFFERENT LIFE

1156
01:19:44,246 --> 01:19:46,782
SO I'M TEXTING YOU TO SAY GOODBYE

1157
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:56,725
EVERYTHING ABOUT CINDY IS A LIE

1158
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,161
CINDY'S AGENCY DIDN'T KNOW
SHE CREATED FAKE PARENTS

1159
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:22,184
-Cindy.
-Hey.

1160
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,054
I won't have any work for a while.

1161
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:30,692
Go take a vacation.

1162
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,527
You haven't had a break.

1163
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:36,698
Okay.

1164
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:38,800
Thanks.

1165
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,316
Hey, Cindy.

1166
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,518
I...

1167
01:20:57,853 --> 01:20:59,387
I told you!

1168
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,226
I told you to just give in to her.

1169
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:07,028
Is that so hard?

1170
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:10,031
I...

1171
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:13,001
I...

1172
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:18,240
I swallow my pride 12 times a day!

1173
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:22,110
You could have done it.

1174
01:21:24,913 --> 01:21:27,282
Look at you now!

1175
01:21:49,437 --> 01:21:51,673
Producer Ra,
did you see the article about Cindy?

1176
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:56,578
So what if I did?

1177
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:58,847
I actually heard this from her.

1178
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:02,250
Cindy told me that she had severe insomnia

1179
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:05,320
because of the guilt she feels
about her parents passing away.

1180
01:22:05,787 --> 01:22:07,956
There's no way that Cindy
voluntarily lied.

1181
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:11,626
That's what I think too.

1182
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,028
-Then--
-But...

1183
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:16,331
it's not like I can do anything about it.

1184
01:22:18,333 --> 01:22:19,901
Go upstairs and get ready for the meeting.

1185
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,570
Cindy is our cast member.

1186
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:24,472
We might have to find a substitute.

1187
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,309
Excuse me? Why?

1188
01:22:27,642 --> 01:22:30,478
You think Cindy didn't do anything wrong,
so why should we replace her?

1189
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:33,715
I think this is all CEO Byun's doing.

1190
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,150
Why must we do that?

1191
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,484
We're producers.

1192
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:38,787
It's not like that.

1193
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,021
Tae-ho.

1194
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,023
We're producers.

1195
01:22:42,257 --> 01:22:44,693
She has done nothing wrong,
yet she's suffering.

1196
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:46,094
Can't we do anything for her?

1197
01:22:47,028 --> 01:22:49,898
Do you think producers
can make all the decisions?

1198
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,668
People don't want to see her.
They won't watch her shows.

1199
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:56,004
What can we do
if we go against the viewers?

1200
01:22:56,571 --> 01:23:00,008
Do you think producers
can make all the decisions?

1201
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:03,078
What can we do
if we go against the viewers?

1202
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:10,418
You said this last time.

1203
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,955
You said good intentions
don't make good results.

1204
01:23:14,022 --> 01:23:17,258
Therefore, you shouldn't intervene.

1205
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:22,030
But if we show our good intentions,

1206
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,966
won't the other person see that

1207
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,770
even if the result is not good?

1208
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:34,909
Knowing that we had good intentions
and that we wanted good results...

1209
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:39,981
wouldn't that offer her some comfort?

1210
01:23:45,086 --> 01:23:46,988
You don't know anything about that.

1211
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:57,565
CINDY'S FAMILY SECRET

1212
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,870
The reactions are terrible.

1213
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:03,905
I don't think this will blow over soon.

1214
01:24:04,539 --> 01:24:07,075
They're blowing up the viewer call center

1215
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:09,077
and our message board.

1216
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,180
I've never seen so much stuff
posted recently.

1217
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:16,084
Cindy is a regular cast member
on our show,

1218
01:24:16,151 --> 01:24:18,386
so they're all criticizing us.

1219
01:24:20,288 --> 01:24:23,091
Jun-mo, the chief director
wants to see you.

1220
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,405
Gosh.

1221
01:24:38,006 --> 01:24:41,810
I thought she was a golden ticket,
but she turned out to be a rotten apple.

1222
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:46,714
How about making an official statement
saying she will be dropped from the show?

1223
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:51,886
Let's not be ambiguous,
or we might get caught up in this mess.

1224
01:24:51,953 --> 01:24:54,689
Right. The viewer committee is going nuts.

1225
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:59,227
It will be a huge headache
if they start boycotting our sponsors.

1226
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,428
We should drop her immediately.

1227
01:25:00,495 --> 01:25:02,797
I'll talk to CEO Byun's agency.

1228
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,833
Let's make her voluntarily drop out.

1229
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,503
CEO Byun came here and apologized.

1230
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:11,706
She offered to give us Jinie.

1231
01:25:12,273 --> 01:25:13,942
She's pretty hot these days.

1232
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,644
Let's use her for this coming shoot.

1233
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:17,612
Tae-ho.

1234
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,849
Do you remember Yun-a?

1235
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,818
Why are you bringing up that old story?

1236
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:28,056
I recently heard something about Yun-a.

1237
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:32,193
You know that I was Yun-a's road manager
for three years, right?

1238
01:25:33,394 --> 01:25:36,798
After she disappeared,
it wasn't just hard for you.

1239
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:37,966
What's wrong?

1240
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,701
Did something happen?

1241
01:25:40,368 --> 01:25:41,269
Producer Ra.

1242
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:44,205
I found where Yun-a is.

1243
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,884
She's actually living quite happily.

1244
01:25:57,318 --> 01:25:58,553
She looks...

1245
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:01,656
a lot more comfortable and happy now.

1246
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,224
That's good.

1247
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,160
She's living a good life. What a relief.

1248
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:07,729
Don't feel guilty about that anymore.

1249
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,998
Sir, Tae-ho.

1250
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:13,067
I'm sorry.

1251
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,539
I can't do this.

1252
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:18,806
Do what?

1253
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,077
This is my shoot and my cast member.

1254
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:25,013
I'll do what I want.

1255
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:29,050
You can't even take care of yourself.
What do you think you're going to do?

1256
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,252
Jun-mo, don't you get it?

1257
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:36,124
CEO Byun and Cindy are at war,
and you might get sucked in.

1258
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:38,593
I'll get sucked in then.

1259
01:26:39,694 --> 01:26:41,095
Afterward,

1260
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:43,865
I'll find my place again.

1261
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:49,504
That's what I'll do this time.

1262
01:26:50,338 --> 01:26:51,306
I'm sorry.

1263
01:26:58,379 --> 01:27:00,748
Why is he so unnecessarily determined?

1264
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:01,950
Just let him be.

1265
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:04,986
We have the follow-up.

1266
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:07,055
His show will be canceled anyway.

1267
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,558
It will only last
one or two weeks at most.

1268
01:27:21,369 --> 01:27:22,971
CINDY CREATED FAKE PARENTS

1269
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,839
MYTHOMANIA OR A TOTAL SCAM?

1270
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:42,724
YANG-MI, I HAVE TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

1271
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,659
PLEASE CONTACT ME. I'LL BE WAITING.

1272
01:27:53,835 --> 01:27:54,769
Hello?

1273
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:06,748
Hello?

1274
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:15,256
Hey! I don't need a loan!

1275
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:18,059
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

1276
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,865
11. UNDERSTANDING VIEWER RATINGS

1277
01:28:23,931 --> 01:28:27,168
THEY CAN'T BE ATTAINED WITH EFFORT,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO TRY

1278
01:29:49,417 --> 01:29:52,320
Shouldn't you file a complaint
at the district office

1279
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:53,755
about those street lamps?

1280
01:31:48,069 --> 01:31:48,903
Cindy.

1281
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:52,740
What are you doing?
It's time for the shoot.

1282
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:21,235
Here.

1283
01:32:24,872 --> 01:32:25,840
You have to drink it.

1284
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:15,556
Hello, I called yesterday
about the street lamps.

1285
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,959
They still don't light up.

1286
01:33:19,126 --> 01:33:19,961
Yes.

1287
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:25,166
No, I saw them.

1288
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,234
They don't light up yet.

1289
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:30,838
Why does it take so long to fix that?

1290
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:35,643
I see you recognize my voice now.

1291
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,714
I'm going to protest
in front of my apartment.

1292
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:42,450
Hello?

1293
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:48,456
They shouldn't be hanging up on me.

1294
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:51,459
Did you just hang up on me?

1295
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:55,396
I better go meet your boss.
This isn't right.

1296
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:59,567
It's too dark there, so it's dangerous!

1297
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:01,268
Starting when?

1298
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:03,738
Starting today?

1299
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:07,141
I'm going to check.
