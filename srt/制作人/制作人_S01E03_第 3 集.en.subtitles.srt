1
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,944
Isn't that the assistant producer
for Entertainment Weekly?

2
00:00:45,011 --> 00:00:45,945
Shin Hye-ju?

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,214
I heard they were dating.
I guess it's true.

4
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,217
Do you live here, too?

5
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,452
No. My boyfriend lives here.

6
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,621
I'm okay.

7
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,891
I tend to give up quickly
if things are hopeless.

8
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,893
"Let's focus on work at the workplace."

9
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,228
Who would understand
when you say it like that?

10
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,763
Are you a dolphin?

11
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,498
If you're not that into her,

12
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,134
tell her clearly and draw the line!

13
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,570
Let's stop seeing each other.

14
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,138
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,411
Okay.

16
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:21,047
Use this.

17
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:23,049
I just borrowed it at the lobby desk.

18
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,350
-Excuse me?
-If it isn't returned,

19
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,986
they'll deduct it from my salary.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,254
Please return it.

21
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:29,556
Look at this!

22
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,458
You parked so close.

23
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,893
The repair estimate is about 830,000 won.

24
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:36,229
That newbie on your team.

25
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,430
Destroy him.

26
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,133
That Seung-chan kid is a total psycho.

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,320
Our concern today is called,
"I don't want to go to work."

28
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,822
We'll find out why that is.

29
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,859
Let's bring out our guest and talk to him.

30
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,327
Come on out!

31
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,628
Come on!

32
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:14,134
BAEK SEUNG-CHAN

33
00:02:14,534 --> 00:02:15,869
He's handsome.

34
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,207
Help him out.

35
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:23,076
He's bad at going down the slide.

36
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,978
-Here...
-He's...

37
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,479
-Oh, I'll help him!
-Are you okay?

38
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,581
-Tae-gyun, let me.
-You're obsessed with men.

39
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:30,116
OH DEAR

40
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,851
It's okay.

41
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:35,388
We've had guests here before

42
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,923
who didn't want to go to work.

43
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,924
-Right.
-Very often.

44
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,027
But what's unique is,
he's a newbie producer

45
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,898
in the KBS entertainment department.

46
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,633
That's right.

47
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:48,835
So, why don't you want to go to work?

48
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:49,936
Why do you hate it already?

49
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:55,608
There's a girl whom I've liked
since college.

50
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,744
She's a producer
in the entertainment department.

51
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,013
PRODUCER OF ENTERTAINMENT DEPARTMENT

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,047
OH NO

53
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,916
-At KBS?
-Yes.

54
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,119
That's why I started working at KBS.

55
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,587
That's admirable.

56
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:10,957
-What an innocent guy.
-He is.

57
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,958
So what's the problem?

58
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:15,361
Once I started working there,

59
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,997
I found out she's dating someone.

60
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,567
-Oh, no...
-Dating a coworker.

61
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,937
But you seem very young.

62
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:24,971
Just find another girl.

63
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,375
Why go after a variety show producer?

64
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:33,079
There are producers
in other departments, too.

65
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,915
-Female variety show producers are tough.
-That's right.

66
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,220
But the real problem is,
her boyfriend is involved

67
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,222
with another female producer.

68
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,190
-What?
-It's very suspicious.

69
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,793
What do you mean, "suspicious"?

70
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,363
It was by chance that I saw them

71
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,033
go into the same house after work.

72
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,502
This is a bit too much for our show.

73
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,770
A BIT INAPPROPRIATE FOR THIS SHOW?

74
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:58,972
You should be on Witch Hunt.

75
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,440
This is more suitable for that show.

76
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:01,541
You said the same house?

77
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,277
If I tell the girl I like what I saw,

78
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,945
it will hurt her feelings.

79
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,982
But I'm so mad at the other two producers.

80
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,884
I don't know what to do.

81
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,954
That's why I don't want to go to work.

82
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:21,361
Let's bring those people out
and talk to them.

83
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,229
What?

84
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,099
We bring out the person with the concern

85
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,268
and the people causing the concern

86
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,570
-to hear their point of view.
-To discuss in detail.

87
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,872
Where are you? Raise your hands.

88
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,207
Where are you?

89
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:36,242
There they are.

90
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,277
RA JUN-MO
TAK YE-JIN

91
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,345
Welcome.

92
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,583
We hear you two have something

93
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,551
to say to Seung-chan.

94
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,186
Yes.

95
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:49,989
I said not to show up in front of me.

96
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:52,258
I told you to destroy him.

97
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,196
ELIMINATED

98
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,802
Today's concern is...

99
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:03,936
Seung-chan.

100
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,905
Take this to the TV studio tomorrow

101
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,775
and give it to BamBam.

102
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,278
It's my big brother's birthday soon.

103
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,214
But I'm your brother.

104
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,251
I mean, he's like a big brother to me.

105
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:22,555
He has a gig at KBS tomorrow. Take this.

106
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,257
-Yu-bin.
-What?

107
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,161
I don't want to go to work.

108
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:41,441
Jun-mo, did you bring the milk in?

109
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,608
No.

110
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,779
Huh? It should be here then.

111
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,151
Did someone steal the milk?

112
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,498
They got two bottles of milk delivered...

113
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,168
I don't think it's a one-night stand.

114
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,107
Oh, I...

115
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:15,942
Yes?

116
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,078
I got a bit worked up,

117
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:21,647
and I said a bunch of things
I shouldn't have.

118
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,583
When I talked about Hye-ju...

119
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,120
These are all very personal things.

120
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:29,822
Please edit that out...

121
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,724
What's your class?

122
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,928
It's... Class 42.

123
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,997
I'm Class 34.

124
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,999
I'm your senior.

125
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,201
You think TV is a joke?

126
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,137
No.

127
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,407
You're not in a position to tell me
what to edit and what not to.

128
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,709
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,182
On your way to work?

130
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,183
Yes.

131
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,285
Do you know what you'll do today?

132
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,521
Well...

133
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
From what my seniors said yesterday,

134
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,194
we have to revamp things
for the new season.

135
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,396
Decide what our concept will be,

136
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:14,267
and most importantly, get a new cast.

137
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,902
The casting writer said that

138
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,405
last season was a total mess,

139
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,143
and we only have a week until the shoot,

140
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,379
so people won't want to be on our show.

141
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,580
So what will you do?

142
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:33,319
We shouldn't waste time trying to catch
top stars.

143
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,322
We should settle for "Plan B."

144
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,990
Plan B?

145
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:41,527
Yes.

146
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,529
So...

147
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm going to head off to find Plan B.

148
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:57,777
I heard there were milk thieves.
I guess it's true.

149
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,412
We should make a hole
in our door for milk.

150
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,947
Here.

151
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,584
Thanks.

152
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,586
But don't you think that

153
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,056
our roles are reversed?

154
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,058
What?

155
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,461
Girls usually can't open these things.

156
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:18,130
They can't hammer or change light bulbs.

157
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,967
So they call a guy and ask him to do it.

158
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,669
"Can you do this for me?"

159
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,508
Is that what Hye-ju did?

160
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,511
Why would you bring her up?

161
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,847
So that's how she seduced you?

162
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,250
Did she ask you to feed her, too?

163
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,518
Come on...

164
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,788
True, she's the serial dater of KBS.

165
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,258
When she first joined,
she dated Yun Ju-won

166
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,527
in the announcer department, right?

167
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,829
Then, Kim what's-his-face in the drama--

168
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:50,930
Hey!

169
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,199
Why are you trashing her?

170
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,103
She's young and unmarried.
It's normal for her to date.

171
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,838
You're the abnormal one,
since you can't date.

172
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:02,041
I can't? Me?

173
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,844
I choose not to date. I'm too busy.

174
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:15,888
Jun-mo...

175
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,892
Hyeon-seong dumped me!

176
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,528
What do I do?

177
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,930
I just don't know!

178
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,765
Gosh...

179
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,402
Where is it? So loud...

180
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,545
-Jun-mo...
-I thought it was a ghost.

181
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,815
I think that jerk
Min-cheol is cheating on me!

182
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,983
Min-cheol...

183
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,654
-Geez, I knew he'd cheat on you...
-What do I do?

184
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,790
Jun-mo.

185
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,826
Do people get sick of me easily?

186
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,062
No.

187
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,465
I've been friends with you for 25 years.

188
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,169
No! People get sick of me!

189
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,306
That's why I can't date a guy
longer than three months!

190
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,942
They get sick of me!

191
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,212
That's why I can't date
for more than three months!

192
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:14,246
So?

193
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,283
I can pop open jam jars

194
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,251
and hammer nails well.

195
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,988
I can change light bulbs like MacGyver.

196
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,322
You're saying that's why I'm single?

197
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,924
I didn't say that.

198
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,094
You trashed a girl you don't know well--

199
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,297
Yeah, you're all caught up with that girl,

200
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,199
and you're not even that into her.

201
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,167
Yet you can't even dump her.

202
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,637
Just let it drag on forever!

203
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:41,007
You might wake up

204
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,476
and find yourself
marrying her at this rate.

205
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:47,413
Hey. I'm in charge of my life.
Mind your own business.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,849
You live at my place because you couldn't

207
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:51,550
work out your own housing issues.

208
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,287
Instead of worrying about me,

209
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:57,657
think about what wallpaper
you're going to use for your new home

210
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,259
and whether you should install a veranda.

211
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,428
Don't butt into my personal life.

212
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,797
What? Are we strangers?

213
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,203
Why can't I be reimbursed?

214
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,372
This was all for work.

215
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,342
You cannot be reimbursed for purchases

216
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,711
made at your home address

217
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,846
and during holidays.

218
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,648
What?

219
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,450
You live in Mok-dong, Producer Kim?

220
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,751
How did you know?

221
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,488
These receipts are all from Mok-dong.

222
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:32,224
Can't I do work in Mok-dong?

223
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,429
I could've been casting near there,

224
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:39,365
or having a meeting with writers.

225
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,568
This was pointed out
by the chief director.

226
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,905
Can't you reimburse me for just one?

227
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,540
This one. It's for 58,000 won.

228
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,211
It's too much to make me pay all three.

229
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,846
This is the biggest one.

230
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,451
The other two are 14,500 won
and 9,200 won.

231
00:11:58,517 --> 00:11:59,585
These are on me.

232
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,155
Fine.

233
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,859
Then how about this one?
The 14,500-won one.

234
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,429
Leave it here.

235
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:19,238
The blood sausages are good there.

236
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,639
What?

237
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:22,775
Blood sausages, spicy rice cakes,

238
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,376
and stew are good there.

239
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,978
That's what the restaurant is known for.

240
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,315
Why would you order rice rolls from there?

241
00:12:32,618 --> 00:12:35,554
Producer Ra! Producer Ra.

242
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,156
Why are you here?

243
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,926
Are you upset
that I said your show would get canned?

244
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:42,394
No, I'm not upset.

245
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,465
It's a relief that
all you need is a new cast.

246
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,534
So who are the new cast members?

247
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,369
Hey! It hasn't been decided yet.

248
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,671
Shin Dong-yup, right? And You Hee-yeol!

249
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:53,806
Says who?

250
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,808
I'm right. I'm writing the article.

251
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:57,710
Go ahead.

252
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,978
It's not?

253
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,813
Write it if you're sure.

254
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,416
Write about me
being a trustworthy producer.

255
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,751
So they rejected you.

256
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:06,919
Says who?

257
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,555
So you tried to cast them, but actually,

258
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,757
Shin Dong-yup and You Hee-yeol
rejected you.

259
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,626
Is that what I should write?

260
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:17,429
Why are you jumping the gun?

261
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,265
Do you have a problem with me,
Reporter Kang?

262
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,567
I have to do my job!

263
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,102
Just tell me who it is!

264
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,403
Wait. It's still in progress.

265
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,039
You have a week until you shoot!
How long must I wait?

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,808
Until today.

267
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:30,543
Really?

268
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,011
You'll call me today?

269
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,479
And only me!

270
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:38,150
If you don't, I'll write that
Shin Dong-yup rejected you.

271
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,785
I really will!

272
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:43,856
Tell me.

273
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,958
Why is everyone turning us down?

274
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,127
Well...

275
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,097
You'll get good viewer ratings
if you get me.

276
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,501
But it's important to me
who my co-star is.

277
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,569
Yoon Jong-shin?

278
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,437
He thinks he's my rival,

279
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,640
which is ridiculous.

280
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,676
How about Shin Dong-yup?

281
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,877
I'd love to.

282
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,545
I should try

283
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,583
an outdoor variety show.

284
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,218
But get Jun Hyun-moo, too.

285
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,853
He should return to KBS.

286
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,621
I'm doing seven shows right now.

287
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,157
I have no time for Two Days and One Night.

288
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,263
How much is the appearance fee?

289
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,998
You can't match my quota?

290
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,233
I can't be on your show.

291
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,101
I take it all back.

292
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,206
Dong-yup is out?

293
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,142
Then I'm out, too.

294
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,577
Hee-yeol is out?

295
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,579
Too bad.

296
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,451
Then get Jo Jung-chi from my agency
to be my co-star.

297
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
Jung-chi really likes me.

298
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:48,654
Is that what he said?

299
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,923
He's delusional.

300
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,725
Tell him you rejected me.

301
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,727
Why did you reject Jung-chi?

302
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,863
He's pretty popular these days.

303
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,931
Then I'm out.

304
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,700
If we get one person,
we can't get another.

305
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,169
If one can do it, another can't.

306
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:09,108
Casting is all about convincing people
who say no to you.

307
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
If everyone agreed, it would be easy.

308
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,013
It's like dating.

309
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,016
You can't just be pushy.

310
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,617
You need to push and pull.

311
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,586
Then you can do the casting.

312
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,454
You're good at dating.

313
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,356
Fine, I'll do it.

314
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,892
You think I won't? This is a crisis.

315
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,363
Why are you staring at me like that?

316
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,534
I wasn't...

317
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,171
Yeah. Let's hear from you.

318
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:40,906
Pardon?

319
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,642
If you dreamed of being
a variety producer,

320
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,977
you must have goals.

321
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,845
Something you've always wanted to do.

322
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,615
Something hidden up your sleeve.

323
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,318
Oh, what do you expect?
He's just a newbie.

324
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,353
Then you come up with ideas.

325
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,989
Was my idea earlier too weird?

326
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,590
Being serious about something pointless.

327
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,626
Get out of here with that!

328
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,760
Actually,

329
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:07,099
I've been studying up on
the history of Korean variety shows.

330
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,200
-What?
-Jun-mo.

331
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,569
He's like the historian Sima Qian.

332
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,805
He knows the entire history
of variety shows.

333
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,773
He could write a book.

334
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:21,547
Viewer ratings are like
a sequential market.

335
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:22,614
What market?

336
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,250
It's like a time period.

337
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:27,519
The period a popular format
loses popularity,

338
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,789
and then becomes popular again.

339
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,394
Every channel used to have shows
about pets--

340
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,563
So what are you suggesting?

341
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,031
Do a show about animals?

342
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,999
No.

343
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,600
According to the statistics,

344
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,004
we should do a dating show.

345
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,575
Oh, that's so played out.

346
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,346
If you look here, in 1995,

347
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,181
Love Studio was popular.

348
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,783
Seven years later in 2002,

349
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,419
War of Roses was a huge hit.

350
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,621
Then exactly seven years later in 2009,

351
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,757
We Got Married became popular.

352
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:06,725
I'm getting goosebumps.

353
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,827
You're like Nostradamus.

354
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,796
Give me a break.

355
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,166
Yes... Well, anyway,

356
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,069
if we start a dating show this year,

357
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,238
then by next year, 2016,

358
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,074
I'm thinking it could become a hit.

359
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,510
So...

360
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,613
Did you go to Seoul National University?

361
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,648
Yes.

362
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,283
Okay, I got it.

363
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,252
Pardon?

364
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,254
I said I got it.

365
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,426
I have a meeting with the chief director.

366
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:42,795
Try to get something done.

367
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,230
-Yes.
-Okay.

368
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,140
Newbie, don't get discouraged, okay?

369
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,077
We need to reuse our tapes.

370
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,212
They're in the room
at the end of the hall.

371
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,114
Erase the Haenam episode
and bring it to me.

372
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:03,549
Okay.

373
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,756
Goodness... Miss.

374
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,593
Eggshells don't belong in food waste.

375
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,994
Oh? Why not?

376
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:20,732
Food waste is used to make feed
for livestock.

377
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,669
So it's not food waste if it's inedible.

378
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,206
I've been teaching a long time,

379
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,209
so I can't let things like this slide.

380
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,078
Okay.

381
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,346
You're just going to throw it out?

382
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,748
I won't throw them out like this again.

383
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,554
Fine.

384
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:47,292
A woman should know
how to properly throw out the trash.

385
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:48,927
What?

386
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,797
So is it okay if a man doesn't know

387
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,199
how to properly throw out the trash?

388
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:55,901
What?

389
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,704
You said you've been teaching a long time,

390
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,472
so I'm asking. I'm curious.

391
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,710
Miss, are you being sarcastic?

392
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:05,777
Honey.

393
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:07,646
Going to the car center?

394
00:19:08,447 --> 00:19:10,382
Goodness...

395
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,252
Oh, the nerve!

396
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,925
How undignified...

397
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,227
Why are you fighting with the neighbors?

398
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:25,564
Can't I even tell her that?

399
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:29,601
I have to be nominated
by the Yeouido area.

400
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,172
You can't be fighting with the neighbors.

401
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,110
You never did support me
when I was ward head.

402
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,746
Oh, give me a break.

403
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,183
You were temporary ward head
for just two months.

404
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:49,588
It's because you look down on me like this
that I have no authority over the kids!

405
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,423
I look down on you?

406
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,258
Did you really just say that to me?

407
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,761
I've been supporting you all this time.

408
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,597
So I never got a good performance rating,
and I missed out on

409
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,566
becoming principal or vice principal!

410
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,768
I even quit my teaching job!

411
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,738
You quit because you couldn't keep up with
the curriculum changing every year.

412
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,308
I couldn't keep up?

413
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:12,344
I'm much sharper
than the younger teachers!

414
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:15,013
I even pray in Hebrew!

415
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm busy as it is,
and the traffic is insane.

416
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,506
Look at all these people here.

417
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,509
These cherry blossom trees in Yeouido

418
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,512
should all be ripped out. Seriously...

419
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,982
Jun-mo, let's go see the cherry blossoms.

420
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,285
It'll rain tomorrow.
All the cherry blossoms will fall.

421
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,220
I can't. I'm editing.

422
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,788
Let's go see them next year.

423
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,492
Let's see them next year.

424
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,227
They bloom every year.

425
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:06,331
They say they're not pretty this year.
It was on the news.

426
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:08,033
Come on!

427
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,770
Didn't we go see them last year?
Or did we not?

428
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,206
I feel like I saw them.

429
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,875
Come on. Let's go drink.

430
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,244
I'll sing "Cherry Blossom Ending"
at the karaoke.

431
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,245
No!

432
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,947
What's the point
of seeing cherry blossoms?

433
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,753
IS
IS NOT

434
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,132
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT
MAIN PRODUCER: RA JUN-MO

435
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,975
What are you doing here?

436
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,944
I'm...

437
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,615
We have to reuse the tapes.

438
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:57,683
So?

439
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,520
I was told to erase the Haenam episode.

440
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:03,989
I'll get it done quickly.

441
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,725
You just have to erase the Haenam episode?

442
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,729
Want some help?

443
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,466
Oh, that's okay. This is my job.

444
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,836
I think you need my help.

445
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:18,904
No.

446
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,220
That's a tape eraser.

447
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,789
You use that to erase what's on the tape.

448
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,058
Not the writing on the outside.

449
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,327
Just ask if you're unsure.

450
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,930
-Yes.
-Ask even if you know.

451
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
Yes.

452
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,501
Nice white-out job, though. Very clean.

453
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:51,837
Producer Tak.

454
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,941
I'm sorry, but can you keep this a secret?

455
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,512
Especially, don't tell Producer Ra.

456
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,749
Well... But this is just too funny.

457
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:05,484
I'm asking you a favor.

458
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:06,985
Then how about this?

459
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,357
The 800,000 won I owe you
for car repairs...

460
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,959
It's 830,000 won to be exact.

461
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:19,064
Fine. Let me pay you that 830,000 won
in installments.

462
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:21,900
Installments?

463
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,169
It's not that I don't have money.

464
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,504
I do.

465
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,205
But I made a lot of investments.

466
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,509
I don't have many liquid assets, so...

467
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,949
Take 30,000 won for today.

468
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,488
Take it. Don't feel bad. Here.

469
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,457
Thank you.

470
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:46,691
You're thankful?

471
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,593
Then buy some chips.

472
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,531
Sure. What should I buy?

473
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,333
That's what I want to see. What you buy.

474
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,069
It's a way of seeing how detailed you are.

475
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,939
You think this is an errand, right?

476
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,675
This is actually part of training.

477
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:13,285
Why do you keep signing
our kid up for stuff?

478
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,590
You can't improve self-directed
learning ability with tutoring.

479
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,126
This is ridiculous.

480
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:25,630
Fine. Sign her up next month then.

481
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,032
That's when I get my bonus.

482
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,501
Why would you use it already?

483
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,870
That's my bonus. You can't just...

484
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,072
I have to go.

485
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,210
What is it?

486
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,479
Don't ever have kids.

487
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,481
It costs so much to educate them.

488
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,851
I've never bought a suit since
my kid started going to school.

489
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,386
That's why you always send me to the KCC.

490
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,788
Since you don't have a suit.

491
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,756
You think I'm joking?

492
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,391
It's true.

493
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,129
English, Chinese, math, sports...

494
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:00,599
Make her an idol singer trainee.

495
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,235
All the agencies
teach that stuff these days.

496
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:04,836
Should I?

497
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:06,204
Come on!

498
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,206
Get up. The chief director
wants to see us.

499
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,408
You got an idea?

500
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:13,478
I told my team to come up with one,

501
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,847
but they suggested a dating show.

502
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,617
Goodness... That's so old.

503
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,353
Is this War of Roses?

504
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,221
So, did the casting go well?

505
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,525
We should cast according to

506
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,426
the concept we choose.

507
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,529
So you've decided on an idea?

508
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,031
Since this is serious...

509
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,269
We have a lot of ideas,
and after narrowing it down--

510
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,603
What did you come up with?

511
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:41,806
First of all,

512
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,176
being serious about a pointless game--

513
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:46,711
What are you talking about?

514
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,380
I'm not saying we should do that.

515
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,116
There was talk of that, though.

516
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,654
Having the cast go to
indoor urban locations

517
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,522
like companies, instead of outdoors--

518
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,326
Did you forget about Invisible Man?

519
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,863
I'm so embarrassed that I can't forget it.

520
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:05,897
Is that all you have?

521
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,366
What will you do?

522
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,836
There was talk of a dating show, too...

523
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,873
That's a good idea. A dating show.

524
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,710
See? I told you.

525
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,279
You should've told him that first.

526
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:26,318
War of Roses was a great show, wasn't it?

527
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:28,253
I did that show.

528
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,387
It was a huge hit.

529
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,756
Don't worry about casting idol stars.

530
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,093
I'll take charge as the chief producer.

531
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,861
Which agency should I go first?

532
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:39,731
Cube? YG? SM?

533
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,834
Idol stars can do anything these days.

534
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:45,003
They learn English, Chinese
and everything.

535
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,438
-Do you guys do that, too?
-Of course.

536
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,807
We have a good training system.

537
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,909
What do you think of her?

538
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,045
This face could do well
in the Asian market.

539
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,480
Or the North American market.

540
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,115
She has that Mulan look.

541
00:26:57,182 --> 00:27:00,685
The CEO would kill me
if I brought in a girl like her.

542
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,588
It's my daughter.

543
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,825
She doesn't have to debut.

544
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,061
She has potential. She could be a trainee.

545
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:12,731
Teach her English, Chinese, sports...

546
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:14,499
Or even self-directed learning methods.

547
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:19,537
I'll do anything for you except for this.

548
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,910
Get me Hani for Two Days and One Night.

549
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,013
Hani of EXID.

550
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,849
Yedang teaches their trainees Chinese.

551
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,183
What about YG?

552
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,119
Oh, just Chinese?

553
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:38,056
We teach them Japanese, calligraphy
and even the tea ceremony.

554
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:44,295
I was going to set her up with SM,

555
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,365
but I'm only going to show you.

556
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,203
How about her as a trainee?

557
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,072
I don't think so.

558
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,476
That's my daughter.

559
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,980
Or get me Sandara Park.

560
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,853
Did you cry?

561
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,323
Hey.

562
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,929
I hate seeing a female producer
cry at work.

563
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,932
What can crying solve?

564
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,803
Producer Tak.

565
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,106
Jun-mo...

566
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:36,147
Jun-mo? What about him?

567
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:43,088
Okay, so yesterday Jun-mo...

568
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,224
Said he was sorry...

569
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,627
He wanted to just be colleagues?

570
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,863
He broke up with you?

571
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:59,070
Oh, what a scumbag.

572
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,842
Hey, it's okay. You're better off.

573
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,877
I always thought you were
too good for him.

574
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,482
Hey, you're young and pretty.

575
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:13,718
You don't need that old, immature Jun-mo.

576
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,287
You'll meet someone better, Hye-ju.

577
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,592
You're saying

578
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,196
I couldn't find a man all this time,

579
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:28,233
and still single...

580
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,836
You're afraid you'll end up like me?

581
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,774
No, Hye-ju.

582
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,877
I haven't found someone, but you can.

583
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,879
Work and love at the same time.

584
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,514
You can do it.

585
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,691
Are you done crying? You want to cry more?

586
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,033
I feel a lot better now.

587
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,539
-Thank you.
-No, it's okay.

588
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,644
Let's talk again. Okay?

589
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,617
Is this Hollywood?

590
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:22,487
Kissing one girl during the day,

591
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,624
going home with another girl at night.

592
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,498
And those two girls
seem like good friends.

593
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,668
I really can't get used to
this overly open

594
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,671
and free environment.

595
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,859
Unbelievable.

596
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,527
No sausages?

597
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,630
You said to buy chips.

598
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,300
So that's all you bought?

599
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,938
When I tell other juniors to buy chips,
they go ahead

600
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:17,041
and buy sausage, jerky, gum
and all sorts of stuff.

601
00:31:17,942 --> 00:31:21,446
I can't believe you didn't buy sausages.

602
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,047
Right?

603
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,018
Hey, you really messed up.

604
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:29,520
That's it.

605
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:32,123
I was going to pay you 20,000 won more...

606
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,994
You're too nimai.

607
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,630
A producer shouldn't be so nimai.

608
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:40,565
They should be more sanmai.

609
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,235
Keep that in mind.

610
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,074
Nimai and sanmai are Japanese words.

611
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,377
Producers shouldn't use words like that.

612
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,079
So what do they mean?

613
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,614
For nimai...

614
00:31:56,948 --> 00:32:00,418
It means normal, serious and not funny.

615
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,389
Sanmai is the opposite.

616
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:10,662
Like in a movie, when a guy and a girl
have a love scene,

617
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,564
and the lights go off... That's nimai.

618
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:14,866
But if the lights go off

619
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:18,770
and they're wearing
glow-in-the-dark undies,

620
00:32:18,836 --> 00:32:19,904
that's sanmai.

621
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:22,006
Kind of lewd. A bit funny and bad.

622
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,976
I'm a bit sanmai myself.

623
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,346
I have all sorts of kinky stuff.

624
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:41,826
How'd you finish the casting so quickly?

625
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,361
I don't know.

626
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,464
They all just said yes.

627
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,768
Thanks a lot, Tae-ho.

628
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,238
Kim Tae-ho is
at the chicken stir-fry place.

629
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,239
Everyone, beware.

630
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,277
He's pushing his daughter on everyone.

631
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,146
Reporter Kang.

632
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:03,982
It's me, Ra Jun-mo.

633
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:10,788
I debated about telling you
this morning...

634
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,191
We got Hani.

635
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,760
Yeah. Hani of EXID.

636
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,929
Up, down, up, up, down

637
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,930
That's right.

638
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,729
This is Music Bank.

639
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,464
Who?

640
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:56,401
Just a moment.

641
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:01,139
Hey. Writer Kim Da-jeong.

642
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,875
What is it?

643
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,082
Hello?

644
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,551
Yes, this is she.

645
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,721
Okay, got it.

646
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,856
What is it?

647
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,591
Package delivery.

648
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,062
Da-jeong, come here. Sit down here.

649
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,964
Just a moment.
Let me get the package first.

650
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,729
Hey. Look here.

651
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,632
You're the youngest in this office.

652
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,535
You're the one who runs errands for us.

653
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,472
You can't keep earphones in all the time.

654
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,173
You don't want to listen?

655
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,509
You have a loud voice.

656
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,778
I can hear you most of the time.

657
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,782
If you're done talking...

658
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,952
I'm not done talking.

659
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,354
Look.

660
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,655
This isn't your house.

661
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,891
Why do you get packages delivered here?

662
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:30,761
I didn't order this.
Someone sent it to me.

663
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:32,730
-Who?
-Cindy's fans.

664
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,366
-Why?
-They want me to be nice to her.

665
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:39,804
Why you?

666
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,141
I'm the main producer of this show.
I'm the one who can help her.

667
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,510
-Don't you know?
-What?

668
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,612
The fans all know that you got into

669
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:51,382
a fight with Cindy in the green room.

670
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,720
Her fans totally hate you.

671
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:57,989
They hate me?

672
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,758
Well, everyone hates Cindy!

673
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,327
She disbanded Pinky4!

674
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:05,396
She's ranked first in the search engines!

675
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,765
Everyone is chewing her out!

676
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:08,933
Yeah.

677
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,769
Hey, look at this.

678
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,038
Look.

679
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,608
Wow, so many people are chewing her out.

680
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,178
"You ungrateful troll."

681
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,513
"You're ugly. Don't AC."

682
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:24,081
What's "AC"?

683
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,184
Acting cute.

684
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,987
Oh... That's what AC means?

685
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,789
Read them.

686
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,992
What did they write after AC?

687
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,563
Don't skip any.

688
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,399
"Think you can make money by yourself?

689
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,768
You shouldn't be called Cindy.

690
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,437
You're Money-dy."

691
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,677
Keep going.

692
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,880
Let's stop. This is hard for me.

693
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:57,415
It's hard?

694
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:58,549
Yeah.

695
00:36:58,749 --> 00:36:59,917
It doesn't offend you?

696
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,819
Of course it does.

697
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:05,856
But why don't you report them?

698
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,658
To the cyber investigation unit?

699
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,831
Cindy, this disgusts and angers me, too.

700
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,267
But I can't report them for this.

701
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,768
Why not?

702
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,838
There's way worse stuff written about you.

703
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,573
If you go to the anti-fan club...

704
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,875
How do you know that?

705
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,555
Are you a member of my anti-fan club?

706
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,044
Oh, what will I do?

707
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,650
They won't move. Excuse me...

708
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,491
When I was young,
I just had to look flustered,

709
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,459
and they'd all help me.

710
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:21,699
That hurt.

711
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,302
JUN-MO

712
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:28,606
The person you are calling
is unavailable at the moment.

713
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,709
Charge will be incurred
for leaving voice messages.

714
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,852
That's it.

715
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,287
A bit more.

716
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:45,690
That's good. That's enough.

717
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,426
Thanks, Seung-chan.

718
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,228
Is your wrist okay?

719
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,931
It'll get better.

720
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,468
Anyway, since you helped me,

721
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,270
I'll give you 30,000 won more.

722
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,304
Producer Tak.

723
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,374
You need to give me 50,000 won...

724
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:09,413
This isn't a regular sedan.
It's really big.

725
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,182
Fine.

726
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,550
Come to my desk tomorrow morning.

727
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,118
I'll have cash.

728
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,119
Producer Tak.

729
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,289
What?

730
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,725
Are you going home?

731
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,693
Yeah.

732
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,096
Where do you live?

733
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,499
I used to live in Heukseok,
but I'm moving to Dongtan soon. Why?

734
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:31,936
Okay.

735
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,504
And by any chance...

736
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:41,846
Do you have a boyfriend?

737
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:46,083
Why? You're going to set me up?

738
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:48,986
No, it's not like that...

739
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,621
Then why'd you ask that?

740
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:55,192
Just seeing if you had a guy you like.

741
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,764
You really don't have one?

742
00:40:23,053 --> 00:40:26,524
People come to Yeouido in spring
to see the cherry blossoms.

743
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,860
But I feel like leaving Yeouido in spring.

744
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,928
Because of the traffic.

745
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,364
I guess I wouldn't feel like that
if I had a man.

746
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:35,466
We could walk and look at the blossoms.

747
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,206
Seung-chan.

748
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,308
Why are you asking me these things?

749
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:49,346
You said to ask everything, be it
something I'm sure of or not so sure.

750
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:52,750
I didn't mean ask useless things
like this.

751
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,188
Move over!

752
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,195
SANDARA PARK
NO MIN-WOO

753
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,296
There.

754
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,764
What?

755
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,900
So we are doing a dating show,
with idol stars.

756
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,204
Have you been listening?

757
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,906
It's not a dating show.

758
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,642
They're just new cast members.

759
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:21,111
Have three pairs of idol stars,

760
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:24,048
and take them on an overnight trip
as if they are couples.

761
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:26,050
That's what you mean, right?

762
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:31,222
Not exactly. But sort of...

763
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,158
That's a dating show.

764
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,660
It was the newbie's idea.

765
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,063
It's different from that.

766
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:40,331
Sounds the same to me.

767
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,099
You didn't like the idea before...

768
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,802
Really? I said that?

769
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,805
What question did I ask you?

770
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,677
Did you go to Seoul National University?

771
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,680
Whether I went
to Seoul National University.

772
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,416
Yeah, that's what I asked,
if you're from Seoul National University.

773
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,252
How does that mean I didn't like it?

774
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,455
That's some dangerous assumption there.

775
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,924
When Seung-chan first came here,

776
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:10,561
he never understood orders,
and he screwed up all the time,

777
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,396
but he finally came up with a good idea,

778
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,999
which shocked me, so I asked him.

779
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,802
"Did you go to Seoul National University?"

780
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,705
Did I yell at him afterward?

781
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:23,374
No, right?

782
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,544
"So you did graduate from there.

783
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,914
I knew it." That's what I meant.

784
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:46,196
Is that what Hye-ju did?

785
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,366
Why would you bring her up?

786
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,702
You're all caught up with that girl,

787
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,671
and you're not even that into her.

788
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,573
Yet you can't even dump her.

789
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,475
Just let it drag on forever!

790
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:07,051
I'm in charge of my life.
Mind your own business.

791
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,987
You live at my place because you couldn't

792
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,722
work out your own housing issues.

793
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:25,135
Why are you here so early?

794
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,137
I stayed out all night last night.

795
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,272
You did?

796
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:33,677
Whose call are you waiting for?

797
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,513
I'm not waiting.

798
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:39,249
Where's Jun-mo?

799
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,319
How should I know? His phone is off.

800
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,121
I don't care where he's roaming around.

801
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,056
So you called him.
You know his phone's off.

802
00:43:47,091 --> 00:43:48,892
I just called.

803
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:53,097
To check when he'd come home
and whether he's going to eat out.

804
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,665
You called him just once, right?

805
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,539
The person you are calling
is unavailable at the moment.

806
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:05,409
The person you are calling
is unavailable at the moment.

807
00:44:05,743 --> 00:44:08,345
The person you are calling
is unavailable at the moment.

808
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:15,719
Just to see if his phone was still off...

809
00:44:19,923 --> 00:44:21,125
Ye-jin,

810
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:24,028
shall we sit down?

811
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,404
Don't get offended, and listen to me.

812
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:39,043
Guys get really sick of girls like you.

813
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,078
What? You little...

814
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,247
I said to hear me out.

815
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,751
Guys don't value qualifications in a girl.

816
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,055
It's not all about looks and money.

817
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,657
Then what?

818
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:56,560
Delay.

819
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:57,594
Delay?

820
00:44:57,661 --> 00:44:59,096
That's right! Delay.

821
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:01,231
There needs to be a slight delay.

822
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,402
But you're so impatient. There's no delay.

823
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:06,537
You little punk!

824
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:07,638
Wait.

825
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:14,378
Let's say a guy you like texts you.

826
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:18,148
"Ye-jin, what are you doing?" Like that.

827
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,384
Then what do you do?

828
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:22,920
You got a text!

829
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:27,458
I'm eating.

830
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:28,892
You got a text!

831
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:30,894
Watching TV.

832
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,896
Taking a...

833
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,235
I'm in the bathroom.

834
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,037
That's what you do.

835
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,172
You respond right away.

836
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:46,944
You don't give the guy a chance
to be curious about what you're doing.

837
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:49,513
But let's say that

838
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,982
he doesn't get a response from you.

839
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,819
He would have to think during that time.

840
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,622
Oh? Why isn't she responding?

841
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,791
Is she busy? Sleeping?

842
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:03,327
Showering? Could she be sick?

843
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,562
Forget it.

844
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,364
So you want me to play hard to get.

845
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,333
Be sly and all.

846
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,603
Don't think of it like that.

847
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,472
I'm just saying, give the guy some time

848
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,275
to think about you in a relationship.

849
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,753
CINDY ANTI-FAN CLUB

850
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,721
What's this?

851
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,759
They made two more anti-fan clubs?

852
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,164
Why don't they just join
the existing ones?

853
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:43,367
WHY ISN'T CINDY BEING DRAGGED DOWN
TO THE UNDERWORLD ALREADY?

854
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,369
DREAMING OF A WORLD WITHOUT CINDY
LEAVE A COMMENT

855
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,440
REGISTER

856
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:52,576
PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU HATE CINDY

857
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,184
She's too...

858
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,625
She's too perfect, so I hate her.

859
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,597
CINDY FANS ARE BANNED FROM THIS SITE
ARE YOU CINDY BY CHANCE?

860
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:15,132
How dare they?

861
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,237
PLEASE TELL US WHY YOU HATE CINDY

862
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,747
She's phony, and she's super rude.

863
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:35,752
I have ugly past photos of Cindy.

864
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,491
YOU ARE NOW A MEMBER
THANKS FOR SIGNING TO OUR ANTI-FAN CLUB

865
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,727
I must be insane.

866
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,167
You got a text!

867
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,941
This is Baek Seung-chan, the assistant
producer of Two Days and One Night.

868
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,943
The guy you borrowed the umbrella from.

869
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:01,578
You remember, right?

870
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:05,949
I knew it. He got my number to hit on me.

871
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:11,655
I see that you haven't returned
the umbrella yet.

872
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,358
This is why I had to emphasize many times.

873
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:16,526
Please return it as soon as possible.

874
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,398
That's it?

875
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,234
Is that it?

876
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:28,305
Please return it at the reception desk
in the new KBS building lobby

877
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,341
by 9 a.m. tomorrow under my name.

878
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,611
For every day of delay, a late fee
will be deducted from my salary.

879
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:35,913
I'd really appreciate it.

880
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:36,980
No way.

881
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:41,752
This is all just about the umbrella?

882
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,121
-For example, black herbal tea.
-If it does,

883
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:45,756
-Something traditional.
-the same agency--

884
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,959
Guys! Big trouble!

885
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:49,893
What is it?

886
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,828
-Hani is first in the search engines!
-What is it?

887
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:54,531
HANI IN PRISON FOR A NIGHT

888
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:55,565
Oh my God.

889
00:48:55,899 --> 00:48:57,801
-She got into trouble.
-What?

890
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:00,837
No wonder things went so smoothly.

891
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:02,773
What happened?

892
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,443
Hani was feeling good
and went out for drinks

893
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,046
after she won first place on M Countdown.

894
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,014
Nothing's wrong with that. So then what?

895
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,618
The guys at the table next to her
were being really drunk and loud.

896
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,420
So they started a fight with Hani.

897
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:18,388
No. Hani started it with them.

898
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,626
Hani hates noisy people
when she's drinking.

899
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:25,395
So, then what?

900
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,166
Took a severe beating.

901
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,434
-Hani?
-Hani?

902
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,370
No. The guys.

903
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:35,739
Hani learned tae kwon do as a kid.

904
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,644
It was three men against Hani,
but she didn't get hurt at all!

905
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:43,547
That's nothing to brag about.

906
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,185
So a big crowd gathered.

907
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:51,288
She ran outside and started the car.

908
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,256
But she got caught.

909
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:54,491
By the guys?

910
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:57,861
No. The cops.

911
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,198
They were checking for drunk drivers.

912
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:03,667
She only got as far as 50cm
before she was caught.

913
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:06,570
So how's the overall mood?

914
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,572
Thankfully, very good.

915
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:11,041
Really? So it's all taken care of?

916
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,244
No, I mean the atmosphere
at the police station.

917
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:15,679
SILENCE

918
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,787
The police chief got an autograph
for his son.

919
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,522
It was very harmonious there.

920
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,525
I think they'll let her go with a warning.

921
00:50:28,592 --> 00:50:29,726
Isn't that a relief?

922
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:33,430
Are you kidding me?

923
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,866
How is she going to work?

924
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,536
I already told a reporter
she'd be on the show!

925
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:08,131
The other cast members want to know

926
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,267
who is replacing Hani
before they do the show.

927
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,636
They're trying to pull out.

928
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:16,106
What if our show really gets canceled?

929
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,279
Don't any of you have someone in mind?

930
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,516
A celebrity who can help you
in times of need.

931
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,086
Actually,

932
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:33,156
there is someone who has been calling.

933
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:36,193
From who?

934
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,762
Hong Kyung-min.

935
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:41,364
He wants to be the replacement.

936
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,467
But he's a guy.

937
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,302
We lost a girl!

938
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,938
And he's married. Why do a dating show?
Is he nuts?

939
00:51:48,004 --> 00:51:50,373
His wife gave him permission.
She wants him to work.

940
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:55,512
Well...

941
00:51:57,681 --> 00:51:59,249
How about Cindy?

942
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,454
Cindy?

943
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,058
The singer?

944
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:09,493
Yes.

945
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:12,062
She's no good?

946
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,465
No good? She'd be great. The best!

947
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,833
What do you all think? Cindy's great.

948
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,801
It would be awesome.

949
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:19,369
-More than great!
-She's the best.

950
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,372
-She's totally my type. She's great.
-The problem would be solved.

951
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:23,840
-Cindy is the best.
-She's my type.

952
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,408
-I really like her.
-People would go crazy.

953
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:31,181
Yeah, why didn't we think of Cindy?

954
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:36,953
You call Cindy and ask her.

955
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:40,090
Ask her to replace Hani on
Two Days and One Night.

956
00:52:41,258 --> 00:52:42,559
Is that okay?

957
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:45,195
Sure. Ask her.
You should. It was your idea.

958
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:49,833
If you can cast her,
I'll do whatever you want.

959
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,042
UMBRELLA BORROWER

960
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,819
Come to my desk.
I'll give you the payment.

961
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,425
What is Producer Ra Jun-mo up to?

962
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,360
He's in a meeting with the chief director.

963
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,829
Did he pull an all-nighter here?

964
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,465
Yes. One of our cast members fell through.

965
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:25,535
Yeah? I see.

966
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:28,638
You must be tired, too.

967
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:30,440
I'm okay.

968
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,275
You're very energetic.

969
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,145
Yeah, that's how newbies should be.

970
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,479
I like that.

971
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:40,417
Here is your 50,000 won.

972
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:41,818
Here.

973
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,153
Thank you.

974
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,321
You're thankful again?

975
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:46,389
Then buy some stuffed pancakes.

976
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,692
I skipped breakfast, so I'm hungry.

977
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,062
When you buy the stuffed pancakes,

978
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,298
get five of the green tea flavor
and five plain.

979
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,333
Okay?

980
00:53:57,801 --> 00:53:58,802
Yes.

981
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,237
Go.

982
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:06,009
I have good news and bad news.
What do you want to hear first?

983
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,678
There's actually good news?

984
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,749
The CEO never liked Hani.

985
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,285
What a relief.

986
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,720
And the bad news?

987
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,757
Since things turned out like this,
get Suzy.

988
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,058
Or Cindy.

989
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:28,965
Why would top stars like them do our show?

990
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,600
As a replacement, no less...

991
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:35,572
I didn't get to tell him that, Jun-mo.

992
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,942
I can't do that. That's unreasonable.

993
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,111
You haven't even tried.

994
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,014
When was it for me?

995
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,716
I went to SBS in winter when it was
around negative 12 degrees outside

996
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:50,053
to cast Kang Ho-dong
for a New Year's special.

997
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,789
Ho-dong was doing Highly Ambitious then.

998
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,892
I waited for him outside on purpose.

999
00:54:56,226 --> 00:55:00,497
My nose gets red when I'm cold.
That's how I tried to gain his sympathy.

1000
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,866
I wanted him to feel bad for me.

1001
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,768
Back when I was Chief Producer,

1002
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:07,604
on the day of Yoo Jae-suk's
Happy Together shoot.

1003
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,706
Remember how they used to shoot

1004
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,608
that show in a bathhouse in Singil?

1005
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,878
It's so cramped,
the staff can't all fit inside.

1006
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,348
I stood outside the bathhouse from morning

1007
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:20,884
until late at night when the shoot ended.

1008
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:25,388
You shouldn't be comfortable when casting.

1009
00:55:26,056 --> 00:55:28,491
You used to be close with JYP.

1010
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:35,265
You fixed his plastic pants
with Scotch tape when they tore.

1011
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,300
And then, he thanked you for that.

1012
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,169
That was ages ago.

1013
00:55:39,302 --> 00:55:41,705
Just go and try.

1014
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,709
You should be clinging to his leg
and begging.

1015
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,612
Geez. Just my luck...

1016
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,615
Fine. I'll go.

1017
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:59,422
But I thought you couldn't
cast Kang Ho-dong back then.

1018
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,657
I couldn't.

1019
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:03,226
Sir, did you cast Jae-suk back then?

1020
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,828
No.

1021
00:56:05,128 --> 00:56:08,164
But he was polite when he turned me down.

1022
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,968
Asking personally
can't always work, right?

1023
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,539
My son went to Seoul National University,

1024
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,908
and he started working at KBS recently.

1025
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,643
A producer for a national TV station.

1026
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,781
He was going to be a prosecutor,
but he became a producer.

1027
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,949
It's a good thing.

1028
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:27,951
What is a producer?

1029
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,120
Someone who commands a TV program.

1030
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:34,023
Leading all those cast and staff members,
earning their respect

1031
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:35,892
-and making a TV show--
-Ten stuffed pancakes.

1032
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,927
Five of the green tea flavor
and five plain.

1033
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:38,962
Seung-chan.

1034
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,230
Hey, Dad.

1035
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:42,532
Why are you here?

1036
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,900
To buy stuffed pancakes.

1037
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,569
Oh, I see!

1038
00:56:46,936 --> 00:56:50,840
You're getting them yourself instead of
asking a subordinate. Good for you!

1039
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,909
I'm the lowest ranked person.

1040
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,350
UMBRELLA BORROWER

1041
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:02,285
Dad, I have to go.

1042
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:04,687
Okay...

1043
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:06,322
That's your son?

1044
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,893
The SNU graduate who became a producer
instead of a prosecutor?

1045
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:12,495
Ah, yes.

1046
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,670
As the former Yeongdeungpo ward head,

1047
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:23,273
I'm here seeing how people are living.

1048
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,708
How is Yeongdeungpo these days?

1049
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:27,544
I live in Seodaemun.

1050
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:30,280
I see.

1051
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,619
Hello? This is Baek Seung-chan.

1052
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,022
The producer who lent me
the umbrella, right?

1053
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:42,425
You're calling me to tell me to return it?

1054
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:45,428
You haven't returned it yet?

1055
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:48,698
You should have returned it
by 9 a.m. today.

1056
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,735
Now they'll deduct a late fee
from my salary.

1057
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,272
I'll pay you the late fee next time.

1058
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,107
You'll pay me the late fee?

1059
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:00,777
Yes! Both the umbrella and the late fee!

1060
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,445
Well...

1061
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,281
Could I get it now?

1062
00:58:05,682 --> 00:58:06,649
What?

1063
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,553
No, I'm rehearsing for a performance.

1064
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,889
You'll come here?

1065
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,592
What's with this guy?

1066
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,528
Who is it? I'll handle him.

1067
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,898
Here's how to get here...

1068
00:58:21,965 --> 00:58:24,133
Okay. I'll be right there!

1069
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:37,780
You called so suddenly.
We were a bit surprised.

1070
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,182
Right?

1071
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,685
Is it okay? Is your CEO really busy?

1072
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,787
He's working out right now.

1073
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:45,688
Oh, really?

1074
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,191
I'll give you a tour of the company
while we wait for him.

1075
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,360
I'd like that, but I'm short on time.

1076
00:58:50,426 --> 00:58:53,029
There's a one-hour tour
and a twenty-minute tour.

1077
00:58:53,096 --> 00:58:55,765
I'll take you on the short tour.
This way, please.

1078
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:03,039
You really came all the way to Tanhyeon
just to get an umbrella?

1079
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,443
Well, to get the umbrella...

1080
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,279
And I have something to tell you.

1081
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,415
Go ahead. Let's hear it.

1082
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,753
But Cindy, who is this person?

1083
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,989
The producer of Two Days and One Night
you said bought me fish cake soup.

1084
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:22,625
That's not him.

1085
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,694
That was Producer Ra Jun-mo.

1086
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,130
Oh, he's my senior colleague.

1087
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,467
What's that?

1088
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:33,403
Stuffed pancakes.

1089
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,241
I'll take them.
It's the thought that counts.

1090
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:39,776
You can't have these.

1091
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:43,046
Someone sent me on an errand.

1092
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,748
These are for someone else.

1093
00:59:45,848 --> 00:59:48,351
What? It looks like you have a lot.

1094
00:59:49,352 --> 00:59:51,888
I bought the exact amount requested.

1095
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:53,923
Five of the green tea flavor
and five plain.

1096
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,763
I'll buy you some next time.

1097
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,166
Forget it. I was just saying...

1098
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,133
Want me to buy some?

1099
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,768
-I said forget it!
-Okay.

1100
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:08,771
Can you leave the room?

1101
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:14,277
Mr. Park has just finished working out.

1102
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,145
Really? Good.

1103
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,083
I'll connect you to him.

1104
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,551
Connect?

1105
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:25,154
He has a concert in Tokyo tomorrow.
He's in Japan right now.

1106
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:29,626
We always have video calls like this
when he's busy.

1107
01:00:30,994 --> 01:00:34,297
Before the meeting, let's watch this clip.

1108
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,299
Come on. Just put me through to him.

1109
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,513
You're short.

1110
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,081
You have no talent in entertainment shows.

1111
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,550
I don't speak Korean very well.

1112
01:00:54,617 --> 01:00:56,586
My Korean is worse.

1113
01:00:56,653 --> 01:01:01,290
But we learned that through this person,
anything is possible.

1114
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:13,870
We'd like you to be a new cast member
on Two Days and One Night.

1115
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:15,238
Why?

1116
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,207
Why should I join that show?

1117
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:19,609
Pardon?

1118
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,045
I understand that you guys need me.

1119
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,883
But why do I need that show?

1120
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:29,852
If we don't need each other,

1121
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,789
you'd just be using me.

1122
01:01:33,156 --> 01:01:35,958
I've been doing some research.

1123
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,563
There are many cases of top stars

1124
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,900
getting many more fans

1125
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:46,536
and becoming even more successful

1126
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,205
after appearing in a variety show.

1127
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:51,040
Keep going.

1128
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:54,077
In 1995, the show Super Sunday

1129
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,612
featured the segment "Scary Experience."

1130
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:59,882
It showed movie star Jeon Do-yeon

1131
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,086
screaming, falling and crying

1132
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:06,055
at the sight of ghosts.

1133
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:09,192
She looked very lovely and pretty.

1134
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,129
And Lee Hyo-ri was on Family Outing.

1135
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,765
Before, she was known as a sexy star,

1136
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,601
but she worked in the fields,
wore no makeup,

1137
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,237
and cooked on that show.

1138
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:22,905
Now she's like a girl-next-door.

1139
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,577
People of all ages loved how she was

1140
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:30,747
so easygoing and charming.

1141
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,815
Hey. What are you doing?

1142
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,589
Who's in there?

1143
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:48,765
Who are you?

1144
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,136
I just asked you a question! Who are you?

1145
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:56,572
He's a producer here to cast me.

1146
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,040
What's that?

1147
01:02:59,008 --> 01:03:01,410
Stuffed pancakes,
but I can't give them to you.

1148
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:09,886
A producer for what show?

1149
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:13,956
Producer Ra!

1150
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,092
-Jin-young!
-Long time no see!

1151
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,860
Yeah, for real. It's been a while.

1152
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:19,228
Did you see everything?

1153
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,197
Yes, it was awesome.

1154
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:22,465
Amazing, huh?

1155
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:24,167
Yeah, for sure. Really amazing.

1156
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,234
Did you see our artists?

1157
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,770
Bernard and Ji-min from K-Pop Star.

1158
01:03:27,837 --> 01:03:28,938
Not yet.

1159
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,808
You can have them.

1160
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:32,708
What?

1161
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:34,777
I'm only doing this for you.

1162
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,980
If you want them, I'll let them be on KBS.

1163
01:03:38,047 --> 01:03:40,183
Oh, I see. Thank you.

1164
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,752
And did you see GOT7?

1165
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,086
I will.

1166
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:47,590
I have a favor to ask
with regards to casting.

1167
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:49,525
Yeah. Who do you want? Tell me.

1168
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:52,261
I'm doing something new
for Two Days and One Night.

1169
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,462
I need Suzy...

1170
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:56,399
Jin-young.

1171
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:57,934
Jin-young?

1172
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,603
Sometimes this happens
when the signal is weak.

1173
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,805
Maybe I should turn it off and on again.

1174
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,173
Let's see...

1175
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:07,410
I didn't hear you. What did you say?

1176
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:12,915
We're doing something new,
and it has to have an impact.

1177
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:15,084
You should! That's how I like it.

1178
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:18,287
So the thing is,
Suzy's pretty busy, right?

1179
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,591
Jin-young...

1180
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,626
Jin-young?

1181
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:27,029
Can't I talk to him on the phone?

1182
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:29,532
He leaves his phone off before concerts.

1183
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,467
This is really urgent.

1184
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:38,140
-Hello?
-Producer Ra?

1185
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:39,942
It's been a long time.

1186
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,611
This is Byun of Byun Entertainment.

1187
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,246
Why would we ever speak on the phone?

1188
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,213
I know, right?

1189
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,382
I didn't think we would, but here we are.

1190
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:49,852
Your youngest producer is here to see me.

1191
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,220
What?

1192
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:53,589
Where are you?

1193
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:56,359
Okay.

1194
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:02,031
Something urgent just came up.

1195
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,700
When the buffering is done,

1196
01:05:04,967 --> 01:05:08,271
please ask him if we can cast Suzy.

1197
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:09,338
Sure.

1198
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:18,581
-Is he gone?
-Yes.

1199
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:22,151
He'll definitely be back. Be careful.

1200
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:28,491
That idiot. Why did he go there?

1201
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,661
You want her on Two Days and One Night?

1202
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,863
My Cindy?

1203
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,865
Yes, that's right.

1204
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,970
Newbie producer.

1205
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,473
Listen up now. We'll do some math.

1206
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:50,846
You want Cindy to take two weekends off
each month to film this show.

1207
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,116
But if we do a concert overseas,

1208
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,419
that's at least 10,000 people per concert

1209
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,554
and 170 million won in profits.

1210
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,523
If you include events
and commercial deals,

1211
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,825
we'd be losing at least 300 million won.

1212
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,860
Over the course of one season,

1213
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,398
we'd be losing at least 3.6 billion won.

1214
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,837
Incredible, right?

1215
01:06:15,504 --> 01:06:16,872
You have no answer.

1216
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,076
How could you bring us
such an impossible problem?

1217
01:06:20,209 --> 01:06:22,445
I imagine you still don't know much.

1218
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:26,916
Right. I didn't know.

1219
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,586
I've only been a producer for a few days.

1220
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:32,621
My senior told me this.

1221
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:35,224
A producer should be a bit sanmai,

1222
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,193
but I'm too nimai.

1223
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:43,165
You know what
nimai and sanmai mean, right?

1224
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,101
Yes, I do.

1225
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,803
So how about you drop this and get going?

1226
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:50,039
Cindy has to prepare for a performance.

1227
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:52,141
No, I still have time.

1228
01:06:54,777 --> 01:06:55,845
Go on.

1229
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:01,350
I may not know much, but...

1230
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,921
It's okay for a producer
to be a bit sanmai,

1231
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:08,758
but not too much.

1232
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:14,463
You should consider money and math
to a certain extent,

1233
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:19,935
but if you only think about that,
you could lose sight of your goal.

1234
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:21,404
Hold on.

1235
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:27,043
Are you saying I'm sanmai?

1236
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,614
No. Not exactly.

1237
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:35,584
Of course you should consider money

1238
01:07:36,018 --> 01:07:38,654
when finding an answer to a problem,

1239
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,590
but only thinking of money makes you seem

1240
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:44,326
like a materialistic merchant.

1241
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:47,897
That's the same thing!

1242
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:49,765
Who do you think you are?

1243
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,735
How dare you come and...

1244
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,737
Sanmai?

1245
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:00,643
Hey, Seung-chan.

1246
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:02,078
Producer Ra.

1247
01:08:02,611 --> 01:08:03,579
Let's go.

1248
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:07,917
I said let's go!

1249
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:09,085
Producer Ra.

1250
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,989
Did you send him?

1251
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:19,929
Geez. Is this your form of revenge?

1252
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:27,436
Revenge, my ass.
I don't even want to deal with you.

1253
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,472
I'm busy.

1254
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,708
I don't have time
to deal with just anyone.

1255
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,410
Let's go!

1256
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,947
Who said to go around
meeting weird people?

1257
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:40,349
If you do that again, you're dead meat!

1258
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,894
-Cindy.
-Manager.

1259
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,930
Is it him who bought me
rice rolls last time?

1260
01:08:54,997 --> 01:08:55,998
Yeah.

1261
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,268
Rice rolls?

1262
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:01,170
I'm going to check the stage, ma'am.

1263
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,281
What do you want for dinner?

1264
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,217
Whatever you want.

1265
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,619
You call yourself a producer?

1266
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,889
Do you have no opinion? What do you want?

1267
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:24,727
-Black bean noodles.
-Anything but that.

1268
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:26,762
I was up all night, so my stomach hurts.

1269
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,063
No flour-based foods.

1270
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:29,131
Kimchi stew.

1271
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:30,299
Are you blind?

1272
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,935
Can't you see I'm wearing a white shirt?

1273
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:35,437
Hamburgers?

1274
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,139
I said I have an upset stomach!

1275
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:41,277
I'll just have whatever you want.

1276
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:57,726
Can you drink?

1277
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,395
No, I can't.

1278
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,076
-My hands are tied.
-Please, help me out.

1279
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:15,311
There he is.

1280
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,513
Why haven't you called all day?

1281
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,117
You went to cast Suzy. What happened?

1282
01:10:22,184 --> 01:10:23,485
I don't know.

1283
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:27,423
Jin-young was on a video call
and was like...

1284
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:34,930
What are you doing?

1285
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,099
He did that for three minutes.
I couldn't even talk to him.

1286
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,034
What are you talking about?

1287
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:42,037
Anyway, I couldn't get her.

1288
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,741
Will Two Days and One Night be okay?

1289
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,043
Can we make it work, at this rate?

1290
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:51,413
So you want to send Choi Jae-won
of Vitamin to Two Days and One Night

1291
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,615
so that you can do Vitamin?

1292
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:53,682
Hey!

1293
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,551
Jun-mo, help me out.

1294
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,021
Help yourself
by warming up to the chief director.

1295
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,123
What more do I have to do?

1296
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:03,092
For the past six months,

1297
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,160
I've gone hiking with him
and played golf every weekend...

1298
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,663
I took his kid camping
and pitched the tent.

1299
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:10,733
I have muscles now. Look.

1300
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,167
Wow...

1301
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,204
Muscles from sucking up?

1302
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:16,138
Geez.

1303
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:19,642
The chief director is a bit out of line.

1304
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,610
You did all that stuff for him,

1305
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,212
so he should do something for you.

1306
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,647
Or at least give you a heads-up.

1307
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:27,149
Take a shot.

1308
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:32,154
You're seeing all sorts of stuff happen
in your first week.

1309
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,527
Drink it all.

1310
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:40,796
Who said you could sip it?

1311
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,066
Wipe it.

1312
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:19,702
I told him I can't have kimchi stew
because of my white shirt.

1313
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:20,602
Now look what happened.

1314
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:34,249
-Join us.
-Sit over here.

1315
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:48,764
Hey, my wife said it was okay!

1316
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,265
Get me on the show, okay?

1317
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,668
I tried, but they said no.

1318
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,602
Dang it.

1319
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:54,703
Next.

1320
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:17,826
03. ALL ABOUT CASTING
IT'S WHERE UNDERSTANDING BEGINS

1321
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:25,401
We're out of soju.

1322
01:13:25,667 --> 01:13:27,336
TITLE: UMBRELLA MAN
A MAN LENT ME HIS UMBRELLA

1323
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,172
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS TRYING TO MAKE
A MOVE ON ME.

1324
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,842
IT TURNED OUT
HE DIDN'T HAVE OTHER INTENTIONS.

1325
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,415
You pay for it.

1326
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,790
-Thank you very much!
-Thank you.

1327
01:14:08,343 --> 01:14:10,679
HE COULD HAVE BEEN SHY.
HE MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN YOU.

1328
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,682
IS THE UMBRELLA EXPENSIVE?
WHO KNOWS, HE MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A PRO.

1329
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,169
Sorry about yesterday. I'm home now.

1330
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:36,238
Come home when you see this.

1331
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:39,274
Delay? Forget delay.

1332
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:44,847
You're home?

1333
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:47,015
Why would you ring the bell?

1334
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:51,687
Goodness...

1335
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,357
I bought the stuffed pancakes.

1336
01:14:56,859 --> 01:14:59,795
Five of the green tea flavor
and five plain.

1337
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,864
Hey, you...

1338
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,808
I didn't cheat on her.

1339
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,812
Ye-jin has a friend from elementary school
named Ra Jun-mo.

1340
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:54,650
Ye-jin liked Jun-mo. She liked him.

1341
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:58,086
She says they're just friends,
but I can tell.

1342
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,856
When I asked her out on the weekend,
she said she had to meet Ra Jun-mo.

1343
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,491
When I asked her
to go see cherry blossoms,

1344
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:05,727
she said she'd go with Ra Jun-mo.

1345
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:08,530
He always came to get her
if she got drunk.

1346
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,766
It felt like I was dating a married woman.

1347
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:14,236
It's obvious that Ye-jin likes Jun-mo.

1348
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,505
It's just the two of them that don't know.
