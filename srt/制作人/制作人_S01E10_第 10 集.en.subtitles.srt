1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,250
There's this passage in a book I like.

2
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,853
"When someone truly wishes for something,

3
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,790
it will really come true."

4
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,162
I've always thought
that I couldn't make someone

5
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,631
like me just because I like them.

6
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:10,904
That's because love isn't based on effort.

7
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:15,075
But after hearing Cindy's song today,

8
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,477
this is what I thought of.

9
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,347
If you wish for something...

10
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,650
you must make an effort.

11
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,852
You must express yourself.

12
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,987
Then...

13
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,390
your true feelings...

14
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,026
can get through.

15
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,126
Do I just speak to it?

16
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:07,627
After pressing the button.

17
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:40,059
Hello?

18
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,595
Hi, Producer Tak. This is Seung-chan.

19
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,364
What are you doing?

20
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:46,132
I'm on my way home.

21
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,668
Oh. Where are you?

22
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,669
Where?

23
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:52,238
I'm at the road going toward
the apartment's side door.

24
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,874
Okay. I got it.

25
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,052
Your apartment is a model house,

26
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:12,525
so you didn't pay much
for the interior, right?

27
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,128
This is random.

28
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,896
Yes. That's right.

29
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,599
You should

30
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:22,035
put it up for lease.

31
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,037
What?

32
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,207
Why? Why would I do that?

33
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:32,612
Because I don't want you to move in there.

34
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,350
Why not?

35
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,686
Do I have to spell it out for you?

36
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:46,793
Just stay at my place.

37
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,696
I don't like it

38
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:53,866
that you're leaving.

39
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,766
Seung-chan.

40
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:29,569
Yes.

41
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:34,774
So you were around here, too.

42
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:35,675
Yes.

43
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:38,878
What's that?

44
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,885
It's not for you.

45
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,820
I didn't ask for it.

46
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,690
Seung-chan, is something going on?

47
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,059
You called and asked where I was.

48
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,036
Is that for me?

49
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:04,737
Goodness...

50
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,576
It's pretty.

51
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,613
But why are you giving this to me?

52
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,853
Someone gave it to me on my way here.

53
00:05:23,122 --> 00:05:24,190
Really?

54
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,693
I know you got it for free,

55
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,162
but the fact that you thought of me
is what's important.

56
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,569
Jun-mo thinks it's a hassle
to even receive free stuff.

57
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,005
Hey, that's not true.

58
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,574
I accept expensive stuff.

59
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,745
Let's finish
what we were talking about at home.

60
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:46,979
Let's go.

61
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,865
-I'm home.
-Hey.

62
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:08,935
Hey, son. Have some melon.

63
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,671
No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

64
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,584
He must have been yelled at
by that senior colleague.

65
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,653
What? What do you mean by that?

66
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,825
Oh, no. What will I do?

67
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:10,163
Producer Tak, you always say that

68
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,566
you're a tough woman.

69
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,304
But seeing you over these last two months,

70
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:20,506
I've come to the conclusion
that you're not tough.

71
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:27,280
I think you're actually just
excessively defensive of yourself.

72
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:34,520
You're actually a soft-hearted,
fragile, and warm person.

73
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,561
The loneliness you feel
caused by the imbalance

74
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,596
of your inner and outer selves

75
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,800
comes from your wanting someone who can

76
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,069
stay by your side and understand you.

77
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,673
Someone who just likes you,

78
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:58,644
who likes to see you smile,

79
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,315
and who wants to be by your side.

80
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,622
You may think I'm still young,

81
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,758
lacking, and clumsy.

82
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,364
But if you're okay with that...

83
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:26,739
If you're okay with my feelings for you,
I would like to be by your side.

84
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:33,479
Someone once told me that
it's easy to tell if I'm being sincere.

85
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,751
But you don't seem to see my true feelings

86
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,857
when everyone else can.

87
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,635
You were saying,
I should put my place up for lease?

88
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,070
What?

89
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,040
Yes, or even rent.

90
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,942
But I'm moving in less than a week.

91
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,376
Is it too sudden?

92
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:41,914
Just leave it empty
and find a real estate agency.

93
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,549
Should I look into it for you?

94
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,952
That's not what's important now.

95
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,887
Right. It isn't...

96
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:53,893
Then what?

97
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:55,828
What?

98
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:56,862
What is it?

99
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,067
It's just my opinion.

100
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,771
It hasn't been bad living with you.

101
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,872
Not bad?

102
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,008
No, it's been good.

103
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:10,876
Good?

104
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,245
Stop nitpicking.

105
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
It's been good.

106
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,015
Can't I even say that?

107
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:23,956
I cooked for you, I did the cleaning,
and even did your laundry sometimes.

108
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,759
So that was convenient for you, right?

109
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:27,860
Hey!

110
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,695
That's what this is!

111
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,498
Things were perfect for you,
but now that I'm leaving,

112
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,333
you're having second thoughts.

113
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,737
Yes, that's right! That's how it is.

114
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,739
It's really comfortable having you around.

115
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,177
You just don't want to hire
a housekeeper once I leave, right?

116
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,746
Jeez...

117
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,081
How did you know?

118
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:51,050
You're absolutely right!

119
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,752
Jun-mo!

120
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,621
That's the kind of guy
you keep pegging me as!

121
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:56,522
Forget it.

122
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,290
It's useless talking.

123
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,492
My thoughts exactly.

124
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,606
What a jerk.

125
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:20,813
She's so dense.

126
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:32,758
Seung-chan.

127
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,428
Let's go eat.
I'll pay for lunch as promised.

128
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,395
Yes.

129
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:38,798
I'll be in front of the elevator.

130
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:44,403
Hey, Seung-chan.

131
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,907
Did you organize all the files
I told you to?

132
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,583
Wait.

133
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,423
You always write a thesis
for every assignment.

134
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,392
When did you do all this?

135
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,828
That's incredible...

136
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,064
Seung-chan, you're really good
at this stuff.

137
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,869
This is needlessly high-quality work.

138
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,238
I'll be going to lunch then.

139
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,812
Producer Tak, what do you want to eat?

140
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:31,083
I want something really bold
and piping hot.

141
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:33,185
I'm really stressed out.

142
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,123
Then how about this?

143
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,795
Say something.

144
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,298
As a fellow guy,
why do you think Jun-mo would say that?

145
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:53,272
I honestly wondered at first.

146
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,442
"What did he mean by
telling me not to go?"

147
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,181
Isn't there a different meaning
behind him not wanting me to move out?

148
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,417
What do you think?

149
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,787
Any thoughts?

150
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:17,396
Producer Tak keeps asking me, as a guy,
what it meant when Jun-mo said

151
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,900
to put her place up for lease
and just live with him.

152
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,236
I think it's because he likes her.

153
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,138
But I didn't want to tell her that.

154
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:31,877
I really can't understand why Producer Tak
didn't know what it meant,

155
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,113
but I also thought
it was a relief that men

156
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,183
and women communicate differently.

157
00:13:40,686 --> 00:13:41,854
So basically...

158
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,858
you feel awkward about it.

159
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,693
About answering my question.

160
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,368
Even from another guy's point of view,

161
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,771
you think Jun-mo just said that to me

162
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:02,174
because I'm more comfortable
to have around than a maid.

163
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,109
That's what you're thinking.

164
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,846
But you can't bring yourself to tell me.

165
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,117
Okay.

166
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,855
I asked a very obvious question, didn't I?

167
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:31,503
I have a question too.

168
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,107
So are you not going to move out?

169
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:40,179
Hey, haven't you been listening to me?

170
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,182
We had a huge fight.

171
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,551
How could I live with him after that?

172
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,257
Wait.

173
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,726
Are you smiling now?

174
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,561
You're smiling?

175
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,664
I can't believe this.

176
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,699
Is this entertaining to you?

177
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:04,837
I've been going way too easy on you.

178
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,741
Stop smiling!

179
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:20,853
Do I have to wait much longer?

180
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,890
Looks like a bigger turnout than expected.

181
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,927
It's taking some time
to get things together.

182
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,368
But Cindy...

183
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:41,040
How about just letting
the CEO win this time?

184
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,610
-What?
-I heard from General Manager Kim

185
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,014
that the situation is exactly like
how it was with Yun-a.

186
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:53,819
I was a total newbie then,
so I had no idea what was going on.

187
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:01,226
Using you to promote Jinie like this...

188
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,764
That's like CEO Byun's preview.

189
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,034
The main feature will be a bloodbath.

190
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:12,104
General Manager Kim
was Yun-a's road manager then.

191
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:15,174
He still feels sorry for Yun-a.

192
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,344
Does General Manager Kim

193
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:20,946
know where Yun-a is?

194
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,850
He doesn't. Not at all.

195
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:27,386
There are just rumors.

196
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,423
That she went abroad,
became addicted to plastic surgery...

197
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:36,261
There are way too many rumors
floating around.

198
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,733
And none of them are good.

199
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:44,937
So Cindy...

200
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:48,707
Apologize to the CEO...

201
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,978
just this once.

202
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,448
-Hey.
-Yes?

203
00:16:57,082 --> 00:16:59,084
Go ask them how much longer it will take.

204
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,760
Yes. Okay.

205
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,940
Don't you think Cindy
is all over the place now?

206
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,577
She's on all sorts of shows these days,

207
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:27,613
so it's nice to have more things
to criticize her for.

208
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:34,253
I hear she has even more gigs next week.

209
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,257
Die Cindy, you always have
a lot of information.

210
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,892
Are you in the party?

211
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:40,959
Party?

212
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,328
Cindy's agency.

213
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,432
Her agency has been using her
to promote Jinie.

214
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:47,800
Yes.

215
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,035
How could they do that?

216
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,304
What?

217
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,044
What I meant was
that they should have done that sooner.

218
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:00,646
What took them this long?

219
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,316
Anyway, we're getting
a lot of members these days.

220
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,252
Our administrators
are planning a get-together.

221
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,688
Die Cindy, you'll come, right?

222
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:13,125
Wow...

223
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,062
Now the anti-fans want a meet-up.

224
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,807
IN USE BY THE TEAM
OF NEW PROGRAM STAR WARS

225
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,351
The rumors are crazy right now.

226
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,520
They say the new program is really good.

227
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,756
They say our show might get canceled.

228
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,026
In danger of being canceled
after four weeks...

229
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,932
Is it true that the new program
is the follow-up of our show?

230
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,735
What will we do now?

231
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,904
What do you mean?
We have to keep plugging away.

232
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,939
Nobody cares about our show.

233
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,207
What's with you all?

234
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,277
We still have 6.8% of the viewers.

235
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,014
Should we redo all the editing?

236
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,716
No need for all that.

237
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,090
Excuse me, but what time
will your meeting end?

238
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,792
Why? Who are you?

239
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:23,462
The youngest writer
for the Star Wars team.

240
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:25,330
This is our office.

241
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:28,233
What is she...

242
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,402
Let's talk outside.

243
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,604
We need this room free by 2:00 p.m.

244
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,339
-Let's talk about it.
-Gosh...

245
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,849
We need a complete overhaul.

246
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,485
Check the captions and music again.

247
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,522
And we need a great preview
to air right after Star Wars.

248
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:53,158
We'll need more help
for a complete overhaul.

249
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,329
How about we let
the youngest do the preview?

250
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,670
No way!

251
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,739
We can't trust him.
This is really important.

252
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:09,942
I'll do it.

253
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,276
You?

254
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,580
Yes. I'll do my best.

255
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,082
Everyone tries their best.
The question is how well you do it.

256
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,518
I'll do a good job.

257
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,552
Really?

258
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,254
Yes.

259
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,190
Fine then. You do it.

260
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,628
Oh, you got the preview.

261
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,300
Don't think it will be easy
because it's 30 seconds long.

262
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,336
People should watch that preview

263
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:41,173
and think, "Man! I had better
not miss that show!"

264
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,808
You have to make that happen.

265
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:46,411
Their sides should split.

266
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,947
Yes. Sidesplitting...

267
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,215
It should be moving.

268
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,721
What's most important is
to let them know when it airs.

269
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:02,261
So, it should make them really curious,
let them know what time it will air,

270
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:07,599
be moving and sidesplittingly funny,

271
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,404
and make them think,
"Man! I had better not miss it!"

272
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:16,475
That's the kind of impact
it should have on the viewers.

273
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,876
-Right.
-That's right.

274
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
How will you do all that?

275
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,782
You'll miss everything.

276
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,385
That's the common mistake
people make on previews.

277
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,554
They try to show all sorts of things
and don't hit the mark on any of them.

278
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,391
If you make a lame
and disorganized preview

279
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,259
while clearly mentioning
the time it will air,

280
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,294
people will think,

281
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:38,030
"I had better not watch that show,
not even accidentally."

282
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,466
That's the conclusion people come to.

283
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,435
I see... This...

284
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:47,439
-So, it has the reverse effect?
-You don't have to try so hard.

285
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:49,641
The seniors will probably fix it for you.

286
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:52,678
They just wanted the youngest member
to be productive instead of goofing off.

287
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,849
I've never goofed off,
not since I started here.

288
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,785
Despite what you may think,

289
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,721
you're just a surplus member
to the seniors.

290
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:04,356
You're totally useless.

291
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:05,691
Only useful for taking food orders.

292
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,360
You're like a food delivery app.

293
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:10,529
Just you wait and see

294
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,365
how great the preview will turn out.

295
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:17,703
It will make them really curious,
let them know what time it will air,

296
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:21,039
be moving and sidesplittingly funny
that it will make them think,

297
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,376
"Man! I had better not miss it!"

298
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,079
That's the kind of impact
it will have on the viewers.

299
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm going to make one like that!

300
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,279
What are you doing?

301
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,150
You're the one who has no business here.

302
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:06,251
What brings you here?

303
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,154
KBS DAYCARE

304
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,624
I just like kids.

305
00:23:12,758 --> 00:23:15,093
I wasn't going to go inside.

306
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,730
I was about to go back to the office.

307
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,867
Go ahead.

308
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,742
You need to move your arm.

309
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,279
You must not tell people

310
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,015
about that night.

311
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:41,686
I know how you love spreading rumors.

312
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,122
Me?

313
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,091
That's not true.

314
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:56,268
Let's meet for dinner.

315
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,004
We should at least discuss

316
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:01,807
what happened that night.

317
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,810
Dinner tonight?

318
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:07,879
You don't want to?

319
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:10,415
It's not that. Of course I want to.

320
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:16,121
I'll text you the time and location.

321
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,324
Delete the text as soon as you get it.

322
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,164
You had something on your face.

323
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,545
This is a person's hand.

324
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,782
This looks like someone's forearm.

325
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,083
Did someone make a mistake?

326
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,888
But there are way
too many copies for that.

327
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,391
Yang-mi will freak out if she sees this.

328
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,160
Totally...

329
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:11,276
It's so cold...

330
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:23,855
What are you doing?

331
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:30,996
Looks like Seung-chan
is trying to win an Oscar.

332
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,465
I think he pulled an all-nighter.

333
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,301
Look. He's wearing the same clothes.

334
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:55,787
Are you on a picnic?

335
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,859
I just started eating.

336
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:01,860
Play it.

337
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:06,231
It's still incomplete, so I can't.

338
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,133
Just play it.

339
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:10,101
Who are you? Steven Spielberg?

340
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,469
Give me a break.

341
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,844
You're going to redo it, right?

342
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,914
It's no good?

343
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,618
You know that I'm not the kind who takes
responsibility for others, right?

344
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,786
Yes.

345
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:30,722
I mean, no.

346
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:37,963
Maybe you made this thinking
that your seniors would fix it for you.

347
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,400
But I'm going to air
exactly what you make.

348
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:46,137
If our show tanks,
it's because your preview was awful.

349
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,205
Okay?

350
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,751
And why isn't Cindy in the preview?

351
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,188
What? She is.

352
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,291
There's a two-shot,
and she's in the beginning.

353
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:08,259
I didn't see her.

354
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,028
She didn't stand out at all.

355
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,663
She didn't pop.

356
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:15,033
Why do parents always take better photos

357
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,137
of their children
than professional photographers?

358
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,472
It's the love.

359
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:24,509
A producer has to love their cast members.

360
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,277
That's how you get good footage.

361
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,714
What do you think Cindy's charm is?

362
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,483
Excuse me?

363
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,386
Cindy's charm is...

364
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:38,890
She's good at singing?

365
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:39,924
See?

366
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,494
How can you make a preview
when you can't see

367
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,062
the charm in your own cast member?

368
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,499
You think others will see
what you can't see?

369
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,423
Excuse me. Is this...

370
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,590
Are you Die Cindy?

371
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,430
Nice to meet you.

372
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,932
But why are you all covered up?

373
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,069
Anti-fans are still fans.

374
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,471
No need to be embarrassed about it.

375
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,007
I have a steady job. You all do too.

376
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,244
I sell flowers wholesale at Yangjae.

377
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:35,947
I'm a high school student living in Ilsan.

378
00:28:36,114 --> 00:28:37,949
I'm a judicial apprentice.

379
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:42,620
Oh, hello.

380
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:46,658
I don't have a business card.

381
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,693
You must be job hunting.

382
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,097
One person in the club,
a job hunter like you,

383
00:28:52,263 --> 00:28:54,332
passed the government official exam.

384
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,535
I don't think you have to worry.
I'm sure things will work out.

385
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,905
Where is Who Is Cindy?

386
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,474
He isn't the type to be late.

387
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,678
So how did you all become Cindy anti-fans?

388
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,481
I'm a fan of Suzy.

389
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:14,319
But Cindy kept stealing
every commercial that Suzy did.

390
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,422
-I felt bad.
-I used to be a huge fan of Cindy.

391
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:20,091
But I ran into her
at a restaurant a long time ago.

392
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,093
I asked her to take a photo with me,

393
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,928
but she refused,
saying she had no makeup on.

394
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,431
But she looked like she had put
a whole tube of BB cream on her face.

395
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,666
She turned me down
in front of all those people.

396
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:30,168
So I became an anti-fan.

397
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:33,872
I'm sorry.

398
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:36,708
Let's take the photo now.

399
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:42,313
I'll take the photo,
since I'm really wearing makeup.

400
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,681
Take it.

401
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,150
Yes.

402
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,753
One, two...

403
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:54,325
And how is it possible to put
a whole tube of BB cream on their face?

404
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,994
You've probably used some before too.

405
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,129
Even when you squeeze a tiny bit
there are always leftovers.

406
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,769
And Suzy stole more commercials
from me than I took from her!

407
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,906
Oh! And don't you know
Suzy's new program put my show

408
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,674
Two Days and One Night on break?

409
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:10,909
Isn't that good...

410
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:12,544
I guess not.

411
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:18,917
And you. You're very academic.
Why are you in an anti-fan club?

412
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,085
I'm sorry.

413
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,455
I get stressed out from all the studying.

414
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,926
I didn't do anything illegal.
It was all in moderation.

415
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,328
Nothing I wrote
would be considered slander.

416
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:32,030
But your family is rich.

417
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,464
Paying some fines wouldn't hurt you.

418
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,335
-Can I get an autograph?
-Get one from Suzy!

419
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,538
But I've never seen
a celebrity in person before!

420
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,810
Why isn't Who Is Cindy here?

421
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,985
There he is.

422
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,929
-Why did he just leave?
-I don't know.

423
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,031
He said he was moved to tears
and felt so relieved

424
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,835
every time we talked trash about Cindy.

425
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:12,904
Excuse me. Whoever wants to leave can go.

426
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:17,775
You said you were getting together today
to talk about how to ruin Cindy.

427
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,277
So hurry and tell me.

428
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,413
If I avoid just that,
I won't go down, right?

429
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,883
I'm very quick to catch on.

430
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,217
Especially when it comes to couples.

431
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,454
I'm very good at telling
when someone likes a person.

432
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:40,391
I'm also great at getting people together.

433
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,295
I set up four couples
and they eventually tied the knot.

434
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,165
Two did get divorced, but the point is...

435
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,467
that's how quick I am
when it comes to catching on.

436
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,837
It looks like Seung-chan likes someone.

437
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,008
He likes Cindy.

438
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:02,680
This happens to some people when
they first start working at a TV station.

439
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:06,918
You could end up liking a celebrity
after seeing them frequently.

440
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,420
But he's getting in over his head!

441
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:13,324
He won't get anywhere with Cindy!

442
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:18,663
Let's say I did a show with Won Bin

443
00:33:18,763 --> 00:33:20,565
and seriously ended up
liking him as a man.

444
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:21,833
Isn't it like that?

445
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,368
Oh, right. Won Bin got married.

446
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,137
Anyway, that's what it's like.

447
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,887
Come up to the roof.

448
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,198
How about a toast,
Producer Baek Seung-chan?

449
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,968
To your first preview. Congratulations.

450
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:58,936
Thank you.

451
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,373
I heard you pulled an all-nighter.

452
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,474
Yes.

453
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,911
It's my first time, so I'm still unsure.

454
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,247
We have 28 hours of raw footage.

455
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:15,720
Finding the funniest 30 seconds
from it isn't as easy as I thought.

456
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,158
What is it?

457
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,563
Seung-chan, I realized that

458
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,932
I've only been talking about
myself to you.

459
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,635
And I'm kind of sorry about that.

460
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,705
You did say you like to listen,

461
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:38,476
but you must have things
you want to say too.

462
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,646
You have something to say, right?

463
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,050
Go ahead. I'll hear you out.

464
00:34:52,056 --> 00:34:54,025
Should I take a guess?

465
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:57,829
Excuse me?

466
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,267
You like someone.

467
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:04,902
So you're agonizing over it.

468
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,440
How did you know?

469
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,076
Hey, don't be so surprised.

470
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,912
You pick up on things quickly
after working in TV.

471
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,380
You thought I wouldn't know?

472
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,515
It's just that...

473
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,985
I'm just very startled that you knew.

474
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,453
How long has it been?

475
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:24,188
Sorry?

476
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,924
When did this one-sided crush start?

477
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,661
It's been a while.

478
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,632
It wasn't like that at all at first.

479
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,535
But I gradually started to...

480
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,905
Why is it another crush?

481
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,176
I've had a crush before.
It becomes a habit.

482
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,212
It's important for a person
to love someone,

483
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,747
but it's important to be loved, too.

484
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,416
Getting your hopes up
and having them crushed...

485
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,887
It's really tiring.

486
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,857
It's different this time.

487
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:06,430
I won't say nothing and keep it to myself
like a fool this time.

488
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:11,869
Seung-chan,
dating someone at the broadcast station...

489
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,972
You know how gossipy this place is.

490
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:19,777
If word ever got out,
it would become a scandal.

491
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,046
I'll take care of all that.

492
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:23,781
I'll take responsibility until the end.

493
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,684
Yes, I like that mindset.

494
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:31,656
Older guys who have weathered a lot
don't think that way at all.

495
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,824
I'll help you.

496
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:35,159
Though I don't know if I can.

497
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,429
Excuse me?

498
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:42,633
Does Cindy know?

499
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,835
That you like her this much?

500
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,003
Producer Tak...

501
00:36:46,103 --> 00:36:47,438
It's okay.

502
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,707
It's...

503
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,076
Okay!

504
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,379
Nobody is here listening.
I won't mention her name.

505
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,082
How about we just call her S?

506
00:36:58,449 --> 00:36:59,650
No, Cindy starts with C.

507
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:02,053
But isn't C a bit too obvious?

508
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:03,487
It's not like that.

509
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,657
Hey, don't worry.

510
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,759
I won't tell anyone. Really.

511
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,195
Tell me any time you need advice.

512
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,763
I'll hear you out.

513
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:18,202
Producer Tak, it's not like that.

514
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,606
You had better not
clumsily confess to her.

515
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,913
This is Cindy we're talking about.
She's a star.

516
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,116
She probably has no idea how you feel.

517
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:34,285
Not a clue.

518
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:39,724
So what I'm saying is,
she's not ready yet.

519
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,564
People who have crushes sometimes make

520
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:50,101
the mistake of blurting out
their feelings too soon.

521
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,770
Love needs a preview, too.

522
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,207
"I'm going to tell you my feelings soon.

523
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,875
I'll be approaching you soon."

524
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,645
Give the other person a chance to prepare.

525
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,313
They could get excited,

526
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,449
or put their guard up
if they're not into you.

527
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:09,220
A preview?

528
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,489
Look at me.

529
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,125
I got drunk and blurted out my feelings,

530
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,328
and now things are weird
between me and Jun-mo.

531
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:20,231
I'm still feeling the aftermath.

532
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,936
Previews aren't just important for TV.

533
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,938
They're important in real life too.

534
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,911
Let's go back in.
You need to get back to work.

535
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:34,979
Wait...

536
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:37,815
What kind of preview would be good?

537
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:43,254
What kind of preview...

538
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,358
would you want?

539
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,959
You had better not tell this to anyone.

540
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,795
I must have been crazy that night.

541
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,198
Yes. It's shocking.

542
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:30,201
If you wanted to outdo me,
you would have to date Ye-jin.

543
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,236
Only that would be
more shocking than this.

544
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,504
Yes.

545
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:36,741
So how did it happen?

546
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,678
You always say how much you hate Yang-mi.

547
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,914
She didn't come to work
for a few days last week.

548
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,750
That was the problem.

549
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,051
I reprimanded her every day,

550
00:39:47,651 --> 00:39:50,087
and it felt a bit empty
when she wasn't around.

551
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:52,323
Maybe I love to hate her.

552
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,498
I shouldn't get my emotions mixed up.

553
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,500
I feel so uncomfortable now.

554
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,844
A mosquito!

555
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,212
A mosquito?

556
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:20,651
Where? Where's the mosquito?

557
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,587
It flew that way. Where did it go?

558
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,290
It bit me!

559
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,324
You got bitten?

560
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:29,493
Dang...

561
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:33,798
Put this over your head and go to sleep.

562
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:34,965
I'm going to catch it.

563
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,403
Did you get it?

564
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,806
Just stay still. Go to sleep.

565
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:48,946
-Did you get it?
-Dang it...

566
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,282
I did, but it's not this one.

567
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:52,950
Why not?

568
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,552
You said you got bitten.

569
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,221
But this one wasn't bloody.

570
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,523
There must be another one in here.

571
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,760
How did they get in here?

572
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:03,828
Hey, Jun-mo.

573
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,964
Remember to fix that window screen, okay?

574
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:10,468
Quit running your mouth and go to sleep.

575
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:14,839
Jun-mo.

576
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:16,307
What?

577
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,810
I'm going to move out.

578
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:27,751
So in the end...

579
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:29,987
you're leaving?

580
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:33,624
You want me to stay here and cook for you?

581
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:36,994
Do you really think that's what I meant?

582
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,333
You've been around me forever,
but you don't know me?

583
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:48,372
Why have we been
around each other for so long?

584
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:54,545
The problem is, we have been
around each other for too long.

585
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,617
That's why I saw you
as a friend on some days

586
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,219
and as a man on other days.

587
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:09,393
So we shouldn't try to solve
this problem when we're together.

588
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,796
We could both get confused.

589
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:20,237
Do we hate the idea of not seeing
a familiar person anymore?

590
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,208
Or do we like each other
as a man and a woman?

591
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,744
I want to know the answer to that.

592
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,484
A good preview?

593
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,722
It should be honest.

594
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:44,795
One that gets you excited is nice and all,
and a lot of people do that.

595
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,433
So that's why I prefer an honest preview.

596
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:52,336
Honest and composed.

597
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:36,780
Like spotting a quiet,
solitary burning candle

598
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:41,051
amidst a bunch of flashing neon signs.

599
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,591
He got it after all.

600
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,727
Oh no.

601
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,298
This is bad.
It will leave a stain on the wall.

602
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:29,199
Gosh...

603
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,408
Goodness. Oh, no.

604
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,076
It's not coming off.

605
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:42,246
Gosh...

606
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:06,103
What time is it?

607
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,605
Almost 12:00 p.m. Time for lunch.

608
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:10,140
Did you pull an all-nighter?

609
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:12,509
Yes.

610
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:14,445
I guess it's time then.

611
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,383
Time? For what?

612
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,653
You'll probably start seeing things.

613
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,123
You'll add captions and background music
to everything in your life.

614
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,426
They call it "first edit syndrome."

615
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,063
It's a stepping stone
to becoming a real producer,

616
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,164
so don't be too surprised.

617
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:48,846
What should we go eat?

618
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:50,814
What would you like?

619
00:45:51,715 --> 00:45:52,883
What should we get?

620
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,624
It's time to decide.

621
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:02,960
The inevitable choice.

622
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,028
It's unavoidable.

623
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,037
Bean paste stew.

624
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:17,407
Bulgogi.

625
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,145
Noodles in bean soup.

626
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,815
The biggest dilemma in human history.

627
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,921
What will we have for lunch today?

628
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:39,062
-Something hot, since it's hot outside?
-Sure.

629
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,972
What do you all want to drink?

630
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,241
I want grapefruit juice.

631
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:52,810
Me, too.

632
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,578
I want an iced Americano.

633
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:57,080
Go sit down.

634
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:00,951
What...

635
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,487
What are you doing?

636
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,023
Forget it. The youngest shouldn't pay.

637
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:07,791
That's my point card.

638
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,827
I want the points.

639
00:47:12,262 --> 00:47:13,297
Oh, okay.

640
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,065
I have a point card, too...

641
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,633
Okay, fine. I'll put it on yours.

642
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:22,239
But Da-jeong, what's with you?

643
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,409
I heard you get hot easily, but
you're wearing this in this hot weather.

644
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:27,211
I do get hot easily,

645
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,080
but you kept complaining about my clothes.

646
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:31,982
I talked to her.

647
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,751
But you didn't have to go this far...

648
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,253
It's hot.

649
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,488
We aren't inside the office so it's okay.

650
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,791
Oh, I see.

651
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,013
Da-jeong, just wear it
if you're not that hot.

652
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,415
But I'm hot.

653
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,619
Then go sit down.

654
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,254
Why are you standing here?

655
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,321
Go!

656
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,023
Okay then.

657
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,526
Go.

658
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,462
Please add the points.

659
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,098
It really is hot.

660
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,536
What is this?

661
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:29,806
That's the script for the preview.

662
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,643
They're going for something
a bit different.

663
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:34,845
These are terrible lines.

664
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:37,080
Are these the actual lines?

665
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,283
Who wrote this?

666
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:41,518
The umbrella producer.

667
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:48,358
Is there anything he's good at?

668
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:52,329
He's not perceptive
and has a poor sense of judgment.

669
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:57,200
His lines for the preview are weird too.

670
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:09,813
What is it?

671
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:14,751
Want me to talk to them?

672
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,486
To change the script?

673
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:21,191
No. One or two changes won't help.

674
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:24,895
Then what should I do?

675
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,664
There's nothing we can do now.

676
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:30,334
Just go.

677
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,003
Are you sure?

678
00:49:35,572 --> 00:49:36,440
About what?

679
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:40,243
You want me to go?

680
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:43,213
Are you kidding me?

681
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,304
Hello.

682
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,241
You should call in advance next time.

683
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,709
Please don't do this again.

684
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,444
Yes, okay. This way, please.

685
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,349
We happened to have free time right now.

686
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,618
But you really shouldn't do this again.

687
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:23,820
Okay.

688
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,723
We came up with the concept so abruptly...

689
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:27,758
This way...

690
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:30,127
You know Cindy is very busy, right?

691
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,364
Would you like something to drink?

692
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:36,333
That's okay.

693
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,670
PREVIEW SCRIPT

694
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,506
So, Producer.

695
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:44,741
Look here.

696
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,078
Did you write this script?

697
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,546
Yes.

698
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,817
If you want Cindy to say these lines--

699
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:54,918
They're no good?

700
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,320
You should have not one, not two,

701
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,924
but at least three versions
for her to choose from--

702
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,726
-Hey.
-Yes?

703
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:03,860
Drop it.

704
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,999
If it's okay with you...

705
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,568
Then it's okay.

706
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,770
Can you get me some tea?

707
00:51:13,937 --> 00:51:15,138
You said you didn't want a drink.

708
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,308
What kind of tea?

709
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,277
Medicinal herb tea.

710
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,617
Do they sell that nearby?

711
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,054
I'm sure they do.

712
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,330
So what do I do?

713
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,400
Oh, so...

714
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:49,506
The lines in the script were actual
comments said during our meeting

715
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,174
that I restructured.

716
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,946
Producers say this stuff during meetings?

717
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,147
Yes.

718
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,717
Then the people
who said this should record it.

719
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:01,618
Why me?

720
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:06,022
The purpose of the preview
is to draw in viewers,

721
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:12,062
so the most loved people
on our show should appear in it.

722
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,463
Loved?

723
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:17,400
Yes.

724
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,238
I liked that comment just now.

725
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,773
Because it's true.

726
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:31,882
But for someone who's loved,

727
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:36,119
this line is so lame.

728
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,687
Action!

729
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:39,923
"The rumors are crazy.

730
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,259
They say the new program is really good."

731
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,895
"They say our show might get canceled."

732
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,730
"In danger of cancellation
after five weeks..."

733
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,666
"Things are a disaster on the Internet.

734
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:51,835
There's no reaction. Not even badmouthing.

735
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:54,171
We're not even ranked
on the search engines."

736
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:55,605
"But it's too early to give up.

737
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,041
We still have 6.8% of the viewers."

738
00:52:58,108 --> 00:53:01,144
"What about the 93.2% who don't watch us?"

739
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,380
"Are we going to disappear like this?

740
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,348
Or will we unleash
our final fighting spirit?

741
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:07,350
It's barely even started.

742
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,652
The real and wild variety show,

743
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:09,986
Two Days and One Night Season 5!

744
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,394
Please just watch it once."

745
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:33,810
-Good work.
-Good work.

746
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,681
Producer, did we have to say all that?

747
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,182
It made us seem so lame.

748
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,584
What? I thought it was funny.

749
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,651
I like stuff like this.

750
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,087
"Please just watch it once."
What was that?

751
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,089
It had better get a good reaction.

752
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,824
I'll be praying that it does.

753
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,461
Cindy. Can I post this photo I took
on my social media account?

754
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,463
What is it? Let me see.

755
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,533
Come on. I look weird.

756
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,301
Only making yourself look good again?

757
00:53:58,368 --> 00:53:59,736
You look fine.

758
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:01,204
Producer, doesn't she look pretty?

759
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,408
Cindy is naturally pretty,
so she looks pretty to me.

760
00:54:05,709 --> 00:54:06,776
See?

761
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:09,846
But...

762
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:14,084
It doesn't make her look as good as usual.

763
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:18,888
Rather than photographing Cindy
from this angle,

764
00:54:19,189 --> 00:54:21,691
like most girls usually do,

765
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,996
her left side view looks much better.

766
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,564
To get this angle,

767
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,433
you should photograph her from the right

768
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:33,203
to really express Cindy's charm.

769
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:37,340
Are you the great photographer
Kim Jung-man?

770
00:54:38,908 --> 00:54:39,776
What else?

771
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:42,212
Excuse me?

772
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:45,282
What else makes me look pretty?

773
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:49,953
Should we be here right now?

774
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:52,455
Seriously, this is very sweet.

775
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,824
Well...

776
00:54:55,258 --> 00:55:00,230
I looked at your face all night
as I was making the preview.

777
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,234
To find your charm
and what part of you I should accent.

778
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,002
Producer, what about me?

779
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,505
-I didn't see your footage.
-What about me?

780
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:10,740
Didn't look at me, either?

781
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,442
Anyway, after viewing the footage,

782
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:18,481
I felt that you looked a lot prettier
when the main camera isn't running

783
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,885
and when you're not looking in the mirror.

784
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:25,689
Like right now.

785
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,559
She's blushing!

786
00:55:29,626 --> 00:55:31,328
She's embarrassed.

787
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,063
Oh, stop it.

788
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,032
I don't have any ulterior motives.

789
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,435
It's just my analysis as a producer.

790
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:40,236
Yes, well...

791
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,572
Thank you.

792
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:49,245
Well then, good work today.

793
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,647
-See you again.
-Goodbye.

794
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:00,757
I guess they don't sell
medicinal herb tea nearby.

795
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,192
He's late.

796
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,330
-Cindy.
-Yes?

797
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:12,869
I'm sorry about
what I said to you last time

798
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,438
at your house.

799
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,808
You already apologized.

800
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,477
Forget it.

801
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,079
No, I...

802
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,752
I found out that
I misunderstood many things.

803
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,756
I want to sincerely apologize.

804
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:35,058
I'm sorry.

805
00:56:39,629 --> 00:56:42,532
Okay. I got it.

806
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:53,910
Cindy, I managed to find it.

807
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,046
I ran so you could still drink it hot.

808
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,516
You didn't have to run.

809
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,018
What?

810
00:57:02,485 --> 00:57:03,353
Nothing.

811
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,359
Hello.

812
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:10,827
Hello.

813
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,830
What are you guys doing here?

814
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:15,031
Hello, Producer.

815
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,768
Oh, right. Cindy.

816
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,004
I was going to call you.

817
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,572
Last time,

818
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:28,278
when you thanked me on TV,
your fans went nuts.

819
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:29,813
They sent me candy.

820
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,148
Yes.

821
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:37,887
Oh, right. The thing is...

822
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,291
At the end of your speech...

823
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,527
The person you thanked
for being your umbrella?

824
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,864
Who was that?

825
00:57:58,441 --> 00:57:59,576
Someone I know.

826
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:03,146
So there is someone like that...

827
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,352
What brings you guys here today?

828
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:11,588
We had dubbing to do
for the Two Days and One Night preview.

829
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:14,090
The cast members did the preview lines?

830
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,558
You don't normally do that.

831
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,361
I wanted to make it special this time.

832
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,131
Special...

833
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:28,004
This is the concept for this preview.

834
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:30,240
Yes. I'm sure it is.

835
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:39,215
I'll be going now. I have another gig.

836
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:41,684
Oh, Cindy.

837
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,153
I'm moving in two days.

838
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,289
It's not a big place,

839
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,224
but I'll invite you
to the housewarming party.

840
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,659
Try to come if you have time.

841
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:54,531
Okay. If I have free time.

842
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,034
Goodbye.

843
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,271
-Cindy, I'm a fan.
-I'm a fan.

844
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:02,572
-I'm sorry.
-Can I get an autograph?

845
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,474
-Can I get an autograph?
-I'm sorry.

846
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,277
-I'm a fan.
-Can I get a photo?

847
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,880
Hey! You're so obvious.

848
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,553
Producer Tak, I know what you're thinking,
and it's really not like that.

849
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,223
Hey! It's okay!

850
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:23,059
Love isn't a crime. And neither is youth.

851
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:25,929
I know you wanted to see her badly.

852
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:27,931
Why are you being like this
in front of me?

853
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,367
Producer Tak.

854
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:38,975
I think Cindy has
that umbrella guy in her heart.

855
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,078
What will you do?

856
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,183
Producer Tak, the person I like

857
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:50,153
is not Cindy.

858
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,187
It's not like that.

859
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,556
No? It's not?

860
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,359
Then who is it?

861
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:03,032
Who is it? Who do you like?

862
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,137
I haven't shown her a preview yet.

863
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:10,106
So I can't tell you.

864
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:11,608
Come on!

865
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:14,677
You showing her the preview
has nothing to do with telling me.

866
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,183
Forget it.

867
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,419
I thought we were really close,

868
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:25,388
and I told you
all my embarrassing secrets,

869
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,756
but I guess you don't feel that way.

870
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:29,959
No. It's not like that.

871
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:38,167
Producer Tak is really great.

872
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:41,571
But I think her flaw is that

873
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,807
she's not too perceptive.

874
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,844
But her bigger flaw is that

875
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:54,817
she thinks she's really quick to catch on.

876
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,788
That's what she thinks of herself.

877
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,293
I told you.

878
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,529
I caught Seung-chan in the act.

879
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,097
But poor guy...

880
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,867
I can tell Cindy likes another guy.

881
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,404
I wish I didn't notice these things!

882
01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:18,775
Someone who's dense
wouldn't notice things like this.

883
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,777
But I can see right through them.

884
01:01:21,310 --> 01:01:22,612
It's so tiring!

885
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:30,953
Cindy, you know that

886
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:37,393
I'm not the kind of person
to bring up stuff from the past, right?

887
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:45,702
In your thank-you speech on Music Bank,

888
01:01:46,736 --> 01:01:49,572
you thanked someone
who became your umbrella

889
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,375
when you were standing in the rain.

890
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,447
Yes, what about it?

891
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:02,485
I thought you were talking about me.

892
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:16,232
I thought, "Cindy cares about me,
even though she doesn't express it."

893
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:20,570
To be honest, I was touched.

894
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,539
It finally felt

895
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,010
rewarding to be your manager.

896
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,581
Hurry up and get to the point.

897
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:33,616
Is it...

898
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,853
him?

899
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,522
The umbrella producer?

900
01:02:41,824 --> 01:02:42,792
It's him.

901
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,194
Isn't it?

902
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,500
That guy kept bugging you
over an umbrella.

903
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,568
When has he ever been an umbrella to you?

904
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:57,173
I've held an umbrella over you
hundreds of times more than he has.

905
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:02,779
I'm upset with you...

906
01:03:04,313 --> 01:03:05,381
Cindy.

907
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,222
Hey, user Who Is Cindy.

908
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,390
Yes.

909
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,634
Drive quietly, Who Is Cindy.

910
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:47,590
I'm sorry for not showing up that day.

911
01:03:52,395 --> 01:03:53,729
Something came up...

912
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,865
But, I'm sorry.

913
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,368
Even when you throw out chewed gum,

914
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:01,971
you should have the courtesy
to wrap it in paper.

915
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:06,843
When you turn down someone
who's looking forward to seeing you,

916
01:04:08,644 --> 01:04:12,048
you should have the courtesy
to at least text her.

917
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,194
Adios...

918
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:29,599
amigo.

919
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,755
Is this the last breakfast
I'll be having here?

920
01:04:54,156 --> 01:04:55,191
Visit from time to time.

921
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:59,695
I figure you will,
even if I didn't say that.

922
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,700
Ye-jin has experienced poverty
since her youth,

923
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,970
so she's obsessive when it comes to
having her own home.

924
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,006
But not me.

925
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,508
Home is where you lay your head.

926
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:16,012
I don't need to pay for or own a house.

927
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,314
What are you trying to say?

928
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:22,051
I get carsick if I ride in a car
for over 30 minutes.

929
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,754
I can't commute to school
from Gyeonggi-do.

930
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,555
What do you want me to do?

931
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:31,727
Why not just put the place up
for lease and live here?

932
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:36,232
Hey...

933
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:39,335
Or put it up for rent.

934
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:44,674
I suggested that to your sister,
but she said no.

935
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,808
She must be insane!

936
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:49,378
Unless you want to live in a study room,
you had better drop this.

937
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,283
Man, this place is perfect.

938
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,220
Other older sisters
meet guys and get married.

939
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:00,356
Just my luck...

940
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,130
CINDY

941
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:17,740
JINIE & CINDY

942
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,676
Wait, why is this...

943
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:22,912
How did this happen?

944
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,880
Wasn't this an event for Cindy alone?

945
01:06:24,947 --> 01:06:26,215
Did you not hear?

946
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:28,985
We heard from your agency.

947
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,221
They requested
that Cindy's guarantee be lowered

948
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:36,158
and for Jinie to come along as an add-on.

949
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:43,399
You got the order wrong.

950
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:46,802
The add-on shouldn't be written first,
don't you think?

951
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:52,008
Please put this up again.

952
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,012
Hey, Cindy.

953
01:06:56,612 --> 01:06:57,947
Hello, Cindy.

954
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:02,151
Get me a chair.

955
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:03,352
Okay.

956
01:07:12,828 --> 01:07:15,598
Not in front of me.
In front of the mirror.

957
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:30,279
Over here.

958
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:37,253
Start.

959
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:42,358
Cindy, why are you being childish
in front of Jinie?

960
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,660
Mom.

961
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,664
If she stayed in my spot,

962
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,300
she would have to get
her makeup done again.

963
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:53,235
Because I would make her cry.

964
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,513
OUR CINDY IS REALLY PRETTY!

965
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,927
You look pretty.

966
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,396
Look that way.

967
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,800
Cindy is being nice to Jinie.

968
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,005
She's one tough cookie.

969
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:34,009
I've been too easy on her.

970
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:36,512
FAN SIGN EVENT WITH CINDY

971
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,947
Thank you.

972
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,518
Hello...

973
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:44,120
Hello.

974
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,689
What's your name?

975
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,593
I love that you're on TV
so often these days.

976
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:51,594
Right?

977
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:55,931
I told my CEO
I wanted to see my fans up close,

978
01:08:55,998 --> 01:08:58,334
and she went a bit overboard.

979
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:01,337
She agrees to every offer I get.

980
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:05,441
I even heard that she might approve

981
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,077
some loan company commercial.

982
01:09:08,477 --> 01:09:09,645
-No!
-No.

983
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:11,313
Don't! No!

984
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,648
-No!
-No!

985
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,216
Please don't.

986
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:15,584
She wouldn't do that.

987
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:20,489
But I have to follow my CEO's orders.

988
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:22,491
It's in my contract.

989
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,995
Don't hate me
even if I'm in a loan company ad.

990
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:27,696
CINDY, YOUR FAN IS HERE

991
01:09:28,597 --> 01:09:31,834
Cindy, I'm a lawyer
at Chunggyeong Law Firm.

992
01:09:31,901 --> 01:09:33,068
My name is Seo Kyung-seok.

993
01:09:33,602 --> 01:09:35,771
If it's an unfair contract,

994
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,641
you can file to have
each clause nullified.

995
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:41,243
I will provide my services for free.

996
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:47,516
Wow, my fans are the best.

997
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:49,351
Thank you.

998
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:53,255
But my CEO surely wouldn't do that.

999
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,991
I'll contact you if something happens.

1000
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,092
I'd like your business card.

1001
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:09,338
Shouldn't we have tied these together?

1002
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,540
Goodness! Hello!

1003
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:15,177
Hello, ma'am.

1004
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:17,913
Your husband?

1005
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:20,282
No. He's a friend.

1006
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:23,319
He's the main producer
on Seung-chan's team.

1007
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,254
This is Seung-chan's mom.

1008
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,657
Oh, yes. Hello.

1009
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:29,925
My name is Ra Jun-mo.

1010
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:34,563
So Producer Ra Jun-mo, you're like

1011
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:38,267
the direct supervisor
of Seung-chan's team?

1012
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:41,136
Yes, well, you could say that.

1013
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,438
You live in the front building?

1014
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:43,505
-Yes.
-Goodness!

1015
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:48,010
So the senior colleague
who lives in our complex

1016
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,379
whose house Seung-chan
sometimes sleeps at...

1017
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:51,747
is his place?

1018
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,082
Yes.

1019
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:54,283
Goodness!

1020
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,752
Have you had dinner?

1021
01:10:57,386 --> 01:10:58,887
We were just about to.

1022
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,591
It's not much, but please eat up.

1023
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:05,261
Goodness. What an impressive spread.

1024
01:11:06,328 --> 01:11:07,496
Thank you.

1025
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:14,370
Is Seung-chan doing well at work?

1026
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:16,305
Oh, Seung-chan?

1027
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:19,975
He's doing great.

1028
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:21,644
He's very good.

1029
01:11:22,845 --> 01:11:26,782
It's not because he's my son
that I'm bragging,

1030
01:11:26,849 --> 01:11:29,184
but he really is something else.

1031
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,654
He was always incredibly smart as a kid.

1032
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:34,590
He made no mistakes. He's perfect.

1033
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:39,428
I'm worried that people
will hate him because

1034
01:11:39,662 --> 01:11:41,363
he stands head and shoulders
above the others.

1035
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:46,201
You don't have to worry about that, sir.

1036
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,771
Well, that's a relief.

1037
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:53,142
I'm sure you see many celebrities

1038
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,611
working at the broadcast station.

1039
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:01,784
My Seung-chan is so handsome

1040
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:06,488
that I worry every day
that the celebrities might

1041
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:08,524
fall for him and hit on him.

1042
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:12,695
Oh, you really
don't have to worry about that.

1043
01:12:15,964 --> 01:12:17,132
Please stop it.

1044
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,735
Yes, that's enough. Let them eat.

1045
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:24,540
My parents really cherish Seung-chan.

1046
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:25,641
Please be understanding.

1047
01:12:26,442 --> 01:12:27,476
-Yes.
-Yes.

1048
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,047
The eldest son

1049
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:39,755
of the family is still unstable
in terms of his job and family.

1050
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,561
So all our hopes are pinned on Seung-chan.

1051
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,098
Hey, why are you bringing that up?

1052
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,202
Dig in. Go ahead.

1053
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:55,204
-Yes.
-Help yourselves.

1054
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,340
It's time for Star Wars.

1055
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:01,510
My friends are so excited about that show.

1056
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,582
Why would they be?

1057
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,917
That show put
Two Days and One Night on break.

1058
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:09,852
Really?

1059
01:13:10,352 --> 01:13:11,587
Why would it be put on break?

1060
01:13:12,287 --> 01:13:14,323
Main Producer, did something go wrong?

1061
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,491
Why did this happen?

1062
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,263
It happens from time to time.

1063
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,467
Oh dear. Are things okay?

1064
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,287
Why is this so funny?

1065
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:49,091
Are we going to disappear like this?

1066
01:13:49,391 --> 01:13:53,562
That preview is Seung-chan's first work.

1067
01:13:53,629 --> 01:13:56,732
The real and wild variety show,

1068
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,000
Two Days and One Night Season 5!

1069
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:01,970
Please just watch it once

1070
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,006
I'm about to cry.

1071
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,308
It's because of your hormones.

1072
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,810
You're too emotional these days.

1073
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,578
That was lame.

1074
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:12,281
-Hey.
-It was good.

1075
01:14:12,815 --> 01:14:15,417
A very nice, old font.

1076
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:16,752
Wasn't that your concept?

1077
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,320
Like when a store posts,

1078
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,790
"We're going out of business.
Please buy ten pairs of socks."

1079
01:14:21,857 --> 01:14:23,091
Hey!

1080
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:24,693
Can't I even ask?

1081
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:29,364
So what exactly is going to happen?

1082
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,334
That's the point.

1083
01:14:32,935 --> 01:14:35,170
The preview is supposed
to make you curious.

1084
01:14:39,374 --> 01:14:41,643
Main Producer,
did Seung-chan do a good job?

1085
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:47,115
Yes, he did.

1086
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:52,955
People usually don't remember previews.

1087
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:54,256
But look.

1088
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,825
You're all talking about it.

1089
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:58,026
He did a good job.

1090
01:15:00,262 --> 01:15:03,665
-I see.
-You did well!

1091
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,537
Whoever says wants to get married to you,

1092
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:11,740
I think I'll tell her
to really reconsider.

1093
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,911
Your mom is just like my mom.

1094
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,913
Meddling and obsessive.

1095
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:19,948
I bet it's tough for you.

1096
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:23,252
But my dad isn't like that.

1097
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:25,387
Yes, his dad isn't.

1098
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:32,995
My parents went a bit overboard today.

1099
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:34,630
They actually respect my privacy--

1100
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:36,298
Producer Ra Jun-mo.

1101
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,200
How about a game of Korean chess with me?

1102
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:41,436
I'm not very good at Korean chess.

1103
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,437
Really?

1104
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:45,107
Good. Let me teach you.

1105
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,074
Come on out.

1106
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:50,045
It sure is nice to have
a lot of people in the house.

1107
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,047
Come on out.

1108
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:52,948
Yes, sir.

1109
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,418
My dad isn't like this.

1110
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,793
Hey, if I told Cindy about your parents,

1111
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:08,063
it might be hard
for you two to grow closer.

1112
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,132
It really isn't like that!

1113
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:15,003
Your reactions are so funny
that I keep wanting to mess with you.

1114
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,005
Seung-chan, you come out too.

1115
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,775
We're playing in teams for stakes.

1116
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:33,088
What is it now?

1117
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:35,591
-Sit in the front.
-Why?

1118
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,025
If you have to talk to her, go ahead.

1119
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:38,493
I'll be waiting outside.

1120
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,331
Do as I say.

1121
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,973
Please wait outside for five minutes.

1122
01:16:59,214 --> 01:17:00,983
You're really cheeky today.

1123
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,152
Ma'am, I'm really annoyed.

1124
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:08,123
Your car wasn't this nice
when you drove me

1125
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:09,891
to Seoul from Chuncheon back then.

1126
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,028
That's true.

1127
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:16,331
I became a big star because of you,

1128
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,267
and you've acquired a lot because of me.

1129
01:17:19,901 --> 01:17:22,437
This is a win-win situation.

1130
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:24,239
What happened to us?

1131
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,208
As long as you act right,

1132
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,711
things should still be good between us.

1133
01:17:32,781 --> 01:17:34,249
I got the certification of contents.

1134
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:36,885
That you would file a lawsuit
if I didn't repay

1135
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,221
the cancellation fees
from when I was absent.

1136
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:41,790
Talk to my lawyer about that.

1137
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,362
One of my anti-fans
is a judicial apprentice,

1138
01:17:47,429 --> 01:17:48,797
so I asked him.

1139
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:50,766
I was injured back then.

1140
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:53,201
The doctor called
for four days' hospitalization.

1141
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:58,140
But my agency wanted me
to work despite that.

1142
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,243
And a cancellation fee
wasn't even requested.

1143
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,144
Why not?

1144
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:05,681
Because I have been doing all sorts of

1145
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:07,749
photo shoots and gigs to make up for it.

1146
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,385
You did your homework.

1147
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,423
Don't try to threaten me.

1148
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:20,629
I'm not desperate for money,
and I have people on my side.

1149
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,999
I have ten months left
until my contract is up.

1150
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:30,372
Until then, don't ruin Cindy's image, Mom.

1151
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,209
I'll work hard and do as you say,

1152
01:18:34,976 --> 01:18:37,879
but I'm not foolish enough to do something

1153
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,749
that will ruin my image.

1154
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:44,686
Cindy.

1155
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,522
Is that how I taught you?

1156
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:50,092
If you're so tense when you talk,

1157
01:18:50,358 --> 01:18:53,995
it becomes obvious
that you lack confidence.

1158
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:58,834
Jinie.

1159
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,369
Did you hear all that?

1160
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:05,006
I kept you here, so you would hear it.

1161
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,276
Stay sharp.

1162
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,613
This will happen to you soon, too.

1163
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:18,820
I'll be on my way now.

1164
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:46,848
Goodness. Look at all these books.

1165
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:00,729
Is he a kid?
Why does he have a stuffed animal?

1166
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,663
Oh, no...

1167
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:04,299
How silly.

1168
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,104
Producer Tak.

1169
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:17,646
You always say that you're a tough woman.

1170
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:20,916
What is this?

1171
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:25,153
But seeing you over these last two months,

1172
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,288
I've come to the conclusion

1173
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:29,357
that you're not tough.

1174
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:32,460
I'm sorry, sir. Check.

1175
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:33,361
Goodness...

1176
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:39,601
-Oh, he's good.
-Dad isn't good at it.

1177
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:41,736
Move this back.

1178
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:51,112
You may think I'm still young,
lacking, and clumsy.

1179
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:55,717
But if you're okay with that...

1180
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,822
If you're okay with my feelings for you,

1181
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:06,895
I would like to be by your side.

1182
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,965
Someone once told me

1183
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:12,834
that it's easy to tell
if I'm being sincere.

1184
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:18,740
But you don't seem to see my true feelings

1185
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:25,013
when everyone else can.

1186
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,918
You like someone.

1187
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,453
So you're agonizing over it.

1188
01:21:34,522 --> 01:21:36,124
How did you know?

1189
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:38,760
No way...

1190
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:42,297
When did this one-sided crush start?

1191
01:21:44,099 --> 01:21:45,400
It's been a while.

1192
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,537
It wasn't like that at all at first.

1193
01:21:50,672 --> 01:21:52,440
But I gradually started to...

1194
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:59,080
Producer Tak, the person I like

1195
01:22:00,348 --> 01:22:01,650
is not Cindy.

1196
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:02,984
It's not like that.

1197
01:22:03,485 --> 01:22:05,520
No? It's not?

1198
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:07,923
Then who is it?

1199
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:38,954
CINDY'S OFFICIAL FAN CLUB

1200
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:40,555
PRETTY CINDY

1201
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,346
10. UNDERSTANDING PREVIEWS

1202
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:15,050
IN ANY CASE, THE PREVIEW EXISTS
FOR THE MAIN FEATURE

1203
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:34,702
Producer Tak.

1204
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,840
Oh, hey. Sit down.

1205
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:41,176
Sorry to call you out so suddenly.

1206
01:24:49,117 --> 01:24:51,453
This is the last night
I'll be at this apartment.

1207
01:24:58,326 --> 01:24:59,227
Seung-chan.

1208
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:02,397
Yes?

1209
01:25:03,998 --> 01:25:07,435
When I was alone in your room...

1210
01:25:09,537 --> 01:25:10,538
I know.

1211
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:13,274
You do?

1212
01:25:17,078 --> 01:25:18,646
When I went into my room,

1213
01:25:20,281 --> 01:25:22,050
the stuffed animal
was in a different place.

1214
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,819
So I figured...

1215
01:25:26,488 --> 01:25:29,791
Really? I see.

1216
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:38,199
You're so meticulous.

1217
01:25:38,266 --> 01:25:40,502
You catch the details quickly.

1218
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:45,573
Just like what your parents said,
you really are smart.

1219
01:25:57,051 --> 01:26:00,221
Anyway, I bet you were surprised too.

1220
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:03,324
I was also surprised.

1221
01:26:04,058 --> 01:26:08,163
I never thought you felt that way.

1222
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,599
I had no idea.

1223
01:26:14,669 --> 01:26:15,904
Why would you like me?

1224
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,973
I never imagined you would like me.

1225
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:24,512
Producer Tak.

1226
01:26:26,648 --> 01:26:27,549
Yes?

1227
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:35,190
I didn't intend for that to happen,

1228
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:39,894
so, that counts as a preview, right?

1229
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:46,267
What? What was?

1230
01:26:48,069 --> 01:26:49,037
The preview

1231
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,207
I made after mustering up my courage

1232
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:57,278
for the first time in my life

1233
01:27:02,483 --> 01:27:03,818
to tell you how I feel.

1234
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,254
That preview.

1235
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:32,647
The problem is, we have been
around each other for too long.

1236
01:27:34,182 --> 01:27:37,819
That's why I saw you
as a friend on some days

1237
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:40,355
and as a man on other days.

1238
01:27:42,991 --> 01:27:47,562
So we shouldn't try to solve
this problem when we're together.

1239
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,898
We could both get confused.

1240
01:27:53,801 --> 01:27:58,439
Do we hate the idea of not seeing
a familiar person anymore?

1241
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,477
Or do we like each other
as a man and a woman?

1242
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:04,912
I want to know the answer to that.

1243
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,433
Hey, I know that too.

1244
01:28:26,868 --> 01:28:29,904
That we've been
around each other for too long.

1245
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,842
That's why telling you this

1246
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:40,882
is like gambling our 25-year friendship.

1247
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:45,286
But what can I do?

1248
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:48,690
I feel more and more uneasy.

1249
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:51,926
If I just let things be...

1250
01:28:54,128 --> 01:28:56,064
I feel like something major will happen.
