1
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,978
They got two bottles of milk delivered...

2
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,747
I don't think it's a one-night stand.

3
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,683
Last season was a total mess...

4
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,386
Why are you throwing cold water
on our show?

5
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,322
Tell me. Why is everyone turning us down?

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,191
People would not like to be on our show.

7
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,226
It's like dating.

8
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,328
You need to play hard to get.

9
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,130
Why are you staring at me like that?

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,467
This is all just about the umbrella?

11
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,169
Take 30,000 won for today.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,770
Take it. Don't feel bad.

13
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,939
-Thank you.
-Then go buy some chips.

14
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,708
You said to buy chips.

15
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,610
Unbelievable.

16
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,578
Here.

17
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:19,979
-Thank you.
-You're thankful again?

18
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,648
Then buy some stuffed pancakes.

19
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,284
What's that?

20
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,351
Stuffed pancakes.

21
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,986
I'll take them.
It's the thought that counts.

22
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,154
You can't have these.

23
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,424
-These are for someone else.
-What? It looks like you have a lot.

24
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,161
How dare you come and...

25
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,729
Sanmai?

26
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,733
Who said to go around
meeting weird people?

27
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,702
If you do that again, you're dead meat!

28
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,672
A lot has happened
during your first week at work.

29
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,208
HE DIDN'T HAVE OTHER INTENTIONS

30
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,715
Goodness...

31
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,185
I bought the stuffed pancakes.

32
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,723
Five of the green tea flavor
and five plain.

33
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,758
Hey, you...

34
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,323
Seung-chan. Hey.

35
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,359
Baek Seung-chan! Seung-chan.

36
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,161
What's wrong with him?

37
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:42,061
Hey!

38
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:50,570
What? What is it?

39
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,377
Ye-jin, you don't live in Heukseok...

40
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,746
What?

41
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,114
Is this...

42
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:05,418
Dongtan?

43
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,522
Hey, did you just...

44
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,091
Did you just call me "Ye-jin"?

45
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,860
Yes, you. Ye-jin.

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,328
"Yes, you. Ye-jin"?

47
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,063
Why did you lie to me?

48
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,266
You liar.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,768
Hey, are you insane?

50
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,136
Let go!

51
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,671
I'm going to kill you for this.

52
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,312
Hold on.

53
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,419
How did he find out where I live?

54
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,631
Now what?

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,480
Hey, are you an idiot?

56
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,183
Why can't you memorize the passcode?

57
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,488
That's why I wanted to keep it as 0000!

58
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,323
But you changed it!

59
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:21,294
Changing it to your birthday...

60
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,064
You act like you own this place!

61
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,047
Isn't that Baek Seung-chan?

62
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,884
Hold on. Where am I?

63
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,952
You are in the right place.

64
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,254
I am, right? This is my...

65
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:52,792
Why is this punk sleeping in my house?
Hey!

66
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,695
Hey, dummy. Get up.

67
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,965
Just leave him alone. He's totally wasted.

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,734
What? Hey!

69
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,937
Hey, why are you sleeping here?

70
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,339
Go home.

71
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,408
Cheater.

72
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:10,910
What?

73
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:15,948
You mix beer and soju together.

74
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,617
You mix them.

75
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,285
How is that cheating?

76
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,622
How could a TV producer
working for a public broadcasting station

77
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,657
cheat and degrade
the worth of its service?

78
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,259
What is he talking about?

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,761
You shouldn't do that to my dear Ye-jin!

80
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,496
"My dear Ye-jin"?

81
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,833
Hey, you are not supposed
to call her like that.

82
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,938
-Only I can call her like that.
-Ye-jin is old and mean,

83
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,141
and she doesn't pay people back,
but still--

84
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,042
Hey!

85
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,112
What did I do?

86
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,116
Are you looking down on Ye-jin

87
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:55,088
because she's old, mean,
and broke as a joke?

88
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,823
You idiots!

89
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,491
What are you guys doing?

90
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,792
Geez!

91
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,833
Chew long and hard.
Stuffed pancakes for your hangover.

92
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,568
Okay.

93
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,972
You didn't bring paper
to hold the pancakes.

94
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,943
That shows you lack detail as a producer.

95
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,112
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,547
-I'll not forget about that next time.
-Why are you being so polite?

97
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,449
Just do as you did yesterday.

98
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,385
You called me a liar.

99
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,287
You pinched my cheeks
and even addressed me by my name.

100
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,623
He did that?

101
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:32,792
Did I?

102
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,794
There's no way...

103
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,396
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,065
Can you stop dripping syrup everywhere?

105
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,402
How'd you get here?

106
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,537
How did you know where we live?

107
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,875
I live in the building
across from this one.

108
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,177
So?

109
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,679
So what?

110
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,252
I happened to see

111
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,288
the two of you going home together.

112
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,562
I thought it was
a one-night thing at first,

113
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:13,132
but I saw that you got
two bottles of milk.

114
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,169
I've always gotten two
even when I Iived alone.

115
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,270
I really like milk.

116
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:21,441
Anyway, the two of you are together now...

117
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:26,078
and I don't think I was wrong
about you two living together.

118
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,614
Listen carefully, Seung-chan.

119
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,418
I get why you misunderstood
the whole situation.

120
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,224
I know how the society sees
the two unmarried people living together.

121
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,661
I see why you think we're shacking up.

122
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,229
-But it's not like that.
-Yes, it's not.

123
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,398
-We just live in the same place.
-We live in the same place.

124
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,999
That's all.

125
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,308
Isn't that living together--

126
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,576
No!

127
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,811
I can't get through to this kid.

128
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:03,316
This is the result of a societal problem.

129
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,321
Do you think the national
real estate policy was a success?

130
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:09,388
Pardon?

131
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,891
I think it was a failure.

132
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,727
As the cost of leases shot up,

133
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,196
moving to the suburbs became unavoidable.

134
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,832
But not unavoidable for me.

135
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,134
I got a new apartment in Dongtan.

136
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,302
It's 22 pyeong.

137
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,075
Anyway, I have to move in there,

138
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:31,477
but the move-in date changed unexpectedly.

139
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:35,481
So anyway, how should I explain this?

140
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,316
-You had nowhere to go.
-Right.

141
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,318
I had nowhere to go for about four months.

142
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:41,254
Since the situation ended up like this...

143
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,055
When was it again, Jun-mo?

144
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:44,924
Jun-mo and I were having drinks...

145
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,125
You know this story.

146
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,528
Why are you making things so complicated?

147
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,531
So, I told her she could stay at my place

148
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,965
since I have three rooms here.

149
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,468
I see.

150
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,437
So that's how you started
living together--

151
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,673
Dang it! This kid is so frustrating.

152
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,308
We're not living together.

153
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,411
We're temporarily sharing
the same address.

154
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,714
A temporary union of households.

155
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,850
My younger brother lives here, too.

156
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,251
Shall I show you his room?

157
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,420
-Get up.
-That's okay. I get it.

158
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,089
Okay, good.

159
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,758
All right.

160
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,826
Wait.

161
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,363
Do you really understand?

162
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,169
You don't!

163
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,737
You still got the wrong idea about this.

164
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,372
What will we do with this kid?

165
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,942
There's no need to misunderstand this.

166
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,945
We've been friends
since elementary school.

167
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:40,913
We could live in the same house forever,

168
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,582
and nothing would happen between us.

169
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,053
The two of us are not like
a man and woman.

170
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,556
We're just two people. That's it.

171
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:56,329
Yes, so you two are temporarily living...

172
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:01,100
Temporarily sharing the same address.

173
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,268
Right.

174
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:03,803
What are we?

175
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,274
Totally just friends.

176
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,892
I feel like a celebrity
caught by paparazzi.

177
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,630
He wouldn't have taken
photos of us, right?

178
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,132
Even if he did, how would he use them?

179
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,136
He might spread rumors at work

180
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,505
or even threaten us with them.

181
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,606
What are you talking about?

182
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:42,675
He won't, right?

183
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,744
But that kid is a bit dense.

184
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,480
He might tell people by accident.

185
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,248
What now? What'll we do, Jun-mo?

186
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,217
What'll we do?

187
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:54,820
Hey, Seung-chan!

188
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,258
You just came out of that building, right?

189
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:03,763
Didn't you pull an all-nighter at work?

190
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,731
Why would you come out of there?

191
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:06,966
Well...

192
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,469
My senior colleague
lives in that building.

193
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,041
I got tired on my way home,
so I briefly...

194
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,611
So you slept over
at someone's house so close to home?

195
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,448
Is that senior colleague a girl?

196
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:24,583
A girl?

197
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,686
Seung-chan isn't like that.

198
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,321
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mom.

199
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,023
That's so unholy!

200
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,927
Seung-chan is praying for his future wife.

201
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,029
He wouldn't sleep at any old girl's house.

202
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,297
He's not some delinquent.

203
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,666
Anyway, it's good
that we ran into each other like this.

204
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,635
I wanted to talk to you about something.

205
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,603
I was worried I wouldn't have the chance.

206
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:46,906
What is it?

207
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,642
Things are tough at my husband's clinic.

208
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,212
Another urology clinic
opened just across the street.

209
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,947
They have an elevator
just for men that goes

210
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,750
straight from the parking lot
to the clinic.

211
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,351
Is that better?

212
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,020
It's more convenient.

213
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,155
Because it takes them there directly
without being seen.

214
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,158
But men sure are weird.

215
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,495
Having a problem with their prostate
is not something to be ashamed of.

216
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,131
Why do they need their own elevator?

217
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:14,767
Are you like that, too?

218
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:19,905
Are you ashamed of your prostate?

219
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:21,941
Jae-hui...

220
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,410
I have to get changed and go to work.

221
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,012
Wait. What I'm saying is...

222
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,918
You have that health show Vitamin on KBS.

223
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,921
Try to get my husband on the show.

224
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,158
-Oh, that's a great idea!
-Right, Mom?

225
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,760
The host Lee Hwi-jae needs a third child

226
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,232
if he wants to beat out
those Song triplets.

227
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,033
That's true.

228
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,736
Tell him to get a diagnosis
from my husband.

229
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,506
Yes, tell him. It's free!

230
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:59,545
Okay? Hey.

231
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,481
My husband might be out of a job soon!

232
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,483
-Jae-hui.
-Yes?

233
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,919
I might be out of a job before him.

234
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:08,954
-What does that mean?
-What?

235
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:09,855
-Why?
-Hey...

236
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,190
-Why?
-Why?

237
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,294
I heard you can get fired if you mess up

238
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,062
three times during the probation period.

239
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,199
I think I've messed up twice already.

240
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,203
I feel like at any minute now...

241
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,112
Any word from JYP Entertainment?

242
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,282
No. They said they would contact me,
but they haven't.

243
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,416
What are you going to do?

244
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,753
The CEO thinks that either Suzy
or Cindy will be on our show.

245
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,824
Say, on Infinite Challenge,

246
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,093
they spent weeks
finding a new cast member.

247
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,095
They called it the "Sixth Man Project."

248
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,197
So?

249
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,132
How about we do the same?

250
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:56,468
We need six people, but we're missing one.

251
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:58,904
We'll make it a competition for that spot.

252
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:02,808
Do you even know what competition means?

253
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,376
The show is this close
to getting canceled,

254
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,278
and nobody's interested in it.

255
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,414
Who would compete to be on this show?

256
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:12,318
Good point.

257
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,289
Should I go meet Jin-young and beg him

258
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,225
on my knees
so that we can have Suzy on our show?

259
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,893
You haven't done that yet?

260
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,229
What did you do there?

261
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:25,698
You should've knelt
as soon as you got there.

262
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,868
PARK JIN-YOUNG

263
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:33,439
It's Jin-young! JYP!

264
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,575
Hey, Jin-young.

265
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,111
I was going to come see you anyway.

266
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,414
I heard you kept leaving messages, Jun-mo.

267
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,617
You and I are close, so...

268
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,952
I'll let you have the biggest star
of JYP on your show.

269
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,523
Okay, Jin-young!

270
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,192
Thank you so much!

271
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,227
I never thought this would happen.

272
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,829
Suzy's okay with it, too?

273
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,832
You can have the biggest star
of JYP on your show.

274
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,568
Right. That's Suzy.

275
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,304
Not Suzy. The one
who won first place recently.

276
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,805
Me.

277
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
JYP! The man himself.

278
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,677
I'm back in the spotlight these days.

279
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,212
I've given this a lot of thought.

280
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,446
Really?

281
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,648
The show will be a hit.

282
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:17,383
I'm crazy popular these days.

283
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,251
This really is crazy.

284
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,253
You have to tell the other idol stars...

285
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,788
What a great idea.

286
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,057
I'll do Two Days and One Night.

287
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:26,659
What did you just say?

288
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,162
I'll be on Two Days and One Night.

289
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,965
-Cindy...
-Mom.

290
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:40,139
That's what I called you when I first
joined the company when I was 13.

291
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:41,807
Mom.

292
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,812
Okay, Cindy.

293
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:48,714
I'm basically your mother.

294
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,916
What mother won't look out
for her daughter?

295
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,087
I worked hard to get you to where you are.

296
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,989
Why would you do a variety show?

297
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,357
Does T.O.P do variety shows?

298
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,627
-Has Jun Ji-hyun ever been on one?
-I've already thought it through.

299
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,862
Thought what through?

300
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:10,169
There are many cases of top stars...

301
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,172
Getting many more fans and...

302
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,409
...becoming even more successful

303
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,846
after appearing in a variety shows.

304
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,948
There was a segment called
"Scary Experience."

305
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,551
It showed movie star Jeon Do-yeon

306
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:30,089
screaming, falling, and crying

307
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,824
at the sight of ghosts.

308
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,125
She looked very...

309
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:38,030
...lovely and pretty.

310
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,299
How do you know about a show from 1995?

311
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,900
You were born in 1993.

312
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,904
Lee Hyori was on Family Outing.

313
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,474
Before, she was known as a sexy star,

314
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,443
but she worked in the fields,
wore no makeup,

315
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,480
and cooked on that show.
Now she's like a girl-next-door.

316
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,484
People of all ages loved how she was...

317
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,619
...so easygoing and charming.

318
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:04,056
She expanded her territory.

319
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,591
Okay.

320
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,494
If you want to be on a variety show,
I'll look into it.

321
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,428
But...

322
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,865
Not Two Days and One Night. Not that show.

323
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,972
For ten years,

324
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:24,443
I've done everything you told me to do.

325
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,079
Yes. So--

326
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,480
So...

327
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,917
let's do what I want this time.

328
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,455
Mom.

329
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,059
Cindy, if you go on that show,
you'll have to sleep outside,

330
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:41,393
eat weird stuff,

331
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,495
and run all over the place. You know that.

332
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,164
Someone fussy like you--

333
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,098
Manager.

334
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,700
Are you in that TV drama Satorare?

335
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,271
Don't say everything you're thinking.

336
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,205
I'm sorry.

337
00:17:55,674 --> 00:18:00,546
You're a bit more delicate than others.

338
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:05,984
And you're sensitive
since you're an artist.

339
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,353
You know what?

340
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,056
I'm a professional.

341
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,660
You think I can't endure all that
for a show?

342
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,198
Look at me now.

343
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,266
I'm so easygoing.

344
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,334
What?

345
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,805
There are finger smudges on this mirror,

346
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,642
but I haven't complained. Can't you see?

347
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,490
-Really?
-Yeah, they all...

348
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,326
-Go ahead. I'll be right there.
-All right.

349
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,332
-Hello.
-Hello.

350
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,367
Were you talking about something funny?

351
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,205
Seung-chan, come see me.

352
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,244
-Goodbye.
-You can sit.

353
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,952
What were you guys talking about?

354
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,421
Sorry?

355
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,691
Just this and that...

356
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:23,095
Like how I'm living with Jun-mo? Right?

357
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,764
No.

358
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,967
Then why were they so startled to see me?

359
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,370
Because...

360
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,975
You came at us glaring.

361
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,779
I don't think so.

362
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,949
I have very kind eyes.

363
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,986
And I didn't glare.

364
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,756
Why would they be scared of me?

365
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,662
Anyway, don't worry.

366
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,163
I...

367
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,201
I won't say anything
about your temporary...

368
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,102
address sharing.

369
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,405
Of course not. You'd better not.

370
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,540
It's time for lunch.

371
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,143
Yes. Goodbye.

372
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,680
Who are you going to eat with?

373
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,916
My colleagues.

374
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,258
Have you seen the movie Oldboy?

375
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:28,160
Yes.

376
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:33,465
Do you know why Choi Min-sik was locked up
and fed dumplings for 15 years?

377
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,401
Because he knew a secret.

378
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,840
Eat it. The fried dumplings here are good.

379
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,245
Anyway, let me tell you this again.

380
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,147
Nobody in Yeouido knows this secret.

381
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,416
No one can know about this
unless you spill the beans.

382
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,254
Even if you have no intention to do so,

383
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,056
you might accidentally mention it
while chatting

384
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,025
with your colleagues
like you were earlier.

385
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,194
I'll be careful.

386
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,896
Of course you should be careful.

387
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,466
Do you use social media?

388
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,636
Usually, quiet people

389
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,039
suddenly reveal shocking things
on social media.

390
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:16,742
I don't use social media.

391
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,310
Good, don't.

392
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,980
Are you going to drink often?

393
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,383
No, I won't.

394
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:27,119
Yes. You really shouldn't.

395
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,254
You were a terrible drunk yesterday.

396
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,891
Anyway, if people find out,

397
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,726
I won't pay you back
the remaining 700,000 won.

398
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,028
It's 750,000 won.

399
00:21:36,662 --> 00:21:38,897
Hey, you should knock 50,000 won off.

400
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,932
You slept at my place last night.

401
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,167
And you even had breakfast.

402
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:46,071
I should knock more like 60,000 won off,
but I'm giving you a deal for 50,000 won.

403
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:50,876
Out of the remaining 700,000 won,
here is today's installment.

404
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,854
Keep the secret.

405
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,691
I will. Thank you.

406
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,495
-Eat the dumpling.
-Yes.

407
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,400
I feel like I'm getting an allowance

408
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,703
or unexpected money.

409
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,073
I feel strangely thankful
when she pays me back.

410
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,044
Though it's actually my own money.

411
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:30,849
I buy you dessert,
I pay you back today's installment...

412
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,018
Isn't it great to have lunch
with your senior colleague?

413
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,454
Yes, it was nice.

414
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,124
But I have a question.

415
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:40,859
What?

416
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:44,096
Does Hye-ju know about

417
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:48,767
you and Producer Ra's
address-sharing relationship?

418
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,503
Are you close with Hye-ju?

419
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:54,773
We were in the same club in university.

420
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,676
Why do you ask that?

421
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:04,015
It just seems like Hye-ju should know.

422
00:23:05,117 --> 00:23:07,285
Since she's dating Jun-mo.

423
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,423
You're very righteous.

424
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,991
I wouldn't go that far.

425
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,896
So, that's why
you called Jun-mo a cheater.

426
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:21,166
But don't worry about that.

427
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,868
They're not dating anymore.

428
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:23,769
Really?

429
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:24,770
Yes.

430
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,004
You didn't know?

431
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:26,938
No.

432
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,774
I didn't know, but...

433
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:30,909
What a relief.

434
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,445
Right? Isn't it?

435
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,616
But why is that a relief?

436
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,420
Oh, I just...

437
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,223
You and Jun-mo are just friends,
but I worried

438
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:49,895
that Hye-ju might misunderstand
and get hurt.

439
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:51,163
Is that it?

440
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:53,565
Yes, that's it.

441
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,435
I heard Hye-ju went on temporary leave.

442
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:59,971
What? Why?

443
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,907
The reason I became a producer

444
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,443
is because I thought it would be cool

445
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,711
if Yoo Jae-suk hosted my wedding,

446
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,714
and if Lena Park
and Kim Beom-su sang there.

447
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,785
But somehow, I've surrounded myself
with producers.

448
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,689
So I had no choice but to date
one of them.

449
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,125
And that's why this happened.

450
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,027
She's sick of dating a producer.

451
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,963
She says she'll never date
a producer again.

452
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,968
She looks soft-hearted,
but she's determined.

453
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,303
Decisive, too.

454
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:47,118
He liked her.

455
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,454
Seung-chan liked Hye-ju.

456
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:50,856
I can tell.

457
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:55,794
What do producers do? This is my opinion.

458
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,262
It's...

459
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,300
He's trying so hard not to show it.

460
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,669
But you can always tell,

461
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,072
no matter how hard they try.

462
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:09,941
Did you see him just now?

463
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:21,887
Congratulations.

464
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,155
About what...

465
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,902
What is it, Ye-jin?

466
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,508
They want you to come to the KCC.

467
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,345
Because Cindy took her jacket off--

468
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,246
Da-jeong.

469
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,282
What is Cindy's ranking this week?

470
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,017
-Give me the chart.
-Okay.

471
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,995
I didn't ask you to look at it.
Give it to me.

472
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,304
She has to be on this week's show, too.

473
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,840
Get me General Manager Kim immediately.

474
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,044
So what did CEO Byun say?

475
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,280
Not much.

476
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,651
Do you people at Byun Entertainment
not get the gravity of the situation?

477
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,921
Tell this to CEO Byun.

478
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,392
Why would a show need a producer
if the singer is going to do

479
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,528
whatever she pleases while performing?

480
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:38,496
Why are you being like this?

481
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,533
CEO Byun is avoiding me!

482
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,471
Her singer made a huge blunder,

483
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,007
so I get why she is so afraid
of seeing me.

484
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,676
That's why she's acting
like nothing has happened.

485
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,011
Geez...

486
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,446
Is she that scared?

487
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,017
The CEO doesn't know about this incident.

488
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:02,887
What?

489
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,756
She's very busy...

490
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,259
She entrusted Music Bank to me.

491
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,231
This week,
I'll check Cindy's outfit ahead of time.

492
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,601
You just don't get it, do you?

493
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:18,570
This won't do.

494
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,740
Cindy can take a break this week.

495
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:22,707
What?

496
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:28,446
Unfortunately, KBS put me in charge
of who appears on Music Bank.

497
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,281
What will you do?

498
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,384
Please...

499
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:34,219
Go about your business.

500
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,623
This is serious.

501
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,826
Really? Yes.

502
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,461
I bet he's shocked.

503
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,931
But Cindy is ranked first for tomorrow.

504
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,866
Forget it.

505
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,102
It's not just any first place.

506
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,705
Won't we be in trouble
if she doesn't appear?

507
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:59,077
-She'll be on SBS and MBC.
-Speak quietly, Da-jeong!

508
00:27:59,144 --> 00:28:02,213
Cindy's fans already despise you.

509
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,749
If first place Cindy doesn't show...

510
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,017
Just wait.

511
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,687
They'll have an urgent meeting about this.

512
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,290
Oh, so you want them to apologize?

513
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:16,294
You think I'm doing this
just for an apology?

514
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:17,762
-You're not?
-Hey.

515
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,499
Do you know what a producer
must never lose?

516
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,568
Their editing skills?

517
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:25,236
Connections?

518
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,338
Viewer ratings? No.

519
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,240
Forget all that.

520
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,576
It's their grudge.

521
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,814
You always have to get payback.

522
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,017
Never forget, and always get payback.

523
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:40,385
That's how producers become powerful.

524
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,321
Once people know that about me,
they would want to work with me.

525
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,623
Whether it's good or bad,
they want to work

526
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,461
with a producer who can get payback.

527
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,734
He's going nuts over there.

528
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,935
It seems really serious.

529
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,938
Hey...

530
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:02,140
Don't look. Pretend to work.

531
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:05,110
Let's have a meeting.
Make it look very natural.

532
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,180
-So, regarding this...
-He hung up.

533
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,482
Don't look at him.

534
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,051
-The set...
-He's coming.

535
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:14,486
Doesn't it look a little weird?

536
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:15,453
This should...

537
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,255
-Where's he going?
-Here.

538
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,757
He just left.

539
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,258
What?

540
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,898
He left really urgently, right?

541
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:32,604
Hello, ma'am.

542
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,523
This is imperial tea, a very special tea.

543
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,526
You're a special guest, so please enjoy.

544
00:30:00,665 --> 00:30:04,269
Send me the contract
before I change my mind.

545
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:07,505
Cindy will do Two Days and One Night?

546
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:08,439
You don't want her?

547
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,041
Should I leave?

548
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:13,444
Goodness, I shouldn't have come.

549
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,647
Hey, you're a producer.

550
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,315
What kind of reaction was that?

551
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:18,817
You upset CEO Byun.

552
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:20,118
I didn't mean it like that.

553
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,953
I was just surprised.

554
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:24,556
You're not thankful?

555
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,291
Of course I'm thankful.

556
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,827
I actually heard.

557
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,596
Our newbie producer went to see Cindy.

558
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,598
I really yelled at them for that, asking,

559
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,034
"What do you take CEO Byun for?

560
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,337
-Are you guys kidding me?"
-You haven't apologized? I told you to.

561
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:40,305
Forget it.

562
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:43,741
Include our terms in the contract.

563
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:45,243
You should've just added them.

564
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,079
-I'd approve them without reading them.
-Here are our terms.

565
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,447
What are you doing? Write these down.

566
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:51,616
Yes. Go ahead.

567
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,619
She's not going into the water.

568
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,154
She won't go into the water?

569
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,124
I came bearing the huge news
that Cindy will be on the show.

570
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:01,759
And all you care about is that?

571
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,263
What will she do
if she doesn't go in the water?

572
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,233
Going in the water is symbolic
of the show.

573
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,133
Right?

574
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,769
She's never been on a show
like this before,

575
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,571
so she doesn't really get it.

576
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,875
I'll try to negotiate about that.

577
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,876
And...

578
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,779
She can't drink any broth.

579
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,249
You have to agree to this.

580
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,784
She's a female celebrity.

581
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,786
Her face gets puffy if she has broth.

582
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,955
What's this? Let me see.

583
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,660
"Get confirmation from her
before playing a game"?

584
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:39,497
"The shoot must end at midnight"?

585
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,801
She wants to see
the original footage before editing?

586
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,571
Are you kidding me?

587
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,874
I had better leave.
I can't get through to you.

588
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,676
Look for another cast member.

589
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,679
CEO Byun, I didn't mean that.

590
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,249
Yes. That's not what we meant.

591
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:01,219
Then what is it? Why won't you allow this?

592
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,621
It's not that we won't allow it...

593
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:06,925
Producers these days are very stubborn.

594
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,860
We're all trying to make
the best decisions, but...

595
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,962
Where did they learn to behave like that?

596
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,765
That's not how they can get their way.

597
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,934
You're totally right.

598
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,969
So, what is it going to be?

599
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,171
Going in the water...

600
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:22,307
She has to do that.

601
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,044
It's symbolic of Two Days and One Night.

602
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,813
What else?

603
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,881
Broth.

604
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,485
There's nothing to eat outdoors
if you exclude soups and stews.

605
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:40,224
And it looks good on TV when they blow
stew bubbles before eating it.

606
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,493
That's true. He has a point.

607
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:49,334
-What else?
-And the shoots will go until 2:00 a.m.

608
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:53,838
Until 1:30 a.m...

609
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:56,040
Please?

610
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,343
Look.

611
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,044
I settled things.

612
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,547
You are so going to thank me
for this, Jun-mo.

613
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,549
-Going in the water?
-She'll do it.

614
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,185
Up to her ankles.

615
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,687
Are you kidding me?

616
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:14,792
CEO Byun said up to her ankles,

617
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,562
and I said, "Are you kidding me?

618
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,131
She should at least
go in up to her calves!"

619
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,432
Tae-ho!

620
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:25,670
I'll try to get her
to go in up to her thighs.

621
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,673
As for the food...

622
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,208
Braised dishes?

623
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,710
She really can't have broth.

624
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,580
Let's settle on braised dishes.

625
00:33:37,715 --> 00:33:39,751
Braised dishes are basically soups
with less broth.

626
00:33:41,152 --> 00:33:43,021
We're so close to the shoot. Just do it.

627
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,390
Are you going to cancel the shoot
because of something this petty?

628
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,460
Let's just film the show for now.

629
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,528
Jun-mo.

630
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,397
-It's crazy, right?
-I know.

631
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,531
-Hey.
-Totally.

632
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,366
Sit here.

633
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,970
What did you say to Cindy?

634
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,339
-What?
-Her CEO

635
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:04,075
is in the chief director's office
as we speak.

636
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,810
She agreed to be on our show.

637
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:06,744
Really?

638
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,945
I just don't get it.

639
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,416
Why is CEO Byun putting Cindy on our show?

640
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:12,917
I wouldn't if I were that CEO.

641
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,553
I can't believe you. This is our show!

642
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,557
I'm just saying, if I were her...

643
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,960
How did you cast Cindy?

644
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,229
Did you have some special know-how?

645
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,432
No, I just told her

646
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,036
we'd like her to be
on Two Days and One Night.

647
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,172
He used his charm.

648
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,508
Right? She fell for his charm.

649
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,977
Oh, so Cindy digs handsome guys.

650
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,980
I'm sure she does. Think about it.

651
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,650
If he asked her to be on the show...

652
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,418
He'd get rejected.

653
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,288
So is this like Notting Hill?

654
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,391
A top star falling
for a handsome ordinary guy?

655
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,526
No...

656
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,694
Handsome?

657
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,088
UMBRELLA BORROWER

658
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:56,621
Looking for me, Producer?

659
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,761
I agreed to be on this show
because of you.

660
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:04,929
You know that, right?

661
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,498
Sorry?

662
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,835
You suggested that I do
Two Days and One Night.

663
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:13,004
Yes, that's right.

664
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:15,373
I'm very thankful that you accepted--

665
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,441
So you have to be good to me.

666
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,080
Right. I got it.

667
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:25,716
What will you do for me?

668
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,453
Well, I'll try my best.

669
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,623
That's not good enough.

670
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:36,727
I agreed to be on this show
because of you.

671
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,730
You should always put me as your priority.

672
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,601
You have to be on my side. Okay?

673
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,873
I will count on you, all right?

674
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:53,744
Thank you for the fish cake soup
and the gimbap.

675
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,380
Oh, it was nothing.

676
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,918
I agreed to be on this show
because of you.

677
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,086
You know that, right?

678
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,255
Because of me?

679
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,524
As you know,
I've never been on a variety show,

680
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:07,792
so I don't really know what to do.

681
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,461
So you have to be on my side.

682
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,465
If you don't know what to do,
just don't do anything.

683
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:16,334
Excuse me?

684
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,036
This is a reality show.

685
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,872
You might think being on this kind
of show is challenging,

686
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,507
but you can just think simple.

687
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,077
You don't need to try to do anything.

688
00:37:26,777 --> 00:37:28,646
Just be yourself.

689
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:31,916
Myself...

690
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:35,086
Cindy, your true self.

691
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,857
My true self.

692
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:43,995
Got it.

693
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:46,631
Anyway, Producer...

694
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,067
I will count on you, all right?

695
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,870
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

696
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,171
Goodbye.

697
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,917
Still no word?

698
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,119
From who?

699
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:09,954
From General Manager Kim
at Cindy's agency.

700
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,857
Don't you get the situation?

701
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:15,126
They're feeling the pressure now.

702
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,395
They're worried about what we'll do.

703
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,463
Just let them be like that for a while.

704
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,132
Aren't we the ones under pressure?

705
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,166
No!

706
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,835
Go to your seat. Go. Sit down.

707
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:28,806
Hello?

708
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,844
Nobody is home now.
Leave it with the security guard.

709
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:34,945
Okay.

710
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,552
Packages are delivered so fast these days.

711
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:43,354
I ordered it yesterday,
and it came already.

712
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,990
Cindy is giving us both a hard time

713
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,259
though she will be on your show
but not on mine.

714
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,127
Cindy won't be on Music Bank?

715
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,265
I have to go to the KCC
because she took her jacket off last time.

716
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,567
I got mad and told her
she can't be on the show.

717
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,336
I guess she won't
even though she's ranked first.

718
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,971
That's so old-fashioned.

719
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:03,107
Why play hard to get with a celebrity?

720
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,076
Do that with a man.

721
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,778
Oh, right. I got a package. Hold on.

722
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:26,564
Nice car.

723
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,599
It's my dad's car.

724
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,471
Hey, Mom. What is it?

725
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,508
Why? You don't need to come.

726
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:39,877
I have plenty of kimchi.

727
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,779
I'll come see you.

728
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,047
Seung-chan.

729
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,083
You're home early. Good job.

730
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,387
I heard you guys got Cindy for your show.

731
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,454
Did you really cast her?

732
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,757
-It's not that I cast her--
-A blind date?

733
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,625
Come on.

734
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,460
-I'm busy these days.
-Maybe...

735
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:59,263
my sincerity got through to her.

736
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,197
A prosecutor?

737
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,234
-How pretty could a prosecutor be?
-I just kindly requested...

738
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,504
-I'll be free next Tuesday after my shoot.
-I gave examples such as Lee Hyori...

739
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,072
Okay! Be quiet already.

740
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:14,478
I'm definitely free on Tuesday,
6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.

741
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,547
I have to do editing afterward...

742
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,449
But is she really pretty?

743
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,920
Mom, you and I have such different tastes.

744
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,221
Can I trust you on this?

745
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,325
Your wrist is injured.

746
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,966
I think she likes him.

747
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,004
Producer Tak likes Producer Ra.

748
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:42,740
They say they're friends,

749
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:43,874
but I can tell.

750
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,510
She tries really hard not to show it.

751
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:51,649
I kind of understand how she feels.

752
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,988
Bring it in.

753
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,293
You can leave it on there.

754
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,497
Thanks, Seung-chan.

755
00:41:06,897 --> 00:41:08,432
It was nothing. I'll be going.

756
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,534
-Seung-chan.
-Yes?

757
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,038
You like Hye-ju, don't you?

758
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,811
You seemed like you were in shock

759
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,113
when I told you Hye-ju
won't be coming to work.

760
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:26,183
Have you told her?

761
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,420
No.

762
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:33,257
Why not? You should,
even if it might not work out.

763
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:38,429
Quiet.

764
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:44,602
Why are you here again?

765
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:46,537
To help her carry this.

766
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,441
You asked him to do that, too?
Why couldn't you carry it yourself?

767
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,177
She hurt her wrist.

768
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:54,545
Really?

769
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,248
You get hurt so easily.

770
00:41:57,615 --> 00:41:59,650
Why do you always trip and fall?

771
00:42:00,618 --> 00:42:02,486
How'd you hurt yourself this time?

772
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,155
You're not even curious, so don't ask.

773
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,658
Thanks, Seung-chan.

774
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,827
I'll be going now.

775
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,595
-Bye.
-Later.

776
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:27,144
What is it?

777
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,580
Are you hurt badly?

778
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:33,150
Forget it. When have you ever
worried about me?

779
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,185
Come on.

780
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:37,421
Of course I'm worried about you. Always.

781
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,094
But why do you keep bringing
Baek Seung-chan into our house?

782
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,130
I've never done that.

783
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:48,332
He was drunk and barged in last night.

784
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
And he just helped me
carry a package today.

785
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:51,835
Exactly.

786
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,806
Seung-chan is a guy, too.

787
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,541
You're so fearless for a girl.

788
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:02,079
Don't invite guys
into the house when you're alone.

789
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,482
Please. You're a guy, too.

790
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,886
Not to you, I'm not.

791
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:14,058
Okay, I get it. Stop talking to me
and go to bed.

792
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,060
Won't you prepare for tomorrow's shoot?

793
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,295
I should.

794
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,398
I'll sleep a few hours
and leave early in the morning.

795
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:23,901
Yes, so go to sleep.

796
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:26,804
Okay. Good night.

797
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:57,701
Eat breakfast, Clumsy.

798
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:18,656
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten!

799
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:23,961
You think ten spins is too many?

800
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,596
Yes, it's too many.

801
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,164
He fell. He couldn't take it.

802
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:28,399
Make it five spins.

803
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,435
Rest for a minute and do five spins--

804
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,039
Come on.

805
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:39,710
What are you doing?

806
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:45,215
Oh, our show is all about games.

807
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,851
We're just running some simulations
to see if they work.

808
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,387
We don't want any issues on set.

809
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,057
Sometimes we run simulations all night.

810
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:59,096
It's a very arduous task
that involves scientific experiment.

811
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:03,200
The games can't be too easy,
but they can't be too hard, either.

812
00:45:03,267 --> 00:45:06,036
Good producers must be able to
choose the game

813
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:08,172
at an appropriate level of difficulty.

814
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,210
You should have hit him. Do it again.

815
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,781
Time's up!

816
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,550
You failed at breaking ten.

817
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:23,821
-It should work.
-See? Ten is too many.

818
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,357
-My goodness.
-It's hard for a beginner.

819
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:28,692
Hyeong-geun, you try.

820
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:31,328
I'm done with this stuff, remember?

821
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,063
Do it.

822
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,998
He has to watch and learn.

823
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,900
That's how he can get better.

824
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:39,903
Give me that.

825
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,041
Geez...

826
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,009
Watch.

827
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:49,379
Right in the crack.

828
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:50,380
Here I go.

829
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:55,385
He's good at this.

830
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,589
-You're amazing.
-It was nothing.

831
00:45:58,956 --> 00:46:00,390
You try hard, too.

832
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,159
You'll be able to do it one day.

833
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,798
Shooting Two Days and One Night
is like going to war.

834
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,100
Wear the right clothes.
Take the right stuff.

835
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,735
I see a lot of useless things.

836
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,839
I think I'll need all this stuff.

837
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:18,175
You don't need toothpaste or a toothbrush.

838
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,778
There's no time to eat
or brush your teeth.

839
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,012
Shampoo and conditioner?

840
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,282
Will you have time to wash your hair
when you can't even brush your teeth?

841
00:46:27,351 --> 00:46:28,285
Laptop?

842
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,154
Are you going to do homework there?

843
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:31,555
You don't need any of these.

844
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:33,991
Headphones?

845
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,528
I like listening to music on car rides.

846
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,229
Leave them here.

847
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,532
You're going to sleep in the car.

848
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,000
It's the only place you'll get to sleep.

849
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:48,772
-A book?
-I always read before I go to sleep.

850
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:49,973
You won't be able to sleep.

851
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,610
You're missing a lot. Write this down.

852
00:46:57,181 --> 00:46:58,982
Chocolate, red bean jelly, and candy.

853
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,552
Your blood sugar will drop late at night.

854
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,187
Senior colleagues will ask
for some sweets.

855
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:04,521
Cup noodles.

856
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:06,690
Nobody will feed you, so feed yourself.

857
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:08,959
And you never know when you'll need these.

858
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,661
A footbag, yut nori sticks, a sketchbook,

859
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,229
markers, glue, a baseball,

860
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,730
plastic wrap, foil, and sand lance sauce.

861
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:14,798
These are the essentials.

862
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,467
And a baseball cap.

863
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,102
Your hair will be a mess by morning.

864
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:24,341
Instant coffee!

865
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:26,043
Jun-mo needs it.

866
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:28,545
Or else he'll blank out late at night.

867
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,587
You need to bring vitamins.

868
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,323
He needs someone to tell him,
so you tell him to take them.

869
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:40,324
Okay.

870
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:41,892
What else...

871
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,895
Did you get medicine for emergencies?

872
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,399
I think Producer Ra is very lucky.

873
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:50,934
Why do you say that?

874
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,171
Because he has a great girlfriend
like you.

875
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:56,773
I mean, a friend that's a girl.

876
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,509
You're getting better at this.

877
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,577
Sorry?

878
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:03,981
You're trying to make me happy
so you can get today's installment.

879
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,549
I only have 20,000 won today.

880
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,684
I didn't say it because of that.

881
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,487
I really think he is lucky
to have a friend like you. I'm envious.

882
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,790
All right. Go pay for this stuff.

883
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,365
Don't worry.

884
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:24,268
We agreed to do this,
so we want her to look pretty.

885
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,937
No. Not pretty.

886
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,338
Raw.

887
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:30,741
Oh, okay.

888
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,076
Got it.

889
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,245
Yes.

890
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,282
Keep it a secret from Cindy?

891
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,652
Of course. Don't worry.

892
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,020
Bye.

893
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:48,292
What did they say?

894
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,927
What time are they coming?

895
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,531
The thing is, this is a secret.

896
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,669
If you know about the prank,
it'll be obvious, and it won't be funny.

897
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:02,673
It's a reality show, so it has to be real.

898
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:08,278
Look. Reality is no big deal.

899
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,484
People see what they want to see
and think of it as reality.

900
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:20,557
I'll just play a character,
just like in a drama.

901
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:22,826
But...

902
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,098
Will that work?

903
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,235
Why do you think I'm doing the show?

904
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:38,208
I'm known for being cold and difficult.

905
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,344
I want to change my image.

906
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:44,848
A friendly person people can relate to.

907
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,651
I'll just act like that.

908
00:49:49,186 --> 00:49:52,456
Let's have a meeting about my character.

909
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:54,691
A meeting?

910
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,626
I saw somewhere that people

911
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,998
give celebrities nicknames. It was funny.

912
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,367
Basketball player Kim Byung-man.

913
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,802
Cute little Kang Ho-dong.

914
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,071
Funny, right?

915
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,706
Yes.

916
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,909
Slim-waist Lee Guk-joo. It's funny.

917
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,913
I want a nickname like that.

918
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:19,516
Oh, a nickname?

919
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,787
Smiling angel Cindy. Like that?

920
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:25,555
No.

921
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,824
That's just stating the truth.

922
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:33,330
I already am a smiling angel.
It wouldn't be funny to call me that.

923
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:35,132
It should be the opposite.

924
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:41,138
Okay. Buddhist saint Cindy. Like that?

925
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,141
What does that mean?

926
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:47,377
Buddhist saints don't get angry.

927
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,480
When have I ever gotten angry at you?

928
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,782
He said he'd keep it a secret?

929
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,216
-Of course.
-Good.

930
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,788
You spray the water.

931
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,624
Me?

932
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,826
The newbie producers always do this.

933
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,561
Even Producer Yoo Ho-jin did it.

934
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,931
Use this to spray the water on her.

935
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:09,866
And when Cindy is startled and wakes up,

936
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,468
you apologize to her

937
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,071
and give her the sand lance sauce.

938
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:15,238
This is very important.

939
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:18,575
She has to look funny
when she spits it out.

940
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,476
Right.

941
00:51:22,879 --> 00:51:23,847
Quiet.

942
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,068
What are you doing?

943
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,738
What is going on?

944
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,408
I'm sorry.

945
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,277
-I got scared.
-I'm sorry.

946
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,614
Drink this.

947
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,649
I don't drink iced coffee
in the morning. I'm sorry.

948
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:40,190
Her manager really did keep it a secret.

949
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,825
She had no idea.

950
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,494
We did this last season, too.

951
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:46,663
I don't think she expected this at all.

952
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,533
The mission was a success.

953
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:51,701
But strangely...

954
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,137
it wasn't funny.

955
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,809
I think Cindy needs to go into acting.

956
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,445
She should.

957
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:03,680
Why?

958
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,449
Did Cindy act today?

959
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,151
No.

960
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:10,887
How about these?

961
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,590
Those look like I'm trying too hard.
I want to seem easygoing.

962
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,360
But I can't wear those lame ones!

963
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:24,067
How about these?

964
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,474
Everyone is waiting downstairs.

965
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,243
They told me to bring you.

966
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,678
Okay.

967
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,183
-Hey.
-Yes?

968
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,252
Clean this place up
while I'm at the shoot.

969
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,288
Call a disinfection service.

970
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:46,256
Okay.

971
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,959
What is this smell?

972
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:53,930
It's not my body odor.

973
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:57,133
I have sand lance sauce in my bag.
It's a prop.

974
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,902
It's leaking a bit.

975
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,837
Okay.

976
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,635
Let's do a good job for the new season.
Let's go!

977
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,274
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

978
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:39,109
Please do a good job.

979
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,310
We'll start now.

980
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,580
-Two Days and One Night!
-And One Night!

981
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,657
This is my first time
seeing Cindy in person.

982
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,326
Why is she doing this show?

983
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:57,761
I'm not against it.

984
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,429
I'm still a rookie.

985
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,632
Being with Cindy will help me
increase my popularity.

986
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,234
Hey, snap out of it.

987
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,703
She'll outshine us if we're not careful.

988
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,471
Then what do we do?

989
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,707
Don't give her good reactions.

990
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,008
Don't laugh at her jokes.

991
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,110
Just laugh when I say something.

992
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:15,612
Yes, Sandara.

993
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,981
You'll give me good reactions, right?

994
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,149
Okay.

995
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,819
If we stick together, we can get
all of Cindy's footage edited out.

996
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:24,321
Yes, Sandara.

997
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,556
And don't call me Sandara
at the end of your sentence.

998
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,525
It sounds too formal,
and it makes me look old.

999
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,126
Okay, Sandara.

1000
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,295
Sandara!

1001
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,230
-Hello, Sandara.
-Hello.

1002
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:35,965
Good to see you, Sandara.

1003
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:37,233
Yes.

1004
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,069
Just speak comfortably to me.

1005
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,737
You're a lot older than me.

1006
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:42,906
Just be comfortable, Sandara.

1007
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,285
Sandara, when are we leaving?

1008
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,020
Stop calling me Sandara.

1009
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:59,556
I have to call you that. It's respectful.

1010
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:02,525
Just call me Dara.

1011
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,928
Okay.

1012
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:07,297
Do you want to form an alliance with me?

1013
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,300
If they make the guys
choose partners today, pick me.

1014
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:13,169
So if the girls choose, will you pick me?

1015
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:14,337
Yes.

1016
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:17,006
Agreed.

1017
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,246
I'm a rookie, so I'm not that famous.

1018
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,583
Will you be okay if you're paired with me?

1019
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:29,686
I'm here
because I want to find someone to date.

1020
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:41,598
How come you became
a writer not a celebrity?

1021
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,034
You have a very pretty face.

1022
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,472
They all say I don't seem like a writer.

1023
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:53,076
Please look after me.

1024
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,678
Well...

1025
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,014
Okay.

1026
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,350
So, today...

1027
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,753
Do the guys choose partners or the girls?

1028
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,289
The guys will choose their partners today.

1029
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:09,993
Those who aren't chosen

1030
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,696
will go with the newbie producer there.

1031
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,931
Raise your hand.

1032
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,935
You'll go somewhere else

1033
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,304
instead of the base camp with him.

1034
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:23,807
You'll spend the night there

1035
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,445
and head to the base camp
early tomorrow morning.

1036
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,515
Guys, have you made your choices?

1037
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,588
Okay then. Ladies, please step forward.

1038
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:42,459
If you've made up your mind, go ahead.

1039
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,997
Ladies, please turn around

1040
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:53,203
on the count of three.

1041
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:56,739
One, two, three.

1042
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,888
Oh, gosh.

1043
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:14,858
I'm blushing, right?

1044
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,963
Nobody chose me.

1045
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,367
Ma'am,

1046
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,737
you'll find out anyway,
so I'm telling you now.

1047
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,106
Cindy was left out

1048
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,342
on Two Days and One Night.

1049
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,511
What?

1050
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:36,713
When?

1051
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:38,047
How long was she left outside?

1052
00:58:38,548 --> 00:58:42,652
No, what I mean is, she wasn't chosen.

1053
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,354
She was left out by the others.

1054
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,656
Why was she left out?

1055
00:58:46,723 --> 00:58:49,659
Cindy is the biggest star there!
Why was she left out?

1056
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,861
Don't you know how much I hate that?

1057
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:55,098
Well, the guys voted for the girls.

1058
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:56,933
But Cindy got no votes.

1059
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,771
What?

1060
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:03,907
Are you okay?

1061
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:06,676
It's better this way.

1062
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,212
This puts me in a predicament.

1063
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,948
I got flustered, and my face turned red.

1064
00:59:12,916 --> 00:59:14,784
The imperfection will make me look cute.

1065
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,988
This is a variety show. It should be fun.

1066
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,990
If you are okay with it...

1067
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,426
I don't want to be around them anyway.

1068
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:26,596
Then who?

1069
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:29,666
Umbrella. Him.

1070
00:59:31,034 --> 00:59:32,535
Should I make him run to me?

1071
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,904
What?

1072
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,006
Hey...

1073
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,924
See? That's how simpleminded he is.

1074
00:59:54,991 --> 00:59:56,092
He's so transparent.

1075
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:00,096
I could have good chemistry with him.

1076
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,466
It could be better to partner up
with someone who is not a celebrity.

1077
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,004
I'm a top star.
It'll help me seem so easygoing.

1078
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,138
Maybe?

1079
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:14,344
But that producer needs to like you, too.

1080
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,047
Hey.

1081
01:00:18,648 --> 01:00:23,186
If I wanted to, I could make him
totally fall for me in two days.

1082
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:24,887
Why?

1083
01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:29,559
Because he's easy.

1084
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,365
So you brought the umbrella.

1085
01:00:46,342 --> 01:00:50,313
I think it's nice being with you
like this.

1086
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,516
Oh. I see...

1087
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,553
Do you know any of my songs?

1088
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,957
I'm sorry, but not really...

1089
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,329
Well, that's understandable.

1090
01:01:06,729 --> 01:01:08,264
I guess you don't listen to the radio.

1091
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,934
I'll find your songs and listen to them.

1092
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,171
Did you see my TV drama?

1093
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,572
I'll look it up next time.

1094
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:22,578
Wow, I guess you don't watch TV, either.

1095
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,952
It's okay that he didn't know.

1096
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,690
I'm being humiliated a lot today.

1097
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:37,326
No. I'm not upset.

1098
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,929
From now on, I shouldn't be conceited.

1099
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:42,799
I should try harder.
That's what I'm thinking.

1100
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,571
Are we almost there yet?

1101
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,240
What are the others doing?

1102
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,046
Let's hurry.

1103
01:01:57,113 --> 01:01:58,548
-To the front.
-Alright.

1104
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,584
-Okay.
-How shall we...

1105
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,454
-Han-na, can you...
-This should be...

1106
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:05,955
But this is slow.

1107
01:02:06,022 --> 01:02:07,056
Who is that?

1108
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,430
Man. Why is that woman here?

1109
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,200
Maybe she came to the set

1110
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:19,836
because we won't
let her see the original footage.

1111
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:22,705
Don't let her come over here.
I won't even respond to her.

1112
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:35,051
Ma'am.

1113
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,287
Ma'am.

1114
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:45,461
It looks like she wasn't coming over here.

1115
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,834
Hey! Answer me!

1116
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,402
Why didn't you choose Cindy?

1117
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:55,605
Who are you?

1118
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,141
Who said to ask a question? Answer me!

1119
01:02:58,207 --> 01:02:59,709
Why didn't you choose Cindy?

1120
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:01,511
What didn't you like about her?

1121
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:02,512
Did...

1122
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:04,981
Them?

1123
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:07,283
They're not much to look at.

1124
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,420
Were you playing hard to get?

1125
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,490
Which agency are you in? Tell me.

1126
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:15,591
YG Entertainment.

1127
01:03:15,658 --> 01:03:17,860
YG? Yang Hyun-suk?

1128
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,930
Did he tell you not to pick Cindy?

1129
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,568
Why do you keep running away from me?
Who did you pick?

1130
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:26,803
Sandara.

1131
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,271
Sandara?

1132
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,973
Which agency are you in?

1133
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,743
YG Entertainment.

1134
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:35,044
YG again?

1135
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,215
Looks like Mr. Yang
has this show in his pocket.

1136
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:42,919
Did he say to stick together?
Is that what he told you to do?

1137
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:45,922
You! What about you?

1138
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,323
Do you want to sign with us?

1139
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:49,225
Me?

1140
01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:52,295
What are you doing on our set?

1141
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:57,233
Producer Ra, don't take it out
on me like this.

1142
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,002
How dare you humiliate Cindy?

1143
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,604
Zero votes?

1144
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:04,640
Is this why you made Cindy do your show?

1145
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:09,278
I didn't make her do anything!
She got zero votes. What can I do?

1146
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,814
What do you mean? Make them vote again.

1147
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:16,886
Edit out her being left out.
Tell her to come here and shoot it again.

1148
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,655
I yelled at all the boys,

1149
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:21,357
so they won't be able to do that again.

1150
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,227
This is such nonsense--

1151
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,262
Where is Cindy right now?

1152
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:31,267
Are we going to keep hiking like this?

1153
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,704
We still have 3 km to go.

1154
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:36,839
You'll play a game of chance for dinner.

1155
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:43,379
But it's boring if we keep walking along
in total silence.

1156
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,183
Let's play Rock-paper-scissors.
Loser carries the luggage.

1157
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,452
-What?
-I'll play scissors.

1158
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:52,655
Don't play, and you lose!
Rock, paper, scissors!

1159
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,073
I'll just carry the luggage.

1160
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,542
No. I lost fair and square.

1161
01:05:15,811 --> 01:05:19,415
I didn't think you'd be so serious

1162
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:22,051
playing Rock-paper-scissors with a girl.

1163
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:23,252
Goodness!

1164
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:42,505
Your shoelace is untied.

1165
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,798
Wow, I can't believe Cindy did this to us.

1166
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,835
Are we doing the show
without the top-ranking singer?

1167
01:06:13,269 --> 01:06:14,603
Seriously.

1168
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:16,639
Producer Tak didn't have to be
so hard on her.

1169
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:25,514
Hello?

1170
01:06:25,715 --> 01:06:27,917
Ye-jin, this is Jun-mo's mom.

1171
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,218
Hello, ma'am.

1172
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,755
Have some grapefruit juice.

1173
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,790
Yes. Thanks.

1174
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:40,963
Is something wrong?

1175
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:46,802
Ye-jin, tell me honestly.

1176
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,272
Jun-mo has a girlfriend, right?

1177
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:52,508
Excuse me?

1178
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,077
It's good for him to have
a girl at his age.

1179
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:56,579
He needs to get married.

1180
01:06:57,446 --> 01:07:02,284
But I'm guessing she's not good enough
for him to show her to us.

1181
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,387
Why do you think so?

1182
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:06,155
He's been telling me
not to come to Yeouido

1183
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,891
since two months ago.

1184
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:11,060
He said he'll come to Banpo
if he needs anything.

1185
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:14,697
It's been so long,

1186
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,500
so I stopped by Jun-mo's house earlier.

1187
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:21,337
But he changed his passcode.

1188
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,172
It's been 0000 for years.

1189
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,441
Isn't that weird?

1190
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:29,645
Maybe he just changed it.

1191
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,248
It's dangerous
if the passcode is too easy.

1192
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,851
But that's not the problem.

1193
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:40,990
Jun-mo's credit card bill came to Banpo.

1194
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:45,828
He's been going to
strange places these days.

1195
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:51,400
It says he went
to Seongbinjang over ten times.

1196
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,337
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

1197
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:01,177
Ma'am, that's a Chinese restaurant
near here.

1198
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,079
Jun-mo likes that place.

1199
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,681
Really?

1200
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,451
So that's what it is?

1201
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,120
No wonder.

1202
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:16,559
Anyway,
could you set Jun-mo up with a girl?

1203
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,027
Do you know anyone?

1204
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:21,864
Well...

1205
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:27,169
All of my friends are married.

1206
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,872
Not a friend.

1207
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:32,875
Jun-mo wouldn't want a girl his age.

1208
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,112
Any juniors? In their 20s.

1209
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:40,649
Wow.

1210
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,519
Jun-mo's mom still has it in her.

1211
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,857
She really knows how to frustrate people.
She's a professional at it.

1212
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:51,494
What if she visits the house unannounced?

1213
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,129
I'm nervous.

1214
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,033
Ye-jin, I'm a future doctor,

1215
01:08:58,234 --> 01:08:59,835
and you have a specialized job.

1216
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,804
Why are we so pathetic right now?

1217
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:06,909
Hey, having a specialized job means
nothing compared to owning a property.

1218
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:10,813
If only Mom hadn't sold our house to her.

1219
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:12,948
Our lives would be much better, right?

1220
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,350
I told you.

1221
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,952
Marry Jun-mo and get our house back.

1222
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:18,220
Shut it.

1223
01:09:19,288 --> 01:09:20,256
What's with you?

1224
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,859
We have to get back at Jun-mo's mom
for our mom.

1225
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,630
She believes the two of you
are just friends.

1226
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,064
You can really shock her.

1227
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,733
Shut up and eat your cup noodle.

1228
01:09:31,767 --> 01:09:35,471
You've acted like friends
for over 20 years.

1229
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:36,572
It won't be easy.

1230
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:40,876
I don't know about girls,

1231
01:09:41,744 --> 01:09:46,282
but a guy having a girl as a close friend
for a long time...

1232
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:54,223
What? What about it?

1233
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:58,093
It means he likes you. At least a little.

1234
01:09:58,894 --> 01:10:01,830
Guys aren't even friends with girls
they're not interested in.

1235
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:07,870
I've noticed this about you these days...

1236
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:08,771
Yes.

1237
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,374
Don't you dare try and teach me!
You're just a baby. What do you know?

1238
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:27,957
Yes, it's almost ready.

1239
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:31,026
I printed it out.

1240
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:38,400
Jun-mo, should I bring them out?

1241
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,379
Isn't it that way?

1242
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,384
Since it's like this,
I think it's this way.

1243
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:33,455
How much farther?

1244
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:36,425
We'll get there momentarily.

1245
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:38,327
I think.

1246
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,602
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

1247
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:50,939
04. UNDERSTANDING REAL VARIETY SHOWS
PLAYING A CHARACTER MIGHT NOT HELP

1248
01:11:51,173 --> 01:11:54,076
It's past 9:00 p.m. now.

1249
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,545
Shouldn't we hurry and find the place?

1250
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,082
-Try calling them.
-Right.

1251
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:11,927
I don't get any reception here.

1252
01:12:13,128 --> 01:12:14,463
I have to change the camera battery.

1253
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,134
What are you doing?

1254
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:23,939
I haven't eaten a thing all day,
and we've just been wandering around.

1255
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:27,343
I'm getting anxious
because it looks like it's going to rain.

1256
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,645
I'll carry the luggage.

1257
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:30,779
I've been wanting to...

1258
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,849
I lost Rock-paper-scissors and carried it
all day. It's already on camera.

1259
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,984
It'll make me look bad
if you carry it now.

1260
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:40,556
Will you take responsibility
if I get criticized?

1261
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:51,667
Oh, no...

1262
01:15:20,549 --> 01:15:21,884
Looking for me, Producer?

1263
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,089
-You always blackout when you drink.
-I drank too much last night.

1264
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,758
That drinking habit of yours...

1265
01:16:02,824 --> 01:16:04,159
Goodness! What are you doing here?

1266
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,794
But if you stay out all night,

1267
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:09,765
you're leaving your sister
alone in the house with a man.

1268
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:12,034
That's a bit... you know...

1269
01:16:12,434 --> 01:16:14,670
"No one loved him.

1270
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,973
No one was close to him."

1271
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:21,209
I'm going to give you a special mission.

1272
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,145
Find out if Jun-mo heard what you heard.

1273
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:25,380
I'd say that's a special mission.

1274
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:27,349
Do you really not remember?
