1
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:46,880
I thought about
who would need the umbrella more.

2
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,615
The camera is vulnerable to moisture,

3
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,083
so I made a quick decision.

4
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,552
What if he makes her play

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,054
a game of chance for dinner?

6
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,522
Fail.

7
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,123
You starved Cindy since yesterday?

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,458
She failed the dinner mission...

9
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,960
Are you trying to kill her?

10
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:02,629
So we meet again, Cindy.

11
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,631
I didn't recognize you without makeup.

12
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:05,999
She takes producers for fools.

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,500
-You did well for your first shoot.
-Okay.

14
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:09,969
But you drank a lot, too.

15
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,372
Hey, I can handle my alcohol.

16
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,606
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,208
Just control yourself.

18
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,444
When she gets drunk, she has no secrets.

19
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,979
Did you tell people I'm living
at Jun-mo's house?

20
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,714
-Producer Tak, people will find out.
-Why you...

21
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:23,183
And she doesn't stop there.

22
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,217
She starts to act cute.

23
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,286
Ye-jin wants to go to a cart bar!

24
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:31,091
"Nobody was friends with her."

25
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,059
You're going on a blind date?

26
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,028
Then why did you kiss me?

27
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,099
I'm going to give you a special mission.

28
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,134
Find out if Jun-mo heard what you heard.

29
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,670
I'd say that's a special mission.

30
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,339
However, if he's not showing any reaction

31
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,075
despite remembering
what I said to him last night,

32
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,712
doesn't that mean he edited out
that truth?

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,815
You and the lady were totally wasted.

34
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,383
What about the man we came with?

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,553
You even yelled at that other guy.

36
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,889
Producer Tak just said she likes you!

37
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,324
I won't let you two leave.

38
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,793
You really don't remember?

39
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,910
Hey, punk.

40
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,380
Why did you leave your phone behind?

41
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:31,351
I wanted to ask for sea eel too.

42
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,653
They don't accept credit cards there.

43
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,022
What?

44
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:38,825
You said you paid 70,000 won
with your credit card there.

45
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:43,263
But that cart bar
doesn't accept credit cards.

46
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,174
Do you now remember

47
00:02:56,342 --> 00:03:00,446
what Producer Tak said that night,
which you're consciously trying to forget?

48
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,954
Do you remember it?

49
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,564
Of course, I remember. Why wouldn't I?

50
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,566
That accident...

51
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,369
Accidents occur

52
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,305
when there are three happenings.

53
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,840
Let's have a toast
and put it all behind us.

54
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,377
I don't drink beer.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,717
Ye-jin happened to get angry that day.

56
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:40,653
She happened to drink on an empty stomach.

57
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,156
Ye-jin wants a second round of drinks!

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,925
Ye-jin wants to go to a cart bar!

59
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,327
Guys! Let's hurry!

60
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,028
She was already totally drunk,

61
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,431
so I should've told her to just go home.

62
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,933
Come on, guys!
Hey, make me fly! Over there!

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,669
A puddle! Careful!

64
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,071
Jeez...

65
00:03:58,137 --> 00:04:00,607
But I happened to want to drink, too.

66
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,176
These reasons were enough to leave

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,878
a big impact on the outcome
of the accident.

68
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,146
You should stop drinking.

69
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,450
What really kills me is that

70
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,255
I usually tell you when I like someone.

71
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,493
But now that I like you,

72
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,564
there's no one I can confide in.

73
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,567
That's really...

74
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,105
That's what really kills me.

75
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:49,622
Since Producer Tak said she likes you,

76
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,225
I won't let you two leave.

77
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,629
I won't let you two leave.

78
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,698
I don't like that...

79
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:02,235
Jun-mo.

80
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:06,472
Why do you keep staggering back and forth?

81
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,007
You'll end up falling.

82
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,310
Walk straight. Straight.

83
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:11,411
Be careful.

84
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,713
You walk straight.

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,682
Go to your house already.

86
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,183
Where are we?

87
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:18,985
No.

88
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,120
I feel uneasy about this.

89
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,290
I'll go after I see you two get in safely.

90
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,262
Jeez. Give me a break.

91
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,734
Ye-jin, did you eat a lot?

92
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,442
It's definitely
going to hurt until tomorrow.

93
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,049
After that chaotic mess of a night,

94
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,818
I decided to forget what happened.

95
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,756
I thought if I forgot,

96
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,958
it would be like it never happened.

97
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,528
But this guy happened to remember it.

98
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,997
Are you glaring at me?

99
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,669
How I look at you isn't important.

100
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,739
Personally, I think you're cowardly.

101
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,673
Why?

102
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,610
You may have edited it out
from your memory,

103
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,246
but I think you still have the original.

104
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,815
Yeah, I have the original.

105
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,918
But do I discard that original,

106
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,187
or save it somewhere?

107
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,822
That's up to the owner of the tape.

108
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,925
That's for the owner to decide.

109
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,327
I think

110
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,631
you've never had a crush on anyone before.

111
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,568
It seems like you've never felt that way.

112
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,271
You've never felt that fear of

113
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:21,507
telling someone you like how you feel.

114
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,278
It's like, you like them so much,
you can't give up on them.

115
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,113
Yet you can tell them how you feel because

116
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,748
you're scared that would
make things worse.

117
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,686
If you knew how hard that was,

118
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:40,359
you wouldn't pretend
you didn't hear Producer Tak,

119
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,196
or that you got drunk and don't remember.

120
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,998
You wouldn't lie like that.

121
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,134
So that's the reason

122
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,605
you've been following me around

123
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,340
like a puppy the last few days?

124
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:56,042
You seemed really drunk last night.

125
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:58,277
Do you really not remember
what happened at the cart bar?

126
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,147
Do you usually blackout
when you get drunk?

127
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,382
What percentage, probability-wise?

128
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,718
A hundred percent! Leave me alone!

129
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:06,953
Is that why you kept asking?

130
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:09,655
To check if I remembered anything?

131
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,159
You dared to snoop on your senior?

132
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,096
I hear you graduated from law school.

133
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,465
Be a prosecutor. Not a producer.

134
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,766
Use your skills.

135
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,335
You're good at interrogating.

136
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:26,806
No. I want to be a witness.

137
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:28,608
As a witness of this incident,

138
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,944
I feel it's my duty to deliver the truth.

139
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,045
To whom?

140
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,213
Of course...

141
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,750
To Producer Tak.

142
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,019
Are you worried about Ye-jin?

143
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,758
Can you not do that?

144
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,660
Excuse me?

145
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,996
Because...

146
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,001
we have editing to do.

147
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,135
Let me go--

148
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,105
If we keep chatting and miss the deadline,

149
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,439
will you take responsibility?

150
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,276
That would be a major broadcast mishap.

151
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,877
-Well?
-Producer Ra...

152
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:05,878
I'll...

153
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:17,990
I have to change the camera battery.

154
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,728
-Have some coffee, Producer Ra.
-What are you doing?

155
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,166
I haven't eaten a thing all day,
and we've just been wandering around.

156
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,504
I haven't eaten a thing all day,
and we've just been wandering around.

157
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,340
I'm getting anxious
because it looks like it's going to rain.

158
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,715
Hey! Is this coffee or sugar water?

159
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,650
How much syrup did you dump in here?

160
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,623
You said to add a lot of syrup.

161
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,124
When did I...

162
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,327
I don't like sweets,

163
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,529
so I told you not to add any syrup!

164
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,165
Oh... Did you?

165
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,468
I thought you told me to add a lot.

166
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,303
Wow. Jeez.

167
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,939
You're even lying now?

168
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:09,742
Would you like some of mine?

169
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,377
Forget it. You drink it.

170
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,050
Hey, how is this?

171
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,823
It's just okay.

172
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,559
This isn't funny?

173
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,828
Well, it's just...

174
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,197
It's kind of obvious.

175
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,299
Are you rebelling?

176
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,367
No.

177
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,336
I just said that because I feel

178
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,804
it's really obvious and played out.

179
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,674
And I added a lot of syrup
because I thought

180
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,809
you said to add a lot. That's all.

181
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:48,414
Jeez. You're a terrible liar.

182
00:10:49,015 --> 00:10:49,915
...and lived in them.

183
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,052
-You're really obvious.
-However, this is the opposite.

184
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,121
-It's not indoors.
-Sleeping outdoors?

185
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,589
Correct!

186
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,092
How about this shot?

187
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,694
This is funny, right?

188
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,098
Man, this guy...

189
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,334
Where'd he go?

190
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,302
Why is he rebelling these days?

191
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:11,370
Did he hit puberty?

192
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,409
Here.

193
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:22,982
As expected...

194
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,283
It's awesome, right?

195
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,919
If you get a man, don't do anything else.

196
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:28,688
Bring him home and cook for him.

197
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,290
Jun-mo and I will get out of your way.

198
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,427
I should seduce a guy with food?

199
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,195
Who cares what you use?

200
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,797
Just get him and marry him.

201
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,733
I hope you get seduced by food
and end up getting married.

202
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,303
I pray that you get seduced
by catfish stew and get married.

203
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:48,941
DOOR SCRAPE

204
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:54,013
Hey, Seung-chan.

205
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:02,688
Sit down.

206
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,325
Aren't you busy?
I thought you had to work all night.

207
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,361
I had to stop by my house briefly,

208
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,297
and I had something to tell you.

209
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,132
What is it?

210
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,969
It's about that night.

211
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,037
Yeah.

212
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,940
I don't think you have to worry about it.

213
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,810
Producer Ra was totally drunk that night.

214
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,680
Yeah? How did you find out?

215
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:32,384
I went to the cart bar, and the lady said

216
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,121
he was the most drunk that night.

217
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,556
He was totally out of it, apparently.

218
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:39,892
Yeah?

219
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,897
So Jun-mo got wasted as usual.

220
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:47,266
I was worried for no reason.

221
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,603
Yes. Now, you don't have to worry anymore.

222
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:56,976
-But Seung-chan...
-Yes?

223
00:12:57,676 --> 00:13:00,513
I feel kind of embarrassed around you now.

224
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,516
Please don't be.

225
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:09,121
I don't think it's embarrassing

226
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,290
when someone likes someone else.

227
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,526
Oh, come on.

228
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,629
It's not that I like him...

229
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,101
When did you start living
in this apartment?

230
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,470
Since I was born.

231
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:25,604
Really?

232
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,106
Me, too.

233
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:31,076
The place I live now.

234
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,678
Producer Ra's house?

235
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,282
It's his place now,
but it was my house back in the day.

236
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,983
What happened?

237
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,587
My dad was laid off from the bank
during the IMF financial crisis,

238
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,924
and he tried to start a business,
which ended up tanking.

239
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,959
So things got hard for my family.

240
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,261
We had to move to the countryside.

241
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,598
We put that place up for sale
for a pittance,

242
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,201
and it was Jun-mo's mom who bought it.

243
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,306
So that's why it's Jun-mo's house now?

244
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,741
And now I live with him at my old house.

245
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,511
An unfortunate twist of fate.

246
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:14,987
This playground
has been here since I was a kid.

247
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,424
I played a lot here, too.

248
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,896
I played with Jun-mo a lot.

249
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,816
Ye-jin.

250
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,485
Will you keep being upset?

251
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,421
Wouldn't you, if you were me?

252
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:51,323
My house became your house!

253
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,029
You'd better not use my room, Jun-mo!

254
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,113
Get out of here. Scram.

255
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,881
Beat it.

256
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,060
Hey.

257
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,031
What are you doing?

258
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,466
Stop crying if you want me to stop.

259
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,568
My grandma said that if you cry,

260
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,205
you'll always get more things
to cry about.

261
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,657
I can't believe I just told you that.

262
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,194
I told you before.

263
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,899
If you ever want
to tell someone something,

264
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,968
but you have nobody to tell,

265
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,437
you can tell me.

266
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,208
You're all grown up, Seung-chan.

267
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,446
But hey...

268
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,781
Is it okay for you to be out this long?

269
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,283
You keep getting calls.

270
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,957
Yes. I'll be right there.

271
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,795
CONTACT LIST
DOOR SCRAPE

272
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:16,668
BAEK SEUNG-CHAN

273
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,495
Hey. I was so shocked.

274
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,130
What's up with that woman?

275
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,999
What do you mean?

276
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,034
She works in administration.

277
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,202
Exactly.

278
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,970
But how does she have that much money?

279
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:55,174
Maybe she embezzled toner and paper...

280
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,341
Yeah, okay.

281
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,744
She can save up selling paper
for 100 years.

282
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,012
Move! You're distracting me!

283
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,481
I have to check the captions. Jeez.

284
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,617
Oh, come on.

285
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,554
Don't you have work to do? Jeez.

286
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,123
Doesn't she look like
she has a lot of secrets?

287
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,592
She's not cheery. She looks gloomy.

288
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,727
Maybe she dug up dirt on someone high-up.

289
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:18,230
How can she keep that sweet job so long?

290
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,865
I actually feel bad for her.

291
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,001
She's unhappy, so she obsesses over
toner and paper.

292
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,437
Do you like Yang-mi?

293
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,340
-Are you nuts?
-Then just drop it.

294
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,642
All you do is talk about her these days.

295
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,678
I can't believe this. I don't like her.

296
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,513
So drop it then.

297
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,683
Oh, right. You heard from Tae-ho, right?

298
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,151
You need to help me with a special show.

299
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,085
I haven't heard.

300
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:42,287
I told him to tell you.

301
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,892
To celebrate Family Month this May,
I'm doing a special show.

302
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:51,196
The city council, district delegate,
and all sorts of big shots

303
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,099
like our CEO will be attending as guests.

304
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,435
I'm so excited, Ye-jin!

305
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:00,539
Why do I have to be a part of that?

306
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:02,107
I need a producer to do stage management.

307
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,243
What are you saying? You should do it!

308
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,545
Then who's going to
take care of all those VIPs?

309
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:09,348
Oh, good for you.

310
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,920
So what? Who's going up on stage?

311
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,556
Here.

312
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,530
Cindy?

313
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:28,033
If you go to the airport after the shoot,
you can take the 7:00 p.m. flight.

314
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,602
You'll be back in Seoul at 3:00 a.m.
after the festival in Busan.

315
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,371
You have hair and makeup at 6:00 a.m.

316
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:34,806
A shoot for a music show
in Sangam at 9:00 a.m.

317
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,341
Right after that is the Big Show.

318
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:40,078
The rehearsal is in Yeouido at 1:00 p.m.

319
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,650
You won't really have time for lunch.

320
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,555
It's not like I ever got proper meals.

321
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,926
It was a bit extreme of the CEO
to book 22 gigs in one week.

322
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,894
It's amazing
how you're able to pull this off.

323
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,262
What's the Big Show?

324
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,631
It's for KBS.

325
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,599
Oh, right.

326
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,903
Tak Ye-jin of Music Bank
is a producer for it.

327
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,473
But she's a producer for a different show.

328
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,709
For big specials,

329
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:14,146
they use other shows' producers and staff.

330
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,348
So, will...

331
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,251
Will they use the staff

332
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,320
from Two Days and One Night?

333
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,924
I don't really know that yet.

334
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:31,096
Wait, it's because of

335
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,398
that umbrella producer, isn't it?

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,570
In case he cluelessly torments you again?

337
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,339
Okay.

338
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,774
I'll be sure to get my message across.

339
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,444
I'll tell them not to let him come.

340
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:50,182
I think his name is Baek Seung-chan.

341
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,283
Hey.

342
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:52,851
What is it?

343
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,120
When I say something,

344
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,123
just take them as they are heard.

345
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,260
Don't try to find underlying meanings.

346
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,899
You told me to read

347
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,103
between the lines last time--

348
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,405
But you keep misreading!

349
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,073
Don't read.

350
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,310
Okay.

351
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,978
I won't.

352
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,918
A 10,000 won bet
on the first episode's viewer ratings.

353
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,222
This is a tradition for us.

354
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,224
With the hope that it'll be a smash hit.

355
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,694
-This isn't about the money.
-t's just for fun.

356
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,531
What do you think, Il-yong?

357
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,503
Ten percent.

358
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,872
Double digits mean it's a hit.

359
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,206
I wonder if we'll get that?

360
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:49,408
I have a good feeling.

361
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,475
Really?

362
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,078
Next is Hyeong-geun.

363
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,113
HYEONG-GEUN, 12

364
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:56,381
Twelve percent?

365
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,984
That's a bit much, isn't it?

366
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,118
It's part of the fun.

367
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,788
Right. It sure is.

368
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,258
Kim Tae-ho, our chief producer.

369
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:08,560
Tae-ho said...

370
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,995
Seven percent?

371
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,833
Come on, that's over the top.

372
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,535
You're just trying to play safe,
aren't you?

373
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,203
You're the chief producer.

374
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,639
No, it's the opposite.

375
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:22,741
I know it'll never be seven percent,

376
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,944
which in turn means
that I'm not after the money.

377
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:31,316
Okay. Our youngest, Baek Seung-chan.

378
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,919
Youngest Baek Seung-chan...

379
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:35,420
SEUNG-CHAN, 6.8

380
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,989
Oh, 6.8 percent?

381
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:40,092
Not even 7 percent, but 6.8 percent?

382
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,131
The last episode of last season
got 5.5 percent.

383
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,768
Statistically, the first episode
usually got

384
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:51,636
2 percent more than the last episode.

385
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,107
But the weather is so nice these days.

386
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:57,242
I factored in people going out on weekends

387
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,744
and subtracted 0.7 percent--

388
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,779
Stop being such a buzzkill!

389
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,384
Okay, our youngest writer.

390
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,019
MIN-JEONG, 15

391
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,288
Fifteen percent?

392
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,791
Isn't that going a bit overboard?

393
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,494
I think we can get that.

394
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,561
See?

395
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:17,896
That's how the youngest should be!

396
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,498
Bright and positive!

397
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,665
Then I'll--

398
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,733
Forget it!

399
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,269
Anyway, this time...

400
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,640
I have a good feeling about it.

401
00:23:32,377 --> 00:23:35,347
Saying that might be a bit hasty.

402
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,916
Be humble and wait for the results.

403
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,452
No, Tae-ho. This is how I feel this time.

404
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,387
I'm positive it'll turn out great!

405
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:45,190
Don't say that with such certainty.

406
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:50,562
Jun-mo's nickname is the Pele
of the entertainment department.

407
00:23:50,629 --> 00:23:52,964
When he says he has a good feeling,

408
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:53,999
things go badly.

409
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:55,567
If he says something will do terribly,

410
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,968
it's a success.

411
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,503
It's a jinx.

412
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,772
You should listen to me.

413
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,407
Don't let him act.

414
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,608
Variety shows? Don't even...

415
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,177
Just make him stick to singing.

416
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,545
He should stick to one thing.

417
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,848
He sure looks like a good singer.

418
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:11,349
You picked some great girls.

419
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,453
Where'd you get these girls?

420
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,256
They're all great, but she's the problem.

421
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:20,192
She looks too shy.

422
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,527
There's nothing special about her.

423
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:24,396
She has no individuality.

424
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,431
I think you should get rid of her.

425
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:30,068
Just do a three-member girl group.

426
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,704
I think you guys will be a hit.

427
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:34,339
This new song is great.

428
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:37,342
You'll become global stars.

429
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:40,612
The quirky energy
and screaming technique is just...

430
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:43,949
There's no group like this
in the entire world!

431
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:45,383
Can you do a shout for me?

432
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,788
It's a wrap.

433
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,157
So it's always the opposite?

434
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,861
Yes. He's consistent.
It's always the opposite.

435
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,063
So when managers pick
title tracks for artists,

436
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,265
they let Producer Ra listen to them.

437
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,566
If he says it's good, they omit it.

438
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,802
If he says it'll fail,
they make it a title track.

439
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:07,572
I had been thinking for a while

440
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:10,709
that Producer Ra has poor judgment.

441
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,479
Please don't tell him I told you this.

442
00:25:14,546 --> 00:25:15,647
Okay.

443
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:18,617
Seung-chan should watch this. Where is he?

444
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,018
He's on his way.

445
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,921
-Seung-chan?
-Is that you?

446
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,123
It's Yeong-chan, Mom.

447
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,125
It's Yeong-chan.

448
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,261
Oh, hey. You're here.

449
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,930
What? Are you disappointed?

450
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,798
No.

451
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,500
Come on.

452
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,335
We're happy to see our eldest son.

453
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,272
Didn't you come two days ago?
You're here again.

454
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,273
What brings you here?

455
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:43,408
This is cucumber kimchi.

456
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,277
My wife said to bring it to you guys.

457
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,779
She doesn't show it directly,
but she really cares.

458
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,347
Seung-chan, is that you?

459
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:51,516
Yes, Mom.

460
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,919
Goodness! It's been days!

461
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,421
Look, honey! His face got so slim!

462
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,123
You must've worked so hard!

463
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,091
-My poor boy!
-Are your subordinates unruly?

464
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:01,693
I don't have any subordinates.

465
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,595
-I'm going to go wash up.
-Go ahead.

466
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,163
Oh, my boy.

467
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,372
All they do is run around.
Why do you watch this?

468
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,475
I don't want to be left out
when I talk with my friends tomorrow.

469
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,178
Two Days and One Night is daddy's show.

470
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,513
No...

471
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,615
Just once.

472
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,917
Just let me watch it.

473
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,123
Wait. Leave it.

474
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:39,831
This is funny.

475
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,001
Jae-suk is a funny guy.

476
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,104
Let's watch until the commercial.

477
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,974
What do you mean?

478
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,077
My son is the main producer of the show.

479
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,914
He didn't do the entire thing himself.

480
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,582
He must have some subordinates.

481
00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:00,852
Dad, I'm the subordinate.

482
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,388
It's starting.

483
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:05,256
Let's watch!

484
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:11,896
Seven, eight, nine...

485
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,198
Ten! Stop!

486
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,268
I won!

487
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,570
Correct!

488
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,044
Maybe it's because we don't know them.

489
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,513
It's not that funny.

490
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,615
I'm sure it'll get better.

491
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,451
It's because Seung-chan is inexperienced.

492
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:38,089
One day, he'll do a famous show

493
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,192
with people like Noh Sa-yeon
and Lee Deok-hwa.

494
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,529
I like Heo Cham and Lee Taek-rim.

495
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,532
You'll go somewhere else
instead of the base camp.

496
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,702
Where does that laughter come from?

497
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,772
Do they still laugh when it's not funny?

498
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:57,008
That was funny--

499
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,844
Seung-chan, isn't that you?

500
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,480
Oh, wow.

501
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,785
It is Seung-chan!

502
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:09,821
-Hey.
-Yeah?

503
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,523
He is a producer,

504
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,759
but he's tying someone's shoelace.

505
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,061
Goodness, Seung-chan.

506
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:18,129
There must have been a reason.

507
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,564
Did she tell you to tie them?

508
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:21,099
She has hands of her own!

509
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,168
Why did she tell my son
to tie her shoelace?

510
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,669
Mom, it's not like that--

511
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:25,770
Is Cindy pretty?

512
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,139
If she's pretty,
he has to tie her shoelaces?

513
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,108
She looked so tired--

514
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,777
Have you ever even tied my shoelace?

515
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:33,878
You only wear

516
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,482
those health shoes with no laces.

517
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,484
Yeah, Mom. You always wear those shoes.

518
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,385
Jeez!

519
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,286
What?

520
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:42,620
She's that girl from before.

521
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,155
The one who danced in her underwear.

522
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,592
She sure looks like a nasty girl!

523
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,466
HELPFUL ASSISTANT PRODUCER
TYING HER SHOELACE

524
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,134
A HEART-WARMING SCENE

525
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,041
It's funny? Pretty good?

526
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,477
That was a good caption, right?

527
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:06,611
Yeah.

528
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:12,350
Seung-chan doesn't look so bad on screen.

529
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,585
He's pretty good.

530
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,222
I thought he was a kid,
but he seems manly.

531
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:20,058
It's because I did a great job in editing!

532
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,761
A man? Please. He's a kid.

533
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,698
But is it Goryeong, Gyeongsangnam-do?

534
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,166
Isn't it Gyeongsangbuk-do?

535
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,703
THE FIRST DESTINATION,
GORYEONG GYEONGSANGNAM-DO

536
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,641
You should've checked that thoroughly!

537
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,143
What happened?

538
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,245
The caption was wrong!

539
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:41,146
JUN-MO'S MOM

540
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:43,081
Who wrote that caption?

541
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,084
Jeez!

542
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,387
Yes, it's okay. Go ahead, ma'am.

543
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,891
So, did you look into what I asked about?

544
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,926
A girl for Jun-mo.

545
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,928
Well...

546
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,832
I don't really know anyone suitable
to set him up with.

547
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,201
I heard he has a blind date

548
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,602
with a female prosecutor.

549
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,905
But he didn't go on that important date.

550
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,007
Oh, he didn't?

551
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,575
Why not?

552
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,311
He fell asleep in the editing room.

553
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:14,546
His phone was off.

554
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,047
I see.

555
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:20,919
Jun-mo is such a heavy sleeper.

556
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,054
It's a problem.

557
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,355
So I reset the date

558
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,025
for the day after tomorrow.

559
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:28,293
I went out of my way to reset it.

560
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,396
But he suddenly said he wouldn't go.

561
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,131
Though he'd agreed the first time.

562
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:36,034
Try talking to him.

563
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:40,071
It'd be a shame if he didn't meet her.

564
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,006
But, ma'am.

565
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,909
Jun-mo is a grown man now.

566
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,278
Would he even listen to me?

567
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:51,649
I think you should let him decide
for himself.

568
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:54,285
If he doesn't go,
I'll burst into his place

569
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,621
and live with him and nag him
until he goes.

570
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,956
I'll talk to him.

571
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,691
Of course. Yes.

572
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:01,960
Jun-mo listens to me.

573
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,762
Is the show over?

574
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,231
Yeah.

575
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,032
How was the reaction?

576
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,267
Not good.

577
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,603
"Learn geography."

578
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:12,570
"Are you brainless?"

579
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:13,771
"You think TV is a joke?"

580
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:14,939
Hey.

581
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,208
You have so many people on your team,

582
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,377
and nobody caught that?

583
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,446
During the preliminary edit, the playback,

584
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:24,582
and the final edit. You had three chances.

585
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,683
Beats me.

586
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,487
All those people saw it.
How did we miss it?

587
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,822
Why?

588
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,191
How did you miss that?

589
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,797
You know how they say that

590
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,367
broadcasting mishaps
sometimes happen for a reason.

591
00:31:42,967 --> 00:31:46,371
No matter how many times you review it,

592
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,273
the mistakes get overlooked. It happens.

593
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,308
Whatever!

594
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,110
Going to work tomorrow

595
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:54,312
is a scarier prospect than facing a ghost.

596
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:58,850
What's most important is how you handle

597
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,120
the mistake the next day.

598
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,390
Don't forget about the work manual.

599
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:08,059
Check everything in there

600
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,394
and handle this well.

601
00:32:18,803 --> 00:32:20,238
How about some beer?

602
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,540
Beer. What do you say?

603
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,778
Get up.

604
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,820
This is nice.

605
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,091
They say a spring night is priceless.

606
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,460
Just forget it all,

607
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:45,129
and let's enjoy this spring night.

608
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,464
That's what life is all about.

609
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,199
Here.

610
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:52,770
Yeah, that's life.

611
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,382
By the way,

612
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:08,019
that female prosecutor you mentioned
the other day...

613
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,287
I met her.

614
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,456
You did?

615
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,490
Sure.

616
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,125
I told you I had a blind date.

617
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,830
Yeah? Is she pretty?

618
00:33:18,896 --> 00:33:20,732
Yeah, she is.

619
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:23,601
I see. So she's pretty.

620
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,870
Did you set a second date?

621
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,038
Yeah.

622
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:37,615
What are you doing?

623
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,950
Say that again.

624
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,118
What?

625
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,786
Say that again.

626
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,022
You went on the blind date?

627
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,390
Yeah, I did.

628
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,625
And set a second date?

629
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,627
Yeah.

630
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:52,530
Why aren't you looking me in the eye?

631
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,400
I'm looking at you.

632
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:57,135
Get off me.

633
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,104
Why are you lying?

634
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,606
I am not.

635
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,664
So you heard everything I said.

636
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,001
What are you talking about?

637
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:32,303
You heard it.

638
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,072
What I said at the cart bar that night.

639
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,407
You're drawing the line for me.

640
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,310
I am not.

641
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,511
So...

642
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:44,282
You think I'll go after you
while you're still single,

643
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,150
so you lied about going on the blind date

644
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,786
and setting a second date. Is that it?

645
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:53,124
Jeez. So you're drawing a very clear line.

646
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:55,793
That's not true!

647
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:57,962
You don't know.

648
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,530
Don't jump to conclusions!

649
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,665
Then what is it?

650
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,334
It was just an accident, wasn't it?

651
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,203
Did you really mean what you said?

652
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:09,273
If I told you I remembered,

653
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:12,443
things would get awkward between us.

654
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,214
Things are good now. It's comfortable.

655
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,283
Yeah.

656
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,520
I might be the problem.

657
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,356
I brought about the mess

658
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:27,725
and I'm making you clean up after me.

659
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,095
Sorry about that.

660
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:35,833
Soon, I'll clean up after myself.

661
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,513
Yeah, you're right.

662
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:50,748
It was an accident. It wasn't the truth.

663
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:52,717
You think I'm crazy?

664
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,418
I've known you forever.

665
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,490
But for some strange reason, right now,

666
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,862
I feel more hurt and humiliated than
when I'd been rejected by other men.

667
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:09,033
That's what you've done to me.

668
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,572
Hey...

669
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:56,147
CREATIVITY IS ABOUT
CONNECTING VARIOUS IDEAS

670
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,493
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT RE-RUN, 6.9%
LET'S GO! DREAM TEAM, 5%

671
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,728
HAPPY TOGETHER SPECIAL, 5.1%

672
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,830
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT, 6.8%

673
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,465
Baek Seung-chan,

674
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,001
that lucky little punk...

675
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,270
How did he know?

676
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,676
Here.

677
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,679
How did you get it exactly right?

678
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,849
Spend this on something good.

679
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,151
You're amazing.

680
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,954
Congratulations, Nostradamus.

681
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:01,612
You could be a fortune teller.

682
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:04,882
I'm sorry.

683
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,285
Why? You got it exactly right.

684
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,519
Good job.

685
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:09,987
Are you happy?

686
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,123
Since we got what you predicted?

687
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,393
Tae-ho. You pay, too.

688
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,861
Seung-chan guessed precisely

689
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,530
that we'd get 6.8 percent viewer ratings.

690
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:21,632
No, it's okay...

691
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,969
I was only off by 0.2 percent.
It's like I got it right, too...

692
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:31,275
Here.

693
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,346
The chief director wants to see you now.

694
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,362
Are you Producer Baek Seung-chan?

695
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,731
Yes.

696
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,132
I heard the rumors.

697
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,768
We're planning a new show.

698
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,604
What do you think the viewer ratings
for the first episode will be?

699
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:11,982
Excuse me.

700
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:17,755
I enjoyed the show yesterday.

701
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,390
You look good on screen.

702
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,925
Thank you.

703
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,798
Our team didn't ask for paper.

704
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:33,971
Keep it. It'll come in handy.

705
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,041
Thank you.

706
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,544
What do you think will happen to me?

707
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,647
Excuse me?

708
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,384
Does anything come to mind?

709
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:51,188
Do you see my future?

710
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,291
What about my love life?

711
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,194
I heard you predict things well.

712
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,230
What should I yell at you for first?

713
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,432
What is there?

714
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,769
The broadcast mishap
and the viewer ratings.

715
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,173
Whatever you'd like first.

716
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,943
You took an exam to get your job here,

717
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,413
but you couldn't tell Gyeongsangbuk-do

718
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,647
from Gyeongsangnam-do?

719
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,550
Goryeong, Gyeongsangbuk-do. It sounds off.

720
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,587
Goryeong, Gyeongsangnam-do.
That's natural.

721
00:40:23,988 --> 00:40:25,122
-Sir.
-Yeah?

722
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,057
It's Goryeong, Gyeongsangbuk-do.

723
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,926
Gyeongsangnam-do was the mistake.

724
00:40:28,993 --> 00:40:31,762
I guess it is pretty confusing.

725
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:33,697
Yes, it happens.

726
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,932
I told you.

727
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,869
And that's why
you should've paid closer attention.

728
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,272
I'm sorry.

729
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,341
I made a phone call to apologize
to the Goryeong district office.

730
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,244
And I said we'd put an apology caption
in the next episode.

731
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,779
They said they understood.

732
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,649
But that's not the issue.

733
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:52,983
Sorry?

734
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,053
The CEO's hometown is Goryeong.

735
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:57,788
Oh, my God!

736
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,657
You have to find out how this happened.

737
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:02,960
How this unforgivable mistake happened.

738
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,297
I need to tell him something
when I report to him.

739
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:09,667
You're not going home?

740
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,636
I have to write a report.
You all go ahead.

741
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:15,072
Bye.

742
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,907
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

743
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,682
Although proper nouns like location names

744
00:41:24,748 --> 00:41:27,051
have to be checked several times,

745
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,188
the producer who happened
to stay up all night

746
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,524
missed it because he dozed off.

747
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:34,992
Have some coffee.

748
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,261
The writer happened to drink coffee

749
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,697
and missed it then.

750
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,067
The light in the final editing room

751
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:46,170
we'd been asking to get fixed
for six months

752
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:48,572
happened to blink more severely that day,

753
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,474
so everyone missed it.

754
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:55,346
Everyone had their reasons and excuses

755
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,947
for what caused this accident.

756
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,184
As the producer of this show,

757
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:02,253
I feel the heavy weight of responsibility.

758
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:18,602
It's important what you do
after an accident.

759
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,205
What's next is important...

760
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:26,777
What should I do?

761
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:40,024
-Producer Tak!
-Goodness!

762
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,826
Did I startle you?

763
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,562
Of course, you did.

764
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:46,096
Don't sneak up on me.

765
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:48,933
I'm sorry. I was just happy to see you.

766
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,935
Why?

767
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,939
Did you come running to me

768
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,607
to get your payment for today?

769
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,345
You're very thorough.

770
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,149
But I can't pay you right now.
I have no cash.

771
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,718
Then let me buy you dinner.

772
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,086
You?

773
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,655
Yes, I'll buy you dinner today.

774
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm craving meat, and I'd like company.

775
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,766
I said pork belly was good enough.
Why are we getting beef?

776
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,704
I don't usually let juniors
treat me like this.

777
00:43:32,643 --> 00:43:34,712
It's good. You eat, too.

778
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,246
Okay.

779
00:43:36,914 --> 00:43:38,048
By the way,

780
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,386
Jun-mo remembers everything

781
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,288
from that night.

782
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,224
Did you know that?

783
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:52,997
I'm sorry.

784
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,099
Forget it.

785
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:57,735
You didn't do anything wrong.
You were stuck in the middle.

786
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:08,245
But what do you like about
Producer Ra so much?

787
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,317
Good question. I don't know.

788
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:19,623
I can't really explain exactly why
I like someone when I do.

789
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:22,359
Can you?

790
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,596
What did you like so much about Hye-ju?

791
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,932
Well...

792
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,504
She's pretty.

793
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:35,606
And?

794
00:44:39,043 --> 00:44:40,177
Because she's pretty.

795
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,415
Guys like pretty girls.

796
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,652
But to Jun-mo, I'm just a friend.

797
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,155
A good drinking buddy.

798
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,824
We've known each other for so long,

799
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:57,061
he doesn't have to explain much to me.

800
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,330
And that's all there is.

801
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,166
I guess I'm not pretty.

802
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:05,502
You're pretty.

803
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:12,710
I think

804
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:15,512
you're also pretty.

805
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,323
You're getting smarter, Seung-chan.

806
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,858
That's what I'm talking about.

807
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,360
Sometimes you have to tell ridiculous lies

808
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,930
to get anywhere in this world.

809
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:36,700
Here. Your reward.

810
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:38,502
Open up.

811
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,195
Hey.

812
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:07,998
Where's Ye-jin?

813
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,901
I don't know. She left work before I did.

814
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,870
Try calling her.

815
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,838
I'm sure she'll come home.

816
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:19,476
Jun-mo.

817
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,578
Did you get in a fight with Ye-jin?

818
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,514
Why?

819
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,082
I got a text from her.

820
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:27,718
To look for a temporary two-room place.

821
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,754
-What?
-You didn't know?

822
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:32,856
I knew it.

823
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,892
Girls are like this.

824
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,361
If she really wanted a two-room place,

825
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:39,096
she could've called
a real estate agent herself.

826
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,531
Why would she ask me to look for one?

827
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,432
Why' did she ask?

828
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:45,135
Come on, Jun-mo. Don't be an amateur.

829
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:47,604
She wanted me to deliver the message
to you.

830
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,276
"I'm really mad,
and I'm thinking of leaving,

831
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,878
so try to get me back or don't.
I don't care."

832
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:56,246
Is that what it is?

833
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,682
Girls are amazing.

834
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:02,019
They always get guys
to do their dirty work.

835
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,688
I'll let her use me,
since she's my sister.

836
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,528
Hey, Ye-jin.

837
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:48,098
A two-room? What's that all about?

838
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,234
You're blowing things out of proportion.

839
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,605
I told you
I'll clean up after the mess I made.

840
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,506
Is this what you call cleaning up?

841
00:47:56,573 --> 00:47:58,542
It's so that you won't be uncomfortable.

842
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,377
This is making me more uncomfortable.

843
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:04,781
I bet you're uncomfortable
with me living here.

844
00:48:07,484 --> 00:48:08,619
Well, that's true.

845
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,122
Well then...

846
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,825
Do what you want.

847
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,826
Jun-mo.

848
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,129
I think Ye-jin left again.

849
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,865
Did you fight a lot?

850
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,553
Hey.

851
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,097
I'll get you some covers.

852
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:40,911
What are you doing?

853
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:42,879
You needed to cover up.

854
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:47,117
Your face...
I thought you'd be embarrassed.

855
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,222
Why, that little...

856
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,626
What time is it now?

857
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,579
FAMILY MONTH SPECIAL

858
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,515
The music rehearsal will start soon,

859
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,251
so check on the singers
in the green rooms.

860
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,919
-Seung-chan.
-Yes, Producer.

861
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,188
You're in charge of standby.

862
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:28,258
Before they sing their two songs,
bring them from their green rooms

863
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,559
and put them on standby.

864
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:31,628
Tell us before you go get them.

865
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,464
Make sure they have their microphones on
and tell them how to leave the stage.

866
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,466
-Yes, ma'am.
-And Chang-sik.

867
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,501
Yes.

868
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,269
You take the children's choir.

869
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,005
We don't want them being noisy
and running around.

870
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,807
Make sure they stay safe.

871
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,275
Don't worry.

872
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,177
I majored in child welfare.

873
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:48,678
-Really?
-Yes.

874
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:51,148
-You'll do a good job, right?
-I definitely will.

875
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,649
-Ye-jin.
-Hello.

876
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,484
I checked the VIP route.

877
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,053
From the parking lot to the green rooms,

878
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,055
and to their assigned seats. It's perfect.

879
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:00,190
Do that on your own.

880
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,159
You don't have to tell me those things.

881
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,795
Let's go get some black bean noodles.

882
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,630
We won't have time once rehearsal starts.

883
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,531
We're good.

884
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,267
We'll order sandwiches or something later.

885
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,568
Okay.

886
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,106
Oh, and check when Cindy is coming.

887
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,375
Yes,

888
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,078
Producer Tak.

889
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,188
Oh, Cindy!

890
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:32,656
Seung-gi, long time no see.

891
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,624
Hey, how have you been?

892
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:35,559
Have you been well?

893
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,861
Well, you know...

894
00:51:41,898 --> 00:51:43,834
This looks heavy.
Can you carry this alone?

895
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,702
Yes. Thank you.

896
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,703
No worries.

897
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:49,372
Later.

898
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:51,741
Bye.

899
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:54,211
What was that about?

900
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,180
It's a pain in the butt.

901
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:58,615
It's not like I could ignore that.

902
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,851
You should. It's not like you know her.

903
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:01,985
How could I?

904
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:03,320
I have a reputation to keep.

905
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:05,889
You make life hard for yourself.

906
00:52:06,223 --> 00:52:08,492
Just be like me. Let people chew you out.

907
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,694
I'm envious of you.

908
00:52:10,927 --> 00:52:12,896
You can get annoyed and angry anywhere.

909
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,533
I don't remember the last time

910
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,735
I got angry in public.

911
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:20,737
Hello, Seung-gi.

912
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:21,972
Hello!

913
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:23,807
-How have you been?
-Good.

914
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,208
Great.

915
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,112
Why did you settle for a nice guy image?

916
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:31,848
I didn't know when I debuted.
I went with it.

917
00:52:32,716 --> 00:52:34,151
Don't you get stressed out?

918
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,419
Of course.

919
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:39,055
But there's a group.

920
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,058
Be careful how you pronounce it.

921
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,660
It's called CGI.

922
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:47,297
A group for celebs with good images.

923
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,899
The president is Yoo Jae-suk.

924
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,934
It's me and... You know Sean of Jinusean?

925
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:52,235
Him and a few other members.

926
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:55,338
-We relieve our stress together--
-How?

927
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,774
We do volunteer work helping stray dogs.

928
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,009
We do donation battles.

929
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,012
Sean shot another commercial

930
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,380
and donated all the proceeds.

931
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,482
Dang. I'm going to step up my game.

932
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:11,488
Hey!

933
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,256
Are you okay?

934
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,725
Dong-min, are you okay?

935
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,229
-Man, what a cute kid.
-Are you hurt?

936
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:20,363
Thank you.

937
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:21,598
Would you like a photo?

938
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,366
-Yes.
-Sure.

939
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:25,535
Two, three.

940
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,010
Isn't the makeup a bit heavy?

941
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,846
-It makes me look too tough.
-Pardon?

942
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,015
It's for your album's concept.

943
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,084
It's a good concept,

944
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:42,552
but all my performances look the same.

945
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,787
Can you make me look

946
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:48,358
lovely, cute and kind?

947
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,928
Just a moment.

948
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:54,130
-Hey.
-Yeah.

949
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:58,401
Don't the producers
come and explain things

950
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,070
before the rehearsal?

951
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,111
Oh, Cindy.

952
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,550
I knew you'd be tired,

953
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,418
so I wanted you to rest before the shoot.

954
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,125
"I don't want anyone to come."

955
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:26,630
That's what I told them.

956
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:33,203
No? Did I screw up?

957
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:36,806
Your manager told us

958
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:39,976
not to send assistant producers.

959
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,212
And that the main producer should come

960
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,281
and explain, since you're such a big star.

961
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,416
So I came here myself,

962
00:54:46,483 --> 00:54:48,184
in the middle of preparing the stage.

963
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,656
You didn't have to.

964
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:59,396
I just wanted to check if there's anything
I need to know before going on stage.

965
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:04,834
I don't mind even if it's the
youngest producer giving me the details.

966
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:06,569
Right?

967
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,371
Seung-chan.

968
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,146
Yes, Producer Tak.

969
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:21,918
Seung-chan will be waiting right outside.

970
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,453
Come out when you're ready.

971
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,090
He'll explain to you.

972
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:29,793
And help you get ready for the rehearsal.

973
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:31,628
Got it, Producer.

974
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,571
We just do not get along.

975
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,440
I can't stand that girl.

976
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:45,308
Gosh.

977
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,177
-Ye-jin!
-Goodness!

978
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,212
-Seung-gi!
-Ye-jin!

979
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,881
Hey! Good to see you!

980
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,883
So good to see you. How have you been?

981
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:54,951
Good.

982
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,187
You got prettier.

983
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:58,788
I can't believe this.

984
00:55:58,855 --> 00:55:59,856
You've gotten younger.

985
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:01,391
Oh, stop it.

986
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:04,828
Who is he?

987
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:06,896
I'm sorry.

988
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:10,667
I usually remember the names and faces
of all staff members.

989
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,704
He's a newbie producer, Baek Seung-chan.

990
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:15,939
No wonder.

991
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,208
A pleasure to meet you.

992
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,110
Please take care of me today.

993
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,078
I haven't performed in so long.

994
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,949
So I guess you sing, too, Seung-gi.

995
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,083
Excuse me?

996
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,753
I thought you were just an actor.

997
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:32,622
You were great as Wang Se-ja

998
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:36,493
in Famous Seven Princesses.

999
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:39,062
It's Hwang Tae-ja.

1000
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,864
My character was Hwang Tae-ja.

1001
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,866
Not Wang Se-ja. It's Hwang Tae-ja.

1002
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,468
Oh, right. Hwang Tae-ja.

1003
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:47,871
My mom really loved the show.

1004
00:56:47,937 --> 00:56:48,772
Right.

1005
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,775
What are you saying?

1006
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:56,479
Of course,
Seung-gi has done a lot of dramas,

1007
00:56:56,546 --> 00:56:57,947
but he debuted as a singer.

1008
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,083
He has that amazing hit song.

1009
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,584
-It's my favorite song.
-That song, right?

1010
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,219
"Because You're My Gal."

1011
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:04,320
It's "Girl."

1012
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:05,522
What?

1013
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,892
The song isn't "Because You're My Gal."

1014
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,193
It's "Because You're My Girl."

1015
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,327
Really?

1016
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,196
Oh, right. Yeah.

1017
00:57:13,363 --> 00:57:14,998
You have another one, too.

1018
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,734
I want to hear it on my wedding day.

1019
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,502
"Will You Marry Me."

1020
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:20,770
"Marry Me."

1021
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,675
It's "Marry Me." There's no "Will You."

1022
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,844
Right. That's right.

1023
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:30,213
But hey, what's so important about that?

1024
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,015
What's important
is that I love your songs.

1025
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:32,949
That's true, Ye-jin.

1026
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:35,151
Should we get some coffee?

1027
00:57:35,218 --> 00:57:36,186
Yeah?

1028
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,420
Okay. I'm going for coffee.

1029
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,056
You have Cindy's lift on standby. Got it?

1030
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,426
-It's been so long.
-I know.

1031
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,695
It's so hard to see you.

1032
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:49,399
I don't know if I can get married
at this rate.

1033
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,671
-Producer.
-Yes.

1034
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,707
Why did you get so startled?

1035
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:00,844
-Let's go.
-Yes, let's go.

1036
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:08,151
Cindy just laughed, didn't she?

1037
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:09,953
Yes.

1038
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,957
Not laughing at someone or sneering.

1039
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,926
It was a happy laughter, right?

1040
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:18,561
Yes.

1041
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,129
Excuse me for a moment, Cindy.

1042
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,230
What?

1043
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,035
All done.

1044
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:33,603
Yes.

1045
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,308
Now, it's time for the lift rehearsal.

1046
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:41,177
When the performance starts,
and you get the cue,

1047
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,547
the lift will go up,
and you'll make your entrance.

1048
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:46,683
I know.

1049
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,451
Okay then.

1050
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:54,857
Here.

1051
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,541
Stay here like this.

1052
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,847
Okay, it's going up now.

1053
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:28,424
Is it normally this shaky?

1054
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:30,393
Is this thing broken?

1055
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,763
It looks pretty shabby.

1056
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,665
It's always shaky.

1057
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,467
Oh, I see.

1058
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,303
That's a relief.

1059
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:49,178
Are you okay?

1060
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:50,446
Yes.

1061
01:01:15,605 --> 01:01:20,276
So this is how it goes up.

1062
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,546
A producer should protect the cast member.

1063
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,114
You're the one who seems scared.

1064
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,717
I wasn't that scared.

1065
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,154
If you're not, can you let me go?

1066
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,722
Right.

1067
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:39,929
Well...

1068
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,364
Yeah.

1069
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,171
Did they give us extra black bean noodles?

1070
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:49,839
I feel bloated.

1071
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,274
I feel bloated, too.

1072
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,809
Should I have a soft drink?

1073
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,244
Where were you two?

1074
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:56,579
You left the stage unattended.

1075
01:01:56,746 --> 01:01:58,214
We had a meeting.

1076
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,749
You haven't eaten yet, right?

1077
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:01,184
No, sir.

1078
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:02,518
You haven't eaten, sir?

1079
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:04,287
Let's hurry and go eat.

1080
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,823
The cafeteria is serving
black bean noodles.

1081
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:10,426
Let's go.

1082
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:11,761
Go with Hong-sun.

1083
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:14,630
I can't leave the stage unattended.

1084
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,532
The cast should be arriving now.

1085
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:17,700
I'll watch over the stage.

1086
01:02:17,767 --> 01:02:19,602
So go eat with Hong-sun, sir.

1087
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,405
Yeah, the VIPs could come early.

1088
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:26,242
Tae-ho, you really seem responsible
at times like this.

1089
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,177
Tae-ho, I will...

1090
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,579
No, I'm okay.

1091
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,781
Go with him.

1092
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,383
What? You don't want to eat with me?

1093
01:02:34,951 --> 01:02:37,453
That's not it, sir.

1094
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,455
I was craving black bean noodles.

1095
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,757
Let's go.

1096
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,059
What was that?

1097
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,661
I'll see you afterward.

1098
01:02:49,832 --> 01:02:51,234
-The order has been changed, right?
-Yes.

1099
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:52,535
-Yes, that's right.
-Okay.

1100
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,142
-Bring it in.
-Yes.

1101
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:02,378
Bring out the sliding stage.

1102
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:12,221
Cindy, it's time to rehearse
the first song.

1103
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,124
Over there...

1104
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,529
Look at her.

1105
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,431
Spacing out in the middle of a rehearsal.

1106
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,667
What a pain.

1107
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,610
Why isn't she moving?

1108
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,480
Why isn't she moving?

1109
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:01,571
Hey! Big trouble!

1110
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,873
There was an accident on stage!

1111
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,576
Producer Tak was taken away
in an ambulance!

1112
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:09,111
As for that singer...
She fell into the hole.

1113
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,933
HONG-SUN HAS INVITED YOU TO A GROUP CHAT

1114
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,369
Not this again.

1115
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:37,006
I should block him or something.

1116
01:04:38,574 --> 01:04:39,642
-Hey, Hyeong-geun.
-Yes?

1117
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,743
Shoot over there.

1118
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,578
Here? Okay.

1119
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,804
There was an accident on stage at KBS.

1120
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:11,040
Just a moment, please.

1121
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:12,541
She's in there.

1122
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:20,616
Wait... Cindy, why are you here?

1123
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,022
What do you mean, why? I got hurt.

1124
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:30,526
Where's Producer Tak?

1125
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:34,997
I don't know.

1126
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,234
I wonder where the person
who did this to me is.

1127
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,284
-What was that?
-What happened?

1128
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:56,886
-Producer, are you okay?
-Call an ambulance!

1129
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:59,055
-Shouldn't we take her to the hospital?
-Are you okay?

1130
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,656
-Cindy, are you okay?
-Are you alright?

1131
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:01,757
Ouch...

1132
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,526
Where'd she go?

1133
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:04,994
Where did Cindy go?

1134
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,030
So annoying.

1135
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,706
Hey, why are you in there?

1136
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,140
Jeez...

1137
01:06:20,242 --> 01:06:22,745
I see.

1138
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,247
So where's Producer Tak?

1139
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:27,817
How did she fall in there?

1140
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,752
I was totally shocked.

1141
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,555
I thought you got injured.

1142
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:33,923
What a relief.

1143
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:37,126
Hey, I got hurt, too.

1144
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,661
I got hurt,

1145
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,563
but Cindy's hurt more

1146
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:42,598
so my injury doesn't look as bad.

1147
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:44,433
But I really am hurt.

1148
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:46,168
I'm a patient, too.

1149
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,703
-Right.
-Man...

1150
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:52,641
Why are you sweating so much?

1151
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:55,378
It's nothing.

1152
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:59,782
I got here at the same time Cindy did.

1153
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,818
But she gets treated first.

1154
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,121
Look at me. I'm still sitting here.

1155
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:07,857
She got special treatment as a celebrity!

1156
01:07:08,124 --> 01:07:09,258
Seung-chan.

1157
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,532
-Hyeong-geun, let me see.
-Sure.

1158
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:17,933
Not bad. Looks pretty.

1159
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,168
-Right?
-Yeah.

1160
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:21,804
What does he want now?

1161
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:22,838
FROM HONG-SUN

1162
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,373
My colleagues,

1163
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,942
there was a big accident at the rehearsal.

1164
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:29,445
Tak Ye-jin was hurt
and taken to the hospital,

1165
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,214
so I'll have to direct instead of her.

1166
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,549
But I'm supposed to manage the VIPs.

1167
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,484
Can anyone direct instead of me?

1168
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,486
Hey, I'm going back to Seoul.

1169
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:39,422
What? Jun-mo!

1170
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:46,495
She wouldn't have been hurt as badly

1171
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,297
if she'd just been hit
by the sliding stage.

1172
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:50,199
Ye-jin went overboard and pushed her,

1173
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,735
so she fell in the lift hole
and was hurt badly.

1174
01:07:52,802 --> 01:07:54,303
Why did Ye-jin do that?

1175
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:55,404
I don't know, sir.

1176
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,507
She did it to prevent an accident.

1177
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,309
And Ye-jin injured her arm,

1178
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:02,511
so I can't really yell at her.

1179
01:08:03,212 --> 01:08:05,648
What if CEO Byun tries to sue us?

1180
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:10,786
Where is she?

1181
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,756
The director who pushed Cindy
into the hole!

1182
01:08:13,823 --> 01:08:15,691
She has to be hospitalized?

1183
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,860
Yes, they have a lot of tests to do,

1184
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,995
so she has to be here
for at least four days.

1185
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,500
Coming through.

1186
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,103
Who are you?

1187
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,505
Well...

1188
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,907
You're a KBS producer?

1189
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:32,875
This way.

1190
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:37,780
We're members
of Cindy's official fan club.

1191
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,316
You guys should know as producers.

1192
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,218
I heard someone pushed Cindy.

1193
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,155
From behind, during the rehearsal. Right?

1194
01:08:48,290 --> 01:08:50,126
I don't know anything about it.

1195
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,627
I'm Cindy's fan, too.

1196
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,728
You don't know?

1197
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:55,097
Are you...

1198
01:08:55,164 --> 01:08:57,700
the producer who tied Cindy's shoelace?

1199
01:08:57,766 --> 01:08:58,968
Yes, that's true.

1200
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,003
He doesn't know anything either.

1201
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,972
-Let's go in.
-Please give this to her.

1202
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:11,981
Cindy, how are you doing? Are you okay?

1203
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:15,885
As you can see...

1204
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:18,888
I'm really sorry.

1205
01:09:18,954 --> 01:09:21,590
It's okay. You didn't do it on purpose.

1206
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,993
You're so smart.

1207
01:09:24,226 --> 01:09:25,861
So you know that.

1208
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:29,765
I was only thinking about trying
to save you.

1209
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,600
I'm sorry I couldn't control my strength.

1210
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,335
I'm really sorry.

1211
01:09:35,304 --> 01:09:37,373
Hey, you say something, too.

1212
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,843
I wasn't there at the time.

1213
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:47,883
I'm sure that what Producer Tak did
was to protect you

1214
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,553
-and didn't mean for this to happen--
-Stop.

1215
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:52,688
I don't resent you.

1216
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:56,625
I've gotten a little vacation,
thanks to you.

1217
01:09:58,093 --> 01:10:00,362
I finally got more than
three hours of sleep.

1218
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,510
What's wrong with you?

1219
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,212
Where were you when she got hurt?

1220
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:17,279
I'm sorry.

1221
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:19,315
How could he have helped?

1222
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,918
I got hurt because I was careless
on stage.

1223
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,789
Cindy, you're such a good girl.

1224
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,328
You're doing okay, right?

1225
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:38,067
I was organizing your schedule
so I got here later than expected.

1226
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:39,902
It was really tough.

1227
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,938
Your shoots and events for today
and tomorrow. I canceled ten gigs.

1228
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:45,674
I won't talk about our losses,
since you got hurt.

1229
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,544
But you must do the gig in Japan
in two days. It's a corporate event

1230
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:49,678
and cancellation fee is high.

1231
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,247
She needs to be hospitalized
for four days.

1232
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,616
There are a lot of tests to run. Right?

1233
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,951
Yes, at least four days.

1234
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:59,421
CEO Byun, I'm Tak Ye-jin.

1235
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:03,325
I'm the one who caused this accident.

1236
01:11:03,692 --> 01:11:04,693
But I--

1237
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:05,894
Don't butt in.

1238
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,863
Please keep your mouth shut.

1239
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,132
General Manager Kim, what are you doing?

1240
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,301
Producer, I'll see you out.

1241
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,570
Byun Entertainment is a big agency.

1242
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:16,805
Will you close down
if she rests a few days?

1243
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,540
The doctor made a diagnosis.

1244
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,676
If you ignore the patient's free will

1245
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:24,747
and say it's a financial loss
if she doesn't work,

1246
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:28,450
I'm pretty sure that's wrong.

1247
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,487
It would be like blackmail.

1248
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:32,688
Right? She can't do that.

1249
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:34,490
That's how I see it, too.

1250
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,155
YE-JIN

1251
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,624
The phone is off...

1252
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:27,076
I should be managing the VIPs right now!

1253
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:30,679
We'll get the CEO's face now.

1254
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,715
Zoom in.

1255
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,352
Why did those two have to fight?

1256
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,621
I like this house.

1257
01:12:41,423 --> 01:12:43,225
Good work today. Thank you so much.

1258
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,027
-Good work.
-Thank you.

1259
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:51,600
06. BROADCAST ACCIDENTS
REGRETS DON'T PREVENT FURTHER ACCIDENTS

1260
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,661
Hey, Ye-jin!

1261
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:26,902
What about Cindy?

1262
01:13:28,137 --> 01:13:29,972
I talked to Hong-sun on my way here.

1263
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,673
I heard she was injured.

1264
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:35,077
She's part of the cast for my show.

1265
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:40,315
Yeah, she got injured because of me.

1266
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:42,451
She's in room 1206. Go see her.

1267
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,220
You're so clumsy.

1268
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,291
I knew you'd mess up one day.

1269
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:50,459
That's enough.

1270
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,396
Let me see. How bad is it?

1271
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:55,531
Get off me!

1272
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,400
Clumsy me. I caused the accident,

1273
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,202
I made your cast member get hurt,

1274
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:03,439
I caused you harm,
and I inconvenienced you a great deal.

1275
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,375
I'm really sorry.

1276
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:10,045
Hey...

1277
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,297
You again?

1278
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:18,013
Why do you always happen to be
in moments I make mistakes?

1279
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:29,458
Go.

1280
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:31,960
I want to be alone today.

1281
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,896
I'm sorry about today.

1282
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:42,771
Producer Tak.

1283
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,346
I'm sorry, too.

1284
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:55,817
For what?

1285
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,991
I think...

1286
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:07,296
I'm going to make a mistake, too.

1287
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:59,247
-Ye-jin!
-Goodness!

1288
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:00,882
-Seung-gi!
-Ye-jin!

1289
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:03,218
Hey! Good to see you!

1290
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,187
So good to see you. How have you been?

1291
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:06,321
Good.

1292
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,924
Wow. You got prettier.

1293
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,459
I can't believe this.

1294
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:11,893
You've gotten younger.

1295
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,562
Oh, stop it.

1296
01:17:14,563 --> 01:17:15,731
It's been so long.

1297
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,539
MR. LEE SEUNG-GI

1298
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,629
You're the newbie producer

1299
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,231
Baek Seung-chan, right?

1300
01:17:50,232 --> 01:17:51,433
Yes, that's right.

1301
01:17:52,367 --> 01:17:53,935
My memory used to be so much better.

1302
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,237
It's harder now.

1303
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,005
-See you again.
-Yes.

1304
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,974
Writer Mun! Just a moment.

1305
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:01,510
Goodness. Allow me.

1306
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:02,644
How have you been?

1307
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,281
-You do Entertainment Weekly, right?
-Yes.

1308
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:08,517
LEE SEUNG-GI

1309
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,618
Where are you going now?
