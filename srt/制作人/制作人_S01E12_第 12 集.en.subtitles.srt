1
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,645
This is my shoot and my cast member.

2
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,614
I'll do what I want.

3
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,684
You can't even take care of yourself.
What do you think you're going to do?

4
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,787
Jun-mo, don't you get it?

5
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,958
CEO Byun and Cindy are at war,
and you might get sucked in.

6
00:01:00,193 --> 00:01:01,227
I'll get sucked in then.

7
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,663
Afterward,

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,399
I'll find my place again.

9
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,072
That's what I'll do this time.

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,339
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,548
It's too frustrating.
We don't have time to look out for others.

12
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,283
This isn't some college club.

13
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,586
This is a place where things are done
according to market logic.

14
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,289
Cindy and the show are kind of the same.

15
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,492
When they were both popular, they didn't
see that it can come to an end.

16
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,060
It's like a man and a woman.

17
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:37,997
Once you're over the person,
you don't want them back.

18
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,834
It will be a relief
if nobody files a lawsuit.

19
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:46,172
Everyone is saying that
our show is getting canceled.

20
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,609
Why does Producer Ra
have to be so determined

21
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,344
at a time like this?

22
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,113
He's usually so indecisive.

23
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,215
I know, right?

24
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,150
Our show's in trouble as it is.

25
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:01,955
How can he still want us to shoot with
Cindy when she's hated by everyone?

26
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,023
He's trying to kill us all.

27
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,427
But do you know what's really scary?

28
00:02:08,862 --> 00:02:09,729
What?

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,534
Nobody is stopping him,
not even the higher-ups.

30
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,706
Our show is really going to get canceled.

31
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,276
Producer Ra is so irresponsible.

32
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,916
-Hello.
-Hey.

33
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:33,153
-Writer Son.
-Yes?

34
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,122
How long have you been working
with Jun-mo?

35
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,526
Around five years.

36
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,498
And nothing has worked out well
during that time?

37
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,603
When his shows were failing,

38
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,939
do you think the higher-ups
didn't tell him to change writers?

39
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:57,644
-Producer--
-They told him to do that. They did.

40
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,814
But that indecisive Jun-mo,

41
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,051
the guy who always has issues
with his shows,

42
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,120
defended you guys

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,523
by arguing that you're part of his family
and shouldn't be replaced.

44
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,932
I just don't know what that responsibility
you're talking about is.

45
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,585
Come to the roof.

46
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,902
I'm worried about your team.

47
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,471
You keep running into trouble.

48
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:05,245
What is it?

49
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:10,049
You told me to come up here.
Why aren't you saying anything?

50
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:16,522
Last night,

51
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,360
I walked home.

52
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,928
You walked?

53
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:24,063
From there to your house?

54
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:26,499
Hey, that's really far.

55
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,836
Did it take you all night?

56
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,805
No. Not all night.

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,509
I got home around 5:00 a.m.

58
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,312
Gosh, you're nuts.

59
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,115
May I keep talking?

60
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:44,917
Yes, sorry. Keep going.

61
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,159
As I walked,

62
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,163
I thought about it.

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,769
I want to shoot it again.

64
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,304
What?

65
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,339
Shoot what again?

66
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,611
If my life is a show,

67
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,147
and I'm the main character...

68
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,016
And if someone is shooting me--

69
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,118
Nice analogy.

70
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,721
You're a true producer now.

71
00:05:25,224 --> 00:05:26,459
Keep going.

72
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:28,795
Then...

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:31,864
I would like to shoot it again.

74
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,403
I don't know where to start over again.

75
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,606
Maybe I shouldn't have

76
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,875
recorded my feelings
in that stuffed animal.

77
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,678
Maybe I shouldn't have left you in my room

78
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,748
when my dad told me to come out
and play chess.

79
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,285
Or maybe I shouldn't have
come to the playground

80
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:54,620
when you told me to come out.

81
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,289
If not that,

82
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:59,692
I should have kept you from rejecting me

83
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,263
by not going on that date

84
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,034
yesterday.

85
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,073
If not that...

86
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,410
maybe I should go back way earlier

87
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,247
to when I started to like being around you

88
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,084
and started to hate
how you looked at Producer Ra.

89
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,188
Maybe I should go back to that time.

90
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,328
I don't know where I should start over,

91
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,698
but the point is

92
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,135
I want to shoot it again.

93
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,670
Why?

94
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,706
Why do you want to shoot it again?

95
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,943
Do you think it would've been better
if you didn't like me

96
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,346
because that way, you wouldn't be hurt?

97
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,015
No.

98
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,888
I wanted to like you more properly.

99
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,462
I was

100
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,432
too awkward.

101
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,501
I was too lacking, and I rushed it.

102
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,439
I was young and lame.

103
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,744
Maybe I could've acted cooler

104
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,580
or more mature.

105
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,385
Maybe there was a more sophisticated way

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,721
for me to get closer to you

107
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,861
without making you this uncomfortable.

108
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:45,665
That's why

109
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,100
I want to stop the filming here,

110
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,104
edit everything out,

111
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,407
and start the shoot over again.

112
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,946
That's what I thought of as I walked.

113
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,051
Would that be impossible?

114
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,796
For one last time,

115
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:21,334
I just wanted to ask you.

116
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:13,853
Shouldn't you submit a complaint
at the district office

117
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,354
about those street lamps?

118
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,007
I don't know.

119
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,377
The street lamps all turn on now.

120
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,112
I think that Seung-chan

121
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,015
might have filed a complaint
at the district office.

122
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,717
But maybe it wasn't him.

123
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,653
Maybe the lights were scheduled
to come on tonight.

124
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:52,158
Because Seung-chan
has been so good to me recently,

125
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,126
I thought it could have been him.

126
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,129
I can't expect that at all from Jun-mo.

127
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:00,366
He isn't detail-oriented
and not that kind.

128
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,001
But Seung-chan is like that.

129
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:14,880
-Hello. This way.
-Okay.

130
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:05,357
Cindy.

131
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,261
What are you doing?
It's time for the shoot.

132
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:37,723
Here.

133
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:42,428
You have to drink it.

134
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,542
Why do you keep looking at me?

135
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,110
Cindy.

136
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,680
You going to a shoot
feels like a dream to me.

137
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,615
Don't do that again.

138
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,752
Don't plan with the staff
and hide things from me.

139
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,655
I probably looked really weird earlier.

140
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:46,759
Hey, that was the prettiest
I've seen you look.

141
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,730
What are you going to do about CEO Byun?

142
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:54,366
What if she slaps you again?

143
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,270
I'm not that scared of CEO Byun.

144
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,173
You're the scariest.

145
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,311
I'm the scariest?

146
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:06,645
Of course.

147
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,051
When someone I don't like gets mad at me,
it's no big deal.

148
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,988
But when someone I like
is disappointed or mad at me,

149
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:19,191
that is what's really scary.

150
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,061
Are you an idiot? Why do you like me?

151
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,137
Cindy is going to the shoot?

152
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:36,609
Yes, they woke her up in the morning,
and now she's going to a shoot.

153
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,346
Then, what about Jinie?

154
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,849
Two Days and One Night.

155
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,252
-Right.
-Two Days and One Night!

156
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,922
She's been practicing that
since yesterday.

157
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,658
I talked to the chief director...

158
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:58,697
Ra Jun-mo still doesn't get it.

159
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,734
Him doing that won't help Cindy.

160
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,906
Two Days and One Night!

161
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,175
Two Days and One Night!

162
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,216
So, is Cindy coming today?

163
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,018
No way. Would she really come?

164
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,453
If she does, she's one strong person.

165
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:24,356
But why would she tell a lie like that?

166
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,126
I think she's always been a liar.

167
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,163
Didn't you all sense that?

168
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,665
I think she's all right.

169
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:36,702
She seemed a little stuck up at first,
but she's cool when you get to know her.

170
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,537
You're a terrible judge of character.

171
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:42,141
She didn't even blink an eye
whenever she addressed me in a way

172
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,509
that made me look like an old person.

173
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,177
I don't like her!

174
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,280
But you are much older than Cindy.

175
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,316
Anyway, people should be honest.

176
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,719
Do you think it's okay to lie
when you're a celebrity?

177
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,805
Oh, Cindy!

178
00:16:13,405 --> 00:16:16,775
We were worried about you.

179
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,980
Right? Weren't we?

180
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:26,785
Those articles aren't true, right?

181
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,754
It was a misunderstanding, right?

182
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:30,923
Tell us.

183
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,365
Thank you so much for worrying about me,

184
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,666
Sandara.

185
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:08,293
Thank you for coming all this way.

186
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,563
Today is a "Going Home" special.

187
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:17,102
You will each be spending the night
with an elderly lady at her house.

188
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,972
Here are the ladies

189
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,343
you'll be spending your time with!

190
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,550
Goodness, look at that.

191
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,952
How amazing.

192
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,258
Oh, that's a helicam.

193
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:43,662
It's a camera that shoots from the sky
like a helicopter.

194
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,730
It's a camera.

195
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:46,965
It's filming you ladies.

196
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,101
You look pretty right now.

197
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,439
Seung-chan, what are you doing?
Bring them here.

198
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:59,378
We got some great locals to join the cast.

199
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,880
The old ladies live with simplicity...

200
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,482
That's a drone, right?

201
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:08,087
There was one of those during the shoot
for Hometown Report.

202
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,488
Mr. Producer.

203
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:14,460
Will you pay our appearance fees
in cash or in gift certificates?

204
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,796
Well, let me talk to the writer.

205
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:21,333
I'll check and let you know.

206
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,202
Thank you.

207
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,205
They know what a drone is.

208
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,213
Ma'am, you can walk slowly.
We have plenty of time.

209
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,718
So, who's the singer?

210
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,654
Excuse me?

211
00:18:42,888 --> 00:18:45,090
Which of you two is the celebrity?

212
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,696
Ma'am, don't you know who I am?

213
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:53,765
The only celebrity I know is Song Hae.

214
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,003
I'm on TV a lot too.

215
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,238
What's your name?

216
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,139
Cindy.

217
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,340
What?

218
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:02,574
Cindy.

219
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,843
That's a strange name.

220
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:12,918
Do you think that's funny?

221
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,121
It sure is.

222
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,058
Was that supposed to be funny?

223
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,761
Was that a joke?

224
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:27,933
I'm sorry.

225
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:34,540
Let's go.

226
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,815
I was flustered.

227
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:46,585
I've been in the industry for ten years.

228
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:51,857
I've been in commercials, dramas,
and all sorts of awards shows.

229
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,692
I've been on TV plenty of times.

230
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,329
I thought everyone in Korea knew me.

231
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,732
But she doesn't know me.

232
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,903
But...

233
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,407
I didn't dislike that.

234
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,243
I like that she doesn't know me at all.

235
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,780
I feel comfortable.

236
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,982
I feel free.

237
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,426
Ma'am.

238
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,363
Are we going to cook rice in a cauldron?

239
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,798
A cauldron?

240
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,499
This isn't the war era.

241
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,868
We use rice cookers here too.

242
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,872
You don't grill fritters
on a cauldron lid?

243
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:42,307
I have a frying pan.

244
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:46,912
I see.

245
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,219
Ma'am.

246
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,321
When did you wash this?

247
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,822
It's brand new.

248
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:39,064
You've never washed this since 2002?

249
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,198
2002 FIFA WORLD CUP
KOREA/JAPAN

250
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,566
It's new.

251
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,246
The blanket...

252
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,315
Yes?

253
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:58,684
No, it's just that...

254
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,586
It's bigger than I thought.

255
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,788
I see.

256
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,423
How long have we been shooting?

257
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,807
Producer.

258
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,975
Can't you stop filming now?

259
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,212
Okay, we have plenty of footage anyway.

260
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,981
Then stop filming and help me out here.

261
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,416
Oh, okay.

262
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:33,552
Turn it the other way.

263
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,455
No, the other way.

264
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:48,500
Producer, how can you be weaker than me?

265
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,471
It's not that I'm weak.
It's because my timing was off.

266
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:07,986
See? You are weaker than me.

267
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:11,022
I'm really not.

268
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:13,692
We were out of sync.

269
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,094
Where did you watch the 2002 World Cup?

270
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,132
I went out in the streets
with my older brother.

271
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,001
Me too.

272
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,903
I watched it in Seoul with my dad once.

273
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,707
We spread out a mat in Yeouido Park
and watched it on the big screen.

274
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:31,510
I went there often too
since I live in Yeouido.

275
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,311
Do you remember what game it was?

276
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:37,682
There was a shoot-out...

277
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:38,850
Against Spain!

278
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,153
Wow, this is interesting.

279
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,021
Right.

280
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,589
So many people were there.

281
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,995
Well, it's not a big connection,

282
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,164
but it's still a connection.

283
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,604
You've known Producer Ra
for a longer time,

284
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,008
but we have this small connection too.

285
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,749
Just so you know,

286
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:16,354
I know that you didn't lie.

287
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,425
Of course!

288
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,932
You'll hang this out to dry, right?

289
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,267
In the sunshine, so it gets nice and soft.

290
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,271
Of course.

291
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,392
I was worried,

292
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,295
but it's a relief
that she's handling this so well.

293
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,931
I heard what's going on
at the other houses.

294
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:03,502
They're performing for the ladies,
and visiting neighbors,

295
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,904
and getting good footage
with stuff like that.

296
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:11,610
But Cindy's just doing housework
like a maid.

297
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,379
It's a bit of a problem.

298
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,015
We're not getting enough good footage.

299
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,289
Didn't I just sound like a real producer?

300
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,191
"We're not getting enough good footage."

301
00:25:28,827 --> 00:25:30,896
There's an issue
with the amount of footage.

302
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:33,298
Don't you think?

303
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,835
He really took Cindy along?

304
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,703
Yes. Articles about it are already out.

305
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,473
They're badmouthing the show too.

306
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:45,310
"Why would a reality show use a liar?

307
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,612
Are you ignoring public opinion?"

308
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,147
CEO Byun must know too.

309
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,050
I think she will come and barge in.

310
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,652
We'll have to talk to her for a while,

311
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,788
so how about we go eat first?

312
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,657
Right, we should.

313
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,159
What's the special at the cafeteria today?

314
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,234
It's good that both of you are here.

315
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,837
We're so upset.

316
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,406
We were just talking.

317
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:16,408
That Jun-mo...

318
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,178
Is this a joke?

319
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,714
We were trying to help you out

320
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:27,085
by taking out the problematic child
and giving you the one with potential.

321
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,322
Producer Ra just doesn't understand me.

322
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,690
You know how he is.

323
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,492
In our department,
people do say he jinxes things.

324
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,895
He only goes for what won't work.

325
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:38,597
So, the thing is...

326
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,835
About the new program, Star Wars.

327
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:47,305
I heard it will take the time slot

328
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,240
currently occupied
by Two Days and One Night.

329
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,147
I'll let you have Jinie for that show.

330
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,718
Get rid of Two Days and One Night,
and start Star Wars.

331
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,219
Wow.

332
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:07,459
You coming here yourself
and telling us that

333
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,196
offends me.

334
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:16,067
If we got rid of a show after one mishap
or after one mistake,

335
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:21,873
what show would last over six months?

336
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,675
Right. That's true.

337
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,146
If we were going to let
the agencies decide

338
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,415
who to cast in our shows,

339
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,018
why would we need producers here?

340
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,853
Sir--

341
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,024
Whether we cancel a show,
start a new one, or add a cast member,

342
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:42,394
we will be the ones to decide that,
CEO Byun.

343
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,830
That's why I have this job.

344
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:49,868
Oh, really?

345
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,736
I see.

346
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:57,842
I hope you two don't regret this.

347
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,077
If you do,

348
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,680
it will be a headache.

349
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,257
Sir.

350
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,026
Are we no longer canceling
Two Days and One Night?

351
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,561
I don't know.

352
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,730
I just said that because I was angry.

353
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,168
Let's go eat.
The line will be long if we're late.

354
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:25,270
Okay.

355
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,375
The pre-recording for this week
won't be played during the rehearsal.

356
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,509
We don't have time.

357
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:33,478
Noted. Will check that.

358
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,817
It's a good thing Cindy is out
after doing her last show last week.

359
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,219
It would be hard for her
to win first place this week.

360
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,589
The competition is tough this week.
It's going to be a close game.

361
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:46,891
There are so many popular singers.

362
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,695
Even if she did rank first,

363
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:54,065
I don't think she'll want to be
on television for a while.

364
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:56,668
I heard she's filming
Two Days and One Night.

365
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,236
What is Jun-mo going to do?

366
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:01,339
Good question.

367
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,944
But I don't think Cindy lied on purpose.

368
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,013
She's still at fault
for not confessing sooner.

369
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,749
She kept it to herself.

370
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,218
It's not like that.

371
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,489
Back when I was a cameraman...

372
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:18,690
When was that again?

373
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,959
When Cindy was in Pinky4,

374
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,828
I interviewed her for some show.

375
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,264
She said so back then.

376
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:27,499
That she was an orphan.

377
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,534
If that was true,
this wouldn't have happened.

378
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,136
People would've watched the show.

379
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,538
You must be confusing her
with someone else.

380
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,406
I'm right!

381
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:38,643
I distinctly remember
because she cried so much.

382
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,378
What did she say as she cried?

383
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,081
That her parents died because of her.

384
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,984
She was so sad back then.

385
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:49,554
Did that footage air?

386
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,222
Probably not.

387
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:55,693
One of the managers cut it short.

388
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,429
New artists should all look pretty,

389
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,833
but her makeup came off
because she cried so much.

390
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,601
That's why we cut it.

391
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,539
They asked the producer not to air it.

392
00:30:07,605 --> 00:30:08,873
When was that?

393
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,842
Well...

394
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,578
I think it was around
seven or eight years ago.

395
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:16,948
What show was it for?

396
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:20,618
Was it Entertainment Weekly?

397
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:23,288
Or some special show for singers?

398
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,990
It's been so long that I don't remember.

399
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,594
Ye-jin, we have to organize the seats.
It's almost time.

400
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,963
Right. Okay.

401
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,199
Organize the seats, please.

402
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:45,844
Who are you?

403
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,254
Who are you?

404
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:01,192
She's Jinie, a rookie singer
of Byun Entertainment.

405
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:04,262
You're the youngest writer
for Music Bank, right?

406
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,900
Yes.

407
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,672
Why aren't you getting up
when the singer is here?

408
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,275
This is the singer's green room,
not the writer's green room.

409
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,016
Oh, is she the singer?

410
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,152
What do you mean?

411
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:36,794
I thought you were a stylist.

412
00:31:39,797 --> 00:31:41,566
She doesn't look like a celebrity.

413
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,334
CEO Byun.

414
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:47,605
What are you talking about?
Of course, she looks like a celebrity!

415
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,581
Goodness...

416
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,817
My bad.

417
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,858
I really thought you were a stylist.

418
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,532
Goodbye.

419
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,773
What's with everyone
at the broadcast station today?

420
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,974
What's their deal?

421
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:28,947
This is so annoying!

422
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,284
Jinie, you better lose some weight.

423
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,486
Where's your willpower?

424
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,722
Cindy starved for days when I told her to.

425
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,291
-General Manager Kim.
-Yes?

426
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,893
Watch her starting today.

427
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:44,162
If you see her eat anything
that's not on her diet,

428
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:46,297
tell me right away, okay?

429
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:47,298
Yes, ma'am.

430
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:02,947
Hey, are things going well?

431
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,018
I don't know.

432
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,886
Why don't you know?

433
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,590
Did you get fun footage
of her and the old lady?

434
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:13,758
Well...

435
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,327
it wasn't awkward,

436
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,997
but I don't know if it's that interesting.

437
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,466
Where's Cindy?

438
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,132
How long is she going to
clean and organize?

439
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,167
Did she get a job at a restaurant?

440
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,803
She keeps moving around,

441
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:01,672
but she hasn't really said anything funny.

442
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,908
The footage isn't great either.

443
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,411
I don't know if it will help
during editing.

444
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,517
Producer Ra,
don't I kind of sound like a producer?

445
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,854
Jeez.

446
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,757
Yes, you sure do.

447
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,228
But...

448
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,199
is our show really going to get canceled?

449
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,607
You know what?

450
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,445
No variety show ends on a high note.

451
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:45,016
Variety shows end when they fail.

452
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:47,385
For dramas,

453
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,421
the number of episodes is determined
from the start.

454
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:53,224
A successful one ends with an applause.

455
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,193
It goes out with a bang, a happy ending.

456
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,429
But that's not the case for variety shows.

457
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,334
If people clap for it, it keeps running.

458
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,438
But they can't clap forever.

459
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,476
It eventually gets old.

460
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,911
It eventually gets obvious.

461
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,279
People eventually stop watching it.

462
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,448
It becomes a nuisance.

463
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,285
That's when it's over.

464
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,655
That's why it's hard
to end on a high note.

465
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:30,094
It's always bitter and sad at the end.

466
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,629
A sad ending.

467
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,269
I would like it
if the show doesn't get canceled.

468
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,138
Do you think I would be happy?

469
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,474
This is a long-running show

470
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:45,743
that's been on air since 2007.

471
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,846
The more long-running a show is,

472
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,118
the worse you feel when it ends with you.

473
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:20,645
Do you have the original footage
for report shoots?

474
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,847
We do. Which one are you looking for?

475
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,816
It's from seven to eight years ago.

476
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:29,787
Stuff that old isn't on the computer.

477
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,323
You'll have to look through the tapes.

478
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,926
They should be indexed.

479
00:36:34,992 --> 00:36:35,893
I see.

480
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,162
Pinky4 was in it.

481
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,364
I need footage from Entertainment Weekly
and singer specials.

482
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:49,941
We're off work in an hour.

483
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,542
Okay, I'll be quick.

484
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:04,956
This is a lot.

485
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,451
Forget this! I quit!

486
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,954
I'm so tired. What am I doing?

487
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,407
How will I go to the bathroom later?

488
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:57,808
I think it will be scary.

489
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:03,147
It's true that we see ghosts often

490
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,782
when we shoot in the countryside.

491
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,250
Excuse me?

492
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,687
Don't lie.

493
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:12,256
Why are you so surprised?

494
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,058
We really see a lot of ghosts.

495
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,327
You'll see one soon.

496
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,963
We even have nightmares
and sleep paralysis.

497
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,700
Last year...

498
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,604
What was the name of that mountain?

499
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,841
Anyway, up on a high mountain,

500
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:33,010
we slept outdoors.

501
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:37,214
I saw a strange woman in my dream.

502
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,485
She had long hair
and was dressed in white.

503
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,187
Oh, come on.

504
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:44,822
Stop it.

505
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:46,857
Why? Just hear me out.

506
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,260
Yes, this is getting interesting.

507
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:56,133
I couldn't tell if the woman
was human or a ghost.

508
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,071
Then I talked to the cameraman
in the morning.

509
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,108
He said he saw that woman
in his dream too.

510
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,711
We talked it over,

511
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,646
and we had the same description of her,

512
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,515
down to the mole on her nose.

513
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:20,725
That's it.

514
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:22,360
I was going to do it later,

515
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:24,028
but we should do
a horror special immediately.

516
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,963
That sounds like fun.

517
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,233
Isn't that for the summer?

518
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:33,270
We don't know if we'll be around
in the summer,

519
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,439
so we have to immediately
do things we think of.

520
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,175
We should do it right away.
Let's have a horror special.

521
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:51,889
It's because of me, isn't it?

522
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,326
You're getting canceled because of me.

523
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:06,003
They've been talking about it
for a while now.

524
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:09,407
You made the decision
to take responsibility for me.

525
00:40:10,441 --> 00:40:11,475
I know that.

526
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:17,381
I came to this shoot
knowing that it could cause you trouble.

527
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,286
Cindy.

528
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,422
Yes?

529
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,258
There's the term "the price of fame."

530
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:31,195
Fame isn't just about fortune.

531
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:37,368
You must pay your dues emotionally.

532
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,905
"Why do I have to go through this?"

533
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,041
Feeling uncomfortable and oppressed.

534
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,243
Those things,

535
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,181
you have to accept them more naturally.

536
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:53,984
Think of it as a tax you have to pay.

537
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,788
That will make you feel better.

538
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,790
You try going through this.

539
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:01,559
It's not easy.

540
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,397
Well, good point.

541
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,036
I saw Yun-a recently.

542
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,940
Yun-a?

543
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,775
Yes.

544
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,645
How is she doing?

545
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:25,950
She's doing great.

546
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,719
She runs a flower shop.

547
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,254
She's a florist.

548
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,827
I see.

549
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,604
Maybe I should run a flower shop later.

550
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,706
No.

551
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:51,775
I'll run a moving company.

552
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:55,980
I'm great at organizing things at home.

553
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,782
I bet I would get great customer ratings.

554
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,986
Right, that would be perfect for you.

555
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:12,930
What's wrong with him?

556
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,702
I hate it when guys do this.

557
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,180
This kid...

558
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:34,285
The cast member isn't even asleep.

559
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,187
How can the producer fall asleep first?

560
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,958
Cindy, go to bed.

561
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,993
Get some sleep. It's late.

562
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:45,729
I'm fine.

563
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:49,366
The wind is cool and nice.

564
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:53,337
I just want to stay like this
a bit longer.

565
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,574
Really?

566
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,276
Yes.

567
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,980
Just a bit longer...

568
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,758
Why are the dogs barking so much?

569
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,674
I'm sorry.

570
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,209
Seriously.

571
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,712
Do you know that you slept
for over half an hour?

572
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,785
You should've woken me up.

573
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,957
You were sleeping so peacefully.

574
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,727
I also didn't want to wake you.

575
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:29,166
I know who you like.

576
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,772
Even though I can't be happy for you,

577
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,242
I don't want to get in your way.

578
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,078
But...

579
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,048
I don't want to lie

580
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,685
about my feelings.

581
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,627
I heard that

582
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:01,331
having a one-sided crush

583
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:03,567
is like building
and destroying a house by oneself

584
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:07,204
and that it's very tiring.

585
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,174
Oh, my.

586
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,310
Are you worrying about me?

587
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,814
Are you telling me not to bother
building and destroying?

588
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:18,682
That I shouldn't waste my time?

589
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,350
No, it's not like that.

590
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,519
Are you looking down on me
because I have a crush?

591
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:24,121
No!

592
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:26,623
No, I wouldn't dare.

593
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,993
It's actually an honor to be liked by you.

594
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,295
It's an honor, and I like you...

595
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,262
You like me?

596
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,431
No, I mean...

597
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,334
I don't mean in that sense.

598
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,402
Do you hate me then?

599
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,305
No, that's definitely not the case.

600
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:44,007
How can I not like it
when someone likes me?

601
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,610
Wow, so you're just happy
if anyone likes you?

602
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:48,512
No.

603
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,416
No, it's really not like that.

604
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,727
Just remember me.

605
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,033
The heroine of the Cindy fan club.

606
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:12,402
The star everyone used to love.

607
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,305
Even though everyone hates me now.

608
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,440
Anyway...

609
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,844
I'm nothing without my pride.

610
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,648
I never got crushes.

611
00:46:26,016 --> 00:46:31,054
And I used to not care at all
if someone liked me.

612
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:36,660
But despite the fact that
you don't like me enough

613
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,863
to give me a bag of stuffed pancakes,

614
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,003
I still really like you.

615
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,185
From afar,

616
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:07,591
I'll be keeping myself busy
building and destroying a house,

617
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,764
so, if you happen to think of me,

618
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:19,002
if you want to see
what kind of house it is,

619
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,772
if you're curious,

620
00:47:24,408 --> 00:47:25,742
then you can look back.

621
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:32,983
This really makes me

622
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:35,986
sound like a beggar.

623
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:41,525
I'm not begging for your affection here,
so don't misunderstand.

624
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,262
Right. Of course not.

625
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:48,999
Thank you.

626
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,800
You said you felt bad

627
00:48:25,535 --> 00:48:26,637
for making me a beggar, right?

628
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,309
Yes, I didn't mean to.

629
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,978
You said you would
make it up to me, right?

630
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:40,651
When I go back to Seoul,

631
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,657
I have a lot of things to take care of

632
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:49,993
on my own.

633
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:56,400
It's possible that no one
will give me a helping hand.

634
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,680
Can you hold my hand just once?

635
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:18,488
Your hands are really warm.

636
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,908
Oh, just my luck.

637
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,879
I shouldn't have heard that story.
Why did I listen?

638
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,090
Hello.

639
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,427
Oh, you're here.

640
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:45,936
What is it?

641
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,904
Producer, did you pull an all-nighter?

642
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,473
Goodness. How did you know?

643
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:53,276
You're wearing the same clothes.

644
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,913
Oh, right.

645
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,950
I had some work to do.

646
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,089
Hey, what's with that smile?

647
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,995
Looks like you made your decision.

648
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,299
I guess something good happened.

649
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,969
No.

650
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,272
It's not like that.

651
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,908
Hey! It's not what you're thinking.

652
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:26,276
Then what?

653
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,213
Look at these tapes.

654
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,349
I spent all night in the editing room.

655
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:33,984
I see.

656
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,354
But don't change clothes.

657
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,389
Why not?

658
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,624
Somehow...

659
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:43,827
you look really hot.

660
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:46,463
Really?

661
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:50,901
Do I look like
I have a complicated personal life?

662
00:52:55,472 --> 00:52:56,439
Thank you.

663
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,816
You're a big girl.

664
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,792
Follow her from afar
until she gets in the car.

665
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,228
Her expression looks good now.

666
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,442
-Seung-chan.
-Yes?

667
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:36,079
Ms. Lee Myeong-ja said
she's a fan of Song Hae, right?

668
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,181
Yes.

669
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:42,152
Get a video message from him
so we can edit it in.

670
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:44,387
A video message?

671
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,890
A video message to Ms. Lee Myeong-ja.

672
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,858
It will be good to use it for the ending.

673
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:50,827
Song Hae's office is in Jongno.

674
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,662
I'll call him, so go there now.

675
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:53,863
Take a cameraman along.

676
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:58,735
-Oh, right now?
-Yes, right now.

677
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:00,403
Got it.

678
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,607
Good.

679
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,843
Will he be okay?

680
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,979
What do you think?

681
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,484
He should say hello.

682
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:16,152
He's a newbie
in the entertainment department.

683
00:54:16,219 --> 00:54:17,254
It's his initiation rite.

684
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:18,788
Ready...

685
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:21,725
action.

686
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,563
This is to Myeong-ja.

687
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:30,000
I can tell if you're my fan.

688
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,370
You must have high standards.

689
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,507
How old is she?

690
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:40,977
She's 78.

691
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:42,746
-What? She's 78?
-Yes.

692
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,283
That's a great age.

693
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:47,951
An exciting age.

694
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,055
Myeong-ja, enjoy your life.

695
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:55,492
You've lived long enough to know that.

696
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,494
Time really flies.

697
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:01,998
Ten years can go by
in the blink of an eye.

698
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,869
We can only live our lives once.

699
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:07,604
So enjoy your life!

700
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:12,208
I'll go to your neighborhood soon.

701
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:17,013
So stay healthy until then,
and let's meet when I go there.

702
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,182
I'm a pretty good guy.

703
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,718
Let's make a promise.

704
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:30,894
Sir.

705
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:33,697
What are you doing?

706
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,700
What do you mean?

707
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:40,036
I'm doing that so you know where it ends.

708
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:41,705
Wait a minute.

709
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,008
Are you a new employee?

710
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,043
Yes, sir.

711
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,946
Oh, I see. Okay.

712
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,582
So you're a new employee?

713
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,253
Do you drink?

714
00:55:57,987 --> 00:55:59,923
I can't really hold my liquor.

715
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:04,661
Good, I wasn't planning
on drinking much today.

716
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:08,098
How about having just one drink with me?

717
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:17,173
You're about to pass out. Goodness.

718
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,642
Hey, man.

719
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:21,277
Hae!

720
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:24,981
What? My goodness.

721
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:27,484
I really...

722
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:30,320
-Oh, my goodness.
-Hae, I...

723
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:34,057
I...

724
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:37,727
I really don't want our show
to get canceled.

725
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:39,896
Oh dear...

726
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:45,835
Why is a fine show of seven years
getting canceled

727
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,872
after I joined the team?

728
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:52,208
Did you say seven years?

729
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:53,743
Gosh.

730
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:58,114
I've been doing my show for 35 years.

731
00:56:58,548 --> 00:56:59,649
Oh, 35 years?

732
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:02,218
Seven years is nothing.

733
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:03,553
Hae.

734
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,522
Why are you being so informal?

735
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,458
-Gosh. Hae!
-What?

736
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:10,727
You're the best, man.

737
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:12,762
You're awesome.

738
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,531
Jeez...

739
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,599
Wow, 35 years...

740
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,036
People still say this to me.

741
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,806
They say I've been doing my show
for so long,

742
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:25,108
I could do it with my eyes closed.

743
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:26,776
How could I do it with my eyes closed?

744
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:29,112
When I shout, "National,"

745
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:32,449
the crowd shouts, "Singing Contest!"

746
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,218
My heart still races,
and I feel like I'm in a hurry.

747
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,252
Why?

748
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:37,720
Because I think of whether or not

749
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,590
they shouted louder
than the previous episode.

750
00:57:40,657 --> 00:57:44,227
You must be wondering
why I'm doing something so difficult.

751
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:45,361
Because I love it.

752
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:50,667
That's why I've been doing the show
for 35 years.

753
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,968
Goodness.

754
00:57:52,502 --> 00:57:53,703
You should know that.

755
00:57:58,842 --> 00:57:59,876
Hey, Hae.

756
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,312
I love you, man.

757
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,670
Did you get a tan?

758
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:30,840
I told you to be careful of UV rays.

759
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:34,143
Thank you for worrying.

760
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,980
I'll be careful during the next shoot.

761
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,715
The next shoot?

762
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:43,853
Cindy, you're always so optimistic.

763
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,122
You should learn from her.

764
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,099
Cindy.

765
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:01,371
The agency suffered a big loss last week.

766
00:59:01,437 --> 00:59:02,872
Our stock has plummeted.

767
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,577
We tried our best to keep you on board.

768
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,780
I don't know why we have to
officially apologize

769
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,649
for the mistake that you made,

770
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,617
but that's what we're going to do.

771
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:18,187
You can reflect on that for now.

772
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,056
Jinie, you should learn.

773
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,163
This was the biggest news this week.

774
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,299
It's about top singer, Cindy.

775
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,535
We found out that Cindy has been working

776
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:36,172
while lying about her background
and her parents.

777
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:39,309
I'm sure many of Cindy's fans
are disappointed.

778
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,745
We were going to air an interview
by Cindy's agency CEO

779
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:45,181
with her official statement,

780
00:59:45,481 --> 00:59:48,651
but we got different news
right before the shoot.

781
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,353
This is the point.

782
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,422
Cindy's exaggerated family background.

783
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:55,792
Was it Cindy's lie,
or was it made up by her agency?

784
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:58,561
But even if Cindy's agency
had been the ones

785
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:00,430
to fabricate her background,

786
01:00:00,496 --> 01:00:03,366
Cindy's failure to come forward
with the truth

787
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,602
left many people feeling betrayed.

788
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:11,240
But if you see this exclusive footage,
you will discover a different truth.

789
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:16,045
This is an interview
from when Cindy was a rookie.

790
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:17,347
Let's watch it now.

791
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,216
My parents

792
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:24,153
drove from Chuncheon to Seoul to see me

793
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:28,224
-and got into an accident.
-What is this?

794
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,728
-Why are they showing this?
-It's all my fault.

795
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,464
I can't stop thinking about it.

796
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,000
Just a moment, please.

797
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,203
I told you not to talk about that,
didn't I?

798
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,772
I told you not to talk about that.

799
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:44,540
They're in the United States.

800
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:47,877
"My home is in the States.
My parents are there."

801
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:49,212
Is that so hard?

802
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,980
How high is your IQ?

803
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:56,152
Producer, please edit this out.

804
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:59,088
She's still too young.

805
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,592
Stop. Let's start again, okay?

806
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:06,162
Hey, General Manager Kim!

807
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:07,363
Call the chief director!

808
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,433
Sue all of them!

809
01:01:11,968 --> 01:01:15,038
I told a senior at Entertainment Weekly
and just gave him the tape.

810
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,607
How did you find it?

811
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:21,644
One of our cameramen said
he shot that footage in the past.

812
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:22,578
That's why.

813
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:25,715
How did you find
that original unaired footage?

814
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,317
It was easy. I'm a producer.

815
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,186
I found it in no time.

816
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,226
Things will be okay soon.

817
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,463
I'm telling you this
so you can have some peace of mind

818
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,497
for a few hours.

819
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:47,704
Tell CEO Byun to get a cleaning service
for her agency's front door, okay?

820
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,846
BYE, EVIL CEO BYUN

821
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:02,318
Wow, how did you find that?

822
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,188
Look at me.

823
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:09,926
I stayed up all night.
Look at how bad my dark circles are.

824
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:13,663
You were...

825
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,166
You were worried about her.

826
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,436
You didn't tell me why,

827
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,572
but I know you're sensitive
about CEO Byun.

828
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:27,176
I knew you cared about
what happened to Cindy.

829
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,981
Isn't that why you still used Cindy
in your shoot?

830
01:02:32,648 --> 01:02:33,483
Yes.

831
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,718
If you hadn't found that footage,

832
01:02:35,918 --> 01:02:38,988
our show and Cindy
would've been in big trouble.

833
01:02:39,489 --> 01:02:40,590
You saved us.

834
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,128
-Are you thankful?
-Yes. Thank you so much, Ye-jin.

835
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:49,699
Hey, I'm really tired.

836
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,268
Sleep over at my house tonight.

837
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,671
Keep your voice down!
Someone might hear you.

838
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,042
-Spend the night.
-Forget it!

839
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,178
I have a house.
Why would I sleep at yours?

840
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:03,946
But you're tired.

841
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:06,949
It's dangerous for you
to drive on the highway.

842
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,485
And your brother

843
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,622
sleeps over at my house
once every couple of days.

844
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,225
That brat drives me nuts.

845
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,529
Jun-mo, Seung-chan isn't back yet.

846
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:21,230
He's not picking up his phone.

847
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,398
Leave him be.

848
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,568
He will come back eventually.
He's not going anywhere.

849
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,036
Are you looking for me?

850
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:35,578
Are you people looking for me?

851
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,446
Yes, we were.

852
01:03:40,082 --> 01:03:42,018
Who made him drink so much?

853
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,253
He did an interview with Song Hae.

854
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,489
Oh, is it his initiation?

855
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:47,824
Yes.

856
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,225
You, Ra Jun-mo.

857
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:52,528
All right, just do what you want.

858
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,629
For real?

859
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,398
I'm going to do what I want.

860
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:57,300
Whatever I want!

861
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,202
Go ahead.

862
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:07,577
Producer Tak.

863
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:10,746
Oh, my.

864
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:12,882
Hey, Seung-chan.

865
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:14,784
Jun-mo, you jerk!

866
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:19,889
You guys...

867
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,960
aren't you curious about Jun-mo's secret?

868
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:25,161
Hey!

869
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,731
Jun-mo has a woman.

870
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,199
Hey, Seung-chan.

871
01:04:30,266 --> 01:04:31,500
-A woman--
-Goodness, Seung-chan.

872
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:33,836
-You're way too drunk, Seung-chan.
-A woman...

873
01:04:34,837 --> 01:04:37,240
Did he even do the interview properly?

874
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:38,541
-I'm a bit uneasy.
-Seung-chan.

875
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,343
Get it together.

876
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,280
Oh, it's Tae-ho.

877
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:45,815
Kim Tae-ho.

878
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,518
Is he talking about me?

879
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:54,257
Good old Tae-ho...

880
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,226
He sure is funny when he's drunk.

881
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:02,632
I have an important announcement to make

882
01:05:03,766 --> 01:05:06,135
in front of you all.

883
01:05:06,669 --> 01:05:08,204
It's that--

884
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,406
Hey.

885
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:11,874
My goodness.

886
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,548
Producer Tak, this isn't right.

887
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:20,950
Producer Tak.

888
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,287
You should walk straight.

889
01:05:24,353 --> 01:05:26,589
Stop walking from side to side.

890
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:28,958
Like this?

891
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:31,327
Happy?

892
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,963
Yes, that's good.

893
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:35,798
Now you won't fall.

894
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,100
Jeez, this guy.

895
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:40,303
It's a shame
we're the only ones seeing this.

896
01:05:45,241 --> 01:05:46,142
Producer Tak.

897
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,279
Seung-chan wants a second round of drinks!

898
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,115
I want live octopus!

899
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:54,550
Let's go get live octopus!

900
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:55,618
A second round!

901
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:56,686
Oh, my goodness.

902
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:59,288
Jun-mo, is he imitating someone?

903
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,891
Do you remember?

904
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:06,362
I only heard.
This is my first time seeing it.

905
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:09,498
This is terrible. Oh, no.

906
01:06:10,166 --> 01:06:11,467
I'm like the living Gandhi.

907
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:12,902
Gosh, he's coming.

908
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,004
Please do this for me.

909
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,206
What will we do with him? Do something.

910
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:18,441
Should we take him to a hospital?

911
01:06:18,908 --> 01:06:19,909
Jeez.

912
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:23,612
What is this?

913
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:25,314
This is what you always do.

914
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:26,515
-Me?
-Yes.

915
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,251
Seung-chan wants chicken gizzards.

916
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,088
Chicken gizzards! I want chicken gizzards!

917
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,123
-What should we do?
-Chicken gizzards.

918
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,328
Chicken gizzards!

919
01:06:49,372 --> 01:06:50,906
Hey!

920
01:06:53,809 --> 01:06:54,810
Why, you...

921
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:56,212
That freak!

922
01:07:27,943 --> 01:07:28,911
You're here too?

923
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:32,815
-Do you want some water?
-No, I'm fine.

924
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,086
Did you sleep well, Producer Ra?

925
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:52,768
Did you sleep here too, Producer Tak?

926
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,171
Yes. It was late last night.

927
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,809
Do you remember what you did yesterday?

928
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:03,579
No.

929
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,116
It's better if you don't.
Don't try to remember.

930
01:08:07,683 --> 01:08:09,185
Oh, really?

931
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,820
Is it better if I don't remember?

932
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,474
Don't try to find out.

933
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,577
Hey, you get over here.

934
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,580
Do you think you still live here or what?

935
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:38,814
Look who's talking!

936
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,020
Oh, right. You haven't heard.

937
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,523
Cindy's all good now.

938
01:08:59,768 --> 01:09:02,671
CINDY IS CLEARED OF HER FALSE CHARGES

939
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:08,144
CINDY WANTED TO REVEAL THE TRUTH

940
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,417
CEO POOP KICKED OUT

941
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,886
PROTECT OUR CINDY

942
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,154
VAMPIRE BYUN EXPLOITS HER ARTISTS

943
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,564
Shall I introduce you
to a good cleaning service?

944
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:35,471
When people thought I was lying,

945
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,341
they wrote on my car a few times,
so I found a good service for that.

946
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,144
They will give you a discount
if you say my name.

947
01:09:46,248 --> 01:09:47,917
Have lunch with me, Cindy.

948
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:54,590
Here. This is your contract cancelation.

949
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:58,294
It's proof that I'll leave you alone
until you're done.

950
01:09:58,627 --> 01:10:00,596
I know you won't believe me
if I just tell you.

951
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,539
I can't believe the last thing
I can do for you

952
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:11,807
is to cancel your contract.

953
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:16,111
All this time,

954
01:10:17,713 --> 01:10:20,282
I don't know what I've been doing.

955
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,255
Stamp your seal on it.

956
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,172
Cindy.

957
01:10:46,875 --> 01:10:50,679
Before you stamp your seal on something,
make sure you read it first.

958
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:53,349
Check if there are errors.
Don't just take your seal out.

959
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,318
Got it?

960
01:11:01,824 --> 01:11:02,758
Yes.

961
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:13,168
Don't think I'm canceling your contract

962
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:15,237
because I'm afraid
of what people are saying.

963
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,708
I wouldn't just surrender over
something like that.

964
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:21,810
I know that.

965
01:11:23,512 --> 01:11:24,780
For the last ten years,

966
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,750
you were my joy.

967
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,387
I wanted you to shine alone,

968
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:35,557
so I eliminated any potential competitors.

969
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:38,460
If anyone tried to hurt you,

970
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:42,031
I chased them down
and put them in their place.

971
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:44,466
Before you turned your back on me,

972
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,136
I really thought of you

973
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,638
as my daughter.

974
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:53,776
That's the truth.

975
01:11:57,579 --> 01:11:58,480
I know.

976
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:10,693
You used the wrong methods,

977
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:13,395
but I know you loved me...

978
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,098
Mom.

979
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,069
I want to be free of you

980
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:22,871
because I know that.

981
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:25,374
You, too,

982
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,045
shouldn't be afraid of people leaving you.

983
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,784
There's a limit

984
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:40,255
to using their weakness
by making them sign an unfair contract.

985
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,792
You can't get people

986
01:12:45,227 --> 01:12:46,562
to stay with you that way.

987
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:53,635
I know that you won't change easily.

988
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:54,603
But still...

989
01:12:57,272 --> 01:12:58,407
I wish

990
01:12:59,575 --> 01:13:01,677
you could think about why people leave you

991
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,879
even when you're so devoted to them.

992
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,548
Just once.

993
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:11,987
Think about it just once.

994
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:15,891
I...

995
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,562
I don't want to live like you.

996
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,499
That's why I'm leaving.

997
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,110
Okay.

998
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,780
The food will get cold.

999
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:39,381
Let's eat.

1000
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,004
Hello, Chief Kim.

1001
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,143
Come on. Do what you did yesterday.

1002
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,045
You patted me on the head.

1003
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:12,614
I did?

1004
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,384
You even called me by my first name.

1005
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:20,055
I'm going to quit drinking now.

1006
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,192
How will you do that?

1007
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:25,194
Someone will always force you to drink.

1008
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,363
Just keep asking for forgiveness
when you make mistakes.

1009
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:31,266
I'm sorry.

1010
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:32,634
Yes. Just like that.

1011
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,039
Oh, right. Seung-chan.

1012
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:40,375
About that preview you made...

1013
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:41,543
Yes?

1014
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,214
It was kind of random but pretty funny.

1015
01:14:45,514 --> 01:14:49,151
My daughter said it was insane
and kept laughing.

1016
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:02,598
Even when I was in school,
I never made someone laugh.

1017
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:06,134
Even when I memorized jokes
and tried telling them,

1018
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,871
my friends told me it wasn't funny
and that I should stop.

1019
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:16,278
But to know that the preview I made
actually made a stranger laugh

1020
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,646
feels exhilarating.

1021
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:22,150
I'm happy.

1022
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,520
You're addicted now.

1023
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,154
It's like a drug.

1024
01:15:26,622 --> 01:15:29,858
You go crazy about entertaining people,

1025
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:32,528
about getting applause and cheers.

1026
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:37,499
That's why I'm so happy that I entertained
even one person

1027
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,001
with a 30-second clip.

1028
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,471
To think that my own show will gain
recognition in the future is just...

1029
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:45,774
Congratulations.

1030
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,342
But...

1031
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:50,512
this is bad for your health.

1032
01:15:50,579 --> 01:15:51,980
Which is why I compared it to a drug.

1033
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:56,685
It's bad for my health?

1034
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,954
It will suck the life out of you.

1035
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,924
Look.

1036
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:04,326
This is a room
filled with that kind of stuff.

1037
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,562
Look at the stuffed husky, Brownie.

1038
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:08,864
It used to be a huge hit.

1039
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:13,368
Almost every kid in preschool
had one of those in their house.

1040
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:14,369
But now?

1041
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,573
It's just a bag of cotton.

1042
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:20,309
And this unicorn.

1043
01:16:20,375 --> 01:16:22,511
It was used in Experience of Life.

1044
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:27,282
When one rode this and rose upward,
they were shone with lights

1045
01:16:27,349 --> 01:16:28,350
and there would be smoke.

1046
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:29,818
People clapped at that.

1047
01:16:30,852 --> 01:16:31,887
It was great.

1048
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,190
But now, it's not even close to being
what a merry-go-round horse is worth.

1049
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:40,295
Because popularity fades.

1050
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:41,229
Eventually.

1051
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:46,401
That's why I don't mistreat the props
whenever I come in here.

1052
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:49,104
It's somehow a little sad.

1053
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,442
I never thought about that.

1054
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:56,979
I have a question.

1055
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:02,351
Why aren't you ever
at our meetings or our shoots?

1056
01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,729
Hey, what are you doing in here?

1057
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,999
I'm talking to the floor director.

1058
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:19,935
Who?

1059
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:25,407
Oh...

1060
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:26,775
What?

1061
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:31,380
You shouldn't drink so much.

1062
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:33,515
You're too young to be hallucinating.

1063
01:17:33,582 --> 01:17:38,420
Some people lie and say they work here.

1064
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,722
They use a fake pass to get in and stuff.

1065
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,090
Maybe he could have been one of them?

1066
01:17:42,457 --> 01:17:43,425
You're right.

1067
01:17:44,393 --> 01:17:48,063
If not, it could be a ghost.

1068
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:52,901
Please don't do that.

1069
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:58,006
You talked with him?

1070
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,042
Yes.

1071
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,810
-And ate with him?
-Yes.

1072
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:03,512
And went to the park with him?

1073
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:04,913
But...

1074
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,949
there's never been
a third person with you.

1075
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,486
It was always just the two of you?

1076
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:20,262
-Hey!
-You startled me!

1077
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:22,798
You're going to be successful!

1078
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,269
He met the broadcast station ghost!

1079
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:30,839
Goodness.

1080
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,926
I'm a very scientific person,

1081
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,962
and I've lived my life thinking that
for every effect,

1082
01:18:54,029 --> 01:18:56,098
there is a cause.

1083
01:18:56,431 --> 01:19:00,902
My seniors all think that I hallucinated
or that I'm malnourished,

1084
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,337
or that I'm faking it to go home early.

1085
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:07,042
They even asked me about their futures.

1086
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:11,113
But I definitely didn't see a ghost.

1087
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,948
Then what was it?

1088
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:18,987
A fairy?

1089
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,389
The broadcast station fairy?

1090
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,692
That sounds a lot nicer.

1091
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:26,661
A fairy.

1092
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:29,464
Like Tinkerbell.

1093
01:19:40,142 --> 01:19:41,243
KO YANG-MI

1094
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,781
You didn't respond to my message.

1095
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:50,018
Aren't you taking this too far
over just one mistake?

1096
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:02,664
You startled me!

1097
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:05,267
Do you have time from now until midnight?

1098
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:06,168
Why?

1099
01:20:06,234 --> 01:20:08,436
You should be thanking me right now.

1100
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:09,404
What is it?

1101
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,275
The chief director and the CEO
are having dinner.

1102
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:17,012
They were wondering who to bring,
and I strongly recommended you.

1103
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,814
-Really?
-Of course.

1104
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,150
-You better do a good job today.
-Of course!

1105
01:20:25,854 --> 01:20:28,957
As you know, Hong-sun is great
with the protocol.

1106
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:30,258
He's a pro.

1107
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,494
The CEO is very strict.

1108
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,262
He holds grudges.

1109
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:38,733
He's also in a bad mood these days
because of the budget.

1110
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:41,069
Leave it to Hong-sun.

1111
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:41,970
Okay.

1112
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,539
The CEO likes to drink.

1113
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:48,577
I'll pull out all the stops today.

1114
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:51,213
I'll do my best today!

1115
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:53,682
Sir.

1116
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:58,019
Thank you so much for inviting me
to such an honored occasion.

1117
01:20:58,086 --> 01:20:58,920
It's nothing.

1118
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,756
Sit comfortably. Why are you so stiff?

1119
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,726
Producer Kim Hong-sun exercises a lot.

1120
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,695
His body is very hard.

1121
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,698
Show him, Hong-sun.

1122
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:15,804
This is embarrassing.

1123
01:21:17,806 --> 01:21:19,975
Wow, you do exercise a lot.

1124
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:24,246
Muscles like this
come from years of exercise.

1125
01:21:25,347 --> 01:21:27,048
I guess things are relaxed
in your department.

1126
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,254
People have time to exercise.

1127
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,325
Allow me.

1128
01:21:38,226 --> 01:21:40,662
This is my turf.

1129
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,592
Ta-da!

1130
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,231
The taste of North Pole.
It's the Aurora drink!

1131
01:22:20,268 --> 01:22:21,403
That's delicious.

1132
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,746
Sir, you must take care of your health.

1133
01:22:31,813 --> 01:22:33,114
Please remember.

1134
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,517
This contains red ginseng extract.

1135
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,352
Drink up, sir.

1136
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,459
I'm sorry.
I should've turned my phone off.

1137
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,028
That's okay.

1138
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,464
He's quite a guy.

1139
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,834
I'll give you 30 minutes.
Your 30 minutes of destiny.

1140
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:56,604
If you don't get here by then,
it's really over between us.

1141
01:22:56,671 --> 01:22:58,907
Come to that spicy rice cake restaurant.

1142
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:05,947
Producer Kim, take a shot.

1143
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,182
I...

1144
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:10,952
I think I must be crazy.

1145
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:13,488
I'm sorry, sir.

1146
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:36,044
It's been an hour.

1147
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,480
You missed the deadline.

1148
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:42,484
It's a miracle that I got here this fast
all the way from Gangnam.

1149
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:47,188
If you knew what I had to give up to come,
you wouldn't be saying that.

1150
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,757
What did you give up?

1151
01:23:50,525 --> 01:23:51,793
Don't try to find out.

1152
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,496
You'll feel terrible if you do.

1153
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,233
Can we get some rice here?

1154
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:04,806
Allow me.

1155
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,777
This is my turf.

1156
01:24:27,595 --> 01:24:28,463
Here.

1157
01:24:34,202 --> 01:24:35,937
I can't believe

1158
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:38,039
I'm using all my skills here.

1159
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:42,277
I already regret it.

1160
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:43,978
I must've lost my mind.

1161
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:45,280
After I came to my senses,

1162
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,649
I realized that
I lost the chief director and the CEO.

1163
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:50,151
Yes, I did get Yang-mi,

1164
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:52,520
but it's not like
she's the CEO's daughter.

1165
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,691
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

1166
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:58,560
The chief director is refusing my calls.

1167
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:02,964
Hello.

1168
01:25:03,498 --> 01:25:04,966
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

1169
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:08,369
It's so nice that the street lamps
come on now.

1170
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,270
Oh, yes.

1171
01:25:09,637 --> 01:25:11,473
They're supposed to come on
in a certain order.

1172
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:15,243
The lights back there
were supposed to go on first.

1173
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,345
But we got a lot of complaints.

1174
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,047
-Complaints?
-Yes.

1175
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:23,184
Some guy kept calling
from morning to night, all day long.

1176
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:24,986
And he didn't just call us.

1177
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:27,622
He even made a big fuss
at the district office too.

1178
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:29,224
Is he a resident here?

1179
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:30,959
No, he doesn't even live here.

1180
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,461
I don't understand
why he was so persistent.

1181
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,930
I see.

1182
01:25:35,997 --> 01:25:38,466
So, I asked him what he did for a living.

1183
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:41,503
He said he was a TV producer.

1184
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,372
He threatened that
he would show up with cameras

1185
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:46,274
if we didn't get the lights here
turned on first.

1186
01:25:47,075 --> 01:25:48,109
Oh, I see.

1187
01:25:52,580 --> 01:25:53,481
Seung-chan.

1188
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,049
Yes?

1189
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:56,851
Listen up.

1190
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:59,754
I'm your senior,
and you're my junior, right?

1191
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:01,823
Yes.

1192
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,726
I don't want things to get awkward
between us

1193
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:06,995
because of what happened.

1194
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:09,497
I feel the same way.

1195
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:12,700
Then why did you do that?

1196
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,235
Excuse me?

1197
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:15,737
Listen.

1198
01:26:17,038 --> 01:26:19,874
You did something
a producer must never do.

1199
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,977
That was the worst thing ever.

1200
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:25,780
Excuse me? What did I do?

1201
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:28,583
Thanks to you, it got resolved.

1202
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:30,351
The lights come on now.

1203
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:33,254
Lights? Where?

1204
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:36,624
It's an amenity for residents,

1205
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:39,727
so filing a complaint is fine.

1206
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:42,697
But why did you tell them
that you're a producer?

1207
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,999
Who taught you to do that?

1208
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:49,604
You don't even have that authority,
but you abused it anyway.

1209
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:54,542
-Producer Tak, I have no idea--
-You threatened to show up with a camera?

1210
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,213
What were you going to do?
Were you going to take a selfie?

1211
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:01,716
By any chance,

1212
01:27:02,283 --> 01:27:06,087
are you talking about the street lamps?

1213
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:07,622
Yes.

1214
01:27:07,689 --> 01:27:10,391
Oh, they light up now?

1215
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:12,994
Yes.

1216
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,330
Did someone file a complaint?

1217
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:17,265
Yes.

1218
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:21,002
And that person said he was a producer?

1219
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:22,003
Yes, he did.

1220
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:28,209
It wasn't me.

1221
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:30,445
It wasn't you?

1222
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:32,347
It wasn't.

1223
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,149
Then who was it?

1224
01:27:43,157 --> 01:27:46,094
You got all aggressive last time.

1225
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,664
So, it totally...

1226
01:27:50,331 --> 01:27:51,332
I shouldn't have done that.

1227
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:55,570
-What is it with me?
-I don't know.

1228
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,747
You know, you sometimes
stare at people in a weird way.

1229
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:07,849
What is it this time?

1230
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:11,185
It's nothing.

1231
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:13,921
I'm going to edit now.

1232
01:28:13,988 --> 01:28:15,823
-Be aggressive.
-Okay.

1233
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:23,564
Hey, Seung-chan.

1234
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:25,433
Yes?

1235
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,534
I have good news.

1236
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:29,304
What is it?

1237
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,139
Our show is still safe.

1238
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:35,543
The viewer ratings went up a bit,

1239
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,612
thanks to Cindy

1240
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,615
and thanks to your preview.

1241
01:28:44,419 --> 01:28:45,320
Thank you.

1242
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,556
Make this week's preview too.

1243
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,959
I'm not going to touch it at all.

1244
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:53,361
It's all your responsibility.

1245
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:55,063
Got it.

1246
01:28:55,697 --> 01:28:56,597
Okay.

1247
01:29:00,034 --> 01:29:00,902
Producer Ra.

1248
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:04,172
What?

1249
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:06,007
How did you manage

1250
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:11,813
to be friends with Producer Tak

1251
01:29:13,314 --> 01:29:14,716
for so long?

1252
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,356
What?

1253
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,625
Did I know my show would last that long?

1254
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,362
Oh, of course not.

1255
01:29:27,428 --> 01:29:28,996
Nobody knows

1256
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,766
if a show is going to last a long time.

1257
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,370
You just think,
"Maybe I'll give it a shot."

1258
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:39,941
Or, "I'll do my best,
but I'll end it if it doesn't go well."

1259
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:44,879
A lot of shows like that
have become long-running shows.

1260
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,348
Nobody thought 30 or 40 years ago,

1261
01:29:47,415 --> 01:29:51,252
"This show is going to last a long time."

1262
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:53,221
It's the same for
National Singing Contest.

1263
01:29:53,521 --> 01:29:57,158
When I first started,
we visited every county.

1264
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,961
Since there are only
around 230 counties in Korea,

1265
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,997
I thought the show would end
after two years.

1266
01:30:03,064 --> 01:30:05,666
But there are so many places to go now.

1267
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,969
It's the same with human relationships.

1268
01:30:08,035 --> 01:30:11,539
You just happened
to become friends somehow,

1269
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:13,841
but the friendship lasts a long time.

1270
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,377
That happens often.

1271
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,779
It's exactly like that.

1272
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,583
I had no idea about

1273
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:29,924
how things would unfold
in the short span of time this spring.

1274
01:30:31,692 --> 01:30:32,860
On that rainy night,

1275
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:36,664
I realized that

1276
01:30:37,231 --> 01:30:39,233
all the things I had learned in school
were useless.

1277
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,736
And I thought working here

1278
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:44,705
was a mistake.

1279
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,678
I didn't know when the show
would get canceled,

1280
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:54,782
so it always kept me nervous
and on my toes.

1281
01:30:55,583 --> 01:30:56,918
This is what I thought every night,

1282
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:01,456
"Let's try it today,
and I'll quit if it doesn't work out.

1283
01:31:03,157 --> 01:31:06,427
I'll work tomorrow
and run away if it's not right."

1284
01:31:08,696 --> 01:31:12,600
As I got through each day
living in the present,

1285
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:17,305
spring has been passing by
equally for everyone.

1286
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:22,643
Is it funny? Pretty good?

1287
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,479
Wasn't that caption good?

1288
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,347
Yes.

1289
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:30,585
One person got to rethink
his relationship with someone

1290
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,421
he thought would always be there.

1291
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:48,302
And one person gave up many things

1292
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:52,473
to set out on her own.

1293
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:04,685
Some experienced the unlikely miracle
of hate turning into love.

1294
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:11,092
Another is trying every day
to protect something

1295
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,494
that has grown more precious over time.

1296
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:15,329
12. UNDERSTANDING LONG-RUNNING SHOWS

1297
01:32:15,396 --> 01:32:18,432
DON'T FORGET THE BEGINNING

1298
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:24,939
As the season passed by like that,

1299
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:28,409
I'm trying not to forget the beginning.

1300
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:33,915
My beginning that seems
so long ago already.

1301
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:44,592
I thought I was
the most useless person ever,

1302
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:47,662
just trying to get through one day,

1303
01:32:52,233 --> 01:32:56,537
and having fears about
not getting through tomorrow.

1304
01:32:58,472 --> 01:32:59,540
I'm trying not to forget that.

1305
01:33:03,811 --> 01:33:05,079
You've really grown up, Seung-chan.

1306
01:33:06,814 --> 01:33:07,848
And...

1307
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:12,653
there was the connection that formed
without me knowing.

1308
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:18,593
I was happy this spring because of her,

1309
01:33:20,161 --> 01:33:21,495
and I'll try not to forget that.

1310
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:53,961
Hello?

1311
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:57,632
Jun-mo, there's a huge mosquito
in my house.

1312
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,369
-What?
-Is it because I live near a mountain?

1313
01:34:01,435 --> 01:34:04,538
-It's a huge mosquito--
-So what?

1314
01:34:04,939 --> 01:34:06,607
You need to catch it for me.

1315
01:34:07,742 --> 01:34:09,844
I tried using
the electric swatter you bought me,

1316
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:11,345
but I can't even see it.

1317
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:12,580
Are you kidding me?

1318
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:15,950
So, you want me to come
all the way to Gyeonggi-do

1319
01:34:16,017 --> 01:34:17,051
to catch a mosquito?

1320
01:34:17,785 --> 01:34:20,521
Hey, I already got bitten twice.

1321
01:34:21,222 --> 01:34:24,358
Just let it bite you.
They need to eat to live too.

1322
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,294
You're really not going to come?

1323
01:34:27,928 --> 01:34:29,497
No. Bye.

1324
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,043
This is annoying.

1325
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:47,915
Man...

1326
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,918
Just to catch a mosquito,

1327
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,424
do I have to go to Gyeonggi-do?
This is nuts.

1328
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,896
I told her to stay in Yeouido.

1329
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,965
Why did she have to move here?

1330
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:07,068
This is only inconveniencing me!

1331
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,565
What are you doing out here?

1332
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,868
What do you think about the lights?
They're bright, right?

1333
01:35:41,969 --> 01:35:44,972
Yeah. Does look so.

1334
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:48,642
Someone filed a bunch of complaints.

1335
01:35:50,644 --> 01:35:52,046
-Really?
-Yes.

1336
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:56,283
He said he was a producer
and threatened to use his power

1337
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,052
and barge in with a camera.

1338
01:35:58,119 --> 01:36:00,755
Hey! I never said that!

1339
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:04,859
The guy kept asking me what my job was,

1340
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,661
so I just answered
and told him I was a producer.

1341
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:09,597
Right.

1342
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:11,632
So it was you.

1343
01:36:14,168 --> 01:36:15,102
Yes!

1344
01:36:15,569 --> 01:36:16,504
That's right!

1345
01:36:16,837 --> 01:36:20,574
You called me all the way here
in the middle of the night

1346
01:36:20,641 --> 01:36:22,042
just to ask me that?

1347
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:25,179
You were lying
about the mosquito, weren't you?

1348
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:27,314
Is that really important now?

1349
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:29,383
You...

1350
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:31,385
The lazy, selfish sleepyhead.

1351
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:36,323
You came all the way here at this hour
after I called you.

1352
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:39,760
Why did you come here?

1353
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:46,000
Why did you file complaints like a madman
to get the street lamps turned on?

1354
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:52,439
If you're not going to answer,
I'm going home.

1355
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:55,009
Wait!

1356
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:06,253
Tak Ye-jin.

1357
01:37:08,556 --> 01:37:09,557
Listen carefully.

1358
01:37:13,060 --> 01:37:14,261
When we were students,

1359
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:20,434
it was tough for me
because you got such good grades.

1360
01:37:21,368 --> 01:37:24,305
It was hard because I had to get
in the same university as you.

1361
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:30,978
When you suddenly wanted
to become a TV producer,

1362
01:37:31,345 --> 01:37:32,580
that was a huge pain too.

1363
01:37:33,614 --> 01:37:37,751
I had to study for that mass media exam.

1364
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,790
It was a huge pain, and it was tough,

1365
01:37:44,491 --> 01:37:47,228
but I followed you around.

1366
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:49,363
But...

1367
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:52,299
even as I spent half my life

1368
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,468
following you around,

1369
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:56,871
I didn't know.

1370
01:37:59,473 --> 01:38:01,008
I didn't know that I wasn't following you

1371
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:03,711
out of habit.

1372
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:07,214
I was following you out of love.

1373
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:13,120
I was worried

1374
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:18,192
that if I told you this
and if we started dating,

1375
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:22,396
you would get sick of me

1376
01:38:23,831 --> 01:38:25,299
being so lazy and stupid,

1377
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,968
which would make you break up with me.

1378
01:38:29,803 --> 01:38:32,406
That's why I kept hesitating.

1379
01:38:34,341 --> 01:38:35,643
But you never left me.

1380
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:38,779
You always...

1381
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:42,316
stuck by my side.

1382
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:48,122
Thank you.

1383
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:40,274
Producer Baek!

1384
01:39:43,043 --> 01:39:43,877
Hi.

1385
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:46,347
Why are you alone?

1386
01:39:49,383 --> 01:39:52,119
My manager is on the bus.

1387
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:54,955
There's some traffic.

1388
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:58,359
It's a one-person agency.

1389
01:39:58,859 --> 01:40:00,594
We're still a bit inexperienced.

1390
01:40:03,263 --> 01:40:04,164
I see.

1391
01:40:09,436 --> 01:40:10,838
Good luck, Cindy.

1392
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:14,408
Okay.

1393
01:40:15,075 --> 01:40:15,909
Thanks.

1394
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:18,445
I'll leave then.

1395
01:40:19,747 --> 01:40:21,248
Do you want to play rock, paper, scissors?

1396
01:40:23,083 --> 01:40:23,951
Excuse me?

1397
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:26,186
The loser carries the luggage.

1398
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,991
But I don't have any luggage.

1399
01:40:31,425 --> 01:40:32,326
I'll play scissors.

1400
01:40:32,393 --> 01:40:34,128
Don't play, and you lose!
Rock, paper, scissors!

1401
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:43,203
Wow, you sure are competitive.

1402
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,306
Fine. I lose.

1403
01:40:47,674 --> 01:40:49,710
I'll beat you one day though.

1404
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:52,679
Go ahead.

1405
01:41:36,723 --> 01:41:38,225
Wait up!

1406
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:14,795
We've been given three months.

1407
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:17,531
We have to really make it work
by this fall.

1408
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,968
A lot of people say we've changed.

1409
01:42:22,402 --> 01:42:24,638
Come up with some ideas!

1410
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,876
-A producer special.
-Will you be responsible for that?

1411
01:42:28,942 --> 01:42:30,511
-It had better not fail!
-Okay.

1412
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,748
I won't be so indecisive anymore.

1413
01:42:35,215 --> 01:42:39,286
I'm going to be more firm and pushy.
Putting all my chips on the table.

1414
01:42:39,987 --> 01:42:43,557
I think out teamwork has grown stronger.

1415
01:42:44,391 --> 01:42:45,559
I have a good feeling about this.

1416
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:48,695
What?

1417
01:42:50,430 --> 01:42:51,498
Me and Ye-jin?

1418
01:42:52,499 --> 01:42:55,369
Oh, we're doing great.

1419
01:42:56,803 --> 01:42:59,206
Wait. Let's be serious.

1420
01:43:00,307 --> 01:43:03,610
I don't think it's a good idea
to have footage

1421
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:05,379
of this kind of thing.

1422
01:43:06,547 --> 01:43:08,248
Nobody knows
what will happen in the future.

1423
01:43:08,782 --> 01:43:11,685
I wondered why people
obsess with homeownership,

1424
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,921
but now I know since I own an apartment.

1425
01:43:14,721 --> 01:43:16,823
I feel like my life has changed.

1426
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,159
It's like my quality of life is higher.

1427
01:43:22,162 --> 01:43:25,165
Jeez, every morning is such a hassle.

1428
01:43:25,232 --> 01:43:30,270
It's like saving a file
under a different name.

1429
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:33,373
I turned a friend into a boyfriend.

1430
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:37,277
Now that I have so much,
I feel a lot more relaxed.

1431
01:43:37,978 --> 01:43:42,049
Now, I don't get
all bent out of shape about things.

1432
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:45,052
I just go with the flow.

1433
01:43:46,587 --> 01:43:47,821
Excuse me.

1434
01:43:49,323 --> 01:43:50,257
Hello.

1435
01:43:51,825 --> 01:43:53,093
An order from the chief director?

1436
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:56,930
What kind of nonsense is this?

1437
01:43:56,997 --> 01:43:58,031
No way.

1438
01:43:58,098 --> 01:44:00,901
I won't allow
a crummy performance like that!

1439
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,237
I don't care if it's an order.

1440
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:07,975
I'll talk to you later.

1441
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:14,481
We may be a one-person agency,
but nothing has changed.

1442
01:44:14,681 --> 01:44:18,418
A rookie might be nervous
about this situation,

1443
01:44:18,885 --> 01:44:20,053
but I'm Cindy.

1444
01:44:24,224 --> 01:44:27,127
We parked the car to do an interview.

1445
01:44:27,194 --> 01:44:28,996
Why would you leave the engine running?

1446
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:31,298
Gas doesn't grow on trees, you know!

1447
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:38,538
Now that I'm out on my own,

1448
01:44:39,506 --> 01:44:42,376
things aren't all that easy.

1449
01:44:44,511 --> 01:44:47,047
The toughest thing, of course...

1450
01:44:50,651 --> 01:44:51,785
is Baek Seung-chan.

1451
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:02,696
The preview I made is ranked eighth
in the search engines.

1452
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:05,265
I got up to sixth last time.

1453
01:45:05,832 --> 01:45:06,933
I made a screen capture.

1454
01:45:07,434 --> 01:45:10,937
It's not like I'm trying to get famous,

1455
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:14,074
but so many people like my previews

1456
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:19,079
and call me the Bong Jun-ho
or Park Chan-wook of previews.

1457
01:45:19,446 --> 01:45:20,380
They give compliments.

1458
01:45:21,014 --> 01:45:25,185
It's a bit excessive,
but I keep it in my heart...

1459
01:45:25,585 --> 01:45:26,486
Excuse me?

1460
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:29,022
We're missing receipts?

1461
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:33,060
But I made sure everything was there.

1462
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,029
Hey, get it together with these receipts!

1463
01:45:36,430 --> 01:45:38,231
And you call yourself a producer?

1464
01:45:40,867 --> 01:45:41,835
Just a moment.

1465
01:45:42,903 --> 01:45:43,804
Producer Ra.
