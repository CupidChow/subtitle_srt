1
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,052
I think that from now on
and for the rest of your life,

2
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,624
amusement parks will remind you of me.

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,772
What's with that look?

4
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,146
Well...

5
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,516
I...

6
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,954
This hasn't happened to me before.

7
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,491
You think I have done this a lot?

8
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,993
No. That's not what I meant.

9
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,761
You think a celebrity...

10
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,564
would do this anytime,

11
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,967
to anyone?

12
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,436
No. I didn't mean that.

13
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,941
Then what did you mean?

14
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:24,811
Excuse me?

15
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,149
What did it mean?

16
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,885
What I just did...

17
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,821
to you...

18
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,330
Say something.

19
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,400
Am I a show host?

20
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,169
You're making it look like
I'm interviewing you.

21
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:57,644
Well...

22
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,114
-I--
-Wait.

23
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,821
I'll give you some time.

24
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,157
Excuse me?

25
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:15,295
I think I startled you just now.

26
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,431
You must be kind of flustered.

27
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,302
So you shouldn't answer right away.

28
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,872
I'll give you some time.

29
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,377
Once you organize your thoughts...

30
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,747
tell me then.

31
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,388
I'll be waiting.

32
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,437
BYUN ENTERTAINMENT
GENERAL MANAGER KIM

33
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,371
What's this?

34
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,807
These people made me
the most hated person ever,

35
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,075
and now they're calling?

36
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:02,976
DECLINE

37
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,182
Why do they keep calling?

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,784
JUN-MO

39
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,656
Hey, Jun-mo. There's such bad traffic.

40
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,992
Did you meet with the manager?

41
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,960
Of course I did.

42
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,130
This place will close
by the time you get here.

43
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,433
-Manager.
-Yes?

44
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,901
How long before the fireworks?

45
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:29,936
One hour.

46
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,539
One hour until the fireworks. Hurry up.

47
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,675
No.

48
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,977
But that doesn't mean

49
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,346
you should get angry and start speeding.

50
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,248
Drive carefully.

51
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:45,385
-Call me when you get here.
-Okay.

52
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,887
What about Cindy and Seung-chan?

53
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,558
Gosh...

54
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,028
Someone might think
I got rejected by a guy.

55
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,066
Did he reject me?

56
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,306
No way.

57
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:08,007
I didn't get a response yet.

58
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:11,744
I bet he was nervous.

59
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,014
Because a celebrity
suddenly did that to him.

60
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,383
He was probably flustered.

61
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,520
Yes, that's it.

62
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,722
Act natural.

63
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:24,257
As if nothing happened.

64
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,592
Act like Cindy.

65
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,715
Let's get going.

66
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,052
Already?

67
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,292
I'm tired.

68
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,568
Producer Tak isn't here yet,

69
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:13,206
and I haven't heard from Producer Ra
about whether he's done with his work.

70
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,075
-And--
-And what?

71
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,412
It's your birthday.

72
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,916
So, I thought it would be nice for us

73
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,085
to all get together and celebrate.

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,521
You don't have to...

75
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,503
No, we're okay.

76
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,309
Take a photo.

77
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:27,814
It's my birthday today. Take a photo.

78
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,496
My face...

79
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,797
Excuse me?

80
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,934
You have a small face.
Why did you stand so far behind me?

81
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,869
Did I do that?

82
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,471
Look.

83
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,372
My face looks huge.

84
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,874
It's similar.

85
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,444
Plus, you're wearing a hat,

86
00:07:58,511 --> 00:07:59,846
so your face doesn't really show.

87
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,014
How is this similar?

88
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,684
Have you never taken a photo with a girl?

89
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:05,985
Excuse me?

90
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,021
Not really.

91
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,891
Aside from family photos or group photos.

92
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,893
I knew it.

93
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,596
That's why you're so clueless.

94
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,967
These are basic manners.

95
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,404
-Manners?
-Sure.

96
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,508
A guy should put his face forward
when he takes a picture with a girl.

97
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,711
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,149
This can't be seen by anyone,
so I'll just keep it.

99
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,585
Yes, go ahead.

100
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,222
Jeez...

101
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,258
Only my face looks big.

102
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,461
It's not that your face is big.

103
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,663
It's the light from the flash.

104
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,408
Cindy.

105
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,312
Do you feel awkward or bored right now?

106
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,047
Well...

107
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,818
A little bit, I guess.

108
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,754
Then hold on tight.

109
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:16,188
What?

110
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,723
Okay.

111
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,531
Don't come out. I'm here.

112
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,266
I got a ticket to get in.

113
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,034
Where are you and Seung-chan?

114
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:04,136
Oh, really?

115
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,705
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

116
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,778
Hello?

117
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,981
Car license plate 6696, right?

118
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,682
You left your light on.

119
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:20,119
Really? Thank you. Bye.

120
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,890
She said she would be here.
What's taking her so long?

121
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,726
She loves fireworks.

122
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,362
There are only 20 minutes left. Jeez...

123
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,832
Where are you?

124
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,433
I went in,

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,003
but someone called and told me
that I left my car light on.

126
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:37,903
Yes.

127
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,773
What?

128
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,644
But Jun-mo...

129
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,613
I took down my phone number.

130
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,882
How did this person know my number?

131
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,251
Wait, what are you talking about?

132
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,221
How can they call you
if you took your number down?

133
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:57,456
Hello?

134
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,126
Ye-jin.

135
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,240
General Manager Kim.

136
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,144
Gosh. You scared me.

137
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,078
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,283
What brings you here, General Manager Kim?

139
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,326
Were you the one who called me

140
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,429
about my light being left on?

141
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,331
Because you don't answer my calls.

142
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,369
I was going to call you back.

143
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,337
I didn't think you would go this far...

144
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,208
So why are you here?

145
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,043
Because of Cindy.

146
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:52,712
Cindy?

147
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,180
What?

148
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,515
You have Cindy with you.

149
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,751
Excuse me? Who? Me?

150
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,321
I have no idea what you're talking about.

151
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,990
I know everything.

152
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,362
But the biggest problem is,

153
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,965
we've never lost touch with her this long.

154
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,268
Maybe something terrible happened.
An accident, perhaps.

155
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,037
Or a kidnapping.

156
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,106
This won't do.

157
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,541
Right, we should report this
to the police.

158
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,745
You want to tell the world

159
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,747
that Cindy disappeared?

160
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,182
We couldn't report it to the police,

161
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,084
so we couldn't check surveillance footage.

162
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,787
So I used other ways.

163
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:10,556
You checked the black box?

164
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,224
Yes.

165
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,260
There was nothing.

166
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,762
It just shows the front and back.

167
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,271
After that, I'm sorry to say this,

168
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,573
but I started to follow you.

169
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:34,046
I saw Cindy come out of your house
to throw out recyclables.

170
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,482
She should have just stayed inside.

171
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,185
Why would she recycle
when she's trying to lie low?

172
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,887
She's different from how she looks.

173
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:43,756
She's very tidy.

174
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,626
Anyway, I'm sorry for how it turned out.

175
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,328
Well...

176
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:52,064
I had no choice at the time.

177
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,935
Jun-mo!

178
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:56,969
Ye-jin!

179
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,337
Are you okay?

180
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,509
-Is that you, General Manager Kim?
-My head...

181
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,181
Gosh. It was dark.

182
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,783
I didn't recognize you.

183
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,652
-Are you okay?
-Don't touch!

184
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:17,289
I hit you with all my strength.

185
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,258
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

186
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,159
Hey!

187
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,127
What was that about?

188
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,796
Don't just swing at anyone!

189
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,098
It made a really loud sound.

190
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,667
Right? It was loud, right?

191
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,071
I got scared because you hung up
the phone so abruptly!

192
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,440
That's why I swung at him.

193
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,443
-Are you okay?
-Man...

194
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,382
Give her a break today. It's her birthday.

195
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,620
CEO Byun is freaking out.

196
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,556
You know how she is.

197
00:14:57,162 --> 00:15:00,966
Cindy might end up like that other girl.

198
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,936
That's why I'm doing this.

199
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,979
Okay. I get it.

200
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,381
But just leave today.

201
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:19,018
I'll take care of Cindy
and bring her to you.

202
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,322
The fireworks will start soon.

203
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,527
My head...

204
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:53,519
Happy birthday, Cindy!

205
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:54,586
Happy birthday!

206
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,854
Happy birthday!

207
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,192
Yeah.

208
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:02,461
Thanks.

209
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,762
They're going off there.

210
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,190
Look.

211
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:32,925
Over there.

212
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,128
It's a heart shape?

213
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,834
Awesome.

214
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,474
-So cool!
-How nice!

215
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,830
Who takes a singer to karaoke?

216
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,098
This is rude.

217
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,334
You can just sit and listen, Cindy.

218
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,105
We always end a birthday beautifully
at a karaoke.

219
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:21,106
Right.

220
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,975
Can you sing, Seung-chan?

221
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,945
Well, I just...

222
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,748
Jun-mo is really good.

223
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,051
Back when he was a student,

224
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,752
everyone told him to become a singer.

225
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:37,189
Oh, come on.

226
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,528
People have told me that too.

227
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,962
To become a singer.

228
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:47,366
They told you that? Who did?

229
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,138
You could be in the top ten
of a singing competition!

230
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,076
Seung-chan!

231
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,978
You can really sing.

232
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,346
That was great.

233
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,750
The karaoke machine would always say

234
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,752
-I should consider being a singer.
-Really?

235
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,255
Hey, that's just what the machine
is designed to say.

236
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:13,659
Whenever I go to karaoke,
I get 99 and 100.

237
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,061
And how could you sing that?

238
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,730
You're here with your seniors,
and that's the song you sing?

239
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:19,765
Good job.

240
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,400
-Ye-jin.
-What?

241
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:23,435
Time to start the engine.

242
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:24,403
Shall we?

243
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,940
Let's go.

244
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:28,000
We still got it!

245
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,002
We're awesome!

246
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,371
We're a great team!

247
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,977
-Getting better every time.
-Yeah.

248
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:44,349
Oh my God. That's my favorite song!

249
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,352
I always ask Jun-mo to sing this for me,

250
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,556
but he never does because it's about
a younger guy and an older girl.

251
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,291
Seung-chan!

252
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,796
I don't want to act like you're older.

253
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:01,166
That's the song he chooses
when I complained about it earlier.

254
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,771
You just think of me as a boy

255
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:08,707
No more than that

256
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,610
You say I'm cute

257
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:14,379
But you are a woman to me

258
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,616
You say, "What do you know?

259
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,619
You'll understand when you grow up."

260
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,722
You say that I'm acting rashly

261
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,158
But you are a woman to me

262
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,292
Is this fun to you?

263
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,795
No matter who you meet

264
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,632
No matter what you do

265
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,536
-I can only wait
-Whale.

266
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,872
-Because you are my woman
-Crab.

267
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:45,010
Because you are my woman

268
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:48,080
I'll just call you by your name

269
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:50,983
No matter what you say

270
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,619
I hold you tight

271
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,989
So you can forget your sadness

272
00:20:57,055 --> 00:20:59,958
I'll just call you by your name

273
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,463
I don't care what you say

274
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,565
Just stay in my arms

275
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,134
Seung-chan! You're so manly!

276
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,170
You are just a soft-hearted girl

277
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,806
-Hey. Turn this off.
-Because

278
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,442
-Stop it! Come on.
-I like you

279
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,245
Because you are my woman

280
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:23,282
Because you are my woman

281
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:27,019
I'm crazy for you

282
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,487
I'm sorry...

283
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,460
Oh, no. Sorry.

284
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:36,862
I pressed the wrong button.

285
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,564
Want to start over from the beginning?

286
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,966
No.

287
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,436
VVIP tickets to my concerts
are really expensive.

288
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:47,939
I would never sing using
such a shoddy microphone and speaker.

289
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,375
But because today's a special day...

290
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:52,177
Go, Cindy!

291
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:57,449
-Good job.
-Cindy.

292
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:17,202
How did I fall in love with you?

293
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:20,772
How can it hurt this much?

294
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:27,713
I've never want someone this much

295
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:30,849
If I keep saying how much I miss you

296
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:34,286
Will you be able to hear it?

297
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,991
If I cry and beg will you know how I feel?

298
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,260
-Goodbye.
-See you.

299
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:39,277
WAS CINDY'S ACCIDENT REALLY AN ACCIDENT?

300
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:40,879
WE WANT THE TRUTH!
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

301
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,991
You should eat before you go.

302
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:57,496
I bought the quinoa
and lentils that you asked for.

303
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,232
If you don't eat them,
nobody else in this house will.

304
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,135
General Manager Kim is waiting downstairs.

305
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,372
Really?

306
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,642
Okay then.

307
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,045
Let's go. I'll walk you out.

308
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:19,150
I didn't use the Internet here,
so I didn't know

309
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,120
that you went through a lot of trouble.

310
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:28,059
Oh that. It was a bit of trouble.

311
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,929
They broke my car's side mirror.

312
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:32,998
The repairs cost a lot.

313
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:36,401
But it's okay.

314
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:37,736
Okay.

315
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,106
What?

316
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,275
You said it was okay.

317
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:47,646
Yes. It's okay.

318
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,217
Just a second.

319
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:58,290
What are you doing?

320
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,925
Thank you for your hospitality.

321
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,729
I'll drop her off.

322
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,506
She's even rude when she says goodbye.

323
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,276
This is why they say to never help
an ungrateful person.

324
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,245
They're right in saying that.

325
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:27,052
Ye-jin.

326
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:31,723
I think I just saw Jun-mo and Cindy

327
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,525
coming out of our house.

328
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,228
I'm dreaming, right?

329
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,397
Yes, you're dreaming.

330
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,066
It's a meaningless dream.

331
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,006
Cindy.

332
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:51,943
Thank you, Producer.

333
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,213
Thank you for waiting.

334
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,482
Explain well to CEO Byun.

335
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,317
Yes. Of course. Goodbye.

336
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,786
Hey...

337
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:04,689
This isn't important, but...

338
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,093
Please don't tell people that

339
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,296
Ye-jin and I are temporarily

340
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,799
sharing an address.

341
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:18,403
Oh. I was surprised by that actually.

342
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,505
I won't tell anyone else.

343
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,542
How nice.

344
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,361
"And I longed desperately

345
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,464
to really live for once,

346
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:50,135
to give something of myself to the world.

347
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,471
To enter into a relationship

348
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,473
and battle with it.

349
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,110
I felt that now

350
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,481
at this very moment

351
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:09,154
I would have to meet my beloved,

352
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:14,492
as she walked past me
at the next street corner,

353
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,936
called to me from the nearest window."

354
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:47,392
Two are with one here,
so it's a love triangle.

355
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,261
These two voted for each other,

356
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,597
but the guy isn't that into her.

357
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,333
I think only the girl likes him.

358
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,703
And Cindy got no votes.

359
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,505
She didn't vote for anyone, either.

360
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:04,776
Yet she was the one
we were most looking forward to.

361
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:08,046
I think the guys find her difficult.

362
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:13,351
We need to see serious romance
to get good viewer ratings.

363
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,487
Since that's the concept
for the new season.

364
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,322
There is romance, though.

365
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,457
Notting Hill.

366
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,425
Notting Hill?

367
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,693
Seung-chan.

368
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,029
The writers all think he's handsome.

369
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:28,733
They're trying to get him
together with Cindy.

370
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,137
That's why we sent Seung-chan
on an errand during the meeting.

371
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,038
Really?

372
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,975
It wasn't on purpose.

373
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,311
Cindy and Seung-chan were shown together,

374
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,548
and he tied her shoelace and everything.

375
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,784
That got a pretty good reaction.

376
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:48,853
How about we try to push them together?

377
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:51,689
What are you saying?

378
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,992
It's not like it will work even if we do.

379
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,527
It's not realistic.

380
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,995
That's true.

381
00:29:57,762 --> 00:29:59,631
But we can make it look cute.

382
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,835
When the cast invite friends
to their homes,

383
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:07,172
should we get Seung-chan to follow Cindy?

384
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,274
-Great idea!
-That would be great.

385
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:10,875
You never know.

386
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,745
Cindy might like Seung-chan.

387
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,445
MANAGER PARK

388
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:49,714
Hey.

389
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,951
The CEO is heading over to your house.

390
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:53,985
Okay.

391
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,142
Da-jeong.

392
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,680
I told you not to get
personal packages delivered to the office.

393
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,717
This is for you.

394
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,952
From who?

395
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,054
Looks like Cindy's fan club.

396
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,824
Goodness! Get rid of it.

397
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,425
It could be a dead rat or something.

398
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,827
-Don't open it!
-I don't think so.

399
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,229
No! I said not to open it! Come on!

400
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:40,965
It says they love you.

401
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,334
What?

402
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,278
Is this really for me?

403
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,414
-Really?
-You didn't know?

404
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,752
Cindy posted this.

405
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,359
Enjoying a wonderful break.

406
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,562
With Producer Tak Ye-jin
who's always kind.

407
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,635
Yes. I am always kind.

408
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,771
She did well.
That's the right thing to say.

409
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:21,572
Oh, wow.

410
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,775
There are 5,600 likes?

411
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,877
It's because they like Cindy.

412
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:27,845
Not because they like you.

413
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:37,055
Goodness.

414
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:42,160
"To Korea's prettiest producer,
Producer Tak Ye-jin."

415
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:44,362
This is nuts...

416
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,564
They must have seen me in person.

417
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,567
How else could they describe me
so perfectly?

418
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,802
Right?

419
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,806
Oh, my goodness.

420
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,809
What do you want to eat?

421
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,144
Anything.

422
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:03,848
Hey, even if you don't provide ideas,

423
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,750
try to give your opinion
at times like this.

424
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:08,786
What do you want to eat?

425
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,488
Let's eat what you want.

426
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:13,958
Blood sausage soup?

427
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,293
It's hot outside.

428
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:17,862
Rice rolls.

429
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:22,100
Don't you get sick of that?
We always eat that in the editing room.

430
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,036
Risotto?

431
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:29,073
Hey, you and I are so out of sync.

432
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,975
That's so boring. Risotto...

433
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,443
And pronounce it right.

434
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:39,851
Then get what you want.
I'll eat spicy noodles.

435
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,792
He's a good guy. Come on.

436
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:49,560
Hey.

437
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,029
You guys are here for noodles too?

438
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:53,231
I was really craving noodles today.

439
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,769
-Hey.
-Hi.

440
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,438
Come on. Give it some thought.

441
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:02,807
This is an amazing opportunity.

442
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,708
What is?

443
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:05,343
There's a buddy of mine.

444
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,111
He got his MBA in the States.

445
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,614
He's a senior manager
at a foreign investment company.

446
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,083
I want to set him up with Ye-jin.

447
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,686
My dear Stefano is looking after me

448
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:18,122
in case I grow old without a man.

449
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,426
Ma'am, two bowls of spicy noodles.

450
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,061
My friend told me his ideal type.

451
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,531
I thought he was talking about you.
I was shocked.

452
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,498
What did he say?

453
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,967
Age doesn't matter to him.

454
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:30,868
Hey...

455
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,339
That's good. And?

456
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,375
He likes tough women.

457
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,011
I'm not tough.

458
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,680
Seung-chan, am I tough?

459
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,748
Not at all.

460
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:44,949
You're actually the opposite.

461
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,754
And he likes a stylish girl like you.

462
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,355
You dress well.

463
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,224
Yes. That's true.

464
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,059
I do dress well.

465
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:58,563
Jun-mo, you talk to her.

466
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:01,199
Your best friend is refusing
a great chance.

467
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,600
Whatever.

468
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,203
She can go if she wants. It's up to her.

469
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,243
I'm not really in the mood for it now.

470
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,444
You have to get in the mood?

471
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,146
You'll get in the mood
if you start dating.

472
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,281
Summer and fall will come fast.

473
00:35:17,348 --> 00:35:18,649
This year will fly by.

474
00:35:18,716 --> 00:35:20,151
Forget it.

475
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,124
I'm giving my buddy your phone number.

476
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,726
You'd better pick up if he calls.

477
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,363
Ma'am, may I have another egg?

478
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,132
I can't handle spicy foods.

479
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,266
-Sure.
-Thanks.

480
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,467
Eat this.

481
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,735
Yes. Give it to me.

482
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,071
Give me.

483
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:44,876
Are you...

484
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,645
Here.

485
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,414
-Here.
-Thanks.

486
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,682
Here.

487
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,050
Great.

488
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,288
Oh, there were only four candies.

489
00:35:58,856 --> 00:35:59,724
What about yours?

490
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:01,526
I'm sorry.

491
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:04,228
I put this in my mouth earlier, so...

492
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,499
Come on. You don't have another?

493
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,204
I can't handle spicy food,
so I always eat candy afterward.

494
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:25,149
Well, there were none left.

495
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,884
Dang it.

496
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,421
Gosh, so spicy.

497
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,069
Did you have a nice break?

498
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:46,971
Thanks to you.

499
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,207
Where did you go?

500
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,809
I was with friends.

501
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,313
You have friends I don't know about?

502
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,115
I have friends too. Friends.

503
00:36:58,816 --> 00:37:01,085
Please don't ask any more questions.

504
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:03,821
I'm back, so everything's fine, right?

505
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,491
If you and I go to war,

506
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:09,794
you'll always lose.

507
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:14,599
You should know that.
I didn't raise an idiot.

508
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,334
I know that.

509
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,905
But would a war happen so easily?

510
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,275
I'm your most valuable possession.

511
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,879
You don't want to lose me.

512
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:35,820
You're so clever, Cindy.

513
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,189
But listen, Cindy.

514
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:42,159
I have lost someone.

515
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,696
She was precious, the way you are to me.

516
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,965
But after losing her,

517
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:49,567
I found you.

518
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:54,872
If I lose you, I could fill your place

519
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,277
right away.

520
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,327
-Sir.
-What is it?

521
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,500
Are you okay with that?

522
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:25,970
With what?

523
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,108
I wanted to know
if you would really be okay

524
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,346
if Producer Tak went on a blind date.

525
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,481
What are you saying?

526
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:45,189
If Producer Tak had another man,

527
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,558
-Hey.
-would you not care?

528
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,094
I'm curious about that.

529
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:53,831
Is that a question?

530
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,300
Do I have to answer that?

531
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:01,605
I think

532
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:05,209
you're rather cowardly.

533
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:10,915
You know how she feels,
but you haven't done anything.

534
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:12,983
You won't let her get closer.

535
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,787
But you cage her in so she can't get away.

536
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:23,361
I think that's all really cowardly.

537
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,030
Just because you crush someone's heart

538
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,733
doesn't mean the feelings evaporate--

539
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,633
Hey.

540
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,639
I have learned one thing
from doing this job for eight years.

541
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,974
Do you know what it is?

542
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:44,682
Good feelings don't make good endings.

543
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,751
That's it.

544
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,955
No matter how kind you are to someone,

545
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:53,858
if the ending is bad,

546
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,330
who can take responsibility for that?

547
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,002
Don't intervene in someone's life

548
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,806
unless you can take
responsibility till the end.

549
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,434
Producer,

550
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,869
do you promise to watch over me?

551
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,639
Of course. Just trust me.

552
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,207
I'll take responsibility.

553
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:49,713
Producer Tak.

554
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:51,148
Going home?

555
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:53,250
Yes. You guys had a meeting?

556
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,119
Yes, we have a shoot tomorrow.

557
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:56,821
What's that?

558
00:40:56,887 --> 00:40:59,223
Cindy's fans love me.

559
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,626
I'll carry it to the parking lot for you.

560
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:03,527
Okay.

561
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:07,498
Did you get a call?

562
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,666
From who?

563
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,769
The guy Producer Kim
wanted to set you up with.

564
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,970
Oh, him?

565
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,638
No. He hasn't called yet.

566
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:16,674
If he does call, will you meet him?

567
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,075
Maybe.

568
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:20,678
What is it?

569
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,015
You know what they say.

570
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:27,117
A guy can truly judge a guy,

571
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,053
and a girl can truly judge a girl.

572
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,255
And as a guy,

573
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,291
I don't think he's all that great.

574
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,594
How can you know? You've never seen him.

575
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,329
He said

576
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,732
that he likes tough women.

577
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,668
I wouldn't say you're tough.

578
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,271
You're sure of yourself.

579
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:48,706
You complain when you have to.

580
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:49,807
Fight when you have to.

581
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,609
That's being tough, Seung-chan.

582
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,478
But I don't think so.

583
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,715
Anyway, what else?

584
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:03,387
He also said he likes stylish women,

585
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:08,726
but I don't think a guy should judge
based on appearances.

586
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,328
You said you liked Hye-ju
because she's pretty.

587
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,766
What is this?

588
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,101
Is this because of Jun-mo?

589
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:22,239
You think I'll date any random guy
because I'm angry at Jun-mo?

590
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,710
I know you wouldn't do that.

591
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:27,778
Well, I could.

592
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,746
You can't!

593
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,414
Why not?

594
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:34,018
My mom told me to just date anyone.

595
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,762
Thanks.

596
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:46,664
Oh, right. Here's today's payment.

597
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,304
What is it?

598
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:56,907
Instead of cash...

599
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:01,278
Can you pay in kind?

600
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,179
What?

601
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,348
It could be

602
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,186
buying a meal, buying drinks,

603
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:15,025
or even movie tickets. Stuff like that.

604
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,100
I'll give you a 10% discount.

605
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:29,940
-How about 20%?
-Agreed.

606
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:32,876
You can't take this back.

607
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,812
You just said 20%.

608
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,779
Yes.

609
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,451
You know, about Cindy...

610
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:45,222
Isn't it courtesy to contact me
if she got back home safe?

611
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:49,393
That girl is so ungrateful and rude.

612
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:54,131
Have you called her, by any chance?

613
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:14,218
TO MANAGER PARK

614
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,489
HEY, CALL ME

615
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:30,267
MANAGER PARK

616
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,139
What is it, Cindy?

617
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,376
I just wanted to see if my phone worked.

618
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:41,512
It works just fine.

619
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,062
WHEN IS CINDY COMING BACK?

620
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,700
I wish Cindy would start
working again soon.

621
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,767
Me too.

622
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:04,868
And me too.

623
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:06,704
What's wrong with them?

624
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,708
There's nobody to chew out
now that Cindy isn't on TV.

625
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,744
Yes, I have nothing
to live for these days.

626
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:14,778
I feel lethargic.

627
00:45:14,845 --> 00:45:16,780
I can't believe this.

628
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:18,949
Me too.

629
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,119
Die Cindy.

630
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:23,754
You haven't been here in a few days.

631
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,189
Did something happen?

632
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:30,661
I went on a trip.

633
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,166
You haven't been a member long,

634
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,036
but you visit our website frequently
and post a lot of comments.

635
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,505
We're planning on changing administrators

636
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,175
-and would like you to be
-What the...

637
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,478
the main operator of this anti-fan club.

638
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,982
They want me to be the administrator
of this Cindy anti-fan club?

639
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,419
I can't believe this.

640
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:58,222
REALLY? THANK YOU.

641
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,126
DIE CINDY'S STATUS
HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO ADMINISTRATOR

642
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:05,362
These jerks.

643
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,698
Okay.

644
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,567
If you post anything weird,
I'm going to delete it.

645
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,276
Hello?

646
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,746
Cindy, thanks for organizing our stuff,

647
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,516
but you should have said
where you put them.

648
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,852
Where did you put the plum extract?

649
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:30,921
Bottom drawer in the refrigerator.

650
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,556
Second one from the right.

651
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,726
No, that's the anchovy broth.

652
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:38,095
No, that's the abalone sauce.

653
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:39,396
Beside that.

654
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:41,532
I even put a green label on it.

655
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,667
Here it is.

656
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:45,469
Right. I found it.

657
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,538
-You're good?
-Yes.

658
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,973
But, hey...

659
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,809
Did you get home safely?

660
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,243
Yes.

661
00:46:54,444 --> 00:46:55,512
I did.

662
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,482
CEO Byun didn't give you a hard time?

663
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,651
I got through it.

664
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,554
Good. What a relief.

665
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,891
I was a bit worried about you.

666
00:47:10,227 --> 00:47:14,131
Thank you for worrying.

667
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:16,066
Sure.

668
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,403
I'll call you again
if I can't find something.

669
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,305
Producer.

670
00:47:21,371 --> 00:47:25,776
The youngest producers
at the TV station...

671
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,512
-Yes?
-Someone asked me

672
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:34,518
if they are usually
really busy with lots of work and all.

673
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,286
Yes, they are.

674
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:39,623
So how busy are they, exactly?

675
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:44,094
Too busy to make a phone call?

676
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:46,597
Or too busy to even send a text?

677
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,998
It's not like that.

678
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,533
They make calls and text people.

679
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,501
Even Seung-chan came

680
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,404
running after me on my way out
to help me carry some stuff.

681
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,042
But who asked you about this?

682
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,410
Just someone I know.

683
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:01,478
Okay, bye.

684
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:06,116
Did she just show me attitude?

685
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,257
I guess there's no cure for rudeness.

686
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,360
I'll never worry about you again.

687
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,042
Ye-jin! Your phone.

688
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:37,114
I'M KIM HYEON-JUN.
KIM HONG-SUN GAVE ME YOUR NUMBER.

689
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:49,159
Where's my phone?

690
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:50,861
Here. It's here.

691
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,096
Why do you always leave things behind?

692
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,765
Oh, thank you.

693
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:56,767
You just got a call.

694
00:48:57,034 --> 00:48:59,303
It was the guy Hong-sun
wanted to set you up with.

695
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,004
You took it?

696
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,006
No. I declined it.

697
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,708
You can call him back if you want.

698
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,243
Alright.

699
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,411
The thing is,

700
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,614
a guy can truly judge a guy.

701
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:14,551
He said he likes a tough
and stylish woman.

702
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:17,721
Just hearing that,
I can tell he's no good.

703
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,657
How strange.

704
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,026
-What is?
-Yesterday,

705
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,429
Seung-chan said the exact same thing.

706
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,531
-Seung-chan did?
-Yes.

707
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,933
He said this guy didn't seem good.

708
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:33,403
If two men are saying the same thing,

709
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,772
maybe he really is no good.

710
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,038
UMBRELLA

711
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:13,076
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

712
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,183
WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED ME?

713
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,559
WHATEVER

714
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,195
DON'T CALL ME

715
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,893
Cindy, someone's waiting for you outside.

716
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:04,361
Who?

717
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,266
It's the best friend special

718
00:51:09,433 --> 00:51:12,035
for Two Days and One Night.

719
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,071
They're going to install cameras.

720
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:16,239
What?

721
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:17,874
Without prior permission?

722
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:20,677
It looks like they talked to the CEO.

723
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:23,780
She said there are rumors floating around,

724
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,451
so you should show up on your main show--

725
00:51:27,517 --> 00:51:29,619
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

726
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,888
I'm not even wearing makeup. Dang it...

727
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:32,989
You're right.

728
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,893
That umbrella producer happened to come.

729
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,562
The CEO hates him.

730
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,931
Why do they keep sending
the newbie to you?

731
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:43,733
Who's here?

732
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,102
The umbrella producer.

733
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:49,206
Tell them to leave immediately.

734
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:51,374
Okay. Got it.

735
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:53,477
-Wait.
-What?

736
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,479
Let them be.

737
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,047
What?

738
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,149
No. Tell them to leave.

739
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:03,487
No. Hold on...

740
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,626
No, forget it. I don't want to see him.

741
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:13,797
Oh! I don't know!

742
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:16,133
I can't organize my thoughts
because of you!

743
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,367
Okay.

744
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:18,969
Wait.

745
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,705
You don't know what to tell them yet.

746
00:52:23,773 --> 00:52:24,641
Right.

747
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:30,413
What are you doing?

748
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:35,318
Tell me once you organize your thoughts.

749
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:39,055
I'll stay here if you want
or leave if you want.

750
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,625
Should I stay by the door?

751
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,393
I will if you want me to.

752
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,653
Cindy.

753
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,588
Let's not mix business
with our personal lives.

754
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:14,224
This is an official gig for me,

755
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:16,593
so let's refrain
from personal conversations.

756
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,029
If you have something
to tell me personally,

757
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,864
tell it to my manager.

758
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:24,434
Okay.

759
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:32,842
I'll set the cameras up.

760
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:36,947
What did he say?

761
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,420
You buttoned your blouse wrong.

762
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,690
Dang it!

763
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:01,771
Your best friend is going to come here.

764
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:02,906
My best friend?

765
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,344
So you're talking about my best friend?

766
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,112
-Yes.
-Who is my best friend?

767
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,984
I mean, my best friend who's coming today.

768
00:54:14,484 --> 00:54:16,286
I can't tell you.

769
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:19,990
Christine of Pinky4?

770
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:20,957
Wrong.

771
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:25,295
I can't tell you.

772
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,030
Is it...

773
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,165
CEO Byun?

774
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:32,502
It's her?

775
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,039
I'm done with this shoot. I can't do this.

776
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,808
It isn't CEO Byun.

777
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,577
Oh. That's a relief.

778
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,015
Who could it be?

779
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:49,419
Tell us the best friend you have in mind,

780
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,090
or the person you really wish would come.

781
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,060
Well, I'm not sure.

782
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,363
It's hard to pick just one person.

783
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:02,666
I have a lot of friends.

784
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,735
I don't want my other friends
to get upset.

785
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:11,374
It looks like your best friend
is here, Cindy.

786
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:16,346
Let's find out who has been invited here
as your best friend.

787
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:20,750
I wonder who it is.
I'm really curious myself.

788
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:26,489
Who could it be? Who came?

789
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:32,762
Why are you here?

790
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,069
I was going to go see you!

791
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:43,406
I didn't think you would come. Goodness...

792
00:55:43,473 --> 00:55:47,644
I missed you, Cindy!

793
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,814
I missed you! Hug...

794
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,619
It's so good to see you!

795
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,688
Great to see you...

796
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:00,523
So good to see you.

797
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,092
Me too.

798
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:06,429
Let's go.

799
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,502
Viewers,

800
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,839
this is my best friend, Go A-ra.

801
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:16,973
Come on!

802
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,908
You left out "soulmate."

803
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,211
Yes! My soulmate!

804
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:27,584
Let go.

805
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,352
You let go first.

806
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:31,254
I'll let go if you let go first.

807
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:33,022
-At the same time.
-Agreed.

808
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,391
-On the count of three. One.
-Two.

809
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,291
Three.

810
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,595
See? I knew you wouldn't let go. You liar.

811
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:41,398
Look who's talking. You liar!

812
00:56:42,632 --> 00:56:43,833
Are we going to do this all night?

813
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,735
Let's do that then.

814
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:55,845
Soulmate.

815
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,552
Wow, I can't believe this.

816
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:04,487
Seriously.

817
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,257
I bet people think we're rivals,

818
00:57:07,323 --> 00:57:09,692
since we're around the same age.

819
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,162
We're not rivals. No way.

820
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,698
When A-ra gets a new commercial deal,

821
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,001
-I'm happy for her.
-Me too.

822
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:21,771
But sometimes A-ra takes my deals.

823
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,208
She does sometimes, but even then,

824
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:28,478
I feel so happy for her.

825
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,679
We'll cut here briefly

826
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,247
and restart after setting the cameras.

827
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,282
Sure.

828
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,488
You shouldn't have come
if you were going to be like this.

829
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:40,390
You're my best friend. This is boring.

830
00:57:42,425 --> 00:57:45,361
You should cater to me. I'm the guest.

831
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:48,698
It's not like I came here
because I wanted to.

832
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,801
Then why did you come all of a sudden?

833
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:55,438
Because your CEO asked my CEO.

834
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,607
She said to come
since you have no friends.

835
00:58:00,343 --> 00:58:02,612
Then you shouldn't have come!

836
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,253
It's because of that stupid rumor
of us standing together

837
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,921
pulling each other's hair
for three hours--

838
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,289
That's the truth, not a rumor.

839
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,960
Anyway...

840
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:20,296
I think that's why I'm not getting
a shampoo commercial deal.

841
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,966
So you haven't heard.

842
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:25,168
I got a shampoo deal.

843
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:33,076
Fine. Anyway...

844
00:58:33,443 --> 00:58:37,714
Anyway, if we pretend to be best friends,

845
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,349
it will improve our images.

846
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,885
Advertisers like it, my agency likes it.

847
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,922
That's why I came.
So let's please do a good job. Okay?

848
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:47,490
Same to you.

849
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,461
CEO Byun has lost her mind.

850
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,364
I have to be in a two-shot with her.

851
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,866
Why did she get a girl
with such a slim face?

852
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:00,603
I had broth the past few days,

853
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,605
and my face is all puffy.

854
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:12,749
I don't look good.

855
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:17,353
My friend Cindy got injured recently.

856
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,525
So I plan on cooking for her myself.

857
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:27,430
My friend Cindy loves kimchi fried rice!

858
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,099
I can't handle spicy foods.

859
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,534
I'll make it good.

860
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,204
Everyone, I'll take some kimchi...

861
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:39,642
This kimchi looks delicious!

862
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:44,080
This is the kimchi that Cindy will eat!

863
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:46,816
Let me chop this carrot now.

864
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:49,919
Finely chop the carrot.

865
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,188
Finely...

866
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,692
That sure looks yummy.

867
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,731
Here, soulmate!

868
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:03,833
I'll eat it myself.

869
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,001
You're not eating this?

870
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,138
Then you take a bite first, Producer.

871
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,541
Hey...

872
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,044
How is it? Good, right?

873
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:16,279
Want some more?

874
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,047
Here you go.

875
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,783
You should eat well when you're injured.

876
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:28,191
You've just filmed video messages

877
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,760
to each other on your phones.

878
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:31,661
-Yes.
-Yes.

879
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:35,064
Please send those to each other.

880
01:00:35,498 --> 01:00:36,633
-Excuse me?
-Excuse me?

881
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,802
-Now?
-Yes. Now.

882
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,704
-Wait.
-Wait.

883
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,375
Give me your number.

884
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,076
Jeez.

885
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,914
You don't have each other's numbers?

886
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,150
We're getting them now.

887
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:06,596
What a shame!

888
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,732
If I didn't have a gig,
I could have slept over.

889
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:12,568
Yes.

890
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:13,870
Come again.

891
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,104
Sure.

892
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,205
Bye!

893
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:22,712
Okay. We'll cut here.

894
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,416
-I'm off.
-Go.

895
01:01:30,653 --> 01:01:31,821
Go downstairs first.

896
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,624
-I have to talk to Cindy.
-Okay.

897
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:47,036
What did you want to tell me? Go ahead.

898
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,943
About today...

899
01:01:55,778 --> 01:01:57,413
with Go A-ra...

900
01:01:59,315 --> 01:02:00,149
Yes?

901
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,756
I don't think she's really
your best friend.

902
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,391
You didn't even have her number.

903
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,531
I think she was cast by your agency.

904
01:02:17,667 --> 01:02:18,501
So?

905
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,070
It's not my decision to make,

906
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:24,207
but I don't think it suited

907
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:26,242
the concept for today's shoot.

908
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,680
It's hard for a show to be 100% truthful,

909
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,951
but we shouldn't lie on a show.

910
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:38,221
This again?

911
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:41,357
I didn't lie.

912
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,093
It's not like she's not my friend.
We're just not that close.

913
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:47,330
Are all friends close? They're not.

914
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:50,166
Right.

915
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:56,305
Because you're so good at acting,

916
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:59,408
if someone who didn't know watched it,

917
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:03,279
they would think
you two were really close.

918
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,882
What are you trying to say?

919
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,923
I'll be honest.

920
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:19,295
I think you're a good person.

921
01:03:20,496 --> 01:03:22,665
But I don't think that

922
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,736
you think that way about yourself.

923
01:03:28,671 --> 01:03:31,808
So, maybe...

924
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:36,679
That's why even your sincerity...

925
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:41,350
has turned into acting.

926
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,194
Is this

927
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,500
your response to my question that night?

928
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,410
Producer Ra Jun-mo told me this once.

929
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,313
Since it's a variety show,

930
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,916
I should show my real, natural self.

931
01:04:16,919 --> 01:04:17,820
But...

932
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,360
What is my real, natural self?

933
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:27,196
What is it?

934
01:04:29,332 --> 01:04:30,600
I don't really know.

935
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:40,443
Like you said,

936
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:47,083
I don't think of myself as a good person.

937
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:48,885
I don't love myself.

938
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,654
I don't really know...

939
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,627
Who would think of me like that?

940
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:02,465
Who would like me?

941
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:08,004
Who would understand me?

942
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,609
I'll take that as your response.

943
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:15,144
Goodbye.

944
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,759
The chief director put you
in charge of the sports meet?

945
01:06:03,826 --> 01:06:06,429
Yes. The entertainment department
sports meet.

946
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,631
Is that a good thing?

947
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,366
You're busy as it is.

948
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:12,435
It seems like an odd job, right?

949
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,270
It's not. It's a test.

950
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,840
What kind of test, Stefano?

951
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,409
The sports meet is a popularity gauge

952
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,979
for the current chief director

953
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:24,981
of the entertainment department.

954
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,150
So it's about how many people come?

955
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,352
That's right.

956
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,154
Last year, 50 people came
for Chief Director Choi.

957
01:06:32,221 --> 01:06:34,190
My goal for this year is 80 people.

958
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,859
-Think you can do it?
-You look great, sir!

959
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:41,130
-Hello.
-Hello.

960
01:06:41,864 --> 01:06:43,699
-The prizes.
-That's great.

961
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:45,067
We prepared a lot, right?

962
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,537
Hey, you don't have to.

963
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:51,707
I hated physical education and sports
ever since I was a student.

964
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,043
I hate running.

965
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,612
I find it a hassle just to move around.

966
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,448
Why do I come to the sports meet?

967
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:00,583
To eat.

968
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,051
That's the best part of it.

969
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:08,424
Enjoying a catered buffet altogether.

970
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:12,661
They always serve boar meat.

971
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,132
And beer.

972
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:18,267
Here, here.

973
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,336
Do you have a stomachache?

974
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:23,806
People at work don't know the importance
of the sports meet.

975
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,908
It's a problem.
They shouldn't think like that.

976
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,943
This is a group activity.

977
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:28,944
Gesellschaft.

978
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:30,880
It's a sense of community that means

979
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:33,382
gathering individuals together.

980
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:36,285
Come here. Writers.

981
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:43,592
Our chief director is the best

982
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,496
I think everyone is dumb.

983
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:49,465
It's so tiring,

984
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,668
but they get together in big groups
to play basketball and soccer.

985
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,071
We have these annually, and I hate them.

986
01:07:55,371 --> 01:07:57,339
It's boring, but we have to cheer.

987
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,775
"Great! Awesome!" They want that.

988
01:08:00,776 --> 01:08:02,878
And if you don't cheer them,
they get upset.

989
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:04,980
They want me to be the photographer.

990
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,216
I have to take photos of them
looking cool.

991
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,189
You're great, Seung-chan!

992
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:14,723
Shoot!

993
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:25,034
-Pass!
-You're doing great!

994
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:26,535
Here!

995
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:32,208
It's the first time
I have felt this is a good place to work.

996
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:35,811
I felt happy working together

997
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,114
with my seniors to achieve a goal.

998
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:42,518
And it was really moving

999
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:44,353
to hear them cheer.

1000
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:47,089
It's a shame we only do this once a year.

1001
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,959
I wish we would do this
every quarter. Seriously.

1002
01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:59,201
Go, Da-jeong!

1003
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:22,791
She's the star player!

1004
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:23,692
No!

1005
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,128
Catch it!

1006
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,302
Isn't that our team?

1007
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,142
Hey! Get your head in the game!

1008
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:41,911
Oh no!

1009
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:43,479
Oh, no...

1010
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:44,914
I'm the only one left?

1011
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,015
What do I do?

1012
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,052
Let's just say we lost.

1013
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:52,488
Go, Producer Tak!

1014
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:55,424
Da-jeong!

1015
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:57,092
She can't even hear me now.

1016
01:09:57,159 --> 01:10:00,462
Da-jeong, get it together.

1017
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:01,764
I'm the main producer on your team.

1018
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:02,998
What are you doing? Are you nuts?

1019
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,177
What the...

1020
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:08,831
She's...

1021
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:12,835
The highlight of the sports meet.

1022
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,671
It's soccer. We'll introduce
each team before the game.

1023
01:11:16,472 --> 01:11:19,842
They drew lots to form teams.

1024
01:11:20,075 --> 01:11:21,076
What do you think?

1025
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,711
The blue team will win.

1026
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,814
How can you be so sure?

1027
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:27,983
The chief director is on the blue team.

1028
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:31,020
Since it's a company soccer match,

1029
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,890
they'll have to see each other at work
and keep their jobs.

1030
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:39,094
Winning isn't important. But!

1031
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:41,630
One person is dribbling. Who is it?

1032
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:42,865
The chief director.

1033
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,902
Is this the Red Sea?
The defense is parting.

1034
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,304
So obvious...

1035
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:51,473
Someone's running to block
the chief director.

1036
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,476
It's Baek Seung-chan. A newbie.

1037
01:11:54,777 --> 01:11:56,478
He won't steal the ball, will he?

1038
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,047
He stole it.

1039
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:01,050
What's going on?

1040
01:12:01,383 --> 01:12:03,352
Wow. He's insane.

1041
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:06,488
To make matters worse,
the chief director fell down.

1042
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:07,489
Please be careful.

1043
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:10,225
The producers are all running to his aid.

1044
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:15,531
The chief director got up, and he's waving
to the spectators that he's okay.

1045
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:20,836
The spectators don't seem to care at all.

1046
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:23,672
In the meantime,

1047
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,475
there's someone running after
Baek Seung-chan.

1048
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,377
-Who is that?
-I don't have to look to know.

1049
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:29,745
It's Producer Kim Hong-sun.

1050
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:33,749
Hong-sun
aggressively runs into Seung-chan.

1051
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,718
He fell. Is this rugby?

1052
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,820
Why would he do that to his teammate?

1053
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:40,456
It's a dogfight. Let's go.

1054
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:44,426
Hong-sun of the white team has the ball.

1055
01:12:44,493 --> 01:12:50,065
He gently passes the ball
to the chief director.

1056
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,401
That was a deliberate pass, right?

1057
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,770
-It didn't look like a mistake.
-Practically served it to him.

1058
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,638
Hong-sun stole the ball from his teammate

1059
01:12:56,705 --> 01:12:59,141
and served it up to the chief director.

1060
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,576
Why would he do that?

1061
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,344
Is his life that hard?

1062
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:06,415
Excessive devotion is a burden
on both the giver and the receiver.

1063
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,617
The chief director has nobody on him.

1064
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:12,388
Hong-sun is blocking teammate Seung-chan.

1065
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:15,491
-As this sad situation is happening,
-I have to stop him.

1066
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:19,395
the chief director
is inside the penalty box and...

1067
01:13:19,461 --> 01:13:20,396
Shoot!

1068
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,567
The ball is rolling very slowly.

1069
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,937
Why is nobody stopping this?

1070
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,273
The goalkeeper, Producer Kim Tae-ho...

1071
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:35,677
He dives in the opposite direction
of the ball.

1072
01:13:36,378 --> 01:13:37,513
Goodness.

1073
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:39,081
It's a goal.

1074
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:43,619
The goalkeeper is celebrating too.

1075
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:45,487
Sir!

1076
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,261
How should I express this situation?

1077
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,062
"I could do it with my eyes shut."

1078
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:55,397
"It's as easy as ABC."

1079
01:13:55,464 --> 01:13:58,600
A pathetic sight
that isn't worth talking about.

1080
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:01,303
The match continues.

1081
01:14:01,403 --> 01:14:04,006
They'll just halfheartedly drag it out

1082
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,074
and end it.

1083
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:07,509
Probably.

1084
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:11,313
The sports meet will end with
the chief director's goal.

1085
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,216
Oh, what's going on?

1086
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:17,453
What is the newbie trying to do?

1087
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,421
Go, Seung-chan!

1088
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:21,256
If this was TV, it would be like

1089
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:24,793
doing the closing, rolling the credits,

1090
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,830
and then starting the show again.

1091
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:29,031
We're back to square one.

1092
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:30,165
Hey!

1093
01:14:56,492 --> 01:15:00,295
Nobody wanted this or expected this,

1094
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:02,097
but it's a penalty shootout.

1095
01:15:02,464 --> 01:15:06,702
Why would they do a shootout
without having overtime?

1096
01:15:06,768 --> 01:15:10,239
We only paid to rent this place
until 2:00 p.m.

1097
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,074
We have to get out of here soon.

1098
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:14,510
Or else there will be
an additional charge.

1099
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,078
As we were talking,

1100
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,313
the cause of today's shootout,

1101
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:21,483
Seung-chan, is stepping up as a kicker.

1102
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,319
The goalkeeper is Two Days and One Night's

1103
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:25,988
main producer, Ra Jun-mo.

1104
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:28,390
What do you think of this situation?

1105
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:32,561
If Seung-chan is in his right mind,
he won't score a goal.

1106
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:36,532
I think we've already witnessed
that he isn't in his right mind.

1107
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,367
You'd better not score.

1108
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:41,169
Why are you trying so hard?

1109
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:42,971
Stop it.

1110
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,843
His expression is strange.

1111
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,978
It looks like
he's going to play seriously.

1112
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:52,147
But there's a goalkeeper.

1113
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:55,684
But that doesn't mean
the ball won't go in.

1114
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,420
That is very true.

1115
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,057
Seung-chan looks very serious.

1116
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,626
Will he score?

1117
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:07,129
It looks like he's trying too hard.

1118
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,114
Shoot!

1119
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:18,100
Seung-chan.

1120
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:22,704
You were impressive out there.

1121
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,539
You're pretty competitive.

1122
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:27,542
I bet you're hot.

1123
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,446
Here's the handkerchief you lent me.

1124
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,815
You played well out there.

1125
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,086
And thanks for what you did then.

1126
01:17:40,455 --> 01:17:41,423
Sure.

1127
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:44,726
Should we take a photo?

1128
01:17:44,893 --> 01:17:45,727
Yes.

1129
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:46,795
Yes, let's take one.

1130
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:49,665
Here.

1131
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:52,034
One, two, three.

1132
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,171
There.

1133
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,641
-Hi.
-Hi.

1134
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:02,644
I'm Producer Won Seung-hyeon
of Cool Kiz on the Block.

1135
01:18:03,211 --> 01:18:05,280
Want to work with me next term?

1136
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,184
Let's play soccer with Ho-dong.

1137
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:15,290
Let's go.

1138
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,064
I can't believe
you're being scouted for this.

1139
01:18:22,764 --> 01:18:25,000
You were great today,

1140
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:28,370
so I'll pay you however you want today.

1141
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:30,505
Food, drinks, or movie.

1142
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,310
I choose a movie.

1143
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,714
Okay. Then I'll go home and change,

1144
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:39,781
and we'll go to the theater.

1145
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:41,850
I'll stop by the office, get ready,

1146
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:43,485
-and go right after.
-Okay.

1147
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:40,408
We debuted when we were
13 and 14 years old.

1148
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,646
We grew up getting people's attention
from such a young age

1149
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:47,082
and that became just part of the ordinary.

1150
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:51,219
Sometimes, when you're really awful...

1151
01:19:53,655 --> 01:19:55,157
I go home, and I always end up thinking

1152
01:19:55,223 --> 01:19:57,025
you and I are really similar.

1153
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,127
So I disliked you even more.

1154
01:20:04,466 --> 01:20:07,202
Anyway, thanks for the invite today.

1155
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:12,107
It was my first time
going to a friend's house.

1156
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,012
Let's hang out again, buddy.

1157
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,113
Bye.

1158
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:25,720
A-RA

1159
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,023
SELECT GROUP

1160
01:20:28,089 --> 01:20:30,225
FRIEND

08. ABOUT ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO END

1162
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,223
What? Is my battery dead?

1163
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,235
UMBRELLA

1164
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:52,674
UMBRELLA

1165
01:22:04,185 --> 01:22:05,287
Hello?

1166
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,955
This is Cindy.

1167
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,458
I have something to tell you right now.

1168
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:13,295
I'm in front of your house.

1169
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,130
Cindy.

1170
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,932
I have an appointment.

1171
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:17,933
I'll be waiting.

1172
01:22:38,153 --> 01:22:41,623
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

1173
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:17,152
Shoot!
