1
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,028
I'm so busy...

2
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:13,440
Lipstick...

3
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,318
Hello.

4
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,786
You're a new KBS employee, right?

5
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,720
Yes.

6
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:28,922
Why are you running?

7
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,557
I have to be at the initiation ceremony.

8
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:31,691
I think I'm running late.

9
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,260
Where is TS1?

10
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,261
Follow me.

11
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,803
Yes?

12
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,240
I have a live broadcast today.
I'm really busy.

13
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,408
Yes...

14
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,277
Oh, gosh...

15
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:52,812
I can't believe this.

16
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,948
I'll call you back later.

17
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,517
Oh, no. What am I going to do?

18
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,855
But seriously, who parks like this?

19
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,957
Talk about manners! Jeez...

20
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,861
Oh, my goodness. Oh, no.

21
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,001
What to do...

22
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,253
What team are you from?

23
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,188
Documentary Three Days.

24
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,824
We're following the new employees today.

25
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,459
Did you just film this?

26
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
Me scraping the door?

27
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:42,629
Yes.

28
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:55,708
We will now begin the initiation ceremony
for new employees of KBS.

29
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:57,877
As the CEO of KBS...

30
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,145
-I swear!
-I swear!

31
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,613
-I swear!
-I swear!

32
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,582
-As new employees...
-As new employees...

33
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,585
NEW EMPLOYEE INITIATION CEREMONY 2015

34
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,761
I'm kind of nervous.

35
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:17,163
It didn't feel real
when I was being trained,

36
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,301
but it now feels real
because I got this and this.

37
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,069
It's not a dream.

38
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,077
I was a bit surprised that my salary
was higher than I thought.

39
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,112
-How much did you get?
-Am I allowed to say this?

40
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,515
I got around 1.89 million won.

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,851
I withdrew it all
and gave the cash to my mom.

42
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,622
She cried when I gave it to her.

43
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,426
You see, I was unemployed for four years.

44
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,547
I'm in the current affairs department.

45
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,556
Well...

46
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,025
I'm in the entertainment department.

47
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,661
Did you apply to entertainment department?

48
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:22,562
Yes.

49
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,097
Why?

50
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:29,636
I see.

51
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,438
You have a personal reason
you're not able to tell?

52
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:33,840
Well...

53
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:36,643
No, it's just that...

54
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:40,313
Someone I like

55
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,749
works in the entertainment department.

56
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,050
Someone you like?

57
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,052
Yes.

58
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,988
We were in the same club at college.

59
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:51,591
I just...

60
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,060
I want to be close to her.

61
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,928
Say, "cheese."

62
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,200
Congratulations.

63
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,202
Thank you!

64
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,908
One, two.

65
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,211
One, two.

66
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,254
If the girl you liked became a reporter,
would you have taken the reporter exam?

67
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,823
Would you have taken the CPA exam
if she became an accountant?

68
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,306
Welcome.

69
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,776
I'm Kim Tae-ho
from the entertainment department.

70
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,013
From Infinite Challenge?

71
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,881
MBC?

72
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:50,249
KBS?

73
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,051
It's KBS.

74
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,220
What?

75
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,288
I'm Kim Tae-ho.

76
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,123
Okay.

77
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,494
There's a guy at MBC
who goes by the same name.

78
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,165
I came first. I'm the original Kim Tae-ho.

79
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,167
Right.

80
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,504
I know he's a good producer too.

81
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,272
He's talented.

82
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,742
We have a busy day today.

83
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,513
You would normally spend
three to four days on set,

84
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,248
but that's not very efficient.

85
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:27,887
Being creative and economical
is trendy nowadays.

86
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,890
OJT used to last five days,

87
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,026
but let's fit it all into one day
and be creative and economical.

88
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,329
-Okay?
-Yes.

89
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,233
If you think that's too little time

90
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,937
to get a grip on the framework
and details of variety shows,

91
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:48,107
I recommend you buy this book.

92
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,745
What is a Variety Show Producer?

93
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,383
There are many inferior books
with similar titles,

94
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,351
so don't get confused.

95
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,421
WHAT IS A VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER?
BY KIM TAE-HO

96
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:06,159
I wrote this because people told me to.

97
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,227
I'm not trying to peddle books here.

98
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,363
I was only paid a small percentage anyway.

99
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:11,597
I'm telling the truth.

100
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:15,368
I'm just recommending it to them

101
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,570
so they can gain a broader view.

102
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,240
I bought this to prepare for my entry exam

103
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,076
because I thought
it was written by Kim Tae-ho,

104
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,511
producer of Infinite Challenge.

105
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,046
A lot of people thought the same thing.

106
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,715
I heard many people returned the book.

107
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:34,287
I wrote my name on it, so I couldn't...

108
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,859
WHAT IS A VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER?
BY KIM TAE-HO

109
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,196
You'll get to hear some familiar names.

110
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,931
Where should we go first?

111
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:46,599
Over here.

112
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:47,900
The show Happy Together.

113
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,938
Yoo Jae-suk, Late-Night Cafeteria...

114
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:52,872
You all know it.

115
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,809
Hey, Kwang-soo.

116
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,011
The show aired yesterday, right?

117
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,749
This is the viewer ratings list
that you will be looking at every morning.

118
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,751
This is like our report card.

119
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,487
Tae-ho, don't...

120
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,256
HAPPY TOGETHER

121
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,657
Oh, it's 7%?

122
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:19,832
That's a good rating.

123
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,435
It's not easy to get 7% these days.

124
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,470
With cable TV these days...

125
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:25,505
Go away.

126
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,242
Let's move on.

127
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,211
That's Immortal Songs 2.

128
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,815
Jae-yeong.

129
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,621
It's a music show,

130
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,557
so the producer listens to music all day.

131
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,493
Don't work so hard.

132
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,095
You'll go deaf.

133
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,140
Let's move on.

134
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,177
This is the new employees' OJT.

135
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:07,113
Unlike when we were training,

136
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,983
we're now observing and learning
what this department is really like.

137
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,853
I was very excited and had high hopes.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,988
Is it different from your expectations?

139
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:23,095
The chief producer
is trying hard to teach us a lot of stuff,

140
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:25,231
but it's confusing sometimes.

141
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:30,236
I don't know if I should
write down what he says.

142
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,110
Everyone, watch what I do.

143
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,915
Writer Lee Mi-rim.
Do you have tickets for Gag Concert?

144
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,950
I don't have any.

145
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,184
Did you see that?

146
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,719
This is really important.

147
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,621
This is what this department is all about.

148
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,356
What does this mean?

149
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:53,492
When you meet people,
regardless of what you talk about,

150
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,028
they will end up asking
for Gag Concert tickets.

151
00:09:56,796 --> 00:10:01,000
It's good to draw the line from the start
and tell them you don't have one.

152
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,034
Why?

153
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:06,339
Because the staff won't give you tickets.

154
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,742
She never does.

155
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,546
GAG CONCERT
NEVER GIVES OUT TICKETS

156
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,353
These cost 4,000 won each.

157
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:24,790
I usually buy 30 at a time.

158
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,394
Don't go to Hongdae or Garosu-gil to eat.
The food here is good.

159
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,999
The flavors have depth because they've
been using the same pots for decades.

160
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,969
It's good for each of you to bond
with your coworkers.

161
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:41,607
You can also get a lot of information
related to broadcasting here.

162
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,743
They're getting divorced, right?

163
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,345
Ever since they got married,
I knew they were going to divorce.

164
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,181
People saw the two of them go to Japan.

165
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,950
They went to Osaka.

166
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,786
CEO Choi took the money and disappeared?

167
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,323
I wonder how much he took.

168
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,292
Go ahead.

169
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,663
They serve chicken ginseng soup

170
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:06,132
on the hottest days of summer.

171
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,535
Sometimes, there's Japanese
or Chinese food,

172
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,972
like sushi or sweet and sour pork.

173
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,776
Check the menu on KOBIS

174
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,477
so you don't miss those days.

175
00:11:19,745 --> 00:11:21,313
I'm a great senior colleague, right?

176
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,882
I'm giving you all this great information.

177
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,451
Yes, will do so.

178
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,091
Hey.

179
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,760
It's Girls' Generation.

180
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:43,736
They will be really happy to see me here.

181
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,138
But we don't want to draw a crowd,

182
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,040
so let's just eat quietly.

183
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,675
Are you close with them?

184
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,910
We're really close!

185
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,180
Producer Kim Tae-ho
from Infinite Challenge?

186
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,817
Oh, there's another one?

187
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,518
I didn't know.

188
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,791
I have a live broadcast,
and you want me to supervise their OJT?

189
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,228
I have a meeting with the chief director.
I'm busy too.

190
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,497
Plus, it's good for them
to observe a live broadcast.

191
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,965
Music Bank is perfect for that.

192
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,000
Things are so hectic today.

193
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:17,269
I even had an accident coming into work.

194
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,170
An accident?

195
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,239
What kind of accident? Did you get hurt?

196
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,274
It's not like that.

197
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:23,709
Scraped a car door.

198
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,478
Oh, a scraped door.

199
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,546
That has happened to me before.

200
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,081
Middle-aged women do that often.

201
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,117
They swing open their doors
without thinking.

202
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,019
I didn't get scraped. I scraped someone.

203
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,056
-What?
-I scraped someone's door!

204
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,391
I opened my door without thinking.

205
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,659
I see.

206
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,031
But it's really just a slight scrape.

207
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,533
How much do you think it will cost?

208
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,135
What kind of car is it?

209
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,236
It's an imported one.

210
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:52,071
Did you hit my car?

211
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,105
Jeez.

212
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,907
You're kidding, right?

213
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,543
It wasn't a junker like yours,
it was a real imported car.

214
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,477
Really?

215
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,614
Get in touch with the person fast.

216
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:04,683
If you're unlucky,
they might accuse you of a hit-and-run.

217
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:10,422
Why would anyone drive an imported car
in this cramped little country?

218
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,024
And such a big car at that!

219
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,159
Look at Europe.

220
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,662
They make more money than us,
but they all drive compact cars!

221
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,731
That's very reasonable, don't you think?

222
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,066
That's why I drive a compact car too!

223
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,202
I only pay half price at toll booths.

224
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,604
Don't even get me started on gas money.

225
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,241
The Music Bank producer is on the fritz.

226
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,976
It's Rage Level 3.

227
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,345
Back off if you have to introduce
a new artist.

228
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,447
Things aren't good right now.

229
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,216
Why is it Rage Level 3?

230
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,519
She scraped an imported car
on her way to work.

231
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,823
She's freaking out
since she will have to pay up.

232
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,258
I wish she had scraped my car.

233
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,928
Then we could become best friends.

234
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,730
What does Rage Level 3 mean?

235
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,631
Right.

236
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,067
You're new, so you don't know.

237
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,204
It's our code
for how bad her condition is.

238
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,973
Level 3 isn't too serious.

239
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,909
Nothing bad will happen
if you leave her alone.

240
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,377
If it's on Level 2,

241
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,913
she will bite you
even if you leave her alone.

242
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,015
What about Level 1?

243
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,584
Get out of Yeouido.

244
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,985
That's like code red.

245
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,220
Jeez...

246
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:18,424
Owner of car 1538, I'm sorry.

247
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,094
This morning, in the parking lot,
I kind of had an issue with your car...

248
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,598
She will be supervising
today's afternoon OJT.

249
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,333
She's the heart
of the entertainment department.

250
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:28,701
The queen bee.

251
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,102
The oldest woman.

252
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,371
I mean, the goddess.

253
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,607
The queen goddess.

254
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:36,041
Producer Tak Ye-jin.

255
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,711
Please contact me.

256
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,521
Hey, polka dots.

257
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,662
It's common sense to put your phone
on vibrate mode at a broadcast station.

258
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,566
It's a major problem
if it rings during a live broadcast.

259
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,467
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:04,503
And don't apologize thoughtlessly either.

261
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:06,639
We're producers.

262
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,642
We can't cringe and cower so easily.

263
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,486
I always get a bit sensitive
before a live show.

264
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,255
I even got into a minor accident
this morning.

265
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,824
I contacted the owner of the car.

266
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,193
But he hasn't read my message.

267
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:29,862
It's still unread.

268
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,366
I'm sure he will get back to me.

269
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,869
These are cameras one and two.

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,103
Here are three and four.

271
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,371
That one is five.

272
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:42,708
They form a series to complete the scene.

273
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,843
You have to make the calls precisely.

274
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,380
It's frustrating if you put
camera two on standby

275
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,882
and do a three cut.

276
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,184
Why even do a standby? Right?

277
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,488
And those cameras in public broadcasts
that shoot from high up,

278
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,223
that's called a Jimmy Jib.

279
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,158
Jimmy Jib.

280
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,894
Camera five over there...

281
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:03,896
Who is that?

282
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,564
I see people.

283
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,701
Assistant producers always take naps
in empty studios

284
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,835
when they're sleep-deprived.

285
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,370
They aren't sleeping.

286
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,206
Let's take a look.

287
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,144
Isn't that the assistant producer
for Entertainment Weekly?

288
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,045
Shin Hye-ju?

289
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,081
Who's that next to her?

290
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,250
It's Ra Jun-mo.

291
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,821
Why is Jun-mo over there?

292
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,289
He's supposed to go to the KCC today.

293
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,858
I heard they were dating.
I guess it's true.

294
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,761
They probably had to talk about something.

295
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,431
Just because a guy and a girl are together
doesn't mean they're dating.

296
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,535
See? They're dating.

297
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,506
That Jun-mo has game.

298
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,608
How many years apart are they?

299
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,447
How would I know that?

300
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:56,815
Okay.

301
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,084
Check the location of the air shot.

302
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:01,787
Don't drop confetti
in the wrong place like last time.

303
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:25,477
It's you, right?

304
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,247
Yes, Hye-ju.

305
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,517
What brings you here?

306
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:33,419
Are you here to watch Music Bank?

307
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:34,953
No.

308
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,258
I'm a new employee
in the entertainment department.

309
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:40,392
Really?

310
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,194
That's great.

311
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:45,664
Say, this is Baek Seung-chan.

312
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:47,399
We go to the same church.

313
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,601
Actually, we went to the same college.

314
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:52,905
Oh, right. College it was.

315
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:55,007
You used to live in Sillim-dong
near campus, right?

316
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,476
Actually, I have been living
in Yeouido ever since I was born.

317
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:02,614
Oh, you live in Yeouido.

318
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:04,650
That's good. It's close to work.

319
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,560
Okay. I'll see you again.

320
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,361
Sure.

321
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,833
I'm thinking of
having the wedding in fall.

322
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,584
Are you okay in there?

323
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,520
I would like to be alone right now.

324
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,228
What's this?

325
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,696
What are you shooting?

326
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,532
Oh, Documentary Three Days?

327
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,769
You're even shooting in the bathroom?
Why are you working so hard?

328
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,231
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:35,841
Hello?

330
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,849
I said let's have the meeting at 4:00 p.m.

331
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,085
What? I have to go to the KCC...

332
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,857
I have to go to the KCC today.

333
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:54,393
Yes.

334
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,229
That's right.

335
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:19,885
KCC stands for
"Korea Communications Commission."

336
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,655
If viewer ratings
are report cards for producers,

337
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:25,824
the KCC would be the student council.

338
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,629
If they send you this,
it means you did something wrong.

339
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,498
Wait.

340
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,701
This is going to be on TV.

341
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,704
I have to watch what I say.
Let me do that again.

342
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,639
It's a very important institution.

343
00:20:40,706 --> 00:20:43,442
Television shows are watched
by unspecified viewers,

344
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:46,178
so the KCC checks
if all regulations are followed.

345
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,081
They pave the way
for wholesome TV culture.

346
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:52,517
But you don't want
to be called in by them.

347
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:55,854
Nobody likes to get chewed out.

348
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,290
No, I shouldn't have said that.

349
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:02,761
We get called in for being crude.

350
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:06,665
But it's not like we're that dignified.

351
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,133
Or for smoking.

352
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,803
But it's so hard to edit
all those scenes out.

353
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,340
If you smoke behind a tree,
it's hard to see.

354
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,110
Or for not wearing a seatbelt.

355
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,544
Shooting on a railroad.

356
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,047
Not wearing a helmet on a motorcycle.

357
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:25,717
All that stuff is allowed in movies.

358
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,818
It looks cool.

359
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:28,887
But if you show that on TV,

360
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,490
you get summoned.

361
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,825
In that case, what's today's issue?

362
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:35,193
Oh, today?

363
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,931
A vulgar word was used
during the broadcast.

364
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,433
What word was it?

365
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:46,705
It was "booger."

366
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,909
The word "booger" was used 15 times.

367
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:55,147
The cast even talked about eating it.

368
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:04,823
It wasn't meant to imply
the actual act of eating.

369
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,260
I thought it was a phrase

370
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:12,764
that anyone could relate to
when talking about stupid people...

371
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:17,002
Couldn't you use a more appropriate word?

372
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:21,440
The word "secretion" wouldn't have worked.

373
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:26,478
The word "booger" has the orthodox feel...

374
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:29,548
But I regret my actions.

375
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,417
I will correct the mistake.

376
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:35,754
To make matters worse,
Two Days and One Night airs at dinnertime!

377
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:38,357
Many viewers probably eat
while they watch.

378
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,158
Wouldn't they lose their appetites?

379
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:42,894
I imagine they would. I'm sorry.

380
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,897
It's nice that you're quick
to admit mistakes,

381
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:47,632
but you come here too often.

382
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,169
I question your sincerity.

383
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,576
Just because we used the word "booger"...

384
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,811
Hey, Reporter Kang.

385
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,081
What? You're here again?

386
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:07,886
A producer should be at the TV studio.
Why are you always at the KCC?

387
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,187
I know, right?

388
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,157
So stop writing articles
that criticize my show.

389
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:13,792
I know.

390
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,294
I can't criticize the show
if it's no longer being aired.

391
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,596
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,997
I heard it was getting canceled.

393
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,098
What?

394
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,199
Isn't it?

395
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,336
I direct Two Days and One Night.

396
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,570
Wouldn't I know?

397
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:27,506
That would only make sense.

398
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,977
The production staff
are always last to know.

399
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,044
Why, you...

400
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,680
Where did you hear that nonsense?

401
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,752
Why wouldn't I know about my own show?

402
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,120
I'm the producer!

403
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,024
Somebody's really sensitive.

404
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:52,631
Two Days and One Night

405
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,132
had a great cast in Season 1

406
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,703
back when Yeong-seok and Myeong-hwan
were in charge of it.

407
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,338
Kang Ho-dong, Lee Seung-gi...

408
00:24:01,006 --> 00:24:04,142
They slipped up a bit in Season 2 though.

409
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:09,147
Then Yoo Ho-jin did a good job
on Season 3.

410
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,049
The show was passed on to me afterward.

411
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,851
It's always been the same thing.

412
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,420
A bunch of dudes playing games of chance.

413
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:18,657
So, I changed things up.

414
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,793
I had a new cast of actresses. Brand-new.

415
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:25,263
-Two Days and One Night.
-Two Days and One Night.

416
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,767
Can you say it together?

417
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,768
You shout, "Two Days..."

418
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,903
Then everyone says, "And One Night!"

419
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,938
Two Days...

420
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,006
-And One Night!
-And One Night!

421
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,208
Great!

422
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,512
You're going to Geoje-do
for a spring special.

423
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:42,113
We're going where? Geoje-do?

424
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,682
I can't go there.

425
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,951
Let's just stay within Gyeonggi-do.

426
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:47,719
Why are you making us go far away?

427
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,120
I have a stomach ulcer.

428
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:51,189
Don't make me drink sand eel extract.

429
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:54,559
If there are squat toilets like last time,
I'm done with this shoot.

430
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:56,127
And sleeping outdoors? Hey, now.

431
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,630
Are you trying to kill this old woman?
I can't do that.

432
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,698
Right.

433
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:01,766
Just film us going camping
somewhere close.

434
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,069
Going far doesn't mean good ratings.
The content is important.

435
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:06,404
It will be so late by the time
we get to Geoje-do.

436
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,540
It may be spring, but we're freezing here.

437
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,077
Yes, other shows shoot nearby,
and they're fine.

438
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:13,712
But the thing is...

439
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:16,515
it was a bit too new.

440
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,819
Viewer ratings are a bit low right now.

441
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,388
That's why there are
false rumors like that.

442
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,559
But crisis means opportunity.

443
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:29,461
I'm not that nervous.

444
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,836
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT SEASON 4

445
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,605
Will you please sit down?
You're distracting me.

446
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,809
Where's Writer Choi?

447
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,444
I just talked to her on the phone.

448
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,146
She's crossing Mapo Bridge now.

449
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,382
She will be here soon.

450
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:54,386
What a mess.

451
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,521
There are all sorts of rumors
going around,

452
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,123
and the main writer isn't even here.

453
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,090
What rumors?

454
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,595
What's the plan for the next episode?

455
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:05,997
Let's go to Jeju-do.

456
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,234
Where was the last filming site
last season?

457
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:10,969
Jeju-do.

458
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,737
What about the last filming site
for Mamma Mia,

459
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:13,838
the show that got canceled?

460
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,174
-Jeju-do.
-That's right.

461
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,044
When shows are totally desperate,
they go to Jeju-do.

462
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,646
If you think we have to go to Jeju-do,

463
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,083
it means this show has run its course.

464
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,420
The Jeju-do special was a huge hit
for the show Infinite Challenge.

465
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,056
Are you dumb?
That show's producer is Kim Tae-ho.

466
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:37,062
Producer.

467
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:40,632
Will Miss A appear as guests
for this shoot?

468
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,134
Can their Music Bank shoot be moved?

469
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,272
They can't make it, can they?

470
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,240
They can.

471
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,876
I just have to make a call.

472
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,244
Miss A...

473
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,682
You get a lot of requests
for a big show like Music Bank.

474
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:00,585
From senior colleagues, the chief,
the chief director, and so on.

475
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,688
You just have to tell them no.

476
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,925
If you give in,
there's no end to the requests.

477
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,461
Even if the CEO comes
and asks you a favor,

478
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,396
you have to say no adamantly.

479
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,367
I'll be at this company longer
than him anyway.

480
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:19,237
Of course, you will all be here
longer than me.

481
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,538
I see.

482
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,212
JUN-MO

483
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,547
What?

484
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:30,682
I need a favor.

485
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,616
A favor?

486
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,487
Okay, hold on.

487
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,889
JUN-MO

488
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:41,693
So, what's this favor, Producer Ra Jun-mo?

489
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,363
We need Miss A on our show next week,
but they have to do Music Bank.

490
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,465
Can you pre-record their performance?

491
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:49,968
No, there are many performances that day.

492
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,002
Come on.

493
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,304
You direct Music Bank. Help me out.

494
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,206
If I let Miss A do that,

495
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,876
I'll have to do that
for all the other singers.

496
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:00,412
Don't rely on my show to handle things.

497
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,280
Let's do our own jobs.

498
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,653
So, keep this in mind.

499
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,723
You're responsible for yourselves
in the broadcasting world.

500
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,193
If you're constantly helping people out,

501
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,762
you're going to lose your job.

502
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,364
Look after yourselves.

503
00:28:19,564 --> 00:28:20,398
Okay?

504
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:21,332
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes.

505
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,503
Let's go to the control booth.

506
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,710
Let's go a bit later.

507
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,446
Rely on her?

508
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,016
Who's relying on who?

509
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,784
She doesn't seem to get what's going on.

510
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,286
Can we get Miss A or not?

511
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,822
I need to know if I have to find footage.

512
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,590
Just hold your horses!

513
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,326
She can't do this to me!

514
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:50,195
I can't believe this...

515
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:51,730
Producer Ra.

516
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,265
The chief director wants to see you.

517
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,371
What's going on? You should know.

518
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:01,673
I don't know anything.

519
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:06,311
I ran into Reporter Kang at the KCC.

520
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:07,746
He said something strange.

521
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:10,548
How was your hearing there?

522
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,150
And that too.

523
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,354
Other chief producers would go to the KCC
for the producers who work for them.

524
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,022
Why did I have to go?

525
00:29:18,356 --> 00:29:20,525
You look good in a suit.

526
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,061
I only have a suit for funerals.

527
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,430
Haven't you really heard anything?

528
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,232
What would I know?

529
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,603
How many times have you been summoned
to the KCC this month?

530
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,538
What did you get this time?

531
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,439
A warning?

532
00:29:35,306 --> 00:29:38,143
I go there so often

533
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,645
that some of them like me now.

534
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:45,250
One person said, "How unfortunate."

535
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:48,286
I don't think we'll get a warning.

536
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,088
Good for you.

537
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,690
How peculiar.

538
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:54,859
How is it that every age group

539
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:58,129
does not watch your show?

540
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:02,667
Sir, if you look here...

541
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,703
there's a section
that shows a sharp increase.

542
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,006
The show is picking up speed.

543
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,941
I don't know about that,

544
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:11,810
but it's over, Jun-mo.

545
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,144
Tae-ho.

546
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:17,081
Honestly, 5.7% viewer rating
is unacceptable for a Sunday variety show.

547
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:21,386
When I did Super Sunday
with Im Baek-cheon,

548
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,923
the viewer ratings were 35%.

549
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,258
The theme song was by The Pet Shop Boys,

550
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,359
"Go West."

551
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,894
Things were great.

552
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,229
They sure were.

553
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:33,798
Sir, there are so many channels now.

554
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,001
Getting 5.7% viewer rating now
is like 15% back then.

555
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,406
That's a lame excuse
from the guy who got 5.7%.

556
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,509
There's nothing we can do.

557
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:45,810
Let's end the show.

558
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:47,145
Excuse me?

559
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:48,813
Sir!

560
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,748
It's already been decided.

561
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:52,350
Did you know about this?

562
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,284
Didn't you know?

563
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,020
Everyone in our department knows.

564
00:30:56,087 --> 00:30:58,389
Even the street vendor
in front of the studio knows.

565
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,524
How come you didn't know?

566
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:00,658
Why, you...

567
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,228
Sir.

568
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:05,897
You said shooting a variety show
with older women

569
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:08,266
was a good idea.

570
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,902
Yes, that's why you should've done
a better job.

571
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,403
MY FAULT, YOUR FORTUNE

572
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,740
What did you say
when you started the show a year ago?

573
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:18,076
You said Na Yeong-seok
made a three-base hit

574
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:20,011
and that you would hit a home run.

575
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,615
This isn't a home run.
This is a double play.

576
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,918
Wow, I really had no idea.

577
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:29,254
You had already decided to cancel the show

578
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,656
when I have been working my butt off,

579
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,192
hitting bunts and running bases
like an idiot.

580
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,228
You want to cancel the show?

581
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:38,897
Well, forget it!

582
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,965
I won't allow it!

583
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,437
Didn't you tell him?

584
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,705
I did.

585
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,908
But he doesn't listen.

586
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:52,443
We pay the actresses a lot,

587
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,647
but with ratings like this,
what did he expect?

588
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,115
Isn't that right, sir?

589
00:31:57,649 --> 00:32:00,685
What if he goes to the union?

590
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,687
What would he say to them?

591
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:05,523
It's not a political show
that raises issues.

592
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,126
We're ending it because it's unpopular.

593
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,329
Na Yeong-seok sure did a great job on it.

594
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,498
Can't we get him back?

595
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:24,609
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT SEASON 4

596
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,482
Give us some ideas here.

597
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,517
-What are you...
-Jeju-do...

598
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,252
Since Jeju-do is out of the picture--

599
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,486
-Why not?
-We're going to Jeju-do.

600
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,488
-We can't.
-How about Leo-do?

601
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,057
Oh, come on.

602
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,601
Well, this is how I feel.

603
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,272
It's like I'm the father
of many young children,

604
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,374
who suddenly became unemployed.

605
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,143
How will I take responsibility for them?

606
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,478
How will I feed them?

607
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,947
My blood type is A.

608
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,383
I'm naturally responsible.

609
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,218
Now, the burden is huge.

610
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,866
What about me?

611
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,337
What happens to me?

612
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:29,907
There must have been talks
about the producer.

613
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:31,609
Am I getting fired?

614
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,712
I have to know in order to make a plan.

615
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,415
You're not getting fired.

616
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:46,924
For now, get a new cast and try again.

617
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,228
Starting when?

618
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,897
What do you mean when? Right now.

619
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,166
-What?
-Look.

620
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,468
Next week is the soccer match
between Korea and Japan.

621
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,103
Do a highlight show the following week.

622
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,905
You have two weeks to prepare.

623
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,306
How can I do everything in two weeks?

624
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,543
Should I ask another variety show team?

625
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:07,645
We can outsource. There are a few of them.

626
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,080
I'll make it work.

627
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:09,981
Good.

628
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,951
First, you should tell
the current cast members.

629
00:34:14,952 --> 00:34:17,922
Sir, we're having a party
with the entire team

630
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,059
for our one-year anniversary tomorrow.

631
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,827
How can I break the news to them there?

632
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:23,728
Really?

633
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,596
This just became simple.

634
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:26,497
How so?

635
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,099
Tell them about it
before the party tomorrow

636
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,068
and make it a farewell party.

637
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,936
That way we can save money
by having just one party.

638
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,373
Look at how great things are working out.

639
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,176
But where are you guys going to eat?

640
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,445
At Bibong.

641
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:45,817
The dinner course there
is pretty expensive.

642
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,987
It's actually a very good value.

643
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:54,158
The Mae course
comes with pine nut porridge.

644
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,960
It's very tasty.

645
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,428
It is.

646
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,798
So, is everyone getting the Mae course?

647
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:03,334
That's a lot of people.

648
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:05,236
How about the Ran course then?

649
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,738
That's only around 30,000 won per head.

650
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,041
But that course
doesn't come with porridge.

651
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,576
You can order it separately.

652
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:12,844
Even pine nut porridge?

653
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,278
Yes, you can.

654
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,617
So, will it be the Ran course
plus pine nut porridge?

655
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,052
Hold on.

656
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,988
Aren't we doing a final shoot then?

657
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,057
That's more production costs.

658
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,625
Think about the company.

659
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,228
Fine.

660
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:34,332
You're going to tell the cast the news

661
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,901
at tomorrow's party, right?

662
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,271
You have to tell them before the party.

663
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,773
Do you want porridge to be thrown at you?

664
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:50,815
TWO DAYS AND ONE NIGHT

665
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,719
When a show starts,
it's like your first birthday party.

666
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,422
All sorts of people come
and give you blessings.

667
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,925
There's so much laughter.

668
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:04,228
But when a show ends, it's like a funeral.

669
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:07,398
Especially when it's an unpopular show.

670
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,535
Nobody mourns it.

671
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,370
Nobody visits,

672
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,172
and there's no money for condolence.

673
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,408
It's pretty lonely.

674
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,547
I think that was pretty good.

675
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,316
Don't edit that out.
It was a very good analogy.

676
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,157
Sir, you had something important
to tell me?

677
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,694
No, it's not that big of a deal.

678
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,397
Is Cindy going to be on Music Bank today?

679
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,365
Yes. She's a candidate for first place.

680
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:44,936
My second daughter is a fan of hers.

681
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:50,074
And she happens to be in Yeouido Park now.

682
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,043
She's riding her bike with her friends.

683
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,012
I see.

684
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:05,089
Are the lights working okay?

685
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:08,226
Isn't it too dark?

686
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,360
It's fine.

687
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,463
Chief, what brings you here?

688
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:15,366
I'm here to see if Cindy needs anything.

689
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,168
How's that chair?

690
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,237
I bet she's uncomfortable.

691
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:22,106
They had these in 1997,
when I first started working here.

692
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,241
We should get new ones.

693
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:25,977
No, it's really fine.

694
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,181
The live shoot will start soon.

695
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:32,550
Oh, right.

696
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,719
Break a leg.

697
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,592
Oh, but do you have some free time?

698
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,562
Can you go say hello
to the chief director?

699
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,666
Thank you for the offer,
but we're short on time.

700
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:51,736
The live shoot will start soon.

701
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:52,803
Is that so?

702
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:54,972
It will only take five minutes.

703
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,275
Is it too much trouble?

704
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,578
She's already in full makeup,

705
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,780
and her heels are uncomfortable.

706
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,781
That's right.

707
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:06,250
It's too much trouble for her to go there.

708
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,518
I'm sorry.

709
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,552
No, that's okay.

710
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,920
It's fine.

711
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,736
How about this then?

712
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,172
Since it's too much trouble to go there,

713
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:30,441
can you just pose for some photos?

714
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:31,776
What?

715
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:34,945
Come in, girls.

716
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,616
This is the chief director's daughter,
Jang Ye-bin.

717
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,685
Ye-bin, stand next to Cindy.

718
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,220
-Gather around.
-One, two, three.

719
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:46,924
Everyone smile.

720
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,493
You're really beautiful.

721
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,996
One, two, three.

722
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,268
Take a picture for us. Come on.

723
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,238
-One more.
-Okay.

724
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,576
Jeez, she's so rude.

725
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,478
Look at her expression. Gosh.

726
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:09,447
What's so difficult about taking a photo?

727
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,481
What's her deal?

728
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:13,050
She's stuck up, just like the rumors says.

729
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,086
How could she treat her fans like this?

730
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,887
Seriously...

731
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:19,056
Whose green room should we go to now?

732
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,424
Do you want to meet EXO?

733
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,460
-Yes!
-Yes! We love them!

734
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,361
Let's go.

735
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,765
This is why
I didn't want to do a rehearsal.

736
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,835
I have to wait longer

737
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,837
and things like this happen.

738
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:36,640
Tell them I'm not doing
a rehearsal next time.

739
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:42,747
But the main producer for this show
is really difficult.

740
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:47,485
The way you see it...

741
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:50,721
am I not difficult?

742
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,123
No.

743
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,658
I think you're very difficult too.

744
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,131
Did I do something wrong to you?

745
00:40:00,197 --> 00:40:01,132
What?

746
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,137
-That's not what I meant.
-No.

747
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,539
Tell me honestly.

748
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,676
How was I so difficult?

749
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,945
-It's not like that.
-Not like what?

750
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,647
I'm sorry.

751
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:21,852
Sorry?

752
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,089
Sorry for what?

753
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,558
I'm really curious.

754
00:40:28,526 --> 00:40:29,493
What are you sorry for?

755
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,801
Cindy.

756
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,372
You're going to have
to change your outfit.

757
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,007
See-through isn't allowed.

758
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,083
Car owner, you must be very busy.

759
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,319
I'm texting again
because you didn't text back.

760
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,055
Please contact me when you see this.

761
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,623
Have a great day.

762
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,098
Why isn't he reading these?

763
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,768
This is the right number.

764
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,236
Isn't it?

765
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,606
CAR OWNER

766
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,314
Aren't you going to turn it off?

767
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:25,316
I'm sorry.

768
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,754
The number you have dialed...

769
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:32,923
I can't believe newbies these days.

770
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:36,260
Hey, do you think you can use your phone
just because I'm using mine?

771
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,173
The phone is off. Please leave a message.

772
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,307
Now his phone is off?

773
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,376
This is definitely not a normal guy.

774
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:57,515
Ye-jin, I told Cindy that
she had to change her outfit.

775
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,416
Good, see-through isn't allowed. Why?

776
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,151
She said she won't change.

777
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:03,888
What?

778
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:06,724
Why not?

779
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,092
It's the concept for her new album.

780
00:42:08,158 --> 00:42:09,326
Bring her manager here.

781
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,729
Not the road manager. The guy above him.

782
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:12,930
Yes.

783
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,132
Why won't she change her clothes?

784
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,334
It's the first week of her comeback.

785
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:18,569
It's the concept.

786
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:20,204
Why don't you let it go?

787
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,806
It's too revealing for KBS.

788
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:25,809
Why must I repeat myself?

789
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,710
I got it.

790
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,679
I'll try to convince her.

791
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:30,214
Just a moment.

792
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,521
Rather than talking
to a celebrity directly,

793
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,723
you get things done more easily

794
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,093
if you talk to the manager.

795
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,430
I bet you all were surprised
that I had to take action myself.

796
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,266
Director, we'll go
with what she's wearing.

797
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,200
I'm sorry.

798
00:42:54,805 --> 00:42:55,873
-I...
-Hello?

799
00:42:57,708 --> 00:42:59,476
Yes, Producer.

800
00:43:05,382 --> 00:43:06,383
This won't do.

801
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:08,819
I'll have to go and talk to her.

802
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,056
Producer, are you going to fight?

803
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,259
Fight? Who's going to fight?

804
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:17,027
Me and Cindy?

805
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,631
How could I fight with her?

806
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,066
I'm going to scold her.

807
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,041
She's so cool.

808
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,519
-Hey.
-Yes?

809
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,422
Can you step outside?

810
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:51,061
Your breathing is too loud.

811
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,465
Okay.

812
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,267
Sorry for breathing too loudly.

813
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,109
Oh, Producer Tak.

814
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,653
Cindy.

815
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,022
I'm Producer Tak Ye-jin of Music Bank.

816
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:22,059
I clearly told you to change outfits.

817
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,094
Is that so difficult?

818
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,931
Didn't you get the message?

819
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,701
I said I'm not changing.

820
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,437
It's not about me getting the message.

821
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,139
This isn't allowed.

822
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,274
According to KBS regulations,

823
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,710
revealing clothes aren't allowed.

824
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,245
This isn't revealing.

825
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:42,913
It's pretty.

826
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:47,584
You,

827
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:50,120
with the teardrop pattern necktie.

828
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:55,225
Don't you think so?

829
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:57,461
Isn't this pretty?

830
00:44:57,928 --> 00:45:01,065
Yes, it's pretty.

831
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:07,771
See, Producer Tak? He said it's pretty.

832
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,908
Guys like it.

833
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:17,081
But maybe not older women like you.

834
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,555
Older women watch this show
with their sons.

835
00:45:25,622 --> 00:45:27,257
They watch Music Bank with their sons?

836
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:35,833
Have you ever watched Music Bank
with your mom at home?

837
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,903
Not really...

838
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,075
Or maybe I have.

839
00:45:49,847 --> 00:45:54,785
If the main producer asks you to do it,
the polite thing to do is to change.

840
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,721
Must you wear that even if it means

841
00:45:58,188 --> 00:45:59,423
it will cause trouble for our show?

842
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:05,963
Okay then.

843
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:08,665
Good.

844
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:09,933
Yes.

845
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,502
I won't do the show.

846
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,506
What?

847
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,145
Since I'm causing trouble for the show,

848
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,747
I'll just leave.

849
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:27,351
Hey, let's go.

850
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,987
I didn't tell you to leave.

851
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,155
Then what is it?

852
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,060
This really won't do.

853
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,897
Everyone get out.

854
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,300
-Producer--
-Out!

855
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,269
Yes.

856
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,212
Cindy.

857
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,182
Don't you see what the problem is?

858
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:04,488
What is it?

859
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,192
It's KBS.

860
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,529
That's the problem
with broadcast networks.

861
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:17,067
I think your outfit is totally pretty,
but the network won't accept it.

862
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,469
It really bums me out.

863
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,844
How would you know
if you've never performed?

864
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,280
It's a sure thing.

865
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,783
If you wear that on the live show,

866
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:34,952
I have to go to the KCC.

867
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,620
So what?

868
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:41,358
You don't have to do anything special.

869
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:42,759
That's a great outfit,

870
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:45,796
but can you wear that jacket over it?

871
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,998
Rather than showing everything off,

872
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:51,101
being slightly revealing
would be a lot sexier.

873
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,573
Producer Tak,
that's what see-through is for.

874
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:57,841
That's true.

875
00:47:58,041 --> 00:47:59,376
That's what see-through is,

876
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,113
but how about covering up a little more?

877
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,250
It would be so much sexier,
don't you think?

878
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,957
Do I have a jacket?

879
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:15,392
Are you going to wear one?

880
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:17,127
For me, Cindy? You'll wear a jacket?

881
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,497
Oh, this is such an honor.

882
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,368
Now I see why you became so famous.

883
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:26,103
You're a good person.

884
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,071
Thank you.

885
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:33,977
Get her a jacket.

886
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,345
She will wear it over her outfit.

887
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,581
Did you yell at her a lot?

888
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:41,919
Don't spread rumors
that I yelled at Cindy.

889
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:44,755
She's too big of a star
to be yelled at by producers.

890
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,891
Hey, polka dots.

891
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:50,861
Me?

892
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,296
Yes, you.

893
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,830
What's your name?

894
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:57,401
Baek Seung-chan.

895
00:48:58,468 --> 00:48:59,903
Okay, Baek Seung-chan.

896
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:02,205
I bet you're feeling really sad.

897
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,808
Was Cindy's see-through outfit
that pretty?

898
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,044
Are you a crazy fan?
Have you lost your mind?

899
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,646
-I'm sorry.
-I said not to apologize!

900
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,716
I'm out fighting in a war zone

901
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,385
and you relax in a bomb shelter
snacking on hardtack?

902
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,021
I can't believe you.

903
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,957
Why can't you say something?

904
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:32,102
Let's go.

905
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,508
When she yells at me,

906
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:40,577
and I try to apologize...

907
00:49:41,244 --> 00:49:42,746
I'm sorry.

908
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,648
I said not to apologize!

909
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,583
She tells me not to apologize.

910
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,219
When I keep my mouth shut, she asks me...

911
00:49:49,753 --> 00:49:51,555
Why can't you say something?

912
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,094
She asks why I'm not saying anything.

913
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:01,631
I feel like I need to apologize
for that too.

914
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,770
However, I can't apologize to her.

915
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:12,676
It's a vicious cycle.

916
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,584
Hey.

917
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,553
Why isn't there any call about the final
edit schedule from Two Days and One Night?

918
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,289
Oh, they're in big trouble.

919
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,393
I think Jun-mo got yelled at
by the chief director earlier.

920
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,495
He also got called to the KCC
in the afternoon.

921
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,431
-I'll get going.
-Okay. Bring it when it's done.

922
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:38,402
Pay attention, newbies.

923
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,570
As you can see,

924
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:45,342
other shows often ask Music Bank
for guests.

925
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:50,113
We're kind of like the control tower
for all variety shows.

926
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,484
So, helping out other KBS variety shows

927
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:57,687
is a win-win situation.

928
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,224
But not right when they ask.

929
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,959
Use the proper timing, like right now.

930
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,061
Watch.

931
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,328
JUN-MO

932
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:08,732
What?

933
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:10,600
It's about that favor you asked me.

934
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:14,004
I'll do the pre-recording
for Miss A next week.

935
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,205
Forget it. I don't need it.

936
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:19,576
Hello?

937
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:24,781
Phones cut off easily here
because of jamming.

938
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,620
Anyway, shall we get this started?

939
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:33,356
I LOVE YOU, CINDY

940
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:34,291
CINDY

941
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:35,258
I LOVE YOU, CINDY

942
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,563
She's wearing a jacket.

943
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,300
Okay, the first cut
will be from camera four.

944
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,036
-Starting on Cindy's face.
-This week's likely top song on the chart.

945
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,171
-Music, standby.
-Here's Cindy turning 23 this year

946
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,840
-Ready.
-with her song, "Twenty-three."

947
00:51:49,906 --> 00:51:50,740
Action.

948
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:55,979
One, cut.

949
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,782
Five, standby. Cut.

950
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:02,886
Two, cut.

951
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,061
My goodness.

952
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:14,931
That...

953
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:16,533
That wasn't me.

954
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,368
Four, cut.

955
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,538
One, cut.

956
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:23,773
Two, cut.

957
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,042
Four, cut.

958
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,148
One, cut.

959
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,596
Five, cut.

960
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,033
Two, cut.

961
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,115
One, cut.

962
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:34,978
Good work.

963
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,246
-Good work.
-Good work.

964
00:53:36,313 --> 00:53:38,215
Get me Cindy's manager now.

965
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,817
They left for an event
right after filming.

966
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,018
-Already?
-Yes.

967
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,895
They were scared of me and ran away.

968
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:53,964
That's what happened, right? Gosh.

969
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,902
Tell her agency's CEO
to come see me tomorrow.

970
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,370
CEO Byun?

971
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,574
I don't know if she will come...

972
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,043
-She better come. Why wouldn't she?
-Right.

973
00:54:13,149 --> 00:54:13,984
Hey!

974
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,053
I bet you loved that.

975
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,422
You saw Cindy wear
her pretty outfit on TV.

976
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:21,791
You had such a loud reaction.

977
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,126
Are you part of the studio audience?

978
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:27,897
Right. Hey.

979
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,534
You can go to the KCC.

980
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,503
You said Cindy's outfit was pretty, right?

981
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,505
Go and tell them that.

982
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:37,874
Tell them it's pretty
and not revealing at all.

983
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:07,804
Today was your first day of work.

984
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,340
How was it?

985
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,209
How do you think it was?

986
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:26,956
Where are you, Jun-mo?

987
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,993
I have a company dinner with my team.

988
00:55:32,028 --> 00:55:33,563
I think I'll be out late tonight.

989
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,399
No, later than that.

990
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,336
Yes, I'm going to be tired.

991
00:55:44,207 --> 00:55:45,442
Okay, bye.

992
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:47,510
Producer Ra!

993
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,446
-Hello.
-Hi.

994
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,515
-Hey.
-Yes?

995
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:54,484
Are you still working for CEO Byun?

996
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:56,753
Yes.

997
00:55:57,287 --> 00:55:58,388
Who's manager are you?

998
00:55:59,089 --> 00:55:59,923
Cindy.

999
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,524
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1000
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:15,572
That's your dinner?

1001
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,441
Oh, I already ate earlier.

1002
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,410
This is for Cindy.

1003
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,912
She needs to be in Suwon by 10:00 p.m.
We're short on time.

1004
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:28,852
-Put that back.
-Sorry?

1005
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,693
What's taking him so long?

1006
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,638
Where is he going?

1007
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,508
Ma'am!

1008
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,843
Anchovy and chili rice roll,
beef rice roll,

1009
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,878
and fish cake soup to go.

1010
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:57,280
-Sure.
-Producer Ra...

1011
00:56:59,015 --> 00:57:03,319
Go and tell this to CEO Byun.

1012
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,455
If she wants her artists to work,

1013
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,557
she needs to feed them.

1014
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,027
If she wants them to work so hard,

1015
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,630
she needs to feed them properly!

1016
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:16,966
She needs energy
to sing and dance all day!

1017
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:19,736
That Byun...

1018
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:21,604
Jeez!

1019
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:23,873
I'm sorry.

1020
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:27,777
That would be 3,500 won...

1021
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,250
Are you kidding me?

1022
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,753
You know I don't eat carbs.

1023
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,423
Great, there's even soup.

1024
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:45,061
Do you want my face to get all puffy?

1025
00:57:45,428 --> 00:57:46,529
What could I do?

1026
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:48,798
The producer bought this for you to eat.

1027
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:51,801
Who did you say it was?

1028
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,170
The producer of Two Days and One Night.

1029
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:56,840
Is he my fan?

1030
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,476
Probably not.

1031
00:58:02,278 --> 00:58:03,112
Well...

1032
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,648
He really hates our CEO.

1033
00:58:07,717 --> 00:58:08,551
Why?

1034
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,086
I don't know.

1035
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:12,522
Our CEO has a lot of enemies.

1036
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,192
So what if you're a writer?

1037
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,827
So what if you're a producer?

1038
00:58:19,596 --> 00:58:21,664
Lift the ban.

1039
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,567
If you don't lift the ban on my artists,

1040
00:58:25,401 --> 00:58:26,903
I'm going to sleep here.

1041
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:32,342
But...

1042
00:58:33,776 --> 00:58:35,545
if he hates our CEO so much,

1043
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,114
why did he give me this?

1044
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:42,218
I don't know.

1045
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:46,523
Is he nuts?

1046
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:03,640
Why doesn't this guy answer his phone?

1047
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:04,541
Hello?

1048
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,242
Oh, you picked up.

1049
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:11,548
Sir, I don't know if you saw my texts.

1050
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:16,052
I had a little issue with your car
on my way to work this morning.

1051
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:19,088
Where are you now?

1052
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,292
Well, I'm almost at the parking lot.

1053
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,727
Oh, I see.

1054
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,332
Are you a KBS employee, by any chance?

1055
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,301
Yes.

1056
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:33,803
My goodness.

1057
00:59:34,203 --> 00:59:36,639
We're family then.

1058
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:39,409
Where do you work?

1059
00:59:41,277 --> 00:59:42,345
The entertainment department.

1060
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:43,846
The entertainment department?

1061
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:45,848
Entertainment...

1062
00:59:58,294 --> 00:59:59,162
No way.

1063
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,102
Nice car.

1064
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:11,574
It's my dad's car.

1065
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:13,977
Really?

1066
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:20,683
But why didn't you respond to my texts?

1067
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:25,421
You told me not to look at my phone.

1068
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,324
I did, didn't I?

1069
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:29,359
Good job.

1070
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,362
I haven't checked any of the texts.

1071
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:33,262
Don't!

1072
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:37,233
Look at your car.
It's just a small scrape.

1073
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,234
Hurry.

1074
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,609
I don't think it's that small...

1075
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,713
Don't go easy on me
just because I'm your senior.

1076
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,181
I'm not like that, okay?

1077
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,554
Okay.

1078
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,356
I understand.

1079
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:03,559
You do?

1080
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,462
This is my dad's car.

1081
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:09,265
I can't decide what to do on my own.

1082
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,567
I'll have to tell my dad first.

1083
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:14,604
I'll get back to you after I see
how much it will cost to fix the damage.

1084
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,274
Yes, you should.

1085
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:20,343
That's the right thing to do.

1086
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:23,413
Okay then.

1087
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,747
Goodbye.

1088
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:29,285
Don't mind me. Just go.

1089
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,488
You go first.

1090
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:37,894
Seriously, look at this!

1091
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:42,565
You parked so close to my car.
How can I get in?

1092
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,268
Look at this.

1093
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:49,472
Jeez! How do I get in?

1094
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,008
How could I not hit your door?

1095
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:52,909
Jeez...

1096
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:54,410
Shall I back my car out first then?

1097
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,879
Forget it! I'm already in.

1098
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,849
Look at this!

1099
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,684
You parked so close!

1100
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,319
Gosh!

1101
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,389
You're really...

1102
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:15,231
Where's Writer Choi?

1103
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:18,134
I called her earlier,
and she said she's crossing Mapo Bridge.

1104
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,736
Does she live there?

1105
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,370
She's always crossing that bridge!

1106
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,539
She should at least take
a different bridge.

1107
01:02:26,509 --> 01:02:28,311
Go ahead and eat.

1108
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,380
Why are you buying us beef?

1109
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:34,517
Something's strange.

1110
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,419
Are we getting fired?

1111
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:38,788
No.

1112
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:39,956
What happened with Miss A?

1113
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:41,057
We don't need them.

1114
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,593
What? I found all the footage.

1115
01:02:44,127 --> 01:02:46,062
Please don't make me do unnecessary work.

1116
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:47,196
It's so tiring.

1117
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,297
I'm right.

1118
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,000
I said you're not getting fired.

1119
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:00,910
Our show isn't getting canceled.

1120
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:02,211
They want a new cast.

1121
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:09,218
This is a good thing.
The viewer ratings were too low anyway.

1122
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:13,055
We're doing a highlight episode next week,
so let's have a meeting about that.

1123
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:13,956
Do it yourself.

1124
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,058
What do you mean?

1125
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,394
This is our work. That's exactly my point.

1126
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,797
What about us? Are we staying?

1127
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,799
That's what's important.

1128
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,235
We've had meetings before
without knowing we would be fired.

1129
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,603
Who said you guys are getting fired?

1130
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:29,071
How can we believe you?

1131
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,507
When Sponge was canceled,

1132
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:34,577
you didn't tell the writers until the end.

1133
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:39,515
That's why I took all those writers
along with me to 1 vs. 100.

1134
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:42,552
That's why the show had 12 writers then.

1135
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:45,721
Even when we didn't need
that many writers for the show!

1136
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,990
I made all that possible, don't you see?

1137
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,660
We're all to blame
if the show gets canceled,

1138
01:03:50,893 --> 01:03:52,495
but it's different for you.

1139
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:56,132
Producers still get paid
no matter what happens to the show.

1140
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,768
That's the difference between us and you.

1141
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,340
Sorry to add,

1142
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,576
but what about our script fees?

1143
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:09,312
What percentage do we get
for the highlight episode?

1144
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:10,346
Wait.

1145
01:04:10,913 --> 01:04:12,515
If next week is the highlight episode,

1146
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,116
will we need clips?

1147
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,452
-Is that the problem now?
-It is.

1148
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,987
That will be so much more work.

1149
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:19,889
Do you think you do all the work
on this show?

1150
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:20,790
Producer Ra.

1151
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,826
I'm sorry, but I have
a graduate school class to go to.

1152
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,528
So, if we're done talking...

1153
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:27,530
I'll be going now.

1154
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:31,000
See that?

1155
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,335
He always leaves like that.

1156
01:04:33,102 --> 01:04:34,437
-I do all the work.
-Oh, gosh.

1157
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,240
What about the vacation home reservation?

1158
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,108
Cancel it.

1159
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:43,145
I worked so hard to make that reservation.

1160
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:44,714
What will I tell them now?

1161
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,482
What's so hard about canceling?

1162
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:48,184
Just...

1163
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,686
Hey, stop crying!

1164
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,555
Sir.

1165
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,057
This is Two Days and One Night.
We planned to film there.

1166
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,959
-Is there an editing room?
-Can you take the call?

1167
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:00,730
-Are there any empty editing rooms?
-Soju, please!

1168
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,231
What about in the basement?

1169
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,935
We asked for more soju here!

1170
01:05:06,002 --> 01:05:08,104
There is?
I'll be there in half an hour then.

1171
01:05:09,038 --> 01:05:10,740
Don't give the room out to anyone.

1172
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:22,518
WHAT'S WITH THE MUSIC BANK
PRODUCTION TEAM?

1173
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,220
CINDY'S SHOCKINGLY REVEALING
SEE-THROUGH OUTFIT

1174
01:05:47,376 --> 01:05:51,180
WITH CINDY, WHO ALWAYS GIVES ME STRENGTH

1175
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:55,251
KIM TAE-HO

1176
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,411
Hello, Producer?

1177
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,081
I heard you needed a writer.
Did you get one yet?

1178
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,620
Stop crying.

1179
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:47,069
MUSIC BANK HAS GONE TOO FAR
CINDY WAS PRACTICALLY NAKED

1180
01:06:48,938 --> 01:06:50,539
THIS COMMENT HAS BEEN REPORTED

1181
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,985
WHAT IS A VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER?
BY KIM TAE-HO

1182
01:07:03,686 --> 01:07:06,355
01. UNDERSTANDING A VARIETY SHOW PRODUCER

1183
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:10,559
STARTING IS NOT THE HALF OF IT.
STARTING IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

1184
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:54,904
Leave me alone today.

1185
01:07:57,173 --> 01:07:58,541
You leave me alone.

1186
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,121
Let's pray.

1187
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,690
Just for a candle on a cake?

1188
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:16,058
What are you talking about?

1189
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,428
He got hired at KBS,
the best national broadcast--

1190
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:20,830
It's a public broadcast network, Dad.

1191
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,566
Anyway, this is no ordinary blessing.

1192
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,435
We should all give this honor to God.

1193
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,503
That's right, father.

1194
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:29,038
Congratulations, Seung-chan.

1195
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,775
But why did you suddenly want
to become a producer?

1196
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:34,510
I know, right?

1197
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,946
I'm not really sure.

1198
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,883
Does that mean
you'll be the producer of Music Bank?

1199
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,751
My friends are all so excited.

1200
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:45,955
Will I be able to meet GOT7?

1201
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,124
Goodness, hurry up and pray.

1202
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,493
-The candle is burning out.
-Right.

1203
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,896
Dear loving Father...

1204
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:57,933
Seung-chan got hired at the best
national broadcast network, KBS--

1205
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,702
Public broadcast network.

1206
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,406
Anyway, he got hired at KBS.

1207
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,842
It's such a happy time
for our family, Father.

1208
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:08,144
I pray that he can work

1209
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:11,547
as Your servant at KBS.

1210
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,649
Also, I pray for our eldest son,
Yeong-chan.

1211
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,087
With the bar exam being abolished in 2017,

1212
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,725
he's been taking the exam
for 12 years now.

1213
01:09:23,058 --> 01:09:24,727
Please keep him in Your care.

1214
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:25,661
Father!

1215
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:29,064
And I pray for my oldest daughter-in-law--

1216
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:30,966
She couldn't come because she has a sty.

1217
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,169
Such a variety of excuses.

1218
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,637
You just don't know.

1219
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:36,338
She got a big sty on her eye.

1220
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:38,541
Take care of her sty, Father.

1221
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,044
-And my oldest daughter--
-Just skip me.

1222
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,014
I'll skip her at her request.

1223
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:46,382
I pray for my son-in-law,

1224
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:51,086
who is a doctor in the field of Urology.

1225
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:54,056
May he use his talents
for the health of many men--

1226
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,457
Dad!

1227
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:56,392
Amen.

1228
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,830
-I pray all these things--
-You always forget and skip me!

1229
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,632
Why did you even have me?

1230
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:09,805
I pray in the name of our Lord Jesus.

1231
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:11,574
-Amen.
-Amen.

1232
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:14,076
Go ahead.

1233
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:18,781
That's it.

1234
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:24,253
Anyway, I'm very happy today.

1235
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:25,888
My son-in-law is a doctor.

1236
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,456
My oldest son is...

1237
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,462
He will become a public prosecutor
when he passes the bar exam.

1238
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,965
And now, Seung-chan is employed too.

1239
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,535
Our family members
have professions that end in "or."

1240
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,238
How does his job end in "or"?

1241
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,343
Produsor.

1242
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:48,911
Isn't that right?

1243
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:50,879
Produsor!

1244
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,284
Produsor.

1245
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,975
I convinced her to join the show.

1246
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:22,111
How can I be the one to tell her to quit?

1247
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:23,979
Nobody will understand you like that.

1248
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,114
Are you a dolphin?

1249
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:26,815
Do you communicate
through ultrasonic waves?

1250
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,984
Then who's going to tell her?

1251
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:30,352
Tell me what?

1252
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,453
Hello, ma'am.

1253
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,955
Hey! Cover that up!

1254
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:37,326
Okay, I won't look.

1255
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:39,695
Me? What's so scary about me?

1256
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:41,030
Don't worry.

1257
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:43,666
I said this earlier.
I'll work even harder.

1258
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,167
I heard you messed up today.

1259
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,037
Do you know you can get fired
for messing up during probation?

1260
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:49,538
Excuse me?

1261
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:50,739
You have two strikes left.

1262
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:52,508
Be careful.

1263
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,245
Use this.

1264
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,580
This isn't my umbrella.

1265
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,250
-I just borrowed it at the lobby desk.
-Excuse me?

1266
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:04,720
If it's not returned,
it comes out of my salary.

1267
01:12:04,787 --> 01:12:07,022
-Please say my name when you return it.
-Okay.

1268
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,525
I'm Producer Baek Seung-chan
of Two Days and One Night.
