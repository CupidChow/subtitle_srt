1
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,713
Someone might think I got rejected by
a guy.

2
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,349
This hasn't happened to me before.

3
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:51,151
Did he reject me?

4
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,088
Ye-jin, are you okay?

5
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:56,823
Give her a break today.

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,891
It's her birthday.

7
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,994
CEO Byun is freaking out.

8
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,629
If I lose you,

9
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:06,633
I could fill your position right away.

10
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,003
I don't think of myself as a good person.

11
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:11,838
I don't love myself.

12
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,506
I don't really know...

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,941
Who would think of me like that?

14
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,379
He's a senior manager
at a foreign investment company.

15
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,747
I want to set him up with Ye-jin.

16
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,048
She can go if she wants to.

17
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,283
It's up to her.

18
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:26,219
If Producer Tak had another man,

19
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,620
would you not care?

20
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:32,859
I don't think a guy should judge
based on appearances.

21
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,128
You said you liked Hye-ju
because she's pretty.

22
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,931
Just hearing that,
I can tell he's no good.

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:42,769
If Seung-chan is in his right mind,
he won't score a goal.

24
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:46,840
You know how she feels,
but you haven't done anything.

25
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,007
It's cowardly.

26
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:49,943
Shoot!

27
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,644
Don't intervene in someone's life

28
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,080
unless you can take
responsibility till the end.

29
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,754
Hello?

30
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,623
This is Cindy.

31
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,260
I have something to tell you right now.

32
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:09,963
I'm in front of your house.

33
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:13,666
Cindy, I have an appointment.

34
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:14,701
I'll be waiting.

35
00:02:31,684 --> 00:02:35,221
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message.

36
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,369
Producer Tak, your phone was off.

37
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,238
Yes. I noticed that earlier.

38
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,939
We aren't that late. Let's go in.

39
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,507
I'm sorry, but...

40
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:02,976
What is it?

41
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,413
I don't think I can watch the movie.

42
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,352
I can't believe this kid.

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,323
I knew it.

44
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,394
I mean, what did I expect?

45
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,997
Like I ever had the time
to go watch a movie, right?

46
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,700
You know what, I actually got excited
about watching a movie with a man

47
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,235
that I even bought popcorn.

48
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,805
Step on it! Cindy is waiting.

49
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,376
Well, it's raining...

50
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,411
I know, right?

51
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:42,982
What does she have to tell you so urgently
when it's raining like this?

52
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,353
Maybe she fought with CEO Byun
and ran away again.

53
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,491
Cindy has quite the temper.
It's worrisome.

54
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,391
Are you okay?

55
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,294
Yes, I'm fine.

56
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:31,664
-I'm good.
-Oh, right.

57
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:35,902
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,170
It's okay.

59
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,774
Why is there so much traffic?

60
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,586
Is that you, Cindy?
I wasn't sure at first.

61
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,358
Why are you out here? It's raining.

62
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,194
Are you waiting for someone?

63
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,230
Producer Baek Seung-chan.

64
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,799
I have something to tell him.

65
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:12,605
Let's go inside.

66
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:16,776
I'll call Seung-chan
and tell him to come over.

67
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,711
You'll catch a cold at this rate.

68
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,125
Where's the tea?

69
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,063
It's better to drink hot tea than coffee.

70
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,866
It's on the third shelf from the right
under the sink.

71
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,601
Under the cocoa and coffee bean shelf.

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,211
It will be ready in a bit.
I'll make it nice and warm.

73
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,016
Thank you.

74
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,521
Does your agency know you're here?

75
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,460
What's up?

76
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,431
Did something happen with CEO Byun
after you went back?

77
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,334
Does it seem like to you

78
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,305
that I'm acting?

79
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,475
Even when I'm being sincere?

80
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,710
What are you talking about?

81
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:28,981
Someone told me that.

82
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,885
That even my sincerity seems like acting.

83
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,392
I can't really tell. Maybe I do that.

84
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,800
I bet you can predict what I'll be doing

85
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,902
ten years from now.

86
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,371
As for me,

87
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:55,508
I can't.

88
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,710
I have no idea.

89
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:02,448
I don't know what I'll be doing
ten years from now.

90
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,685
I don't even know what will happen
five years from now

91
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,353
or even one year from now.

92
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,257
I feel like the more I struggle,
the deeper I'll sink.

93
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:18,130
Don't do things you don't want to.

94
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,866
You've done enough already.

95
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:22,335
You get bruises so easily

96
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,837
and that's from lack of food.
Lack of food and lack of sleep.

97
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:26,239
You're being overworked.

98
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,274
I can't refuse to do things
just because I don't want to.

99
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,310
Do you think CEO Byun will let me be?

100
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:32,945
Just quit that agency.

101
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,147
I want to do that.

102
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,752
Will you take responsibility for me?

103
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,187
I will.

104
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,856
Really?

105
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:45,258
I'm a producer.

106
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,260
Why worry when a producer is on your side?

107
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:50,196
I'll cast you in any show I work on.

108
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,131
It's not like you have no talent.

109
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,000
You're a star. What are you afraid of?

110
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,435
Producer.

111
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,305
-Yes?
-But...

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,375
what happened here?

113
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:04,010
Oh, this?

114
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,746
It happened while playing soccer.

115
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,015
So that's why you bought ointment.

116
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,850
Give it to me.

117
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,324
Hey, where did you learn this stuff?

118
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,793
When I perform
overseas or in the countryside,

119
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,896
I don't have time
to see a doctor for injuries.

120
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,266
I know basic first aid.

121
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,836
There's nothing good about being injured.

122
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,711
Hey, you're here.

123
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,883
What's this?
Why did you two come together?

124
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,919
Seung-chan and I
were supposed to watch a movie.

125
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:53,693
Didn't you text Seung-chan
that Cindy was here waiting for him?

126
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,928
Yes, I did.

127
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:57,964
All done.

128
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,066
-Thanks.
-Did you hurt yourself?

129
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,935
Oh, this is nothing.

130
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,575
Hello? You're near the broadcast station?

131
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,612
I'm at Producer Tak Ye-jin's house.

132
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,147
I'll be right down, so hurry over.

133
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,917
What? You're leaving already?

134
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:22,488
I thought you had
something to tell Seung-chan.

135
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,296
It was nothing important.

136
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,567
Last time, I kind of messed up.

137
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:38,738
So, I wanted to apologize.

138
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,807
I'm a cast member on his show after all.

139
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,511
I don't know
if we'll see each other often,

140
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,847
but I don't want things to be awkward.

141
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,652
I'm sorry about what I did that time.

142
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,957
-Cindy--
-That's all I had to say.

143
00:10:58,024 --> 00:10:59,091
I'll be going now.

144
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,129
-Goodbye.
-Wait, Cindy.

145
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,366
You should take the stuff
that you asked us to buy before.

146
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:09,435
Take it with you.

147
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,369
Hold on.

148
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,473
Here.

149
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,744
Okay.

150
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,813
Thank you.

151
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,996
Don't you think
something else is up with her?

152
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,901
She didn't look too good.

153
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:46,338
What are you doing? Go after her.

154
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,941
Wait with her until her ride comes.

155
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:50,976
Okay.

156
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,684
Producer Tak.

157
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,521
About missing the movie today...

158
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,090
No, it's okay.

159
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,758
No, I...

160
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,094
I really regret it.

161
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,675
Did you sense that, too?

162
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,546
I think Seung-chan

163
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,416
really loves watching movies.

164
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,286
He...

165
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:40,159
Are you kidding me?

166
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,329
She's so stupid.

167
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,577
I...

168
00:13:01,347 --> 00:13:04,450
I'm sorry if what I said last time

169
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:06,952
made you upset.

170
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,288
Don't be.

171
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:11,924
That's how I am.

172
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:17,062
Cindy.

173
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,732
What kind of person are you?

174
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:25,104
Phony and rude.

175
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,208
That's what everyone say about me.

176
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,179
They chew me out because I deserve it.

177
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,884
I heard this somewhere.

178
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,321
When people speak ill of you
behind your back,

179
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,257
they are like poisoned arrows.

180
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,493
But thankfully,

181
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,730
words said behind your back
have no strength,

182
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:54,233
so...

183
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:57,403
those arrows can't pierce the heart.

184
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,874
However,

185
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,078
the most foolish thing to do

186
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:11,350
is picking up the arrows

187
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,119
that are lying on the ground

188
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:17,489
and piercing your own heart with them.

189
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,663
You get pierced by an arrow needlessly.

190
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,000
And you get hurt needlessly.

191
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,170
Cindy,

192
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,006
I wish you wouldn't do that.

193
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,593
What movie did you go to watch?

194
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,264
Excuse me?

195
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,132
With Producer Tak.

196
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:03,702
Oh, well...

197
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,941
Producer Tak was the one
who bought the tickets,

198
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,477
so I don't know what movie it was.

199
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,047
We didn't get to watch it anyway.

200
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,788
So, it didn't matter what movie it was?

201
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,626
So...

202
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:31,030
you didn't go to watch a movie.

203
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,965
You went to see Producer Tak.

204
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,473
Lucky you.

205
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,576
You're so easy to read.

206
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,114
Even if you try to hide it,

207
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,218
your true feelings are so apparent.

208
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,661
I try my best, but...

209
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,733
my sincerity doesn't show.

210
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,013
Bye.

211
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:49,308
Hey, stop trying to look cool
by staring out at the rain.

212
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:50,309
Get over here.

213
00:16:58,117 --> 00:16:59,084
What is it?

214
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,053
Take a look at this.

215
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,757
You always pay the utility fees late,
so you always end up paying late fees.

216
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,526
I especially paid them
in advance this month,

217
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:11,363
so be sure to sign up
for an automatic wire transfer.

218
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,332
All right.

219
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,068
Don't just agree with me.
You should do it.

220
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:19,338
Same goes for the gas bill.

221
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,140
And that...

222
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,375
You should get the screen fixed
before summer.

223
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:28,714
I saw a flyer in the elevator
saying you can make a group purchase.

224
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:31,984
Make sure you check that out
and sign up for it, okay?

225
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,921
Also, the meat in the freezer
has been there for a while,

226
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,456
so eat it within a month.

227
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,626
What are you doing?

228
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:41,894
What?

229
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,863
I'm moving into my new apartment soon.

230
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,099
I have what, three weeks left?

231
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,170
Four months really flew by, right?

232
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,914
Anyway, I sure gave you a lot of trouble.

233
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,083
It's not like you're moving out tomorrow.

234
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,651
Why are you making a fuss already?

235
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:08,987
I should still prepare ahead of time.

236
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:09,888
Hey.

237
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,791
Three weeks is still a long time.

238
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,593
That's a good amount of time.

239
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:18,730
All right, it's a good amount of time.

240
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,233
Look at this.

241
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,774
What? On break?

242
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,411
The new season
hasn't been on for that long!

243
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,779
We can't take a break!

244
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:36,315
Don't think of it like that.

245
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,117
More like a substitution.

246
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,685
What's the difference?

247
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,588
You're going to broadcast
the new program in our show's slot.

248
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,290
The new program must be aired this month.

249
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,994
It has something to do
with the sponsors too.

250
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:50,896
Who's the chief producer
of the new program?

251
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,932
-Me.
-Oh, come on!

252
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,573
They're a bit sensitive.

253
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,675
It's like an inferiority complex.

254
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,845
It's hard for me to criticize teams
that get low viewer ratings.

255
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,180
Whenever I say something, they say,

256
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,682
"Why me?
Is it because I'm not good enough?"

257
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,585
Why is he only doing this to me?

258
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,722
It's because my show isn't popular
and has poor viewer ratings.

259
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,157
I'm an easy target.

260
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,258
A popular show?

261
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,526
Like The Return of Superman?

262
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,661
He would never cancel that show
for a new program.

263
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,232
Does a program break mean

264
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,134
I get time off?

265
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:33,172
I haven't had a proper day off
since I started here.

266
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,444
I have two kids.

267
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,013
I'm more comfortable at work than home.

268
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,781
At other companies,

269
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,450
a wife wouldn't know
if her husband had a day off or not.

270
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,319
But I can't fool my wife.

271
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,154
When it gets canceled,
the whole nation would know.

272
00:19:49,254 --> 00:19:53,825
Some people think that a program break
is good news for the staff.

273
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:57,496
But writers don't get paid
until it actually airs.

274
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,565
That's the fate of a TV writer.

275
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,733
When we have time, we don't get paid.

276
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,735
When we get paid, we don't have time.

277
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,804
A program break.

278
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,439
If you think about it positively,

279
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,709
it's another chance for us
to prove our worth.

280
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,612
People get used to long-running shows,

281
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,614
so they take us for granted.

282
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:17,249
You only realize how precious they are

283
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:20,285
once they're gone.
This applies to both people and TV shows.

284
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,570
Cindy, I'm glad you're here.

285
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,572
I was looking for you.

286
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,040
You know Jinie, right?

287
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,610
She's the final winner of
The Great Audition.

288
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,112
I don't really watch TV.

289
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,283
She has great potential,
so our agency signed her.

290
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,218
Jinie, say hello.

291
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,519
You know Cindy, right?

292
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,488
Hello, Cindy.

293
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,659
I heard Two Days and One Night
is on a break this week.

294
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,929
Thankfully, you have time now.
Let's do these shows.

295
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,903
How many shoots are these
in just two days?

296
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,773
What? I thought you liked variety shows.

297
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,110
You'll be a guest on the three networks'
most popular shows.

298
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,713
By any chance...

299
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,250
will I appear on these with her?

300
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,151
Yeah.

301
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:28,387
Jinie is only good at singing.

302
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,489
She has no TV experience.

303
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,425
Appear on these shows with her
and coach her as her senior--

304
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,261
You want me to do these shows
to get her all set up?

305
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,864
Yes, that's right.

306
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,835
If you do this,

307
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,839
I might reconsider renewing my contract.

308
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:50,642
Reconsider?

309
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,480
Go ahead.

310
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:59,084
It's an important decision.
I'm sure you have many things to consider.

311
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:02,821
But renewing is a two-way street.

312
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,756
I can also do that.

313
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,692
Reconsider, that is.

314
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,505
What's all that?

315
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,274
They are curtains.

316
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,544
Seung-chan got them.

317
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,611
Jun-mo.

318
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,214
These are perfect for your room.
Change them to this.

319
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,716
How did he get that stuff?

320
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:32,250
Hey.

321
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,355
Seung-chan is really amazing.

322
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:39,324
The new apartment
I'm supposed to move into...

323
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:43,261
Can you believe that Seung-chan
arranged for my unit

324
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:45,364
to be the model home
for people to look at.

325
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,532
That's why I got the whole interior done.

326
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,735
How much was it again?

327
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,970
Well, the wallpaper was free.

328
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,939
Did you hear that? It was free.

329
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:55,574
For the curtains,

330
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,876
it was 50% for the living room,
30% for the master bedroom,

331
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,912
and 10% for blinds in the small room.

332
00:23:01,413 --> 00:23:02,981
Isn't that awesome?

333
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:06,151
I got 100% hardwood floors,

334
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,554
except for the entryway
which will be marble.

335
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,023
I thought it would disrupt
the overall balance

336
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,558
since it's not a big place.

337
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,594
See?

338
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,529
He's amazing!

339
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,799
Hey, try working this hard at work.

340
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,101
You have so much free time
because of the break.

341
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,873
Also, the lights
are being installed tomorrow.

342
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:31,109
I'm trying to get them done for free.

343
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,078
Hey.

344
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,814
Forget the lights.

345
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,417
I want you in my new house, Seung-chan.

346
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,987
How are you so clever?

347
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,322
Who called you clumsy?

348
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:47,225
Bring them all to me.
I'll sew their mouths shut.

349
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,596
It's good that you got a good deal.

350
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:53,465
How many days until you move in?

351
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,667
It should be cleaned
a week before moving in.

352
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,170
I'll help you clean the place.

353
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,107
Clean up the place, you said?

354
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,608
Don't sweat it!

355
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,677
Here's what happened.

356
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:12,017
Are you going to be moving in?

357
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,219
Yes. Are you moving in too?

358
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,488
My friend will be moving in here.

359
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:19,991
How do you plan on cleaning
before you move in?

360
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,126
Cleaning?

361
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,195
I found out from this flyer

362
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,231
that if a bunch of people
make a group purchase,

363
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,433
we can get the cleaning done
for a cheap price.

364
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,369
The more people there are,
the bigger the discount is.

365
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,938
Would you like to get in on this?

366
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,540
Oh, maybe I should.

367
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,642
Say, come here.

368
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:40,579
-Can I have one too?
-We can get a discount.

369
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,948
-We should get in on this.
-Let's do this.

370
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:47,152
Seung-chan got ten ladies to sign up,

371
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,254
so they're cleaning my place for free.

372
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,223
Even oxygen disinfection.

373
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,326
Jun-gi's mom got many ladies together.

374
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:55,961
Oh, my goodness.

375
00:24:56,027 --> 00:24:57,796
Hey, did you hear that?
He said Jun-gi's mom.

376
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,966
He's already close
with the neighborhood ladies.

377
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,102
I think Seung-chan will be really good

378
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,938
at casting non-celebrities when you shoot.

379
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:13,845
My mom is the head
of the local women's group.

380
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:16,181
Her friends come over often,

381
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:19,317
so I don't feel awkward or uncomfortable

382
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,821
around middle-aged women.

383
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,891
Now I just need a moving service.

384
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,592
Should I hire movers?

385
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,263
Of course, you should.
That's the most convenient.

386
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,598
I actually looked into it.

387
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:35,767
You don't have that much stuff,

388
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:39,170
so you can just hire a delivery service
that can help you transfer your stuff.

389
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:43,441
You can start moving your stuff
little by little starting today.

390
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,279
The storage room will be locked,
so you can store your stuff in there.

391
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,446
That's true.

392
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,782
That would be a lot cheaper.

393
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,151
Jun-mo, want to help me out?

394
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,087
Forget it. You two can do everything.

395
00:25:56,621 --> 00:26:00,358
Jeez, it's not like
you can really save that much.

396
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,429
The movers have to make money too.

397
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,972
I'll help you pack, Producer Tak.

398
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,440
Okay, Seung-chan.

399
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,211
Wait, we need another box.

400
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,513
-Hold on.
-Okay.

401
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:41,666
How cute.

402
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,528
Producer Tak!

403
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,764
You startled me. What is it?

404
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,201
Do you know when we first met?

405
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,371
Of course, isn't it
on your first day of work?

406
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:21,106
Wrong. We met before that.

407
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:24,609
Look.

408
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,649
Hey, that's me and Jun-mo.

409
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:32,484
Over here. Behind you.

410
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:33,985
Behind me?

411
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,186
Here.

412
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:37,756
-What about him?
-It's me!

413
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,759
-That's you?
-Yes!

414
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,994
Wow, is that really you?

415
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,163
What a coincidence!

416
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,264
Right?

417
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,500
I can't believe it. My gosh.

418
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:52,303
Well, it makes sense because you've lived
here ever since you were born.

419
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:56,007
You also went to this playground often.

420
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,377
We probably met each other
by chance, right?

421
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,613
Or you can call it fate.

422
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,449
Oh, come on.

423
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,119
You've known Producer Ra
for a longer time,

424
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:11,489
but we have this small connection too.

425
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,326
That's true. I guess you could say that.

426
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:18,897
You look really cute here.

427
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:19,864
Really?

428
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,802
Producer Tak, please give me this photo.

429
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,704
Do you want it?

430
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,205
Okay.

431
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:30,241
I owe you anyway,

432
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,810
so you can have it.

433
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:34,946
Here's your gift.

434
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:36,247
Thank you.

435
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,762
Jun-mo, is it tiring?

436
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,230
Don't make me talk!

437
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:56,735
How much is the rent for this place
to be so high up?

438
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,503
Deposit is 3 million won
and rent is 200,000 won.

439
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,141
Do you even get any sunlight here?

440
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,376
It's a semi-basement so I do get some sun.

441
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:07,479
At least it faces South.

442
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:08,379
How much is this place?

443
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,181
Deposit is 20 million won
and rent is 400,000 won.

444
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,116
A 70 million lease?

445
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:13,418
You're paying it all with your own money?

446
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:14,986
I got a loan for 20 million won.

447
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,322
Pretty impressive!

448
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,791
Very impressive, Ye-jin!

449
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:23,561
I'm so happy!

450
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,937
Are you happy that you're moving out?

451
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,773
Yes, I'm excited.

452
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,576
I worked really hard
to make this possible.

453
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,845
That's true.

454
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,582
How many times have I moved since college?

455
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,518
Has it been 13 or 14 times?

456
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,853
It has been 14 times.

457
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:27,358
I'm so sick of house-hunting and packing.

458
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,094
Now I have my own place.

459
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,131
Anyway, Jun-mo...

460
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:34,966
Thank you.

461
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,770
Why are you in such a rush?

462
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,639
Thank me after you move.

463
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:43,808
Jun-mo.

464
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:45,944
Actually...

465
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,580
I have regrets.

466
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:50,582
About what?

467
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,283
About moving into your place.

468
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,354
Coming here and being a hassle.

469
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,323
Not to mention

470
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:02,393
getting drunk and saying things

471
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,263
that made you flustered.

472
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:06,197
All of that.

473
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,667
I'm sorry.

474
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,471
I almost ruined
our 25 years of friendship.

475
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:21,512
I guess I was a bit out of line.

476
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:23,348
Once I move,

477
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,553
everything will go back to how it was.

478
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,956
-Ye-jin.
-Yes?

479
00:31:32,857 --> 00:31:36,494
Let's say we meet different people

480
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,162
and end up marrying them.

481
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:39,597
Okay.

482
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,934
But our spouses

483
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,003
don't approve of our relationship.

484
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,439
Then what will you do?

485
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,746
We're the only ones who know
the history of our relationship.

486
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,416
As for my husband and your wife...

487
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,451
they might not like it.

488
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,421
No, don't you think
they would definitely not like it?

489
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:07,158
If we get married,

490
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,128
do you think we can maintain
this relationship?

491
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,665
So...

492
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,802
are you saying you won't see me
after you get married?

493
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,139
Come on.

494
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,574
We're still going to see each other.

495
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,343
We work at the same company.

496
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,178
Of course, we will still see each other.

497
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:28,980
But...

498
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,351
it won't be like how it is now.

499
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,722
I guess it won't.

500
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,428
But...

501
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,331
I don't like that.

502
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,534
What are you going to do about it?

503
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,337
I guess a line has to be drawn
when it comes to friendship

504
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,305
between a woman and a man.

505
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,746
Hey. Isn't that Cindy?

506
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:08,353
She just got her cast off,
and she's already running like that?

507
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,921
And another thing.

508
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,623
Cindy doesn't usually accept
shows like this.

509
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,226
Your show was her first variety show.

510
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:19,998
I think she's doing
a lot of shows these days.

511
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:15,987
It's delicious!

512
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,256
Yes. It's really delicious.

513
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:19,524
This is good.

514
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:21,092
It's good.

515
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:23,995
It's really tasty.

516
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,698
Yummy.

517
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,070
Yes.

518
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,639
Just a moment.

519
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,709
Cindy.

520
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:40,678
What?

521
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:43,514
The radio phone interview will start

522
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,050
after the commercial break.

523
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,966
Hello?

524
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,302
Cindy, it's good to hear from you.

525
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:07,772
I know you don't usually do
radio phone calls,

526
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,373
but you made time

527
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,212
especially for your beloved junior,
and rising star, Jinie.

528
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,447
-Right.
-Okay.

529
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,850
What is Jinie like? Tell us about her.

530
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,984
Sure.

531
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,386
Jinie is...

532
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,089
very talented.

533
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,391
She's cheerful...

534
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:34,065
This is CEO Byun's usual method.

535
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:35,500
She already did this before.

536
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:38,569
You're right.

537
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,739
You talked about it over drinks
a few years ago.

538
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,176
What was her name again?

539
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,446
Wow, I can't even remember now.

540
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,748
She used to be really popular.

541
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,049
Yun-a.

542
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,352
Right, it was Yun-a.

543
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,258
What did CEO Byun do to Yun-a again?

544
00:36:01,292 --> 00:36:02,360
She was her marketing tool.

545
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:06,864
She used Yun-a who was really popular
back then to promote Pinky4.

546
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,000
That's right.

547
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,936
That's why Pinky4 became really popular.

548
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,337
Cindy as well.

549
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,939
Right before contract renewal,

550
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,807
after working them half to death,

551
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,776
she promotes a fresh new star

552
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,678
and drops the older artist
once they're useless.

553
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,013
That's what CEO Byun does.

554
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,750
But she wouldn't do that to Cindy.

555
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,519
Cindy's a top star.

556
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,421
CEO Byun is crazy if she does that.

557
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:34,992
Besides, even though Cindy
does have a bit of a temper,

558
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:37,295
she's smart.

559
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:42,633
But why did Yun-a do what she did?

560
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,036
What made her go up against CEO Byun?

561
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,338
Weren't you close with her?

562
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,044
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

563
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,684
Things were just
starting to get interesting,

564
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,952
and now he's tired?

565
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,760
Let's use Yun-a as the host.

566
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,062
She's the best.

567
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,296
She was the best.

568
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,798
Not anymore.

569
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,634
She has a poor image these days.

570
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,903
She was in a loan commercial recently.

571
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,238
A lot of people chewed her out.

572
00:37:20,304 --> 00:37:22,006
It's been a while
that people stopped liking her.

573
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,507
She was rumored to be in prostitution.

574
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,409
Even her agency gave up on her.

575
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,478
They probably couldn't manage her.

576
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,180
She's totally washed up.

577
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,748
You know her.

578
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,185
You worked with her on a show.
You know she's not like that.

579
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,487
If people find her unappealing,

580
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,690
we can just make her appealing again
by using the right persona.

581
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:44,028
Why are you doing this? Do you like her?

582
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,197
Come on.

583
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,399
It's not like that.

584
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,569
Tae-ho, we're producers.

585
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:54,305
She didn't do anything wrong,
yet she's suffering.

586
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,773
Why can't we do anything for her?

587
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,577
Do you think producers
can make all the decisions?

588
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:03,180
Viewers don't want to see her.
They won't watch her shows.

589
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,616
What can we do
if we go against the viewers?

590
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:07,652
I'll take responsibility!

591
00:38:07,718 --> 00:38:09,520
How can you?

592
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,056
What if people talk badly about the show
because she's a cast member?

593
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,359
Is it okay if your sense of justice
ruins a show?

594
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,264
None of the three major networks use her,
so why would we take that bullet?

595
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,806
Producer, do you promise to watch over me?

596
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,208
Of course. Just trust me.

597
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,810
I'll take responsibility.

598
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:57,702
Excuse me.

599
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:58,969
Yes?

600
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:01,639
The person who works here...

601
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:05,343
She couldn't make it today,
so that's why I'm here.

602
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,945
I see. Welcome.

603
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,889
I feel like I forgot something.
What could it be?

604
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:22,893
Oh, no.

605
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,395
Goodness.

606
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,034
My phone. I must have lost my mind.

607
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,802
What should I do? I'm already late.

608
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,204
TURN LEFT ON PEDESTRIAN CROSSING

609
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:45,015
-Excuse me, miss.
-Yes?

610
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:46,417
Goodness.

611
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,119
We've met before.

612
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,955
Oh, that's right.

613
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,258
Go ahead. What is it?

614
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,827
Don't you know that we park facing forward
at this apartment complex?

615
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,696
You will need to park your car again.

616
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,165
Oh, I forgot.

617
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,967
I'll do that. From now on.

618
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:04,402
From now on?

619
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,737
I want you to do it now.

620
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,840
But right now,

621
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:13,244
I just need to get something real quick
from my place.

622
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,748
I'm just going to get that,
pull my car out, and leave again.

623
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:19,750
There's no need to park again.

624
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,853
This isn't for my own benefit.

625
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,524
This is for the stability and order
of this apartment complex.

626
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,794
The exhaust fumes are bad for the flowers.

627
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,396
What if you were one of those plants?

628
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:33,664
Wouldn't you be unhappy?

629
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:36,066
You're right.

630
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:40,771
I truly apologize
for not thinking about the plants.

631
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,742
And I promise to try my best
to maintain stability and order

632
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,844
of this apartment complex.

633
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,549
But for now, I'm going to get my stuff
and pull my car out right after.

634
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,250
I do feel bad for the plants.

635
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:56,620
I'm sorry, but I don't believe you.

636
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,858
Then should I sign an agreement?

637
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:04,795
Don't just think of the plants.

638
00:41:04,862 --> 00:41:08,132
Can't you think of your fellow
apartment resident too?

639
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,433
Mom.

640
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,469
Hey, Seung-chan, my son.

641
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,471
Producer Tak.

642
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:14,605
Oh, my God!

643
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:18,042
Hey, Seung-chan.

644
00:41:22,546 --> 00:41:23,380
Mom.

645
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,584
This is my senior colleague,
Producer Tak Ye-jin.

646
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,787
Producer Tak, this is my mom.

647
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,090
Hello, ma'am.

648
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,593
Oh, my goodness.

649
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:39,663
I didn't know you were
my son's senior colleague.

650
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,266
Goodness, I was way out of line.

651
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,334
Oh, no.

652
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,436
And not just once, but twice.

653
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,204
No, no! It's okay!

654
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:49,707
Just a second. I'll pull my car out now.

655
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,175
I should've parked facing forward.

656
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,576
I'm so sorry! I must be crazy!

657
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,812
-I'm sorry! Let me pull my car out...
-No, don't!

658
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,348
Please don't! You don't have to!

659
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,350
I can't believe myself...

660
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,452
I'm not even the manager
of this apartment complex--

661
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,320
No, that's okay.

662
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,756
You said you would
pull your car out right away!

663
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,792
I'm usually very trusting of people!

664
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,096
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't be.

665
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,598
Please help my son at work.

666
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:19,470
No, it's okay! He's doing very well.

667
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,180
I was so shocked earlier.
My legs are still shaking.

668
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,884
Would you like me to drive?

669
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,286
No, it's not that bad.

670
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:41,158
My mom is a bit sensitive about recycling,

671
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,628
exhaust fumes, and things like that.

672
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:47,097
She even argues
with our neighbors sometimes.

673
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:52,236
My mom's nickname is Yeouido Busybody.

674
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:55,005
Busybody?

675
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,141
I see.

676
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,146
This is why people
should be nice to everyone.

677
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,716
I have to cure this temper of mine.

678
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:10,821
But when certain situations arise,
I can't help but lose my temper.

679
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:15,025
Anyway, you have to talk
to your mom for me.

680
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:18,562
I wouldn't have talked like that
had I known she was your mom.

681
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,265
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

682
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,803
But why are you going to work today?

683
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,973
Hyeong-geun and the others
took a few days off.

684
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:32,276
It's still a bit...

685
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,080
Why? Because you're the youngest?

686
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:37,848
Yes.

687
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:42,086
But I plan on leaving work early
so I can go to your new apartment

688
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:45,356
since the window sash guy is coming
and so I can help you with your luggage.

689
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,224
Then I should go too.

690
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:48,659
Okay.

691
00:43:49,727 --> 00:43:51,095
But you know,

692
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,498
I'm really thankful for all this,
but I don't know if it's okay

693
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:56,066
to make you do extra work for me.

694
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:01,305
I'm doing this because I want to.

695
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,574
Oh, you like stuff like this?

696
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,676
Moving, interior decorating,
and stuff like that?

697
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,445
No.

698
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,715
It's not that I like that stuff.

699
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,655
I'm doing this because I like you.

700
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:19,323
Really?

701
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,693
Yes.

702
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,397
Then, can you help me tomorrow?

703
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:30,267
It's a Music Bank special,
so there are more performances than usual.

704
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,736
Chang-sik, Jong-hyeon,
and some other guys with free time

705
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,204
are going to help.

706
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:38,308
Okay.

707
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,611
Thanks.

708
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:45,249
The reason why I asked
some of the juniors at work

709
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,787
is because it's your break this week,
so I thought you would want to rest.

710
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,588
That's why I didn't ask you.

711
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,994
You're my favorite junior colleague

712
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:58,829
so that made me feel guilty.

713
00:45:02,566 --> 00:45:03,600
Really?

714
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,036
Yes.

715
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,273
Do you think we just ask juniors
for favors carelessly?

716
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,842
We don't because we feel sorry.

717
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,313
No, I wasn't asking about that.

718
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:21,819
I want to know
if I'm really your favorite.

719
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,187
Didn't you know?

720
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,624
I like you the most
out of all my junior colleagues.

721
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,160
We got really close
in a short amount of time.

722
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,170
What's the deal, Mom?

723
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,473
Where are the green apples
you went out to buy?

724
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,541
I have a craving for green apples.

725
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:49,012
-Forget the green apples. This is bad.
-Why?

726
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,583
-Seung-chan is ruined.
-Why?

727
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:56,420
Do you remember how I got
into that fight over recycling?

728
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:57,921
Oh, the bad neighbor?

729
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,790
Yes, the bad neighbor.

730
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,392
That bad neighbor...

731
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,660
Did she do something bad again?

732
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,996
She's Seung-chan's
immediate senior at work!

733
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:06,930
Really?

734
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,732
My goodness.

735
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:15,739
Mom, you ruined Seung-chan's career
instead of helping him.

736
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:16,907
Right?

737
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,877
But I made another mistake today.

738
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:24,214
I made a huge fuss about her car
being parked the wrong way.

739
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:26,016
He's ruined.

740
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:29,686
That bad neighbor
will take it out on Seung-chan.

741
00:46:30,754 --> 00:46:31,722
I don't know.

742
00:46:32,055 --> 00:46:34,525
She seemed like she had a temper.

743
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:37,628
What if she yells at Seung-chan
because of me?

744
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,799
Jeez, why did she have to be our neighbor?

745
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,336
Didn't you pull an all-nighter at work?

746
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,538
Why did you come out of there?

747
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:51,842
My senior colleague
lives in that building.

748
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,813
I got tired on my way home, so...

749
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,381
Mom.

750
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,049
Back then,

751
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:02,452
didn't Seung-chan say that he slept over
at his senior's house nearby?

752
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:03,554
Maybe it's her!

753
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,823
How could you say that?

754
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,025
This isn't an apartment complex
for employees.

755
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,561
Does he have two seniors
in this neighborhood?

756
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,264
There has to be another senior.

757
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:16,333
I don't think so.

758
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,202
There must be.

759
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:22,039
A male senior.

760
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,947
IN USE BY THE TEAM
OF NEW PROGRAM STAR WARS

761
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,248
Producer Ra, what's up?

762
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,253
So you're doing the new program.

763
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,688
Yes.

764
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,456
But they won't tell me the time slot.

765
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,159
Tae-ho said he would bump
a weak show for us.

766
00:47:44,561 --> 00:47:45,996
-It's our show.
-What?

767
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,265
You guys are getting our time slot.

768
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,067
I see.

769
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,073
Who's on the show?

770
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,709
Casting was hard.

771
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,345
Right? It's hard, right?

772
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,814
So we got Suzy and Taeyang of BIGBANG.

773
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:05,849
I thought you said it was hard.

774
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,218
We barely managed to get them.

775
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,457
Did the shoot go well?

776
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,592
We didn't have time to prepare.

777
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:16,827
I bet you didn't.

778
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:20,931
-It's a new program after all--
-But it's actually really funny.

779
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,800
There were a lot of unexpected incidents.
It's probably because it was unplanned.

780
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:25,269
We're doing the editing meeting now.

781
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,337
Fortunately, I think we can
put together a good show.

782
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,849
But still!

783
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,119
How can you give our meeting room
to the team working on the new program?

784
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,521
You guys are on break.
You won't have meetings.

785
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,455
We will!

786
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,124
We're going to come up
with something great

787
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,825
and really take off.

788
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:51,194
Right. You should.

789
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:54,097
But if you give away our meeting room,

790
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,999
how will we do that?

791
00:48:56,233 --> 00:48:58,168
Have a meeting at a cafe or something.

792
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:00,137
This is more urgent.

793
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:01,772
You should know that.

794
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,109
What kind of name is Star Wars?

795
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:07,744
It's all wrong!

796
00:49:07,811 --> 00:49:09,513
I think it's destined to fail.

797
00:49:09,913 --> 00:49:10,948
Do you think it will flop?

798
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:12,983
Of course!

799
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,620
Weekend variety shows aren't easy to make.

800
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:23,593
Why do you look so pleased?

801
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:27,297
Knowing how inaccurate
your predictions are,

802
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:29,199
what you just said
strangely puts me at ease.

803
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:30,901
You're not helping.

804
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,137
Anyway, Jun-mo,

805
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,974
my advice is, don't keep your guard down.

806
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,709
When a program goes on break,

807
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,511
it gives others the chance
to take that spot.

808
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:44,181
-It's okay.
-It's a great opportunity for them.

809
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,315
Don't try to do everything.

810
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:48,719
If you're careless and think
the show will air as usual,

811
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,456
you will lose your spot.

812
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,462
I'm not losing anything!

813
00:49:58,528 --> 00:49:59,896
That spot is mine!

814
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,698
I'm not going to lose it!

815
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:09,806
Since when did he have
so much passion for his show?

816
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,376
Hey, weren't you going
to eat lunch with me?

817
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,779
This isn't the first time it has happened.

818
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,681
But why are my feelings so mixed up?

819
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:32,195
What's this?

820
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:35,832
You looked tired.
It's red ginseng extract in water.

821
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,534
You drink it.

822
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,338
Should I buy you some coffee then?

823
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,910
Are you happy to be taking a break?

824
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,678
Can't stop smiling, can you?

825
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:55,385
You're loving this, aren't you?
Do you want to go on a permanent break?

826
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,587
No.

827
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,656
My goodness.

828
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,025
What will I do? This is bad.

829
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,408
You still have a long way to go.

830
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:20,644
Listen carefully.

831
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,546
This is very basic stuff.

832
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:23,814
It is?

833
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:27,384
Some producers like program breaks.

834
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:29,519
They are those whose shows
have high viewer ratings.

835
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,054
They're confident.

836
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,057
But for a producer
working on a low-rated show,

837
00:51:34,124 --> 00:51:36,226
program breaks are very nerve-wracking.

838
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,494
It makes them uneasy.

839
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,530
Moreover, if a new program gets scheduled
in their time slot,

840
00:51:41,031 --> 00:51:43,700
it means they are testing the waters.

841
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:46,403
Testing the waters?

842
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,538
How do you think the main producer
will feel about that?

843
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:50,006
Not good.

844
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,109
Uneasy, restless, sad, ashamed...

845
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:54,878
A mixture of various emotions.

846
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,680
But if a newbie on that team

847
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:59,483
always goes to chat with a producer
of another show,

848
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:02,119
goes to her house to help out and stuff.

849
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,988
Now, imagine the main producer found out.
That would be the worst thing ever!

850
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,390
-The worst?
-Of course.

851
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:11,528
It's like sucking up to the rich neighbors
because your parents are poor.

852
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:13,396
I wasn't sucking up.

853
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,899
I really had to help Producer Tak
with something.

854
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,369
This is exactly when
the youngest member is very important.

855
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:22,439
Make your seniors smile,
and don't ruin the mood.

856
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,542
That's what I tried to.

857
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,345
I offered him a drink.
I also tried to smile and talk to him.

858
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,246
What happened?

859
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:33,350
"Are you happy to be taking a break?
Can't stop smiling, can you?

860
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,986
You're loving this, aren't you?
Do you want to go on a permanent break?"

861
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,121
That's what he said.

862
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:43,527
Producer Ra can be like that,
but he's still the main producer.

863
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:46,062
You need to support him
so he doesn't feel alone.

864
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:47,998
Make him feel like
you're always by his side.

865
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:48,965
Camaraderie.

866
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,600
Right.

867
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,971
2015 NEW PROGRAM, STAR WARS
AIR DATE: 16TH JUNE, 2015

868
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,806
But what's that?

869
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,243
Isn't Star Wars the new program?

870
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:03,313
You caught me.

871
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,982
Keep this a secret from Producer Ra.

872
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,619
They asked me for some help.

873
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,954
I'm moonlighting.

874
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:23,400
Tae-ho.

875
00:53:23,767 --> 00:53:26,102
Why didn't Yang-mi show up today?

876
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,837
She's sick.

877
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:33,009
She looks like she's tough as nails.
Did she really get sick?

878
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:34,911
Isn't she lying?

879
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,682
You know, it's the first time
she took a day off

880
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,283
since I started working here.

881
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:48,191
Excuse me.

882
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:50,193
Can I get some A4 paper?

883
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,128
Yes. Take some.

884
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,466
Okay. Thank you.

885
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,074
Can I get some paper?

886
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:05,575
Sure.

887
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,792
-Excuse me!
-Yes?

888
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,361
Can you just give the paper away
like that?

889
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:25,895
She asked for some.

890
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:31,167
But still, you can't just
freely give it away.

891
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,704
If Yang-mi finds out,
she's going to freak out.

892
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,374
Does Yang-mi know about this?

893
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,676
When is she coming back?

894
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,579
How would I know that?

895
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:01,698
Hey.

896
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:05,869
You're Da-jeong's senior, right?

897
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:06,803
Yes.

898
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,708
A producer can't really criticize
how writers choose to dress,

899
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,143
so please try talking to her.

900
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,846
Don't you think that her outfits
are indecent?

901
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,652
Sometimes, I wonder
if she ever feels cold.

902
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:23,820
I tried talking to her.

903
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:25,689
-It's no use.
-Why?

904
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,258
I asked if she doesn't get cold
dressed like that,

905
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,794
and she said she gets hot easily.

906
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:37,701
She gets hot easily? My goodness.

907
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,338
So where did Miss Hotness go?

908
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,175
She went to get the newly printed posters.

909
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:46,743
How many boxes is that?

910
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,678
How can Da-jeong carry all those?

911
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,779
Don't worry.

912
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,782
She's been very popular
ever since the sports meet.

913
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:28,785
Every time we give Da-jeong an errand,

914
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:30,754
they come and do it for her.

915
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:33,957
My goodness.

916
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,960
How can she do that to them?

917
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,496
Imagine their parents' reaction
from seeing this.

918
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,930
Making them work like that...

919
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,033
I don't think that's right.

920
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:48,571
By the way, weren't you worried about
moving into your new place

921
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:50,940
and how the interior needs
a lot of work to do?

922
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,243
Oh, I got someone to take care of it.

923
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,119
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

924
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:04,988
I moved in today.

925
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,489
Oh, I see.

926
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,727
So you already moved in.
I'm moving in next week.

927
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,097
The sash window construction
has been really loud.

928
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:15,498
Get that done during the day.

929
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:17,367
I'm sorry.

930
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,236
The guy is only available at night.

931
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,671
It will be over soon.

932
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:23,273
That won't do.

933
00:57:23,339 --> 00:57:24,441
Get it done tomorrow.

934
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,544
-Excuse me--
-It looks like you're a newlywed couple.

935
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,180
But you need to show manners.

936
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:31,581
Excuse me?

937
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,783
Oh, no. We're not newlyweds.

938
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:34,751
Okay, sir.

939
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,486
We'll be sure to reschedule.

940
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:40,089
Goodbye.

941
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,130
Jeez, what a misunderstanding.

942
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,765
How can he think that we're...

943
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:50,467
My goodness.

944
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:53,436
What a misunderstanding.

945
00:57:57,841 --> 00:58:01,077
Mom, you said it's going to be okay.
Why are you being like this?

946
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:04,080
No, I keep getting a bad feeling.

947
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:07,450
I think the bad neighbor

948
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,386
will fall for Seung-chan

949
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,056
and will try to seduce him.

950
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,358
No, I don't think so.

951
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,030
It's all my fault!

952
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:25,268
Why did I have to have
such a wonderful son?

953
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,038
I must have prayed too hard
when I was pregnant.

954
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,074
Look at Seung-chan.

955
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,543
He looks like royalty...

956
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,179
Producer Tak!

957
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:40,283
I wiped down the air conditioner fan
since it's not included in the cleaning.

958
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,655
He's also very smart.

959
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,526
He really is smart and good at studying.

960
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:50,860
You have to memorize these.

961
00:58:51,394 --> 00:58:52,495
Don't get them confused.

962
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,464
The yellow one is for the bathroom.

963
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,034
This special material
will eliminate humidity and dust.

964
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,302
The blue one is for wood floors.

965
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,105
There's some wax on it
so it won't cause damage.

966
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:03,373
And this is for furniture.

967
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:05,675
This is a dishrag for the sink.
This is for the veranda windows.

968
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:06,809
This is to wipe down the sofa.

969
00:59:07,176 --> 00:59:09,245
How did you memorize all this?

970
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,216
You're amazing, Seung-chan!

971
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,322
And he has perseverance.

972
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,592
He's high-spirited and extremely tenacious

973
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:26,696
that everyone in the neighborhood
said he can become a president.

974
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,099
Hey, I think you can stop now.

975
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,101
No. It can go further.

976
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,787
Wow, you mixed it up so well.

977
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,692
That's why girls love him

978
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,827
even though he's not interested in them.

979
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,164
He still only cares about me.

980
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,799
Oh, please.

981
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:06,736
You've been telling him for a month
to move the couch,

982
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,238
but he's been too busy to help.

983
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,206
Forget it.

984
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,042
I can ask your father
or Yeong-chan for labor.

985
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,378
Seung-chan wouldn't know
how to do such stuff.

986
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:21,417
Isn't it past the time for an open house?

987
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,286
You're right.

988
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,922
Nobody should know the passcode.

989
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:29,959
Jun-mo!

990
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,263
Sit.

991
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,000
What are you two doing?

992
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:42,839
We moved my stuff into the small room
and cleaned the air conditioner fan.

993
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:46,009
-This and that.
-There's still no sofa.

994
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,110
Please sit here.

995
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:50,813
My goodness.

996
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,586
-Here.
-Oh, my.

997
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,355
This is what I needed the most.

998
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:01,758
I get a lot of mosquito bites.

999
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,327
They only bite me
even when I'm with other people.

1000
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:11,768
Producer Ra,
how did you know the passcode?

1001
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,238
Producer Tak said she only told me.

1002
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:16,939
Did I tell it to you?

1003
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,508
You didn't have to tell me.

1004
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:20,109
It's either your birthday or mine.

1005
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:22,779
It was my birthday, 0520.

1006
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:27,817
Is 0520

1007
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,919
Producer Ra's birthday?

1008
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:31,154
Yes.

1009
01:01:32,088 --> 01:01:34,257
-Eat up.
-I already ate.

1010
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,760
It's a nice place.

1011
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,563
-It is, right?
-Yes.

1012
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,865
The ceiling is high too.

1013
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,835
-They're 5cm higher.
-Is that so?

1014
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,180
Where are you all going?

1015
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,349
Ko Yang-mi is back.

1016
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,319
She said to bring back
all the paper we took.

1017
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:05,188
She's flipping out.

1018
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,426
What? She's back?

1019
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:13,730
Looks like it will be a pain in the butt.

1020
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:19,035
How can I lose everything in a few days?

1021
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:20,269
Bring them all back now.

1022
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,373
I'm sorry.

1023
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:27,243
Jeez, these people...

1024
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,446
Hong-sun, how many reams of paper
did you take?

1025
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,347
Excuse me?

1026
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:34,283
Just one.

1027
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:36,686
I really took one.

1028
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:38,554
Oh, my god.

1029
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:41,190
Bring it back now.

1030
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:42,658
But I only took one...

1031
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,061
I'm disappointed in you.

1032
01:02:46,562 --> 01:02:47,396
Yes, ma'am.

1033
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,300
There are always people like this.

1034
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:55,404
Da-jeong, get it together.

1035
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,407
Don't just stare at your phone.
We have a big performance today.

1036
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:01,310
-Is the pre-recording done?
-Yes.

1037
01:03:01,377 --> 01:03:03,246
How is it looking? Are the cameras ready?

1038
01:03:03,312 --> 01:03:05,314
Yes. One, two, three.

1039
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:06,249
They're all good.

1040
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,018
Producer Baek.

1041
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,623
Yes?

1042
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:18,060
Check if the back entrance is open.

1043
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,129
I think light is coming through there.

1044
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,064
Okay, Producer Tak.

1045
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,001
Are we ready?

1046
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,105
Producer Baek.

1047
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,974
Tell me when Cindy is on standby.

1048
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,576
I'll go check now.

1049
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:41,651
Producer...

1050
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:43,486
Why are you here?

1051
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,321
I have a break this week.

1052
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,490
I'm on the floor for today's special.

1053
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,927
Cindy, the umbrella producer...

1054
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:56,632
Producer Baek is here.

1055
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:01,437
Am I on standby?

1056
01:04:03,606 --> 01:04:04,974
Two teams are left.

1057
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,076
Fix my makeup.

1058
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,001
Here you are, Cindy.

1059
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:38,207
Newbie producer,
I run into you everywhere.

1060
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,876
Jinie, say hello.

1061
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:42,545
This newbie variety producer
is Baek Seung-chan.

1062
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,982
Hello, I'm a rookie singer,
and my name is Jinie.

1063
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:47,283
I look forward to working with you.

1064
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,453
I'm raising her to be the next Cindy.

1065
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:55,191
Please help her a lot, Producer Baek.

1066
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:56,692
Yes.

1067
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,562
Jinie, go sit next to Cindy.

1068
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:01,597
Don't sit down.

1069
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,003
Cindy.

1070
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,372
I want to use this dressing room alone.

1071
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,842
Find another dressing room for the rookie.

1072
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,012
Well, there is another room.

1073
01:05:16,979 --> 01:05:18,281
Why are you doing this?

1074
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,383
Why are you doing this, ma'am?

1075
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,385
Don't you know me?

1076
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,022
I haven't shared a dressing room in years.

1077
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:31,260
Jinie isn't a stranger.

1078
01:05:31,494 --> 01:05:34,630
She's the next Cindy.
She's like your other half.

1079
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,565
Just like Yun-a was?

1080
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,306
I was Yun-a's other half.

1081
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:46,375
I was the next Yun-a.

1082
01:05:49,078 --> 01:05:50,413
Now, Yun-a is gone.

1083
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,649
There's only Cindy.

1084
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:02,158
Get out.

1085
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:04,160
I don't know you.

1086
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:07,430
Don't go around saying
you're the next Cindy.

1087
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:10,700
You seem to be confused.

1088
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:13,636
The name Cindy isn't yours.

1089
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:18,040
Whether I make the next Cindy or not,
you have no rights.

1090
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:19,008
Why you ask?

1091
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:22,878
Because your image was made.

1092
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,580
I'm the one who made you.

1093
01:06:32,855 --> 01:06:33,889
Newbie producer.

1094
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,025
Why are you still here?

1095
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:42,598
Well...

1096
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:46,435
I think I better get you
another dressing room.

1097
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,238
Things seem tense in here,

1098
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:51,574
and you will just be
uncomfortable here, ma'am.

1099
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,210
I'll take you somewhere else.

1100
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,752
Let's go, Jinie.

1101
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:25,908
It's here.

1102
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,277
It's big enough,
so many people can use it.

1103
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:33,649
COMEDIANS' ROOM

1104
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,554
Can we share this room?

1105
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:40,923
The comedians' room is a bit cramped...

1106
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,527
Oh, come on in!

1107
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,595
-Come on in!
-Quick!

1108
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,398
-Please come in!
-Please.

1109
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:50,966
This way, please.

1110
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:55,971
It's spacious. Please come in.

1111
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,574
Tell them ahead of time to keep it short.

1112
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,544
You get what I mean, right?

1113
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,551
Get wide camera angles.

1114
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:10,186
It has to be controlled.

1115
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,754
-Hello, Producer Tak.
-Get the long shots.

1116
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,056
Our CEO is here.

1117
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,324
Oh, right.

1118
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,326
Hello again.

1119
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,728
I came today
because it's an important day.

1120
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:23,165
Right, it's Cindy's
last performance today.

1121
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,534
She's a prime candidate for first place.

1122
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:27,570
How can she win with two songs
from one album,

1123
01:08:27,636 --> 01:08:31,240
one dance song and one ballad song?

1124
01:08:31,674 --> 01:08:33,576
Cindy, you're amazing.

1125
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,312
What are you doing, Jinie? Say hello.

1126
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,815
This is the producer for Music Bank,
Producer Tak Ye-jin.

1127
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:41,517
Hello, Producer Tak.

1128
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:42,918
I'm a rookie singer. My name is Jinie.

1129
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:44,687
I see. You're pretty.

1130
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,255
Producer Tak, have some lunch.

1131
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:47,590
Oh, thank you.

1132
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,092
Thank you.

1133
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,564
Do a good job.

1134
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,401
If you want to become like Cindy,
you really have to work hard.

1135
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,303
Yes. Thank you.

1136
01:09:01,737 --> 01:09:04,707
Please make Jinie look good.

1137
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:07,109
I can tell the difference

1138
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:09,612
when I watch music shows
from the three major networks.

1139
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,848
I can tell which producer
worked on which show.

1140
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:14,149
I see.

1141
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:16,218
You can tell that?

1142
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,654
Yes, I can tell
after watching several times.

1143
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:22,625
I can also tell what affects
the quality of a performance.

1144
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,460
And what is that?

1145
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:27,496
The producer's care and attention.

1146
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:31,100
"Does this producer care for this singer?

1147
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:33,769
Are they giving them extra attention?"

1148
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:37,606
Performances that get
extra care and attention

1149
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:38,807
definitely stand out.

1150
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:40,509
I can see that.

1151
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,812
You can tell how much
the producers care for them?

1152
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,716
So, please give Jinie extra attention.

1153
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,118
It's her debut performance.

1154
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:50,953
It's very meaningful.

1155
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,256
She will be watching this footage

1156
01:09:54,323 --> 01:09:56,158
over and over.

1157
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:58,460
I see, CEO Byun.

1158
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:04,099
But the most important performance to me,

1159
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,404
and the one that I'll be giving
extra care and attention to

1160
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,707
is not the next Cindy's.

1161
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,976
It's just Cindy.

1162
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,580
This is Cindy's last performance
for this album.

1163
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,516
Cindy, break a leg!

1164
01:10:28,924 --> 01:10:29,858
How are we doing on time?

1165
01:10:29,925 --> 01:10:31,560
A bit over. By around a minute.

1166
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:32,761
Let's do this then.

1167
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,029
The last song is over.

1168
01:10:34,096 --> 01:10:35,231
Host, standby...

1169
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:37,499
Ready, and action.

1170
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:42,771
This is the live broadcast of Music Bank
for the second week of June 2015.

1171
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,708
We need to reveal the first-place winner,
so give Cindy a signal.

1172
01:10:45,774 --> 01:10:48,010
She should say a few words
after winning first place.

1173
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:51,547
All Cindy ever says is, "Thank you."

1174
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:53,616
That's true.

1175
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:56,352
She never cries no matter
how many times she wins.

1176
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:57,953
K.Will and Cindy.

1177
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:00,089
Who will win first place this week?

1178
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:01,724
Please reveal the scores.

1179
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,926
The digital single scores,
viewer preference scores,

1180
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,494
episodes aired scores, album scores...

1181
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,029
Who wins first place?

1182
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,897
CINDY VS K.WILL

1183
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:10,032
Congratulations!

1184
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,368
Cindy's "Heart" won first place this week.

1185
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:14,036
-One, cut.
-Would you like to say a few words?

1186
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,038
Prepare the music. Let's go.

1187
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:19,975
Thank you.

1188
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,378
And...

1189
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:24,179
The award I'm receiving today

1190
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:27,116
is very meaningful to me.

1191
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:30,686
I'm thankful to a lot of people.

1192
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,088
And I want to tell them

1193
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:37,159
how I feel right now.

1194
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:38,427
What's with her?

1195
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,630
Didn't you signal her
that we're short on time?

1196
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:43,299
First...

1197
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,403
I want to thank the Pinky4 members.

1198
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:50,739
I also want to apologize.

1199
01:11:56,345 --> 01:11:58,380
I've never said this before,

1200
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:00,716
but...

1201
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,453
I really liked

1202
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:07,323
you girls.

1203
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,959
Hey, cut her off,
or she won't have time for her song.

1204
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:13,595
And to my parents watching me
from up above...

1205
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:17,733
I miss you,

1206
01:12:18,434 --> 01:12:19,635
and I love you.

1207
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:25,140
I wanted to say that, and...

1208
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:27,443
Goodness, what's gotten into her?

1209
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:30,679
While at it, she might even start thanking
her grade school teacher, don't you think?

1210
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,348
Hey, cut her off!

1211
01:12:32,414 --> 01:12:34,683
-Or play her song.
-Producer Tak Ye-jin.

1212
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:36,318
Wait.

1213
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:39,054
I've made a lot of mistakes

1214
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,191
and you complained a lot
but still showed me kindness.

1215
01:12:45,094 --> 01:12:46,462
I'm really thankful for that.

1216
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,030
Gosh, this girl.

1217
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:50,599
So she knows she was difficult.

1218
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:53,268
I also want to thank Producer Ra
of Two Days and One Night.

1219
01:12:53,335 --> 01:12:55,871
We don't need to hear this.
Hey, cut her off.

1220
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:58,874
Hey, Seung-chan. Tell her to finish.

1221
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,627
Lastly...

1222
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:25,200
Lastly...

1223
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:37,880
To the one who became my umbrella
when I was standing alone in the rain...

1224
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:43,685
thank you.

1225
01:13:46,054 --> 01:13:47,122
Thanks to you,

1226
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:51,660
I felt so much warmth.

1227
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,537
I just wanted you to know.

1228
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:21,623
When I break into a smile, it's you

1229
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:26,695
When my heart flutters, it's you

1230
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:31,834
When I'm lost in thought, it's you

1231
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:38,173
When there's an echo from within, it's you

1232
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,610
When I see you

1233
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:45,547
I let out a sigh

1234
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:50,285
And perhaps that is why

1235
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:54,389
It hurts

1236
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:01,830
You don't have to reciprocate

1237
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:06,168
You don't have to come to me

1238
01:15:17,713 --> 01:15:19,414
Do you think Cindy will be okay
from now on?

1239
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:22,117
I heard CEO Byun
is bringing in a newbie again.

1240
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,219
You might have to change cast members.

1241
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:57,319
PRODUCER RA, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

1242
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,254
I'LL BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT BEING MY FAN FOREVER.

1243
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,155
THANK YOU! FROM YUN-A

1244
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:22,311
09. UNDERSTANDING PROGRAM BREAKS

1245
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,746
A BATTLE BETWEEN THE FAMILIAR AND THE NEW

1246
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,118
One more time.

1247
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:07,055
Hello?

1248
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:09,157
I'm on my way home.

1249
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:10,759
Where?

1250
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,362
I'm at the road going toward
the apartment's side door.

1251
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:14,896
Yes.

1252
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,399
-Hey.
-Hey.

1253
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,034
-Did you come from work?
-Yes.

1254
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:20,936
Who was that?

1255
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,372
Seung-chan. He asked me where I was.

1256
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:28,744
You got some days off
for the program break,

1257
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,413
so why were you working late?

1258
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,849
I watched the new program.

1259
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:35,283
Star Wars.

1260
01:17:35,851 --> 01:17:37,219
Oh, that...

1261
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,389
The one in your time slot? How was it?

1262
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,692
It was good. It was funny and fresh.

1263
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:45,193
Really?

1264
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:48,063
-What will you do?
-What do you think?

1265
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:50,432
Should I be uneasy?

1266
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,802
Two Days and One Night
has run a long time.

1267
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:57,606
And things haven't been good lately
compared to the previous seasons.

1268
01:17:58,273 --> 01:18:01,843
If a really good new show comes out,
you should be uneasy.

1269
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:05,247
-You think so?
-Yes.

1270
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:07,949
You should've talked to
Tae-ho or the chief director

1271
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,751
to prevent this program break.

1272
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:14,056
You haven't even been on air that long,
and now you'll be compared to them.

1273
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:17,359
Yes, you're right.

1274
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:22,164
A program break
is a good chance for someone,

1275
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:24,299
but it spells trouble for me.

1276
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:29,938
Why are you so serious?

1277
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,874
Was the new show that good?
Was it amazing?

1278
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:41,983
-Ye-jin.
-Yes?

1279
01:18:44,186 --> 01:18:45,921
Your apartment

1280
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,523
is a model house,

1281
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,394
so you didn't pay much
for the interior, right?

1282
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,063
This is random.

1283
01:18:55,597 --> 01:18:56,698
Yes. That's right.

1284
01:18:58,333 --> 01:18:59,401
You should

1285
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:01,937
put it up for lease.

1286
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:03,905
What?

1287
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,042
Why? Why would I do that?

1288
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:12,414
Because I don't want you to move in there.

1289
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:17,119
Why not?

1290
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,454
Do I have to spell it out for you?

1291
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:25,026
Just stay at my place.

1292
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:28,029
I don't like it

1293
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:30,265
that you're leaving.

1294
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:31,893
I'm taking the photo.

1295
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,428
One, two...

1296
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,861
I think you dropped this.

1297
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,397
You're a nice kid.

1298
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,500
Keep it.

1299
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:46,534
I had to stop by the house...

1300
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:48,770
I can't pronounce it.

1301
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:51,907
I had to stop by...

1302
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:53,942
Stop by...

1303
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:55,644
I had to stop by the house.

1304
01:21:57,545 --> 01:21:58,413
I'm sorry.

1305
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:02,350
I had to stop by the house,
and I wanted to tell you something.

1306
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,286
What is it?

1307
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,322
Producer Tak, about that night...

1308
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:11,192
you don't have to worry about it.

1309
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:13,428
I'm sorry. I said all my lines.

1310
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,430
Who made this?

1311
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,599
What do you mean? Of course, I made it.

1312
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:21,436
It's really good.

1313
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:23,471
I'm sorry.

1314
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,876
It looks like it tastes bad.

1315
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:28,877
It tastes bad.

1316
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,313
When I asked earlier,
you said you don't have lentils,

1317
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,049
quinoa, or feta cheese.

1318
01:22:34,749 --> 01:22:35,617
Feta...

1319
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:36,584
Chia seeds.

1320
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,220
Anyway, Len...

1321
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:40,622
I'm sorry.

1322
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:45,260
You don't have lentils,
chia seeds, or quinoa.

1323
01:22:45,860 --> 01:22:46,695
Chia...

1324
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,397
I'm sorry!

1325
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:50,699
-Feta cheese.
-It's okay.

1326
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:52,067
This always happens to us.

1327
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,669
Oh, she went to the auto shop.

1328
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,671
She had to get her car fixed.

1329
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:58,807
-Auto shop--
-When she's done...

1330
01:22:58,873 --> 01:23:00,008
I'm really sorry.

1331
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:01,710
Wait until I finish.

1332
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:02,877
I'm really sorry.

1333
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,449
A person shouldn't be a sloppy drunk.

1334
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:11,519
Ye-jin doesn't have...

1335
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:16,624
A person shouldn't be a sloppy drunk.

1336
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,026
Stop laughing at me...

1337
01:23:18,093 --> 01:23:18,927
Look over there.

1338
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:20,261
I want a second round of drinks.

1339
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,330
I want live octopus.

1340
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,665
How about getting some air?

1341
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:25,633
A second round. This way?

1342
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:27,235
I don't want to go to the roof.

1343
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:28,403
This isn't the roof.

1344
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,872
I don't want to go there!

1345
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,678
Ye-jin wants to go home!

1346
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,382
I'm sorry.

1347
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,984
Seung-chan, why are you doing this?

1348
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,052
Why are you doing this?

1349
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:46,321
-Did you just laugh at me?
-No.

1350
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,056
Why are you doing this to me?

1351
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,162
I cooked for you, I did the cleaning...

1352
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:56,765
Things were perfect for you,
but now that I'm leaving,

1353
01:23:56,831 --> 01:23:58,099
you're having second thoughts.

1354
01:23:58,166 --> 01:23:59,501
What a jerk.

1355
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:01,803
She's so dense.

1356
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,139
Just you wait and see
how great the preview will turn out.

1357
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,475
It'll be moving and sidesplitting
that it will make them think,

1358
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,444
"Man! I had better not miss it!"

1359
01:24:09,511 --> 01:24:11,246
These are terrible lines.

1360
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:13,081
-Who wrote this?
-The umbrella producer.

1361
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,850
You'll probably start seeing things.

1362
01:24:15,917 --> 01:24:17,786
They call it "first edit syndrome."

1363
01:24:17,852 --> 01:24:18,953
Don't be too surprised.
