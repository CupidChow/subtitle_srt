1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,190
Menu of the day. Morning Set: A) Americano+Egg+Hotcake,
B)Cafe latte+toast+Kiwi or blueberry, Brunch Set: C)Basil pesto sandwich+fruit salad, D)Beef & cheese sandwich+Chicken salad

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,420
My father always said,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,700
make the second thing you like most as your job

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,740
and leave the thing you like most as your hobby.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,720
Episode 2

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,960
That is why his job is a lawyer who specializes in criminal suits,

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,980
and his second job is a cafe owner.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,890
Because his "after service" care overflows through
both of his occupation.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,060
The cafe below our house has been overflowing with ex-convicts.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,210
Among the criminals whom my father defended,

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,190
many have become his fans.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,690
These fans find my father after they are released from prison,

13
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,160
and ask for meals and settle down seeking job help.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,700
So, they have become my friends.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,300
My friends have taught me a lot.

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,440
Things that you cannot ever learn in school.

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,790
- Good job!
- Yes!

18
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,860
Amazing!

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,960
Hello, Ajussi.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,330
Oh, is that you Yeong Sin?

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:26,570
Ajussi.

22
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,610
You came early.

23
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,720
It's clean, right?

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,790
- What?
- Here.
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,540
What's wrong here? It's clean.
♬  can shine all night long tonight ♬

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,960
Hurry, Hurry!
♬ But I only have eyes for you  ♬

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,940
What? ... Hey!
♬  and I'm home ♬

28
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,890
Ah! Seriously.

29
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,520
Hey! Wait, one more bite.
♬ When you hold me tight ♬

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,240
Here, how is it?

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,870
The title is "One summer night's flower."

32
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,590
From retired gangsters, felons, and con artists,

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,480
I have also learned a most important skill: gam.
(Gam: feeling, sixth sense)

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,600
As if I have another pair of eyes on the back of my head,

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,500
I need to be able to tell when someone is staring at me without turning around

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,280
so that I can run away.

37
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,240
Be sure to pull accurately so you don't have to do it twice.

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,030
Like last time, don't just bring back a few pieces of hair
without even a trace of the hair-root.

39
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,120
The best way would be to draw her blood

40
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,120
or open her mouth and scrub it
with a cotton swab (for oral mucosa cell).

41
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,690
But that would be difficult even for you, right?

42
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,560
What do you mean late? I'm already at the office.

43
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,960
What do you mean where? I'm already in the field.

44
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,550
A reporter goes to the field, where else?

45
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,230
Director, I haven't slept for the past two days.

46
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,060
Thanks to the all night undercover work, my skin is pea-green,
dark circle is down to my chin.

47
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,360
My hair is so oily that I can't even hide it.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,390
What should I do?

49
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,420
Even so, there are guys who chase after me every street I turn.

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,860
I am just attractive, huh?

51
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,000
I think she knows that you're following her.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,380
This girl is really quick in catching on. So annoying.

53
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,700
Oh! So annoying. If only I could just drag her to a secluded alley and draw her blood.

54
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,540
The bag.

55
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,600
The bag looks as if she might have her toothbrush or hair brush inside.

56
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,460
Bringing back a toothbrush or a comb would do.

57
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,540
Now.

58
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,630
- Are you alright?
- Yes, yes.

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,460
Ahjusshi, should have been careful. Look at what you did!

60
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,150
How will I sell them with all of these bruised?!

61
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,100
You should have watched where you were going!

62
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,540
No, something just flew into...

63
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,720
I can't sell them since they're all split and bruised!
What are you going to do about it?!

64
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,710
Oh no...

65
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,780
No, somebody...

66
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,980
No comb or anything like that.

67
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,880
Seriously, what's with this woman?

68
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,690
You thief! That's my bag isn't it!?

69
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,900
And you're a thief.

70
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,560
Yes, I found him. We're at the Men's bathroom
on the 2nd floor of Dongshim building.

71
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
Where?

72
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:16,760
I've trapped him inside, so come quickly and arrest him.

73
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,910
Isn't there a policeman on watch around the area?

74
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,160
Be quiet.

75
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,300
- That...
- Shhh.

76
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,860
It hurts.

77
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,080
Dad.

78
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,350
If you move, you'll get hurt.

79
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,400
From now on, don't just chase after someone without fear.

80
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,550
You can truly die like that.

81
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,870
Hyung, long time no see!

82
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,250
Hyung, Take a look at my Benny. Doesn't my ride look different?

83
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,450
I spend a hundred and had it tuned up. What do you think?

84
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,930
Killer, ain't it?

85
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:52,390
Hyung, since I tuned up my Benny like this

86
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:56,370
can't you convince our boss?

87
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,760
Even though I'm not as heavyweight as you,

88
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,420
I could do the jobs that are easier.

89
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,160
You know that I can do more than just delivery.

90
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,230
Tell her to try me at least once.

91
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,090
Take a look and see how well I'm doing and if it's okay...
Ouch.

92
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,920
A simple case. Huh? Please? Ouch!

93
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,580
Drive safely.

94
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,580
Hyung! Hyung!

95
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,020
Ah! Seriously... oh!

96
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,170
Locker 08
Code 0808

97
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,670
Oh, Reporter Kim, hello.

98
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,390
Hello.

99
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,070
Where have you been?

100
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,190
Oh...

101
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,870
There.

102
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,900
Soosun Company called. You've been meeting retired workers.

103
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,070
Me?

104
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,750
Don't do it. It won't work. Nothing will be broadcast.

105
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,830
It is super interesting! You would also...

106
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,750
I mean, Director Kang, it'll totally entice you.

107
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,160
Have you any idea how many of Soosun Industry's advertising
we get (to fund our programs)?

108
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,560
Do you know how much that's worth in cash?

109
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
- You get paid with that money too.
- I know.

110
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,510
I always am thankful for it.

111
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,720
You know the station is having financial troubles.

112
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,500
It's different from before. Getting one commercial is eve...

113
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,240
It's strange...

114
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,470
Why is the special report director worried about commercial contracts?

115
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,850
There are many competent workers in the commercial department.

116
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,410
Let them do their jobs. You're overstepping your bounds!

117
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,190
I have chased this for over three months.

118
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,040
If you just give me some time, I can talk for 3 hours!

119
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,900
- I have a scene set out and interviews!
- Are you so enveloped in your fame?

120
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,010
I know that every time you have a broadcast, the SNS and internet are buzzing.

121
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:11,840
"Modern age's progressive reporter, the reporter who speaks for the weak,"

122
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,000
and he is even handsome.

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,820
Since you have more fans and get more applause, you're losing your true focus.

124
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,810
Fame is an addiction. Right now, you're losing.

125
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,180
- I'm addicted to fame?
- Yes.

126
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,970
You can't control it yourself.

127
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,860
Every day, you want a bigger round of applause.

128
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,870
The people in the crowd who are applauding now will easily discard you for a little matter someday.

129
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,720
- Very easily.
- Do you think they'll just discard me?

130
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,200
They'll rip me apart and stamp out my existence.

131
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,080
- Kim Moon Ho...
- I'll do it until then.

132
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,420
Until they throw me away. Or else I have nothing else to do.

133
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,640
This is a new jacket.

134
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,820
Did a man catch your fancy?

135
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,320
Why are you getting so pretty?

136
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,530
The ex-boyfriend in me is getting jealous!

137
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,030
Hey...

138
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,030
Sunbae, I printed these after digging through all the files
in the reference library,

139
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,500
but these are the numbers for two years ago.

140
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,950
- And what about last year's?
- I couldn't find anything!

141
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,120
I said last year.

142
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,980
Yes, I'll look again.

143
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,130
- Jong Soo.
- Yes?

144
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,610
Let me ask you a favor.

145
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,090
On your way out, can you drop this by the lab that I asked you before?

146
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,700
You know my friend?

147
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,430
- Again?
- Yes.

148
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,390
There is a comparison sample at the lab already,
so all you need is that.

149
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,550
Sunbae, this DNA test...

150
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,000
I asked you to conduct it in confidence as it is a secret?

151
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,630
Who are you looking for?

152
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,400
Perhaps, Sunbae....

153
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,230
What about me?

154
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,470
It's nothing.

155
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,050
I'm trailing a case.

156
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,990
What?

157
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,570
If I can get a better perspective on it, I'll let you know.

158
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,080
You just promised.

159
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,970
If you go back on your promise, I'll just talk crap everywhere.

160
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,810
- Do you think it'll be alright?
- What?

161
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,910
The upstairs mood is totally chaotic.

162
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,840
Sunbae, I heard it won't go down with just a written apology this time...

163
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,560
- Stats.
- What?

164
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,310
Last year's.

165
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:44,980
Yes.

166
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,080
Noona Myeong Hee /i>

167
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,770
Moon Ho...

168
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:01,210
Do I have to call and ask you to come in order for me to see your face?

169
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,630
Noona, you're exaggerating.

170
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,630
Even if you're busy, let's eat together once a week.

171
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,760
Our famous and busy Reporter Kim.

172
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,950
Here, this is an nagging prevention.

173
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,070
Bimoran!
 (Red top cactus)

174
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,760
I see that the graft was inserted into the stock prettily.

175
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,470
What's the menu? What should I help you with?

176
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,370
Oh, I picked up some porcini mushroom.
I had a nice grade of veal brought in as well.

177
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,850
I'm going to make a wine sauce and put it atop the steak.

178
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,130
Oh, can you wash the salad greens?

179
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,940
Yes.

180
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:51,530
But this smell, tomatoes, cheese, and potatoes being baked thing... this would be?

181
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,900
I'm making you a gratin to take home.

182
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,070
If you reheat it in the microwave, it'll solve one meal at least.

183
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,640
Noona.

184
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,730
- What?
- Let's leave my brother and go to Seoul.

185
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:17,020
I will find a house with a well-equipped kitchen.

186
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,970
Noona...

187
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,450
Stop calling her Noona.

188
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,640
It's already been 20 years, and you still won't call her Sister-in-law?

189
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,850
Leave it be. If he addresses me as sister-in-law, I'll have to address him as brother-in-law.

190
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:39,510
And we also have to use the honorific.

191
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,670
Are you going to sleep over?

192
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,760
I have to leave later.

193
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,740
I have a lot of work to do.

194
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:55,440
I heard that you're marked at the newsroom there?

195
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,150
I am just a little famous right now, so may be the jealous ones are?

196
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,200
I heard you didn't follow the script during a live broadcast, and it wasn't your first time.

197
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,370
Did you have dinner with my company's director?

198
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,680
Write your resignation letter and come to me. I'll give you your own team.

199
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,980
Then you can talk as much as you like without restrictions.

200
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,920
Rather than being the tail of a public TV,
you can be the head of Jong-Pyeon
(a cable TV without any specific genre).

201
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,380
Should I? I mean, getting in through nepotism is an ability as well.

202
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,340
You have to give my wife her medication and let her rest.

203
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:33,140
She's been trying to avoid her medication because she doesn't like being sleepy.

204
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,240
I've given you medication and moved you to your bed. Is there anything else you want?

205
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,930
I want the details on your girlfriend.

206
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,870
Hey... I thought...

207
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,400
You still don't have one?

208
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,930
No, I haven't had one. They're annoying.

209
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,470
No fun.

210
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,500
Leave after I fall asleep, okay?

211
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,550
Okay.

212
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:37,150
This is the hardest part, trying to fall asleep.

213
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,780
I have all these thoughts in my head.

214
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,040
Should I tell you a funny story, so you can't get distracted?

215
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,380
You're not good with funny stories though.

216
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,720
Then should I tell you a serious story? A serious one?

217
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,570
Try me.

218
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,260
Well, there was this Chinese writer.

219
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,950
Give me more of a hint.

220
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,710
Well...

221
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,940
There are people in a sealed room made of steel.

222
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,000
They're all asleep,

223
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,990
and before long, they will all die of asphyxiation.

224
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,370
But one of them woke up.

225
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:20,180
This person, should he wake the rest of the people up

226
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,160
so that all could find a way out together?

227
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,190
Or, since it is a room they can't escape from,

228
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,300
should he let them sleep and die in peace?

229
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:31,350
Since they will only be in despair even if they woke up.

230
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,970
- Right...
- Well...

231
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,920
I think it was a sort of forward, not a novel.

232
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,940
It starts with an N ...

233
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,390
No...

234
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,160
Noshin!
(Lu Xun in Chinese pronunciation)

235
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,930
Noshin, Noshin. Yes.

236
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,970
But, why?

237
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:52,590
Why did you think of that?

238
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,080
Moon Ho, is there something that you aren't telling me?

239
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,550
Hm?

240
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,810
Excuse me, but the world doesn't revolve around you.

241
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,870
But see this here.

242
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,840
The press should be...

243
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,060
When did you loosen your seat belt?

244
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,720
Put it back on!

245
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,390
Did you cry?

246
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,410
Oh you cried because of the spilled milk...
You had to pester your brother for a good while to get it.

247
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,000
Right?

248
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,670
Moon Ho, you can cry.

249
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,610
In front of me, you can cry.

250
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,440
I won't let anyone see.

251
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,710
Shouldn't we get rid of them together?

252
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,240
The Healer is difficult to even meet.

253
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,370
And even if we can somehow meet...

254
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,910
The task is complete.

255
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,440
Here is the item as well.

256
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,270
Did you say he was called Healer?

257
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,580
That guy?

258
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,860
Well, we've caught his ankle, but what should we do?

259
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,360
Shouldn't we get rid of them together?

260
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,880
The Healer is difficult to even meet.

261
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,450
And even if we somehow meet,
it won't be easy to take care of him.

262
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,080
I have heard he has the best skills.

263
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,340
Yes, it's me.

264
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,360
Kim Moon Ho, the results are out.

265
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,730
The fact that you called... What is it?

266
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,250
I can't say without some incentive.

267
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,680
These tests take over a week,

268
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,500
and I do them myself. With my own hands.

269
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,970
Tell me, what is it?

270
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,140
I don't know who this is but congratulations.

271
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:14,440
Is this the fourth? All the samples you've sent so far
have been negative.

272
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,090
It's over 99%. Two samples are of a parent and a child.

273
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,300
They're both female, so it must be mother and daughter.

274
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,920
Kim Moon Ho, are you listening?

275
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,590
Yes...

276
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,560
But this is something to congratulate, right?

277
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm an errand boy.

278
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:47,740
I've done this since I was 20 years old, so I've been doing this for 8 years.

279
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,510
Excuse me.

280
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,110
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

281
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,690
I'm pretty good too.

282
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,180
To be honest, I'm the best in the field,

283
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,910
so I'm a little expensive.

284
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,210
If it doesn't involve killing, I will take on anything.

285
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,350
I don't care about ethics or justice.

286
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:09,760
That is my ethics and justice for my clients.

287
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:16,950
Where the item I stole, then handed over on a client's request,
is used isn't a concern to me.

288
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,400
That is why even when I steal or spy on someone,

289
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,160
you can't really label me as a thief or spy.

290
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,560
As I said, I am just an errand boy.

291
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,550
Connection Pass

292
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,570
Sunbae!

293
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,710
Download Complete

294
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,980
My cellphone has exactly three numbers.

295
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,950
Ajumma, my henchman, and my favorite fried chicken delivery.

296
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,260
Family, colleagues, friends? I don't keep those.

297
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,760
I don't understand why I would need any of them.

298
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,160
Ah, I really don't know.

299
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,410
Now...

300
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,570
Ahjumma

301
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,000
Hello!

302
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,350
Now see here, tell me the truth.

303
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,800
You installed a camera in my house, didn't you?

304
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,760
The only source of enjoyment in your life is to bother me
whenever I try to eat, isn't it?

305
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,190
You can't say that's real food.

306
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,580
Delivery pig's feet and chicken are called just snacks
or a late-night snack.

307
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,990
Wow, you really installed it.

308
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,160
You installed a camera for sure.

309
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,170
This girl must be right.

310
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:51,860
- Was the money deposited?
- I like this client.

311
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:54,490
He deposits fast.

312
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:00,170
Also, this client that I like has requested a second job.

313
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,260
Second what?

314
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:11,920
There are seven items on the list. He asked that we investigate all seven.

315
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,980
And how much did you agree on?

316
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,870
Each question, one small check.
(means "$1,000 per question")

317
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,210
Wow.

318
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,720
What is this?

319
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,990
First, the girl's family and their background.

320
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,680
Whether she was abused as a child or not.

321
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,140
Everything is the same with those new glasses, but there is less battery power.

322
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,940
So don't forget to charge it often.

323
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,870
Welcome! Good morning!

324
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,280
Chae Yeong Sin currently lives with her adoptive father and no one else.

325
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,880
Her father's name is Chae Chi Soo.

326
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,210
She was adopted when she was eight.

327
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,240
Chae Chi Soo was born in 1963 and his occupation is lawyer.

328
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,470
His second job is being a cafe owner.

329
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:32,120
It says that there is a lawyer office inside the cafe.
What does that mean?

330
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,330
Chae Chi Soo
Law Office

331
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,470
Aha.

332
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,370
- Customer?
- Yes?

333
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,540
I'll have the breakfast set.

334
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,570
Which one of the sets?

335
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,770
Ah...that. I'll have the first one. The A set.

336
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,900
A set. That will be 6000 won.

337
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,240
How should I cook the eggs?

338
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,780
Eh?

339
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,570
Fried? Scrambled? Or simply boiled egg?

340
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:12,540
The first one. F-f-fried.

341
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,110
Yes, fried. Okay.

342
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,040
There is a newspaper article here.

343
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:23,150
Chae Chi Soo is famous for taking care of the people whose
cases he defended even after they have been released from prison.

344
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:28,100
Every weekend, he will help his clients teaching them how to be baristas.

345
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,080
Oh! Here are six 1,000 wons.

346
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,380
The background information on the small one who took your order came up.

347
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,390
Three previous criminal records, pick-pocketing and burglary.

348
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,870
The last time he was released from jail was seven years ago,
and since then, he's worked at the cafe.

349
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,140
Then, Chae Yeong Sin's only family relation is her adoptive father,

350
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,340
and her adoptive mother died in 2001.

351
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,030
Dad, I am very depressed today

352
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,570
because of that psycho thief.

353
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,610
I had a nightmare all night and almost kicked the bucket
in my sleep.

354
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,550
Let's not listen to depressing music.

355
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,000
This isn't depressing. It's soft.

356
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:34,390
♬Give me some water♬

357
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,640
♬ Give me some water♬

358
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,360
♬I'm thirsty♬

359
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,820
♬Give me some water♬

360
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:56,890
♬ Water is love, making my throat tickled ♬

361
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,360
♬Teasing me and letting me go out♬

362
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,060
♬I shall leave♬

363
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,550
♬I will leave♬

364
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:20,450
♬Up on that hill and over I will go♬

365
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:30,430
♬If I meet a girl during my travel ♬

366
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:33,790
♬Then I will live♬

367
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,970
♬I will live with her♬

368
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,230
Is there any evidence
that she was abused as a child?

369
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,340
ABSOLUTELY NONE.

370
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,110
♬Give me some water♬

371
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,140
I'm sorry.

372
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,840
Second, find out her job and how well she performs.

373
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,330
What is her working style?

374
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,490
3389, 5425.

375
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:51,870
Where is Lee Joong Bin's car?
It should be around here.

376
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,950
Chae Yeong Sin, her job is Internet newspaper sunday...

377
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:58,560
No, a reporter for Sunday Daily.
What do you think of her capability?

378
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,630
Ahjumma, is that girl really a reporter? Are you sure?

379
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,530
Why?

380
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,480
She looks like an amateur car thief. The first timer even at that.

381
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,620
Look at this,

382
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,230
she doesn't even care about the CCTV or blackbox cameras.

383
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:18,660
She hasn't the notion of them.

384
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,760
E-exc....

385
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,660
Hey! Hey! Hey! Brush your hair. What's with your look?

386
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,630
And put on some lipstick.

387
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:37,530
Aigoo. Jeez.

388
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,970
Lee Joong Bin.

389
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,350
Excuse me, door!

390
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,340
-  The number is incorrect.
- Why won't it work?

391
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,240
Thank you.

392
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,950
Yes! I knew it was the 9th floor! I knew he would get off on the 9th floor.

393
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,110
I knew it. I got you both now.

394
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,720
Fifth floor.

395
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,020
The door will close.

396
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,300
Aren't you getting off?

397
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:36,170
The door is closing.

398
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:42,160
Ninth floor.

399
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,790
The door is closing.

400
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:15,540
I think this girl is skipping work and chasing some guy.

401
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,600
Her actions speaks of her as none other than a stalker.

402
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:24,970
Ajumma, I was watching her from the side, and she gave me goosebumps.

403
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:29,370
I really think girls like her are scarier than serial killers.

404
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,650
I really hate it.

405
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,600
Let's see. If I'm within the 11 meter range,

406
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:38,150
then it won't be the 6th floor. That's right, she got off at the 9th floor.

407
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,920
Do you want me to find out who lives on the ninth floor?

408
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,010
I'm telling you a guy lives there. A very poor guy who's
being pestered by an obsessed stalker girl.

409
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,130
You should at least check out how he's being pestered.

410
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:49,810
Ajumma, do I really have to see such petty things?

411
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:53,480
Only seeing it won't do. We have to have it on camera.

412
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,730
Yes.

413
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,790
Can't believe this is a job.

414
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,200
Who is it?

415
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,900
This is the police patrol.

416
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,520
There was a report of a burglary, and I am on an investigation.

417
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,610
Please open your door for a moment.

418
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,100
Yes, this is Officer Park Yeong Ja. I am at apartment 3 on the ninth floor.

419
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,720
There is a person inside, but she is refusing to cooperate. What should I do?

420
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:31,070
Wait. Let me get dressed.

421
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,680
Going up. Ninth floor.

422
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,370
The door is closing.

423
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,420
Where is that woman?

424
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,790
The bag owner. Did you not see?

425
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,410
There better be something going on.

426
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,590
I was going to get a special... Just my luck.

427
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:28,830
Damn. I'm seriously going crazy.

428
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,430
Excuse me, Unni.

429
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:40,370
Wait!

430
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,690
Excuse me. Unni, uh...

431
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:48,220
I really have something important to say. Please talk with me..

432
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,860
The thing is...

433
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,150
This bag is yours, right?

434
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,940
This looks real nice, and it was left in the elevator.

435
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,210
Oh! Wait, wait! Stop, stop! Wait.

436
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,300
Don't do this. Talk to me.

437
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,150
I don't know what it's about, but I'll listen to it, okay?

438
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:09,980
So please turn around and look at me.

439
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:15,430
Excuse me.

440
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,100
I stood there too

441
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,910
when I was seven years old.

442
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,790
When I was seven,

443
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:29,480
I stood there in your position.

444
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:36,550
Because everyone who knew until then, abandoned me.

445
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:46,170
My mom and my dad, they both threw me away.

446
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:50,910
They said they found me next to a trash can when I was five.

447
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:56,470
And I was sent to five different orphanages.

448
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,730
I was adopted and then sent back,

449
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,190
and was adopted again, but this time I was beaten.

450
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,790
so...

451
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,690
Because it hurt so badly...

452
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:17,120
It hurt so much that I wanted to die.

453
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:25,220
When I was seven, I thought that it wouldn't hurt if I died.

454
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,990
Those were my thoughts.

455
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,690
Do you remember when you were seven?

456
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:39,720
Most people can't remember very well.

457
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,440
But I remember everything clearly.

458
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:52,170
That it was cold like today, in the winter,

459
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,280
and it hurt where I was hit.

460
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,500
You see, several of my ribs were broken,

461
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,320
but I'm

462
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:18,010
not hurt anymore.

463
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,520
Everyone has their moments, but it all passes.

464
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,810
If you just endure it a little, it will pass.

465
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:41,200
Trust me.

466
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:44,400
It really passes.

467
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,270
I...

468
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,170
I've done it before.

469
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,980
Why did you turn it off?

470
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,390
That's enough.

471
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,880
Hey still, the client--

472
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,170
My mom and my dad, they both threw me away.

473
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,690
They said they found me next to a trash can when I was five.

474
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,040
That it was cold like today, in the winter,

475
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,780
and it hurt where I was hit.

476
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,120
Several of my ribs were broken.

477
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,220
Did Noona Myeong Hee lend this to you?

478
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,620
Then I'll wash it then return it to her for you,

479
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:20,220
since it has to be washed clean.

480
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:58,980
No way, what do you mean, "A Kiss the 13th"?

481
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,600
- Look at that. Over there.
- Where? What is it?

482
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,910
Aish, seriously...

483
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,960
- Stop it.
- What?

484
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,690
Stop teasing me.

485
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:14,580
I was just...

486
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,410
Hey, who are you?

487
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,260
Cyber crime investigator? What is a detective doing here?

488
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:13,710
So the victim was thrown off the train passing by that bridge?

489
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:17,290
And no one knows if the victim was alive or dead when thrown off?

490
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:19,830
- How did you know?
- I read the report.

491
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:25,980
According to the report, there was a note found in the victim's pocket. A memo.

492
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,480
Yes. There was.

493
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,150
Can I see it?

494
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,910
Well, we made a report less than two hours ago.

495
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:34,420
How did you come down from Seoul so fast?

496
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,460
It has been two hours and forty minutes. Can I see it?

497
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,890
That bastard.

498
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:50,790
Ah, wait a minute.

499
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,370
This is evidence.

500
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,070
We don't know whether it is suicide or murder, but it may be vital.

501
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:58,730
- Healer.
- Excuse me?

502
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:02,580
This is Healer's email.

503
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,230
I have been chasing this guy for over five years.

504
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,870
You should just let this slide.

505
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,090
healer@moebius.com

506
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:29,080
The client is very satisfied with what we sent him.

507
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,270
He said he doesn't need #5, 6, or 7, but he wants us to find out one more thing.

508
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:35,390
That thing is...

509
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:38,710
Ah, I seriously...

510
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:40,100
What is it?

511
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,700
That... it makes me nauseated... by a lot.

512
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,900
But since the client wants...

513
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,970
- What?
- What are Chae Yeong Sin's dreams?

514
00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:54,020
What is her ardent dream she'd like to achieve?

515
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:56,960
He wants us to find that out.

516
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,830
He must be kidding.

517
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:02,350
I said the same but in cruder words.

518
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,670
Ajumma, you find that out.

519
00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:07,410
Girls do those SNS and blog stuff

520
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,510
and put pictures up online.

521
00:54:10,510 --> 00:54:12,780
She must have written about her dreams somewhere.

522
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:20,330
I told you, she has no SNS, cafe, or blog.

523
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:24,110
Hey, Healer. Do you want to have a blind date with her?

524
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:26,750
Then you could ask her naturally.

525
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,640
Excuse me, what is your dream?

526
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,650
What is your name?

527
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:33,340
What is your phone number?

528
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,820
Ahjumma, please come to your senses.

529
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,730
Healer, what are you going to do?

530
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:54,760
I'm going to do my job. Make money.

531
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,570
What are you looking for?

532
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,530
Her journal or something.

533
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:05,490
Who still writes journals these days?

534
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:17,650
This is the bathroom. Take a bath first if you want.

535
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:20,740
If you open up that cabinet, there are new toothbrushes,
and feel free to use whatever makeup [skincare items] there is.

536
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,430
I'll get you a change of clothes.

537
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,760

CCTV from Love hotel shows unidentified man filmed with Go Seong Cheol

540
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,130
Newer the better, I bet.

541
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:03,130
Where are the new underwear?

542
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:05,770
There were some here somewhere.

543
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,140
Oh, here it is.

544
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:27,150
Hey Healer, you're on the wanted list.

545
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:30,970
Wanted list? I've always been on one.

546
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:34,360
But they're calling you a murder suspect.

547
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,470
- Why?
- The guy Go Seong Cheol is dead.

548
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:44,490
- Why?
- Let's stop working for a while and go under the radar.

549
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:47,180
Get out right now.

550
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,300
What are you doing? Get out quickly.

551
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,690
- This is conflicting...
- What is?

552
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,820
I have to be next to this girl for a bit longer.

553
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,610
What are you saying? You're a murderer on the--

554
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:58,830
You asked to find out about her dream.

555
00:57:58,830 --> 00:58:03,110
That client doesn't want to know just any dream but the real dream.

556
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:08,100
Then I'll have to be right next to her

557
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:11,730
to find out.

558
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,370
Healer Preview

559
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,830
These days, I feel something on the back of my head,

560
00:59:07,830 --> 00:59:09,700
like someone is following me.

561
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:12,000
How does she have my picture?

562
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,860
Is she the lure for my capture?

563
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,750
This is Kim Moon Ho. Do you not know who Kim Moon Ho is?

564
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:19,190
You said your dream is not to be called "Gi-regi".
(a compound word of "Gija (reporter)" and "Ssregi (trash)")

565
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,300
This reporter is hiding this so called victim.

566
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:24,100
That's why this reporter can write so freely.

567
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,060
Investigate the writer. She may be hiding the victim.

568
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,840
I believe in things like fate

569
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,550
Life was mundane, but now it is getting interesting.
