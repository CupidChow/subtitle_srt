00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,540
03/02/1992 Seo Joon Seok Testimony

3
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,270
I've brought the tape.

4
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,290
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.

5
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,540
The testimony is being recorded.

6
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:33,500
March 2, 1992,
Testimony of Seo Joon Seok

7
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,500
- We heard your father's testimony tape.
- What did he say?

8
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,810
Your father, Hyung Joon Seok, wasn't a murder suspect to begin with.

9
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,950
Your father went to the police to report a murder case.

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,450
To testify that his friend Oh Gil Han died
in those bastards' hands.

11
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,210
He went to the police with the evidence pictures he took.

12
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,660
So this tape is a witness' testimony,
not a suspect's testimony.

13
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,660
How those bastards killed Hyung Gil Han,

14
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,160
what those bastards were doing on the scene,

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,330
your father was talking about those.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,050
Jeong Hoo, I think this much is enough.

17
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,370
Just come back, okay?

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,690
This is more than enough to make the broadcast.

19
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,870
What do you think?

20
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,120
Killing my father and making your father a murderer,

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,830
you're asking me what I think about those bastards who totally screwed our lives?

22
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,700
Let's go according to plan. Let's go all the way till the end.

23
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,000
Another lonely death has occurred.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,090
Park Dong Cheol, who got kicked out
of the police station for being a whistle blower,

25
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,800
has kept a cassette tape with him for the last 22 years.

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,250
It was the very cassette tape with Seo Joon Seok's testimony.

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,830
Yeong Sin, throw it!

28
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,440
We suspect that Park Dong Cheol got murdered

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,410
by the people who want to get rid of that tape.

30
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,040
Because the tape with the testimony from 22 years ago, that he gave Someday before he died,

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,000
has an incredible story about them.

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,160
Okay, okay. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

33
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,500
Take me to meet the Elder.

34
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,750
Ah, he lives in a nice place.

35
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,100
Who exactly are "they" who are referred to here?

36
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,260
Our Someday's reporter went to some place
to ask who "they" are.

37
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,050
People usually call him "Elder".

38
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
Hello.

39
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,750
The person whose face you're covering is the Elder, right?

40
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,430
Hello, I'm from Someday News.

41
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,160
Can I ask you a question, Elder?

42
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,060
Ah, I... can't?

43
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,540
These seem to be people working under the Elder!

44
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,160
Wait, let me ask you guys a question.

45
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,490
By any chance, would the Elder order you to beat up those reporters in the middle of a live interview,

46
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:22,450
or whatnot? No, right?

47
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,950
Ah, I'll get scolded if my glasses get damaged. Easy, easy...

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,330
This is Park Bong Soo.

49
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,540
There is also a Someday reporter business card.

50
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,480
Didn't you say you were Healer?

51
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,950
If I say it like that...

52
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,450
They said you're going to meet me.

53
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,910
If you're Healer, I'll give you some of my time to talk,

54
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,190
- If not...
- Y-y-you'll kill me?

55
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,120
I really don't want to die.

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,970
Oh right, but Grandfather, are you the Elder?

57
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,950
The one that scumbags like Oh Tae Won, who goes around killing people, work for?

58
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,120
If you're curious about that, you can just ask.

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,060
Why would you take a picture of my face and
put it on a broadcast?

60
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,220
Ah, that... I have no choice.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,850
The thing is, if something bothers you,

62
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,790
or if they get in your way, you kill them.

63
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,250
But we can't do such things.

64
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,200
This is really unfair.

65
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,580
That's why, I should have at least let your face be known

66
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,600
and put a sign under it,

67
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,660
"Beware of a ferocious dog!"

68
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,090
Do you think people would thank you?

69
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,540
I can't say. I don't really know.

70
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,010
Because this is my first time.

71
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,750
Child.

72
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,110
Who are you?

73
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,870
Among the people someone like you has killed,

74
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,830
there's a person named Seo Joon Seok.

75
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,540
I'm that person's son, Seo Jeong Hoo.

76
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,250
Grandfather, from now on when you kill people

77
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,700
it would be good if you would think about their son or daughter.

78
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:43,040
Up until now, you have never thought of that, have you?

79
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,290
Look here, the video's been cut off during the interview in there.

80
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,390
It is this house.

81
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,500
Just wait a bit.

82
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,220
We also have to get the order from our superiors...

83
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,800
I'm saying that by the time you get that order,

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,160
- it's already--
- Just because we're the police, we can't just enter any house on our whim, Miss!

85
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,480
I'm going crazy.

86
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,410
Our reporter who has gone inside the Elder's house cannot be reached.

87
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,830
Chae Yeong Sin, footage at the Elder's house

88
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,330
Ah, a new video has come in just now.

89
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,890
One of our reporters is in front of the house, filming right now.

90
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:24,620
It also looks like the police have arrived.

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,760
It's been a while since a young person has come to this house like this.

92
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,250
Go ahead and sit down there.

93
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,700
Have a cup.

94
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,950
I don't drink with someone who killed my father.

95
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,450
You're misunderstanding something.

96
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,200
We've never killed anyone.

97
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,120
You've probably ordered for them to be killed.

98
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,800
We are all doing the work to save everyone.

99
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,200
How do I explain this to you?

100
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,700
From before you keep on saying, 'we, we'.

101
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,160
Just exactly how many scumbags like you
are there, Elder?

102
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,810
There is 'us' who look after the people.

103
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,000
There is 'them' who receive our care.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,660
Young man,

105
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,910
which side do you want to be on?

106
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,450
Grandfather, you talk too much.

107
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,030
I thought it's going to be someone with such an incredible aura,

108
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,430
but it turned out to be just a talkative grandpa.

109
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,990
I'm telling you that I like you a lot, young one.

110
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,940
Think about it.

111
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,700
I won't wait for you for too long.

112
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,290
Testimony is being recorded.

113
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,540
March 2, 1992.

114
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,200
Affiant, Seo Joon Seok.

115
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,990
Those people call themselves farmers.

116
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,790
They should be sorry to the real farmers.

117
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,860
It's cold.

118
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,170
Us three, myself, Oh Gil Han, and Choi Myeong Hee,

119
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,550
have been following these so-called 'farmers' for a year.

120
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,680
We received information that these people are going to secretly move something using a truck.

121
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,570
We thought they were going to move the slush fund.

122
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,530
These people called farmers, this is what they do.

123
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,910
They think our country is their vegetable garden.

124
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,730
They finance political funds and go on some political play that suits their taste.

125
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,800
They make the laws they want and reap the benefits from it.

126
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,930
Excuse me, Miss, you can't enter without permission!

127
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,560
Jeong Hoo, what's wrong with you?

128
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,280
Ah, I can't wake up...

129
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,870
Why are you always sleeping when I see you?

130
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,640
But you always wake me up.
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

131
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,850
Hmm, did they drug you or something?
Should we go to the hospital?

132
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:43,400
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

133
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:49,800
Let me sleep a little more.

134
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,980
♬ When you look at me ♬

135
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,210
Is it him? Is he okay?

136
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,770
He's just sleepy.

137
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,340
We found him.
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

138
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,070
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- What? Do you need anything?
♬ when there are so many words I want to say. ♬

139
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,430
Our fathers... they were really close, weren't they?
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

140
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,670
Yeah.
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

141
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,480
They say they were on the same side from beginning until the end.
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

142
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,060
You should have seen the broadcast.

143
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,510
You tell me about it.
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

144
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:34,970
Excuse me, you, who carries a reporter business card with him, should also watch something called news...

145
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,320
Tell me.
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

146
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,900
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you ♬

147
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,950
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay ♬

148
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:51,570
On that day in 1992, our fathers went out together to do some news gathering.
♬ I will always be looking.  ♬

149
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:54,350
♬ It's you ♬

150
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,290
- Take the pictures well.
- Don't worry, don't worry.

151
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,060
Take good pictures so they are not out of focus.

152
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,450
Have you seen me go out of focus?

153
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,970
Hey, I just didn't tell you,
not just once or twice but...

154
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,490
- Hold up! This...
- Awesome, right?

155
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,050
This is the latest model!

156
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,290
- It's expensive, you punk.
- Hold on.

157
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,480
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stay still!

158
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,050
What do you mean stay still?

159
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,790
This guy's crazy!

160
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,030
- Hey, hey, hey
- You are going to break it.

161
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,640
- Let me use it once.
- Hey, you can't!

162
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,980
Just this once.

163
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,680
They just thought it'd be enough to take a photo of the scene of the money exchange.

164
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,630
That's how they set off lightly, thinking they'd be back right away.

165
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,220
What is that?

166
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,060
One apple box contains 200 million won ($200,000).

167
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,330
It looks like there are at least 10.

168
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,100
So one paint truck would be 2 billion won ($2 million)...

169
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,660
I'll take one of those paint cans.

170
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,950
What are you going to do?

171
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,690
You think they'd kill me? I'm still a reporter.

172
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,500
What if they do?

173
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,720
That's impossible, you punk.

174
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,830
What was that?

175
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,120
I'll lure them away. Take one of the paints cans.

176
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,260
What are you, bastard? Grab him!

177
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,860
Stop right there, bastard!

178
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,460
Stop there!

179
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,070
Oh, wait, wait!

180
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,070
- Hello.
- Who are you?

181
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,340
You can't do that.

182
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,570
You can't take that!

183
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,440
Hey!

184
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,090
What's the matter?

185
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,850
Gil Han is in danger. So,

186
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:32,670
Just wait for a moment. I'll go get Gil Han.

187
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,070
Get ready to leave.

188
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,650
Ugh!

189
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,900
Let me go! Hey!

190
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,430
Hurry!

191
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,880
Gil Han! Gil Han.

192
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,190
- Gil Han...
- Seo Joon Seok!

193
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,240
We have to go. Hurry.

194
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,130
Gil Han.

195
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,570
Gil Han!

196
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,500
Take down the plate number.

197
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,010
Yes.

198
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:00,440
While fleeing for a few days,
I tried to figure out what that paint was.

199
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,100
This is a fake red lead.

200
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,040
In construction, if you pour it on the steel frame,

201
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,030
the corrosion of the steel gets accelerated.

202
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,450
Usually, we want to slow down the rusting,

203
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,630
but this is made for the exact opposite!

204
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,040
Excuse me.

205
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,700
That's how the recording in the tape ended.

206
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,450
Those old men (our parents)...
they have lived an exhausting life.

207
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:55,560
It looks that way.

208
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,390
It's over.

209
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,470
What?

210
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:07,530
Assignment. Teacher. Father. And you.

211
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,930
Good job.

212
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,360
- Yeong Sin.
- Yeah?

213
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,100
I was thinking while sleeping...

214
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,710
How can you think while sleeping?

215
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,040
Living like everyone else... Is it hard?

216
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,760
You want to live like that? Like other people?

217
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,670
Would it be hard for me?

218
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,690
Let's try it. Living like others.

219
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,660
You'll stay by my side, right?

220
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,500
Of course.

221
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,420
Good.

222
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,780
I thought you set Ji An's birthday table.

223
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,990
I did a simple one at lunchtime.

224
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,720
Weren't you sick then?

225
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,170
It was short, just passing through.

226
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,700
Don't be sick.

227
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,380
I'm not going to be sick now.

228
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,170
I watched Moon Ho's broadcast.

229
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,340
I would have preferred that you didn't.

230
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:09,410
But, were you all right

231
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,540
watching something like that?

232
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,360
How much have you known? The details you never told me?

233
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,470
There isn't any part I didn't tell you.

234
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:30,190
That day I was waiting in the car, and after Joon Seok came running over, he told me to escape. And

235
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,610
I took him and escaped. Although I haven't said anything,

236
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,990
actually, up to now, I have been suspicious of Joon Seok.

237
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:39,750
It's a relief to clear up my misunderstanding.

238
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,020
This soup is delicious. Is it consommé?

239
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,050
It's a new recipe I tried. Is it good?

240
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,190
Close your eyes just once. And open them again.

241
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,530
Then the invisible is made visible.

242
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,600
That is called... growing up.

243
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:12,300
I... saw it.

244
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,930
Joon Seok killed

245
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,500
Gil Han.

246
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,340
We were tailing the truck which had the slush fund.

247
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:38,900
The truck driver saw us arrive at the scene and fled.

248
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,530
When the truck door was opened, there was a box full of 10,000 won notes ...

249
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:48,210
We had a fight in front of the money.

250
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,270
"This money has no owner, let's take it."
"We can't do that."

251
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,210
And then he killed him. His friend.

252
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,140
There was no chance to stop him.

253
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,480
That's how money is.

254
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,800
Ah, is it people who are like that?

255
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,920
What? Ah, that money.

256
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,370
The money was revealed to be political funds received by the Jin Min Party.

257
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,590
It's really scary, isn't it?
That money made my friends

258
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,430
kill each other and die.

259
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,250
Jeez, it's broken. What a shame.

260
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,070
In spite of my running around crazily today,
I was careful with this.

261
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:20,510
Your mother's cooking skill must be very good, eh?

262
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:25,660
Dad, when you go see that house,
the kitchen sink is placed this high.

263
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,870
I guess it's to match the wheelchair height.

264
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,790
Hey, If there is that much caring to go to that extent in the kitchen, you don't have to see anything more.

265
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,290
That means her cooking skill is great.

266
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,670
Dad, say, "Ah."

267
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,700
Why should I eat first? You eat first.

268
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,180
Why? I brought it back so you can taste it. Here.

269
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,440
Without it being too sweet, it's yummy!

270
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,510
Right, right?

271
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,110
But, when is that guy coming?

272
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,010
Which guy? I naturally have a lot of guys.

273
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,860
Drag him here.

274
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,430
If I drag him here, you are going to beat him up, right?

275
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,500
Hey, girl, out of all guys, why such a weakling?

276
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:21,090
You've always been vulnerable in violent situations. So

277
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:24,570
I had hoped that you'd pick a big sturdy guy

278
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,700
so you could hide in his arms.

279
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:34,580
Of all people, you had to choose a scaredy-cat, who would stammer and whimper if he gets hit just once.

280
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,570
Why are you laughing?

281
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,450
What? Why are you laughing?

282
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,360
He is like a stammering whimpering mess?

283
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,910
Is that funny?

284
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,190
How did you get in?

285
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,070
From the window.

286
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,840
One meter away.

287
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,090
Why?

288
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,300
A bit more. Back off.

289
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,770
You said you wanted to live like others.

290
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,060
After we go to bed, let's talk.

291
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,540
First, when you come to your girlfriend's house, use the door.

292
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,320
Okay.

293
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,120
Second, if you want to go out with your girlfriend,

294
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,720
you have to first introduce yourself to
your girlfriend's father and get his permission.

295
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,370
Oh, that's a little...

296
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,780
Third, on your girlfriend's birthday, you should give her a present.

297
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,170
Today is my real birthday.

298
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,590
Ta-da.

299
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,430
You should get a new gift ready. And please giftwrap it.

300
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:00,290
Your cellphone tracker got erased. It has a GPS function.

301
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,040
Wow, look at this guy. Are you now going to stalk your girlfriend?

302
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,180
No, no. You just turn it on when you need to.

303
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,050
Oh, you can turn it off if you don't like it.
But when you feel you are in danger,

304
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:16,460
you can just turn it on. You can keep it off normally.

305
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,640
Okay.

306
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,960
- Thanks.
- Can I hug you now?

307
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,060
What, am I bothersome?

308
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,700
No.

309
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,800
Then why are you pushing me away?

310
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,000
You said it. You wanted to love like other people do.

311
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,510
Love.

312
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,370
Love.

313
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,820
Then this is?

314
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,590
This is... a bit different than other people?

315
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:05,340
Alright. Then, I will take every step like others do. Just wait.

316
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,300
Don't take too long.

317
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,880
Introduce myself to the father. Then the salary.

318
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,250
And when you come in and out, you use a door like this...

319
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,520
This won't do.

320
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:42,280
I think I... I need to... the next time... I will...

321
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:48,390
Hyungnim, we forgot the... Oh, my!

322
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,740
Oh, oh!

323
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,520
Hello.

324
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,710
So I, uhh... I actually came today to give you my greetings.

325
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,370
Permission. I also would like to get your permission...

326
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,030
Ah, this, I did wrong.

327
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,960
Why are you... Why are you over there?

328
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,480
Don't come in.

329
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,550
Dad.

330
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,900
The moment you come in here, it is the end.

331
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,790
Dad, go easy on him. Go easy.

332
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,050
Hey, so I have a few things to ask you.

333
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,840
Ah, yes.

334
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,550
That... on that day, in my cafe...

335
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,440
with my daughter.

336
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,700
I...

337
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,090
I...

338
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,530
In front of me!

339
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,630
Aigoo, Hyungnim! Hyungnim.

340
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:30,860
Before you kill him, the information first.

341
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,260
Hyungnim, Hyungnim!

342
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,140
Calm down.

343
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,990
For now, sit down.

344
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,000
Yes, sit down, sit down.
♬  Love♬

345
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,220
I will ask him, Hyungnim.
♬  it isn't just a dream.♬

346
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,440
♬ Now that you are everything to me ♬

347
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,620
- So first of all.
- Yes?

348
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,790
How far did the two of you go...
♬ Oh love is the sweetest thing ♬

349
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,100
Aigoo, out of all the things you could ask! ♬ I smile at every being with a skip in my heart. ♬

350
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,520
Was the dried pollack soup delicious?
♬  with a skip in my heart ♬

351
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,150
- Ah, that was really good!
- See! It's him!
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars  ♬

352
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:09,310
The friend she nursed the whole night at the time, it's this guy!
♬ can shine all night long tonight♬

353
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,980
Hyungnim! Hyungnim!

354
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,080
You, you! How dare you kiss her in front of me before marriage?

355
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,380
- Hey!
- You can't kill him! You can't!

356
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,340
- Come here!
- Wait a minute!

357
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,710
You think I don't fight well just because I'm a lawyer?

358
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,120
- Come over here.
- I'm sorry.

359
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,600
What do you mean, you're sorry? Just you wait!

360
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,930
You can't act that way before marriage!

361
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,040
Wait, what did I even do?

362
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,970
- If you can't, then you can't!
- No! Hyungnim!

363
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,470
I did wrong.

364
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,090
Hyungnim!

365
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,780
This...

366
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,010
This... HEY!

367
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,220
Hyungnim!

368
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,350
I'm sorry!

369
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,470
What are you sorry for?

370
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,420
Hey, hey, come on out!

371
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,930
I didn't really do anything much.

372
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,160
A tip came in. It's unusual.

373
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,440
- What kind of tip-off?
- It says he met with the Elder.

374
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,970
Did you get the informant's contact information?

375
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,840
That's not it. But,

376
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,360
will you look at Someday's comment board? Something keeps coming up.

377
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,870
That grandfather is a killer?/ Who is Elder?/ The Elder is a farmer? Village Head?/ I saw that grandfather once.

378
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:51,560
From now on, we're setting up a corner
of "We're accepting tips for 24/7".

379
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,680
Ah, we are accepting any tips related to the Elder and red lead case in 1992.

380
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,730
Catch anything we can from those, and double-check their reliability,

381
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,520
if it's possible, we are going to meet them personally and conduct an interview.

382
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,150
Excuse me, if we are going to do that broadcast

383
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,990
that attacks Candidate Kim Moon Sik's interview, we are lacking in manpower.

384
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,650
A reserve human resource is coming.

385
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,000
Ah, yes. Hello. I'm Park Bong Soo.

386
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,530
- Hey, you punk! How dare you do a covert infiltration news coverage as a newbie...

387
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:22,000
You did well. Great job, great job!

388
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,640
Great job! Great job!

389
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:28,000
How are you, Bong Soo?

390
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
He wants to live like other people.

391
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,780
I want to see you all the time!

392
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,270
Let's go to a company dinner! Company dinner!

393
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,470
Living like others won't be easy.

394
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,470
From what I see, he doesn't seem to know how it is to live like others.

395
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,760
What's so good about that?

396
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,070
But it seems that he really wants to do that, seeing that he's back as Park Bong Soo.

397
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,840
Great job, great job!

398
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,890
He said he also stopped being Healer, but

399
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:53,030
I think he's been fired. He's been sacked.

400
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,920
Let's eat, let's eat! Let's eat!

401
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,620
Reporter Yeo, eat, alright?

402
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,150
Noona talked about you a lot over the phone.

403
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,290
Really? What did she say?

404
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,770
She says she wants to see you again. She asked me to make an excuse because she wants to see you.

405
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,890
She asked me to do a special article on Choi Myeong Hee.

406
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,830
Really?

407
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:11,140
Oh, sure, sure.

408
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,590
Let's do that, the special article.

409
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,900
There's someone I know.

410
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,810
That person seems to live in a little different world.

411
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:23,280
- Actually, he LIVED in a world different from others.
- Let me go! How dare you grab your sunbae by the wrist...

412
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,710
In 1992, I worked on painting the Seodo Bridge.

413
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,200
You know that bridge, right?

414
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,630
It collapsed even before it was opened to the public.

415
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,220
There was some rumor going around amongst us.

416
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,270
All of a sudden, they told us to use different paint.

417
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,200
What happened to the construction company that was handling the bridge construction?

418
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,560
What else could have happened? They were completely ruined and bought over by another company.

419
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,930
- I can go now, right?
- Yes.

420
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,270
Thank you for your cooperation.

421
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,070
Sleepy?

422
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:09,300
That kind of guy says he wants
to come to our world and live like others.

423
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,590
Watching him from the sidelines, it's a bit funny.

424
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:14,360
I also feel a bit sorry for him, too.

425
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,920
Let's go to Yeongdeungpo!

426
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,370
Ah, Yeongdeungpo...

427
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,260
Do you even know how far that is? When are we going to get there?!

428
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,370
I'm telling you I saw that Elder with my own eyes.

429
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,570
I was an aid for a member of the National Assembly.

430
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,750
While they were trying to put into legislation, our Assemblyman did...

431
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,130
You know how feline predatory animals act.

432
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,380
If they don't go out to hunt, they sleep continuously.

433
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,430
It's exactly that.

434
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:39,790
It's a total waste giving him a monthly salary.

435
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,460
Park Bong Soo.

436
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,730
Yes?

437
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:48,760
Your monthly pay has been deposited.
Please check it.

438
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,480
Ah, yes.

439
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,700
Monthly pay...

440
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,200
Ajumma, how much is my monthly pay?

441
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,870
Subtracting this and that, it's a little over $900.

442
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,160
No,

443
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,670
but I worked for almost the whole month?

444
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,130
You also took a lot of vacation days.

445
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,510
One month... $900...

446
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,610
Ajumma, should I work part-time?

447
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,180
If there is some simple work, I can...

448
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,720
Return that earset first.

449
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,190
- Why?
- You already quit.

450
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,170
A person who quit can't have company equipment!

451
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,270
Hey, Ajumma, how could you say that between us...

452
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,700
Look at that, that, that!

453
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:45,460
- Are you not going to do your work properly?
- Ah, Ajumma, this temper.

454
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,980
Black box!

455
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:54,610
Do you not see them attached on the line of cars beside you?

456
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,450
Then, what do I do?

457
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:01,120
Is there even any street in Seoul without parked cars!

458
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:05,860
That's why your Hyungnim flew around through the roofs!

459
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:09,900
His dream is quite simple, isn't it? To live like others.

460
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,790
But well, since he wants to do it, I'm just

461
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,810
letting him.

462
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,070
Actually, he... he's not that much older than me,

463
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,880
but from how he acts, he's like thirteen years old.

464
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,630
That's why, well... I'm just looking after him.

465
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,340
Is that 'someone' a man?

466
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,500
Yes.

467
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,880
A man you like?

468
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,600
Hey.

469
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:34,710
Yes.

470
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,950
I thought you're going to do an interview again in a bit?

471
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,850
Ah, yes. I have a bit of time left. It's just the next neighborhood.

472
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:52,080
Let's see.

473
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,110
Look at me.

474
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:09,570
But, can you please lower your speech with me...

475
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,240
Should I? (informal)

476
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,140
Close your eyes.

477
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,940
It's done.

478
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:30,230
Ah, the special interview! You're going to watch Candidate Kim Moon Sik's special interview, right?

479
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,010
But that's not related to the Elder reports we are taking.

480
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:44,870
Excuse me, Ahjusshi, but we can't put a report about your runaway wife on broadcast.

481
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,710
I'm sorry.

482
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,250
Hey, there.

483
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,700
Bong Soo.

484
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,620
Park Bong Soo!

485
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,390
- Yes?
- Please answer the phone.

486
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,110
Okay.

487
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,210
You dialed the wrong number.

488
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:07,770
Bong Soo! Bong Soo! Bong Soo!

489
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,840
Please! Get out of the way, please!

490
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,900
it's very important to make sure it doesn't show it all.

491
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,380
Hello. Oh, really, what to do?

492
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,520
- What is it?
- About the talk show with Kim Moon Sik,
the script has been totally changed.

493
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,190
- When? Why?
- I've just heard.

494
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,680
As soon as Candidate Kim arrived
at the broadcasting station, he said,

495
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,580
"About today's script, I will take care
of it myself without any script."

496
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,100
Because of it, Chief Kang's nerves are on edge,
every single one of them.

497
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,220
Everybody near her can't even breathe freely, they said.

498
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,980
Yes.

499
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:52,960
Candidate Kim, this is a live show.

500
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,400
If you make any wrong comment by any chance...

501
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,510
It's alright, relax, please.

502
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:03,540
Chief Kang. You can ask anything you want to ask.

503
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,750
These days, regarding the conflict
between me and my brother, Reporter Kim,

504
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,240
I heard some people call it, "War between brothers".
I'm well aware of it.

505
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,910
(Ed. note : "War Among Brothers" refers to Joseon's third king, King Taejong who killed his brothers for the throne.)

506
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,270
Yes, because of the very same reason,
there are some voices of concern

507
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:26,080
that doubt if you can take care of Seoul properly
while you can't even handle your own family.

508
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,290
Yes, I know.
My brother and I, both of us are journalists.

509
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,450
It was the 80's when I first became a journalist.

510
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:39,250
My brother, Reporter Kim Moon Ho, recently aired the broadcast series about this story and gained some popularity.

511
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:44,020
You know the pirate broadcasting team mentioned in that show? I was a member of it.

512
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:49,000
I brought a photo today,
but I'm not sure if I can show it to you here.

513
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,410
- Yes, I want to see it.
- Okay.

514
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,410
Where... Ah.

515
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:57,250
Among these five friends,
here, this is me.

516
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,430
Next to me, this is my wife now.

517
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:05,160
I fought for the freedom of speech
even during that harsh era (of censorship).

518
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:09,290
So, even if my brother makes some contrary reports,

519
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:10,930
I should cut him some slack

520
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:17,120
because that is how we observe the freedom of speech
which we have fought for and protected.

521
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,480
The concept of the pirate broadcasting
is actually a bit unfamiliar to us...

522
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:25,330
- Could you explain more? 
- The content of their show totally changed,
so what about our delayed spiking broadcasting?

523
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,300
- In the 80's, the forbidden words, ...
- I'm cancelling it.

524
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:31,760
... and the contents we couldn't broadcast,
there were so many of them.

525
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,000
So, we had no choice but to make pirate broadcasts.

526
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,700
Frankly speaking, nowadays, we're enjoying the freedom of speech excessively, don't you think so?

527
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,290
For the freedom you're enjoying today,
the previous generation made a sacrifice.

528
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:51,100
I wish the viewers acknowledge that point.

529
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,450
Honestly, I was a bit surprised
that Candidate Kim Moon Sik, CEO of Je Il Newspaper,

530
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,350
used to make a pirate broadcast.

531
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:01,030
I have something I want to show you.

532
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,330
What is it?

533
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,330
What is that?
Those are yours, Boss.

534
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,850
These are the cassette tapes of the broadcasts
that our pirate broadcasting team worked on.

535
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,120
I have kept them dearly for more than twenty years.

536
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,530
Here, can you see the date on it?
Marked as 1980, you can see it, right?

537
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:35,910
Can you see this magazine printed by stencil pen?

538
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,290
This might look a bit shabby
to the young people nowadays,

539
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,430
but we were really innocent back then, like this.

540
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,120
Was it made by that pirate broadcasting team?

541
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,830
Yes, it was published just once back then.

542
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,530
The name of the magazine is Healer.
What does that mean?

543
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:57,050
Look right here.

544
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:02,450
Media exists to diagnose
the pain of this society and cure it.

545
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:08,040
With this mindset, I have protected the media so far.

546
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:15,130
I, who am such a person, am now going
to dedicate this mind to Seoul.

547
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:23,970
For the freedom, democracy and order we've protected by devoting our lives.

548
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,330
Are you all right?

549
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,200
I'm sorry.

550
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,500
For what?

551
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,540
I'm sorry.

552
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:54,620
Please don't cry. Otherwise, you'll get sick again.

553
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:58,540
Was something... something wrong?

554
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,660
Those tapes, if those bastards stole them,
do you want me to bring them back?

555
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,210
That's not that difficult, you know.

556
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:36,300
You said you wouldn't do that kind of work any longer.
I thought you wanted to live like other people.

557
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,670
Ah... You must have heard that from Yeong Sin.

558
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:45,250
That's right. I also hope you can live like that.

559
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,600
Well, about that, I will take care of it myself, but...

560
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,390
Are you all right?

561
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:55,250
I was really scared that you might cry.

562
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:57,320
I almost cried.

563
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,370
Because those tapes were stolen?

564
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,500
Some day, come with some beer again,

565
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,870
I have a lot of stories I want to tell you.

566
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,040
Together with Yeong Sin?

567
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,050
All right.

568
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,250
Those guys I have are the world's top class
in terms of their skills.

569
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:26,330
- Besides, ...
- For the time being, I will use this room.

570
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:28,910
Over there, please set up one more desk.

571
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,540
You have another place to stay,
other than this room, right?

572
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,230
Me? Other than this room?

573
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,880
Set up as soon as the desk is ready.

574
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,950
I understand.

575
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,660
I guess you don't know who I am.

576
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:45,040
Look here! I'm Bae Sang Soo,
CEO of this place!

577
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,370
So, Double S! From the initials of my name, S and S!

578
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,720
And, this room!

579
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,340
This is the CEO's office, you know.

580
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,300
Calling - Phone connect.

581
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,700
Hello.

582
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,200
From the Double S, the people are coming out.

583
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,950
Those guys killed all CCTVs nearby that.

584
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,080
You should take photos and send me those.

585
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,620
Take a picture of the license plate number.

586
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,900
Shall I follow them?

587
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,840
Never mind. Just stand by.

588
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,080
By the way, what are we now chasing after here?

589
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,330
We're now in the middle of making
the severance package for Healer.

590
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:30,160
Those guys who followed Healer,
starting from Park Dong Cheol's place.

591
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,040
Healer took photos of them, like this.

592
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:39,400
So, among these punks, I think there must be
the real murderer who killed Park Dong Cheol.

593
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:43,540
Why are they hanging out with Sang Soo's gang...?

594
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,750
Where did I see this guy...?

595
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:58,120
I'm sure I've seen him before...

596
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,350
This is Someday. Yes, we're looking
for any information regarding to the Elder.

597
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,580
The phone number of night snack place...?

598
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:16,540
I don't really know that.

599
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,900
Well, among the posts on the message boards,
about 70% of them are just pranks,

600
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:31,910
and 20% are irrelevant.

601
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:34,410
But still, we had more gains than we expected.

602
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,500
We have already got two, three tips
about the Seodo Bridge case.

603
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,040
But about that, there must have been
some emotional impact to the laborers back then.

604
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,830
Just think about it, please.
The bridge they had worked on just collapsed.

605
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:51,830
What could've happened if it collapsed
after it was open to traffic?

606
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:56,870
Oh dear, you should have some sleep.
It seems you hardly went to sleep.

607
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,550
I think it's time to start soon.

608
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,880
From where and how they would come at us,
frankly speaking, I have no clue.

609
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,950
I see. But, they are good at only one thing.

610
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:11,700
They will probably start from taking up our "spoons".
(Editor's Note : "spoons" - implying "livelihood")

611
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,700
It's too dirty and petty
that I don't even want to fight against them.

612
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,290
But its effectiveness is really something. Jeez.

613
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,600
You guys sure are confident.

614
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:15,250
Chae Yeong Sin can't sleep in places with other people.

615
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:19,270
- How about you?
- I am not 'other people'.

616
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,690
Look here.

617
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,280
Ah, I really hate leaving pictures...

618
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,980
I have liked taking pictures
ever since I first started walking.

619
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,390
- But...
- Yeah.

620
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:44,950
You're fighting against that person called Elder right now, right?

621
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,860
Right.

622
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:50,680
- Will Yeong Sin be in danger again?
- I don't know.

623
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:57,590
Do you want to take her far from here? If you go, it would be easier to live like other people.

624
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:01,300
I'm wavering.

625
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,070
Why?

626
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:06,240
I thought about why I'm hesitating.

627
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,920
It looks like it's because of you.

628
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:15,110
It just bothers me a bit if the two of us go and leave you alone.

629
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,910
I'm touched.

630
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:22,860
- But...
- Yeah.

631
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:28,510
I can't be without her. If it's for her, I can abandon you.

632
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:30,210
It's okay.

633
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:54,600
Yes, you called the wrong number.

634
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,620
This is Someday News. Are you giving us a report?

635
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:01,490
We need to record the reports we receive. Is that fine with you?

636
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,190
Ah, yes.

637
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,890
Wait one moment.

638
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,730
Please tell me.

639
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,790
Here's the mail.

640
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:21,470
Media Control Agency

641
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,300
Summons for mediation committee

642
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,110
Here.

643
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,890
Something came from the Prosecutor.

644
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,900
Prosecutor
Summons

645
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,620
Summons

646
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,680
Summons

647
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,980
The informant should be able to introduce people whom he worked with back then.

648
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,860
Start out first by putting them at their ease.

649
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,980
Yes, I understand.

650
00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:50,460
Oh, wait. Who are you? Where did you come from?

651
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,170
We are from the National Tax Service,
Seoul Branch's Audit Group 4.

652
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,280
National Tax Service ...

653
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,460
What's going on?

654
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,070
A tip came in making allegations regarding the source of the funds for the acquisition of Someday News.

655
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:03,520
Mr. Kim Moon Ho?

656
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:08,110
- Yes, that's me.
- If you agree to it, we will start the search and seizure process right away.

657
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:11,610
If you object, we will do a compulsory search.

658
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:21,580
I understand.

659
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,000
Oh, you can't do this!

660
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,820
Wait, wait, wait!

661
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,210
Please cooperate with us.

662
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,110
I bought that with my own money. With my own money!

663
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,460
Give it to me.

664
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:37,220
Well, it's mine. I'm telling you this is mine.

665
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,930
Ah, seriously.

666
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:58,210
- Excuse me...
- Yeah? Ow, that hurt.
- Why... Is there...?

667
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,680
No, no. It's nothing.

668
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,560
Hey, Bong Soo.

669
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,880
-Yes?
- My wife owns a chicken restaurant.

670
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,130
But the business license got suspended after the city health inspection

671
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:18,050
that claims to have found bacteria in the water filter.

672
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:22,850
And the fine was over 10 million won ($10,000).

673
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:27,920
That couldn't be related to our Someday, could it?

674
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,500
Never mind. Just go on.

675
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,630
It probably isn't... Aigoo...

676
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,200
What?

677
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,270
It's weird. That car.

678
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,700
What's going on?

679
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:27,930
Ahjumma, can you track Kim Moon Ho's cellphone?

680
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,820
Forget about being retired or getting fired! Please!

681
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,690
I think he's been kidnapped.

682
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,300
What do you want to do? Do you want to come with me, or do you want to wait inside Kim Moon Ho's house, or-

683
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,010
If you go, you'll be fighting again, right?

684
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,700
Probably.

685
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,150
Go, and bring Sunbae back.

686
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:01,790
- Let's go.
- What are you doing? Hurry and go.

687
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,400
Alright. You know the code for Kim Moon Ho's house, right?

688
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,930
- By the entrance, there's a latch. You have to...
- I get it already, just go.

689
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:01,230
A right turn on the incoming intersection.
