1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,350
The case records... You said they show it to immediate family.

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,160
I'm immediate family.
My father's immediate family.

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,440
Inaccesible Document
Requester Must be Detained.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,180
Ahjussi, where are we going?

5
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,480
Teacher once said that the best bait when fishing is oneself.
- Why do I have to go, huh?

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,280
But has that old geezer ever actually gone fishing?

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,240
Episode 12

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,960
It's the Je Il newspaper owner.

9
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,480
- Why all the way here?
- I don't know either.

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960
Don't you think it's something like this? He sent his brother to take over Someday Daily.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
Now that the older brother came, perhaps there will be a merger with Someday ...

12
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,980
Chief?

13
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,020
Then I'm becoming a chief at Je Il Newspaper.
Then the difference in salary will be...

14
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,840
Wipe your drool. It's dribbling down.

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,860
It's citrus tea. We don't have proper cups with saucers, so I made do.

16
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,020
Thank you.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:32,520
Oh, Sunbae Kim Moon Ho... no... our boss is out on some business. I called, so he'll be here soon.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,440
Please drink. I made two cups.

19
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,400
You've grown up to be bright and lovely.

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,020
Bright and lovely?

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,400
I do have that sort of side to me.

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,920
Are you thirsty?

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,240
Wait a second. I'll buy something to drink.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,080
Stay here.

25
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,660
Mom.

26
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,840
I saw you asking questions at Kim Ui Chan's press conference.

27
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,900
You were very brave.

28
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,900
Well, I just did what sunabe taught me to do.

29
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,220
- How tall are you?
- What?

30
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,800
When I saw you on the broadcast, you seemed tall.

31
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,880
Let's see.

32
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,720
I was wearing high heels then, and right now I'm...

33
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,680
You're similar.

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,580
Maybe not?

35
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,960
Are you shorter?

36
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,020
Compared to whom?

37
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
Chae Yeong Sin, get out.

38
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,060
Yes.

39
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
What is it? What is it? Why is he acting that way?

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,300
You startled the child.

41
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,360
How dare you come here?

42
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,180
Moon Ho.

43
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,180
How can you meet that child?

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,420
You met that child without shaking or going down on your knees?

45
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,260
You do know that

46
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,680
because of you

47
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,000
that child is now in danger?

48
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,380
As long as you get out of her life, there's no reason for her to be in danger.

49
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,660
It seems to me that you thought that if you made her known on a national broadcast,

50
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,720
I wouldn't be able to mess with her easily.

51
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,320
Why?

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,720
Is this insufficient? Do I have to do it again?

53
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,080
Thanks to you, I think I'll be running in the next Seoul mayoral election.

54
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,260
You pulled down Kim Ui Chan with that absurd broadcast,

55
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,060
so it looks like I'll be pushed into that position.

56
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:04,480
The person who will push you onto that position is the person your cronies call the Elder?

57
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,620
That's right. The Elder thinks that my weakness is Ji An.

58
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,000
The Elder believes that I need to get rid of my vulnerability.

59
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,720
The child is in danger, Moon Ho. So,

60
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:36,700
I'll have to take her. I'm planning on protecting her safely myself.

61
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,360
You'll take her and protect her?

62
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Yes.

63
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,200
How?

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,140
Are you going to break her two legs so she can't move

65
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:58,700
and put her in a cage? Is that how you will keep her safer?

66
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,900
Be careful with your words.

67
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,860
When you say protect, that's what you mean.

68
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,360
What are you trying to do by putting forth these people who know nothing?

69
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,940
Seo Jeong Hoo? Did you bring him? What the heck are you thinking?

70
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you saying you'll uncover the events from 22 years ago with them?

71
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,280
Seo Jeong Hoo? Joon Seok's son?

72
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,900
Did you find him, too? So, are you planning
to "handle" him as you did to Ji An?

73
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,980
Because, if he becomes a "weakness" and the past is exposed, you will be in big trouble, right?

74
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:47,760
A few days ago some man searched my house.

75
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,060
I'm thinking he is the one who did it. I couldn't ask him

76
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,940
because he left so hurriedly.

77
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,220
Mr. Seo Jeong Hoo?

78
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,540
Gosh, this is the fifth time that someone is asking my name.

79
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,000
"Seo Jeong Hoo?" "Mr. Seo Jeong Hoo?"
"Are you really Seo Jeong Hoo?"

80
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,020
Yes, that's right. Seo Jeong Hoo.

81
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,000
Did you ask for information about Seo Joon Seok?

82
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Yes, I did.

83
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,980
You are his son, correct?

84
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,940
Yes, that's correct. My dad's name was Seo Joon Seok.

85
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,140
There's someone who wants to meet you. Will you come?

86
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,560
Someone who was your father's friend is waiting.

87
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,100
Fine.

88
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm still half asleep, that's why.

89
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,260
What are you doing? Let's go already.

90
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,100
Let's leave quickly, Ajussi. Okay? Ajussi!

91
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,480
Are you tired?

92
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,220
Ah yes. I haven't been in Korea for long.

93
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,740
Gracious, I'm not over the jet lag.

94
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,980
I'm sorry but I need to sleep. Gosh.

95
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,930
Hey. The man really does well.

96
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,120
He lives in this house all the time, right?

97
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,160
Now, this way.

98
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,370
Where? There? Okay.

99
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,740
Wow! These books are all ...

100
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,450
and a second floor like this ...

101
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,840
Wow... is he collecting books, or what?

102
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,170
Hello.

103
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,690
You're Seo Jeong Hoo?

104
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,530
The sixth time.

105
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,850
The sixth time today. Yeah, that's right. I'm Seo Jeong Hoo.

106
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,020
Yes! Jeong Hoo, this guy!

107
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,710
Welcome.

108
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,880
Yes.

109
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,800
Don't you remember me?

110
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,970
No, I don't.

111
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,210
Here, here. Sit right here.

112
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,390
Because I was young.

113
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,340
Hey. I feel hurt, though.

114
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,500
I even gave you a lot of piggyback rides. Your dad and I were very close.

115
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,410
Could you possibly be one of the people among them?

116
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,650
So, I have one photo.

117
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,640
So, five people were taken together.

118
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,690
So in that photo, my father and some woman and...

119
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,410
perhaps you are one of the guys among them ...

120
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:50,340
- Yes.
- Is that right?

121
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,230
I am among them. Five of us friends.

122
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,410
Hey, seriously, as soon as I came to Korea, I hit the jackpot ...

123
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,260
Have you not been in Korea for a while?

124
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,790
Yes, I was in Russia.

125
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,330
Ah, Russia?

126
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,120
Yes, as an exchange student. I was an exchange student.

127
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,700
Who did you say came?

128
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,110
It is someone whom you must greet.

129
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,410
Then, you must have a ton of money and

130
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,520
must be a real higher-up, right?

131
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,870
I'm not sure whether I am.

132
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,850
Because you're a higher-up, you could get me out
when I was locked up back there. Right?

133
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,700
Ah, that?

134
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,160
But... earlier, why was I being held there?

135
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,260
And, how did you know I was being held?

136
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,150
If anyone is trying to get information on your father,

137
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:48,270
it's supposed that first the requester is detained
and then a report is made.

138
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,170
I've done some things to make sure I can listen in on that reporting process.

139
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,910
Why?

140
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,250
I told you. We were friends. Very close.

141
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,950
Ah, everything you have said is among friends like that.

142
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,850
It's amazing, right?

143
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,850
Is a guest here?

144
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,890
Introduce yourself.

145
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,950
Hello.

146
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,370
The guest is this young?

147
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,500
Don't you know? Whom does he resemble?

148
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,650
Who?

149
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,030
He resembles Seo Joon Seok.

150
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,790
Where is the resemblance? I don't see any.

151
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,230
It's Joon Seok's son.

152
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,870
Hello. I'm Seo Jeong Hoo.

153
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,960
Please come this way.

154
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,780
I...

155
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,870
I can not stand. That's why.

156
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,860
Can you sit down?

157
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,870
I want to look closely at your face.

158
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,200
Jeong Hoo.

159
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,540
Yes.

160
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,680
You grew up this much.

161
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,310
You were so small, but you grew up so big.

162
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,720
I saw this face somewhere.

163
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,100
I definitely saw it.

164
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,850
What?

165
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,760
I have something to say...

166
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,110
I'll come by again later.

167
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,530
Come in.

168
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,100
I came with an item that can be
the special feature articles.

169
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,280
I really want to try it.

170
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,770
Tell me.

171
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,830
I want to investigate again
about the Hwang Jae Gook case.

172
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,570
I did some research.

173
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,920
He committed suicide. A suicide note was discovered, and

174
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,620
with that, the case was closed. I think that's suspicious.

175
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,710
What is?

176
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,300
It's too easy.

177
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,130
Ah. well, it seems as if someone who committed a crime shifted all the blame to Hwang Jae Gook.

178
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,850
It feels like a brush off; you know that feeling?

179
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,140
You detested Hwang Jae Gook. Because of Joo Yeon Hee, you've been cornered by him too.

180
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,380
Even for Someday, all the lawsuit cases were resolved,

181
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,430
thanks to Hwang Jae Gook's death.

182
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,140
Shouldn't you be happy?

183
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,530
Of course, I'm happy. Well, although saying this
when someone's dead is a bit bad...

184
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,020
anyway, still as a reporter

185
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,460
one must dig out justice and the truth,
instead of being swayed by personal emotions.

186
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,880
So I am here with questions about the case, and

187
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,740
I sorted out some points for the news coverage.

188
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:27,470
When people talk about truth and justice, you should be suspicious of the space between the lines.

189
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,350
Those are words that don't need to be said

190
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,770
when you have no ulterior motives.

191
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,220
What's your ulterior motive?

192
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,640
Actually, a detective came to see me.

193
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,460
He was suspicious of the person named Go Seong Cheol that Hwang Jae Gook claimed to have killed in his suicide note

194
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,030
and of Hwang Jae Gook's suicide.

195
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,270
- Suspicious?
- He said both were killed by the Healer.

196
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,340
And so?

197
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,670
I want to reveal the truth for him.

198
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,720
I learned that the person who handles the case is the detective,

199
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,780
but that the person who handles the truth is the reporter. Right?

200
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,130
That young man from earlier is Seo Jeong Hoo.

201
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,600
I've also requested a check on his entry and exit of the country.

202
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,980
We'll know by tomorrow.

203
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,050
Myeong Hee

204
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,940
was always bad at lying.

205
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,990
If she did lie

206
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,360
she was always caught. It's always been like that.

207
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,640
Then do you still suspect

208
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,560
that that young man is the Healer?

209
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,090
But,

210
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,070
I think Myeong Hee is lying.

211
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,710
What is it?

212
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,790
Why is Myeong Hee doing this to me?

213
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,780
Come over here. Here.

214
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,490
Do you remember your father's face?

215
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,050
He was always smiling and was good at making jokes.

216
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,810
This is your father.

217
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,780
Why?

218
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,940
Truthfully, I...

219
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,000
heard something from someone.

220
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,060
What?

221
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,810
My father...

222
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,060
killed his friend, they said.

223
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,380
So that,

224
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,080
was this person.

225
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,010
And I heard this person

226
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,260
was married with this person.
Then this woman is...

227
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,890
It's me.

228
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,760
I was married to him.

229
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,200
Ah.

230
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,090
Then my father killed

231
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,130
your husband?

232
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:44,380
Myeong Hee, let's stop here.

233
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,460
It's not so, Jeong Hoo.

234
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,370
It's not. Your father didn't do that.

235
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,670
Did you come because you wanted to know that?

236
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,710
Yes.

237
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,480
I'm sorry, but leave now. She isn't well.

238
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,340
Take my hand.

239
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,630
You are brave.

240
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,260
You could have just kept it covered.

241
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:33,810
It would have been okay even if you did that.
Nobody would've noticed that...

242
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,320
You know,

243
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,200
now there is someone I like.

244
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,660
So, I had to know

245
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,680
what kind of father am I the son of,

246
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,570
and whether it's okay for me to like that woman.

247
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,790
Yes.

248
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,270
I see.

249
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,090
Did you see, Ji An?

250
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,730
Jeong Hoo has grown up so handsome like this.

251
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:14,600
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo, play with me ...

252
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,190
Ji An, Ji An!

253
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,150
The child, her name, her name ...

254
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,860
What was her name? What did you say it was?

255
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,790
Ji An.

256
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,530
Our Ji An ...

257
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,570
My daughter ...

258
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,300
You two were so close, Jeong Hoo.

259
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,020
Leave.

260
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,930
Myeong Hee, Myeong Hee.

261
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,130
Here,

262
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,650
Meong Hee ...

263
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,920
I figured out where I saw this guy.

264
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,000
Healer, are you listening?

265
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,700
It was when the elevator incident happened.

266
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,990
At the time, I combed through every nearby CCTV.

267
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,030
I pulled out the identities of the people one by one

268
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:42,580
who were passing in front at about the same time,

269
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,730
but there were a few people
whose identity absolutely wouldn't come out.

270
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,710
He is one of them.

271
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,130
On the day of the elevator incident,

272
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,040
he was in the vicinity of the building at the time.

273
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,880
If this is not a huge coincidence,

274
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,020
this guy is the one who tried to murder Chae Yeong Sin.

275
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,060
I wanted to know.
While offering money to that extent,

276
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,240
whose parentage did he want to determine?

277
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:35,370
Hyung Gil Han had a daughter.

278
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,650
- The girl ...
- She died.

279
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:42,470
Jeong Hoo, Jeong Hoo.

280
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:44,600
Stop running around, huh?

281
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,640
If you guy's keep on running, I'm not letting you into the island.

282
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,130
It's Moru Moru Island!

283
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,300
Ji An! Ji An! Ji An!

284
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,740
Ji An, Ji An! Ji An!

285
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:53,160
How long were you going to deceive me?

286
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,310
How much do you know?

287
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,190
Why didn't you tell me

288
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,700
who Chae Yeong Sin is?

289
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,120
Why did you say she was dead?

290
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,020
You should have at least told me.

291
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,200
Ji An was in danger.

292
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,230
I will explain.

293
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,720
That explanation of "Reporter Kim Moon Ho",

294
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,210
I know too well what it will be.

295
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,000
Depending on the situation,
you mix the truths with lies and spit them out.

296
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,110
- Jeong Hoo.
- This guy, that guy, everyone is lying!

297
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,730
So, my father,

298
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:30,360
no matter how many times you guys are babbling

299
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,770
that my father is not a murderer!

300
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,810
I can't

301
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,560
believe what you say.

302
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,060
I couldn't talk about Ji An.

303
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,710
Because I had to protect her.

304
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,160
Her real mother is alive, but

305
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,660
day in and day out while you look at her silently in front of you, you keep your mouth shut.

306
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,950
- Is that protecting her?
- If the child knew and

307
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:55,560
her mother knew,

308
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,900
she will really

309
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,920
lose her mother, huh?

310
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,960
What the hell have you guys really done?

311
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,010
What the hell have you done to us?!

312
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,110
I'm sorry.

313
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,870
Why don't you stop now?

314
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,530
Both Chae Yeong Sin and I lived fine
without you guys before.

315
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,410
In the future, too, we will live well, and also even without you,

316
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,190
because we can handle anything between the two of us, so

317
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,000
keep your nose out of our business.

318
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,260
Jeong Hoo, you still don't know a lot.

319
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,790
What kind of people they are...

320
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,550
I don't need to know.

321
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,470
Don't you know what I meant?

322
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,440
These guys or those guys, whatever,

323
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,530
you guys play among yourselves.

324
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,490
Because we will play among ourselves.

325
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,330
What about your father?

326
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,520
What are you going to do about your father's problem?

327
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
My father's problem ...

328
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,620
Because it is my and my father's problem,

329
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,620
you don't need to know.

330
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,240
Welcome ...

331
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,280
Hey, Park Bong Soo.

332
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,500
Weren't you mad at me?

333
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,160
That was really bothering me...

334
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,260
- What's the matter?
- Sunbae.

335
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,150
Yeah, what is it?

336
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,590
Because I'm really having a hard time right now, would

337
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:11,400
you help me out?

338
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,430
Okay, what ...

339
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,460
Hey!

340
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,850
♬ It's a beautiful feeling, what we got deep inside. ♬

341
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,640
Why is your body so cold? Why is it totally ice?

342
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,370
♬ We've got a thing which will last forever, together you and I.♬

343
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:44,330
♬ Such a rush of emotion, there's no way we can push it away. ♬

344
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,110
Oy, Park Bong Soo?
♬  'Cause they'll never tear our love apart ♬

345
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:47,670
♬  'Cause they'll never tear our love apart ♬

346
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,190
That's as far as it's going.

347
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,640
♬ Our bond will never break ♬ ♬

348
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,200
Still ...

349
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:59,460
♬ Do you believe in the power of everlasting love? ♬ ♬

350
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,640
- Still? Still?
-Th...That's enough. That's enough. S-surrender.

351
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,330
♬ We can make it if we stay together ♬

352
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,830
♬ Our love is just enough ♬

353
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:16,450
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

354
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,550
So, you can't go home because of the bugs?

355
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,150
They said it would take a few days to finish the fumigation.

356
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,010
What's the name of the bug?

357
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,470
Camel crickets. So,

358
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:30,190
they've spread through the entire house.

359
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,090
One is this big,

360
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,670
but they don't travel alone.

361
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,790
Okay. So, you want to stay at my house?

362
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:43,690
I can sleep on the sofa like last time,

363
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:47,430
or I can sleep here.

364
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,850
Your family is rich, right? Go to a hotel.

365
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,050
Hotels are scary. How can I go there alone?

366
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,710
What about your family?

367
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,750
I live alone.

368
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,550
- What about your family?
- Fath--

369
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:05,020
My mom remarried early,

370
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,550
and my dad passed away when I was young.

371
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:21,900
Raise your head.
♬  No matter if you're near or far, ♬

372
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,390
♬ Our bond will never break ♬

373
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,790
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

374
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:35,870
My dad and ahjusshi have gone to a funeral.
♬ We'll always be this way. ♬

375
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,210
I'll call to ask them in a little while and...

376
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,770
♬ And do it all again ♬

377
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,350
What?

378
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,710
♬ Oh my love ♬

379
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,050
You said you have someone you like, right, Sunbae?

380
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,470
I do. Why?

381
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,790
But is it okay if you let any man stay over and hug them because they said they're having a hard time?

382
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:03,550
Are you a man?

383
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,550
You're clinging to your sunbae because you're afraid of bugs.

384
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,920
If you say, "Oh sunbae, I'm scared" and suddenly

385
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,650
put on a male cosplay,

386
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,690
don't you think it will bother the person listening?

387
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,270
Camel crickets are really scary.

388
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,310
I'm going to get all the lodging expenses from you so prepare.

389
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,970
Welcome!

390
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,530
What would you like?

391
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,930
-One Americano and...
- One Americano.

392
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:32,410
a caramel macchiato.
-Do you need something else? Would you like whipped cream?

393
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,870
Okay, okay.
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

394
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,330
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

395
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,610
♬ My eternal love ♬

396
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,810
This person is unavailable. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

397
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:59,590
- Dr. Seo.
- Long time no see, Reporter Kim.

398
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,590
Is Noona not well?

399
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,490
We've calmed her down. But I told CEO Kim to check on her progress, and if she's not doing well,

400
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:09,870
we could think of hospitalizing her for a little bit.

401
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,410
Seo Jeong Hoo came here this afternoon. Joon Seok's son.

402
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,230
That kid can't tell the difference between what should be said and what shouldn't.

403
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,430
Look at what he did to her.

404
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:52,270
What that kid knows, did you tell him?

405
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,490
Is that why a kid who's been quiet all this time suddenly came here?

406
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,510
To whom else and what have you told?

407
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,230
How much does Ji An know?

408
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:08,130
Hyung, up till now, I thought that I was a better human being than you.

409
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,750
But...

410
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,690
the only thing I saw and learned from growing up was you.

411
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,950
I've become a person just like you.

412
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:28,250
- So?
- So I think this is okay.

413
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:37,350
If it's dirty, you have to wipe it with a rag first.

414
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:40,610
Wouldn't it be wasteful to use a white towel?

415
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,910
Let's talk.

416
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,470
I came here to see Noona, not you.

417
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:09,010
We have to assume that the Healer has the Elder's videos.

418
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,250
If the Healer is Seo Jeong Hoo
and Moon Ho is behind him...?

419
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,810
I sent an e-mail to the Healer, but there is no response.

420
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,690
No matter how much money I offered,
he's not budging either.

421
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:22,170
There's no other way to contact him...

422
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,790
Then we have to make him come.

423
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,730
I didn't want to go this far.

424
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,530
What a pity.

425
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:39,310
What are you doing?

426
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,470
That is, so, this...

427
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,830
Peel them.

428
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,250
Alright. Nevermind the potatoes.

429
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,250
Peel the onions using the small knife.

430
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:10,670
You can do it, right?

431
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,930
- Bong Sook.
- Yes?

432
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,550
Can we please clean the eye discharge off our eyes?

433
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,530
- Eye discharge?
- Left eye.

434
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,170
Bon appétit!

435
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:00,470
Bon appé...

436
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:23,590
W-what's wrong?

437
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,230
Why, is it bad?

438
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,730
It's fine.

439
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,250
Don't eat it.

440
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,190
It's good, it's good.

441
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,990
Why would I sleep with the door (of my room) locked?

442
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:50,150
Dad, it's Bong Sook, Bong Sook.

443
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,190
Alright. Drive safely when you come. Okay.

444
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:00,050
Dad and Ajusshi said it'll be another hour or two and told us to go to bed.

445
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,490
I can wait. Shouldn't I at least greet...

446
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,670
This is my dad's, so it'll be pretty big. But pajamas are still best for sleeping.

447
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,450
Aigoo, sorry.

448
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:30,850
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

449
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:37,690
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

450
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:43,730
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

451
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,190
♬ When you see me ♬

452
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:49,850
- What?
- Wait.

453
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:58,310
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

454
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:04,410
♬ when there are so many words I want to say? ♬

455
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:08,470
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

456
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,250
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

457
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,990
Oh, I must be going insane.

458
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,910
Sorry, good night.

459
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:24,830
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

460
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:30,730
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

461
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,770
That woman named Myeong Hee.

462
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:35,630
Kim Moon Sik's current wife.

463
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,250
Can you look for her hospital records?

464
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,910
What will happen if she meets the daughter
she thought had died? I wanna know about that.

465
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,500
Is this an official commission?

466
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,330
Sure, take the money, okay?

467
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,780
You take care of my account, so take it yourself.

468
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:01,750
If that's the case, I'll provide an analysis about you without taking a penny.

469
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,350
Mr. "You", do you know that you're a junk robot
that's lost all its artificial intelligence capabilities?

470
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:13,270
Aigo, Ajumma must be hungry again since she's starting to nag.

471
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:19,790
You lose your sense of reason because of a woman, and end up revealing yourself because you carelessly dropped that woman's cellphone.

472
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:24,790
As soon as you heard your father's story, you revealed your face and real name and jumped into enemy territory.

473
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:29,120
What is it now? You went on your own two feet to a place where detectives are camped out to do what?

474
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,180
To protect whom?

475
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,540
Ajumma, you must be getting older. Do you know you've been getting more talkative?

476
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:40,260
I told you about superman that one time, right?

477
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,620
The guy, like you, who took a job undercover because of a woman.

478
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,180
That guy had one weakness.

479
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:51,620
♫If I meet an unmarried woman,♫

480
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:55,010

482
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,330
Are you listening?

483
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,230
Yeah.

484
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:14,120
But to you Healer, people must be that rock.

485
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:14,970
Ahjumma.

486
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:22,180
People, humans are your krypto...whatever.

487
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,020
I know that you actually really like me, Ajumma.

488
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,080
Who is it?

489
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,730
You already knew...

490
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,840
the story that my father...

491
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,980
did something to Chae Yeong Sin's father.

492
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,480
That's why you tried to keep us apart, isn't it?

493
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,060
Because I might be hurt.

494
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,830
Were you... hurt?

495
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:56,360
I can't even remember my father's face. What I do know

496
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,360
is only the face in the photo.

497
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,460
How does what my father did more than 20 years ago

498
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,340
have anything to do with me? I don't have anything to do with it.

499
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:14,250
As long as he didn't kill the father of the woman I like.

500
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,050
Ajumma.

501
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,130
What?

502
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,510
I like Chae Yeong Sin.

503
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,570
Did you only just realize that?

504
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,110
So I'm prepared.

505
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,720
It doesn't matter even if I get hurt.
It's okay although she doesn't know.

506
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,480
I still want to be at her side.

507
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,050
Don't tell me to run away.

508
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:01,030
I don't know how to run away.

509
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:19,280
Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan, who has been accused at his candidacy press conference of accepting sexual favors , has been summoned by the prosecution today.

510
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,450
While Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan is denying claims of accepting sexual favors,

511
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:26,340
the police are focusing the investigation on the suicide note of construction president, Mr Hwang, who is this case's central person,

512
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:32,280
and the prostitution video. If the charge is proven, they will request a warrant of arrest...

513
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,020
I'll present a new project for Someday News.

514
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,920
The headlines today suggest that Kim Ui Chan, who just appeared on the news,

515
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,190
will probably be abandoned.

516
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:47,270
It seems the party has already abandoned him.

517
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:51,480
If that's so, they'll be putting forward a candidate for the next mayor of Seoul.

518
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,000
That person is the subject of our next special.

519
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,870
Has the next Seoul mayoral candidate been announced? Why didn't I see it?

520
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,790
Yes, that's right. They haven't announced it yet. I learned of it through personal means.

521
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:06,020
Oh, so who is it?

522
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,120
Kim Moon Sik.

523
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:11,910
The owner of Je Il Newspaper.

524
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:16,180
News about Kim Moon Sik will start to be released in the next few days.

525
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:21,660
Maybe it's going to be about Kim Moon Sik's achievements so far, or some prominent people would be recommending him--

526
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:26,580
But, no, so...Boss Kim Moon Ho,

527
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,610
are you are talking about that person, your brother?

528
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:36,500
Yes, he came here a few days ago, didn't he?

529
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,670
The first special broadcast we made after you took over Someday Daily

530
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,140
sunk Kim Ui Chan.

531
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:52,110
It was a great success. Thanks to that we've also been receiving a lot of hits.

532
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:58,430
I thought that this was a great accomplishment. That's really what I thought.

533
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,620
But now that I see ...

534
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,030
But now that you see?

535
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:07,310
It was a prelude taken
for your brother's election campaign.

536
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:12,340
Of course, you could do that. The world is like that. I understand.

537
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,240
I cannot stay here any longer.

538
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,040
- Hey, spy!
- Yes... Yes?

539
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,390
Do you report back every day?

540
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,940
I report back about twice a week. They told me to report often if something came up.

541
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:28,510
Go report that Someday's Kim Moon Ho is doing a series on Kim Moon Sik.

542
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,600
So without a doubt, he has secured
the mayoral seat? Right?

543
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:38,160
Kim Moon Ho knows a lot of personal things about Kim Moon Sik, so a lot of fun things will be coming out.

544
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:43,910
The first in that series. How was his wealth accumulated?

545
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,890
Don't you think this sort of a beginning will be good?

546
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:53,560
My project direction is to suggest that this sort of person should not be Seoul's mayor.

547
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,620
Mom, let's eat lunch together. I'll tell you the location.
-Jeong Hoo

548
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,150
If you look in there, you'll see the materials I've researched.

549
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,290
It summarizes all the public figures whom Hwang Jae Gook entertained.

550
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:29,340
Thank you.

551
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,880
Look at the relationships. Following the money should be fastest.

552
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,190
Because, whatever relationship or power it is,
it's basically the dynamics of money.

553
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,750
I'm thinking of meeting the detective-in-charge first. The one who has suspicions.

554
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:47,030
That's good. Work on this with Park Bong Soo.

555
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,710
Teach him how to be a reporter.

556
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,450
I will properly teach him.

557
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:54,160
Park Bong Soo, let's go.

558
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,630
You said Chae Yeong Sin is in danger. Are you going to let her wander around on her own like this?

559
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:05,200
You said you'd protect her.

560
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,280
If you're tired, do you want a glass too?

561
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,560
Wow, seriously.

562
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:22,780
Anyway, it's already too late to run away
or hide her. We'll just have to counterattack.

563
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:25,430
You're going to leave Chae Yeong Sin knowing nothing?

564
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:31,050
I'm waiting for Ji An to come here on her own.

565
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,670
When the time comes, I'll probably be hit again.

566
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,090
If someone I knew had heard that, she would have said this:

567
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:46,360
"He even bullshits creatively".

568
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,140
Chae Yeong Sin. From Chae Yeong Sin.

569
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,980
Are you available for a call? I'd like to meet you.

570
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,500
Chae Yeong Sin. From Chae Yeong Sin.

571
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,740
Are you available for a call? I'd like to meet you.

572
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,570
I am looking for Seo Jeong Hoo.

573
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,910
I am looking for Seo Jeong Hoo.

574
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,740
I am looking for Seo Jeong Hoo.

575
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,140
Sunbae.

576
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,750
What?

577
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,890
It's nothing.

578
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:33,420
- Sunbae.
- What?

579
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,350
I have something to ask you...

580
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,330
Ask then.

581
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,110
So... By any chance...

582
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,030
Hello? Oh, Detective Yoon, hello.

583
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:52,210
Eh? Where? Ah, then we'll go that way.

584
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,300
It's not too far from here,

585
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,500
so when we get there, I'll contact you.

586
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,760
Yes.

587
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,300
There's something you need to see right now. Can you check your mail?

588
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,300
Park Bong Soo, can you go to Eastern Mall?

589
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,380
Do you have bad eyesight?

590
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,160
Yeah... sometimes I put them on when it's hard to see,

591
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,340
or if there's something I need to see...

592
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,860
I agreed to meet Detective Yoon at Eastern Mall.

593
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:22,860
How long will it take for us to get there?

594
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,320
There are e-mails coming in every 30 minutes.

595
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,600
New Mail

596
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,460
Hey.

597
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,880
Where?

598
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,340
Didn't you hear me?

599
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:43,220
I'm tracking your mom's cell phone.

600
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,360
But, Healer, this is definitely a trap.

601
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,620
So where?

602
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:51,400
I said Eastern Mall!

603
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Seongsan Rotary. Near Giah Station.

604
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,820
Park Bong Soo, we don't have to hurry. We can go slowly.

605
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,980
What's the fastest way to get there?

606
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,320
I don't know about that.

607
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,480
I think this is Kim Moon Sik's trap.

608
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,880
If you go like this, you're practically confessing that Seo Jeong Hoo is the Healer.

609
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,040
I'm contacting your teacher right now. I'll tell your teacher to look into this.

610
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,860
The fastest way to get there!

611
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,440
Right turn at the Royal Department Store.

612
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,560
Have you made a reservation?

613
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:32,040
- Yes.
- Yes. Please come this way.

614
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,940
- Please wait just a moment.
- Yes.

615
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,740
Oh, my! Father!

616
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:26,520
Healer. When you went to Kim Moon Sik's house you put a tracker in that secretary's car, right?

617
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,740
That guy's car is going where your mom is.

618
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:31,740
He's almost there.

619
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,100
Perhaps...

620
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,540
Do you remember me?

621
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,340
Lawyer Baek?

622
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,600
Another mail came. Another photo.

623
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,920
It must be your son's clothes.

624
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,120
Yes, my son dresses too coldly.

625
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,240
By son, which son are you referring to?

626
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:32,740
Oh, was your oldest son's name Jeong Hoo?

627
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,100
Do you contact that son often?

628
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,520
Sunbae, wait a second. I have somewhere I need to go right now.

629
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,120
Okay, go. I'll wait.

630
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,160
But what do you have so urgent ...

631
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:42,340
Excuse me, where did the person who was here go?

632
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,620
Oh, her? She left through the back door a moment ago.

633
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,740
Customer!

634
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,220
Ajumma, please track her. My mom isn't in the restaurant.

635
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,860
I think your mother has gone towards Secretary Oh's car. The signals are getting closer together.

636
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,500
Look through the parking lot. I'll get into that building's CCTV.

637
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,380
You're the person who reserved the seat, right?

638
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,540
She's already left.

639
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,560
What?

640
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,800
What's wrong with this? Hey! Hey! Hey!

641
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,620
No Signal
Disconnect

642
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,880
I shouldn't do this.

643
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,760
But it's an emergency, so it can't be helped.

644
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,840
Your mom is in Secretary Oh's car.

645
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,760
Ajumma, check the parking lot.

646
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,480
See if there's anyone waiting there.

647
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,080
I'm almost done. Just a second.

648
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,580
Ajumma.

649
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,080
What?

650
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,840
Wait, wait, wait!

651
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,260
Ah, damn it.

652
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,780
Ajumma!

653
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,960
I have to know what's happening inside.

654
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,220
Ajumma!

655
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,220
Yes!

656
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,320
Catch him.

657
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,960
Go this way.

658
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,000
What is this?

659
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,360
Oh no. It looks like the door is locked.

660
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:35,240
Hey, Healer. I'm really happy to see you again.

661
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,860
Why don't you show me your face?

662
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,220
Healer.

663
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:05,020
Hello?

664
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,240
Where are you, you punk?

665
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:09,900
Why are your vitals like that?

666
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,780
Answer your phone!

667
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,860
- Hello?
- Miss Chae Yeong Sin?

668
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,340
Yes, that's me.

669
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,780
You know Park Bong Soo, right?

670
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,120
Yes.

671
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:47,700
Can you find him?

672
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,780
I think he's in serious danger.

673
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:01,780
♬ Meeting you was fate. ♬

674
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:07,740
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine.  ♬

675
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:12,020
♬ As I can't go back  ♬

676
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:15,700
♬ to the time before loving you ♬

677
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:15,800
♬ I am returning to you ♬
