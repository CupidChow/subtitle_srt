Episode 11

2
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,740
Caller Number Suppressed
(Private Caller)

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,620
Hello?

4
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,160
Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

5
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,780
Who is this?

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,000
This is Healer, you know already, yes?

7
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,850
I heard that he doesn't do phone calls himself.

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,960
Exactly. This is something I usually don't do.

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,090
But I have something urgent to ask you.

10
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,670
Like this, face to face.

11
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,650
I will give you payment for the information. For example

12
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,030
I'll give you a free ticket to use my services as this field's best errand guy.

13
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,870
Can I hear the question first? The deal afterwards.

14
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,490
The photo inside that box.

15
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,390
You know the five people there, correct?

16
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,240
I know them.

17
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:37,200
Do you know what happened to those people in February 1992?

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,500
I know. As much as I've seen.

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,740
On what condition will you tell me?

20
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,310
Will you show me your face?

21
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,140
Hey there, that's-

22
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,180
Park Bong Soo.

23
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,460
This cell phone came out of the clothes of the reporter with that name.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,160
It's hard to see these nowadays, so I remember. It's Chae Young Sin's, isn't it?

25
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,620
She lost it in the elevator accident

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,100
and in that place was the person who made the accident and the Healer.

27
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,920
Park Bong Soo. I have to see your face once more.

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,990
Will you show me?

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,110
That is my condition for the deal.

30
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,790
Show me your face. Then I'll answer everything you want to know.

31
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,620
I've gotten attached to Someday Daily,

32
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,880
so I wanted to stay a little longer. What a shame.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,560
Then, shall we begin?

34
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,490
Of these five, which one do you want to know about?

35
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,290
The one on the far left... With the red clothes.

36
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,580
Seo Joon Seok.

37
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,060
Do you know what that person did

38
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,270
in 1992?

39
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,410
By any chance, do you know an island called Moru Moru?

40
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,390
What?

41
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,210
Because no one knows where it is

42
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,960
and no one knows its name, therefore, Moru Moru Island.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,500
(Moru = "don't know" in Korean)

44
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,660
The fact that I've revealed my face like this means I'm very serious, so...

45
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,760
It's Moru Moru Island! It's Moru Moru Island!

46
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,770
It's Moru Moru Island!

47
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,670
Continue speaking.

48
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,620
Not too long ago, my sister called me.

49
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,090
A thief broke in, but he looked so much like her old friend that she was surprised.

50
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,630
My sister probably remembers even better than I do.

51
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,890
Time stopped for her

52
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,910
in 1992.

53
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,470
I only know now that you look so similar.

54
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,890
The reason a night errand boy for whom secrecy is of utmost importance

55
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,020
would reveal his face

56
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:55,510
to learn about the person in this photo, Joon Seok...

57
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,490
You, with such similar eyes, Seo Jeong Hoo...

58
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:05,990
are you Jeong Hoo?

59
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:14,160
Jeong Hoo. Jeong Hoo. Play with me!

60
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,020
Jeong Hoo. Jeong Hoo. Jeong Hoo, let's play!

61
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:25,140
Stop running! If you guys keep running, I won't put you in the island.

62
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,000
It's Moru Moru Island!

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,840
That's right. No one knows where it is or its name, so Moru Moru Island.

64
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,100
Can I go in?

65
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,660
Not yet.

66
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,140
- Where is this?
- Moru Moru Island!

67
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,980
- An island where?
- No one knows!

68
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,500
- What is its name?
- Moru Moru Island!

69
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,970
I don't know its name either.

70
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,960
So, who wants to go to this island?

71
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,890
You have to play quietly on this island. You know that if you're loud, the pirates will come, right?

72
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,010
Yes.

73
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,800
That's mine!

74
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,880
Let's play together.

75
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,520
When they got together,

76
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,200
they would drink all night or talk, and so

77
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
it was always me who took care of you all.

78
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,780
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't drink with anyone.

79
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,480
You guys were close with me too.

80
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:00,210
But that "you guys". Me

81
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,800
and a girl? One whose age is similar to mine?

82
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:10,510
Yes. Gil Han had a daughter.

83
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,970
- That girl...
- Died.

84
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,870
She died in 1992.

85
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,540
So many people died that year.

86
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,230
What should I start with about that day?

87
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,240
Who is the person my father killed?

88
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,870
Did no one tell you?

89
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,300
Yes, my social connections are rather poor.
So who is it?

90
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,640
But the person

91
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,380
that my father killed--

92
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,570
Oh Gil Han.

93
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes, it was one of the five friends.

94
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,630
He killed

95
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,230
a friend?

96
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,400
But your question is incorrect.

97
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,340
Your father was just a murder suspect, not a murderer.

98
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,270
Do you know the difference?

99
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,050
I know. I've had it happen to me as well.

100
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,560
But before he was able to have
that false charge cleared, he died.

101
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,730
Because of that, your father continues
to be a murder suspect from then until now.

102
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,550
Do you want to clear that false charge?

103
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,020
Is that why you came to see me?

104
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,000
He says we can work together if I want to clear my father's name. He says he'll help.

105
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,490
So?

106
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,660
I'm planning on continuing to work as Park Bong Soo at Someday Daily. He says to stay at his side.

107
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,300
I'm opposed to that idea.

108
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,300
I didn't like Kim Moon Ho from the beginning. You saw too.

109
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,360
He's someone who can always easily tell lies that sound like the truth.

110
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,720
I also don't approve of the fact that you revealed your face in front of someone like him.

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,120
He said he played with me when I was young. And

112
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,450
I think I remember too.

113
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,770
Let me ask you something. Why is it so important

114
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,710
to clear your father's name of that murder accusation now?

115
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,060
Will your father send a letter of appreciation from the heaven?

116
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,050
Using a parcel delivery service?

117
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,390
- That is...
- That's what?

118
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,420
I want to talk.

119
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,860
I've started to want to to tell Chae Yeong Sin

120
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,340
that I'm actually a thief.

121
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,200
But saying that my father is a murderer is a bit...

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,270
That's completely different.

123
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,700
You want to say what to whom?

124
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,580
You were the one who said that if it was a woman, who would follow me to the uninhabited island, it would be okay.

125
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,620
That I can start that.

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,460
I think it will be okay if I tell Chae Yeong Sin

127
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,030
who I am and ask if she can come with me.

128
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,900
At first, she'll probably try to beat me up for lying to her up till now.

129
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:39,380
She'll probably kick and hit me. I can take a few hits.

130
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,210
But,

131
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,580
I think she'll get over it soon.

132
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,300
That's what she's like. She'll sing a strange song

133
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,620
and dance an outrageous dance. She'll get over it quickly.

134
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,740
Ajumma, are you listening?

135
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,340
I know what you're thinking, Ajumma.

136
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,680
"Healer, this rascal, is done now. I would have
to find another guy now. Aigoo, so bothersome."

137
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,920
I know. I know, but...

138
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,460
it's only until I clear my father's name.

139
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:28,480
Something makes me uneasy.
Something keeps bothering me.

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,740
So,

141
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,620
watch my back for just a little longer.

142
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,580
I'll do well too. Okay?

143
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,500
Ajumma.

144
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,640
"This is Chae Yeong Sin."
(Log of Healer's e-mail messages.)

145
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
- Reporter Chae Yeong Sin!
- Oh, you scared me!

146
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,800
What are you doing there? It's a mess right now!

147
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,020
- What mess?
- Didn't you get the call?

148
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,860
What call?

149
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,420
Hwang Jae Gook committed suicide.

150
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,720
Wait...wait! Hwang Jae Gook? You mean that Hwang Jae Gook?

151
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,740
- Yes.
- Wait, he's not the sort of person to do that. You're joking, right?

152
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,600
For real? Let's go together.

153
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,710
Since 11 last night, (the server of) Someday Daily has been completely down because of the traffic.

154
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,260
How can you still not have fixed that?

155
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,360
What investigation report are they releasing? Since when have those police guys worked so hard like that, huh?

156
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,030
When you go there, there would be a photo line. Get the best seat in front and secure the angle.

157
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,020
When you get the chance to ask a question, go for it no matter what.

158
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,800
But, I don't know what question I should ask.

159
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,480
Take notes.

160
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,480
Park Bong Soo, what kind of situation is going on out there?

161
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,140
I heard Hwang Jae Gook committed suicide. That's not because of me, is it?

162
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,440
It can't be, right? Hey!

163
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,330
Why is he acting like that again?

164
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,280
I'll be back.

165
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,980
I'll be back.

166
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,220
I think the server host keeps pushing things off and making excuses.

167
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,060
It doesn't make sense that they still haven't been able to deal with the traffic.

168
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,660
How about we procure our own server?

169
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,360
If we consider that outsiders (higher-up officials)
can suppress us anyway, that's useless.

170
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,720
What solutions can you think of?

171
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,360
There's also that solution of securing servers overseas.

172
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,740
Let's do that. Let's move.

173
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,960
Right now?

174
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,600
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yes.

175
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,360
Joo Yeon Hee is at your house, right?

176
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,580
Yes, she's at my house.

177
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,200
Joo Yeon Hee's name is in Hwang Jae Gook's suicide note.

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,340
Reporters are probably looking for Joo Yeon Hee.

179
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,080
Before they find her, get an exclusive interview first and then hide Joo Yeon Hee.

180
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,800
Get an interview, and hide her. Roger.

181
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,080
- Park Bong Soo.
- Jong Soo.

182
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,620
- Yes, Sunbae.
- Follow Chae Yeong Sin. You can film.

183
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,520
Okay.

184
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,420
With him...

185
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,040
Park Bong Soo.

186
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,900
- Ah, yes.
- Prepare to go out.

187
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,040
You're going to move with me.

188
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,620
Yes, I'll prepare right away.

189
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,780
Why?

190
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,840
Hey, Park Bong Soo. Are you avoiding me?

191
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,180
Are you...doing this because of what we talked about at that secret place?

192
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,980
Sunbae.

193
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,160
Yeah, let's talk through this. I don't want to be so uncomfortable with you.

194
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,740
Can you move?

195
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,900
I have to go out, and your hand is on my backpack.

196
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,420
Thanks.

197
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:50,340
Hey. Do you not want to talk to me?

198
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,000
That's right.

199
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,860
Let's go.

200
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,640
Are you not going?

201
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
I should have noticed right away.

202
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,580
That could have never happened.

203
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,980
I should have been suspicious when I heard the name Healer.

204
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,500
Yes, it shows up in a lot of online games. Healer.

205
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
I met your mother once.

206
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,860
It was hard to find her,

207
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,080
and she said you were studying abroad.

208
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,460
Are you going to keep doing that?

209
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,880
Pretending to be close?

210
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,740
Can I ask how you ended up as a night errand boy?

211
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:50,680
Naturally, I don't intend on responding, Boss.

212
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,960
You used to call me uncle.

213
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,540
Do you not remember?

214
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,120
What I hate the most

215
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,480
is someone talking to me when I eat, sleep, or drive. That...

216
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,520
Ah...

217
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,880
It makes me mad.

218
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,460
This is the junkyard that my family used to run.

219
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,720
To those five friends, it was like a hideout.

220
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,760
Those five people did something like a pirate broadcast.

221
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,340
It was a time when you could get caught for saying a wrong word at a bar.

222
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,880
They were very brave.

223
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,140
Do you know anything about that time?

224
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:04,440
I don't know. And I also don't really want to know.

225
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,740
Can you get straight to the point?

226
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,600
Over there. They met right about there.

227
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,040
Your father was always fixing some machine.

228
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,420
Gil Han and Myeong Hee were writing the next broadcast script or laughing.

229
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,620
The scenes I remember were always that way. They were laughing and on good terms.

230
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,780
It was warm.

231
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,060
So. That was when?

232
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,780
- 1981.
- 1981.

233
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,660
From 1981 until 1992, when he died,

234
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,600
you're not possibly thinking of going in chronological order, are you?

235
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,620
Let's not do that.

236
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,320
That feeling of meeting someone you haven't met for a long time, or when you want to know how that person's doing...

237
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,780
Do you not know that feeling?

238
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,900
Do I need to know that?

239
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,780
Do you have any friends?

240
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,060
Is there someone who asks if you have any friends?

241
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,540
I cannot trust you yet, Boss.

242
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,400
You threw money at a night errand boy like me, and did background investigation on someone.

243
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,540
Then you bought the company where that person is working, and up until now, you hear that person call you "Sunbae".

244
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,480
But you haven't said anything to the person involved.

245
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,440
I want to ask why you looked for Chae Yeong Sin and what this is all about,

246
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,340
but since it's part of my job's policy to not ask about customers' secrets, I won't ask any more.

247
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,370
so you stop too, Boss.

248
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you going to do after finding out about my friends?

249
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,420
It's not here anymore,

250
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,160
but on that area, there was the junkyard's office.

251
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,620
This junkyard back then was
owned and ran by my brother.

252
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,460
On that day in 1992...

253
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,800
Hyung Gil Han and Hyung Joon Seok came to visit.

254
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,660
Hello, hyungs.

255
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,980
Those two were a quite famous reporter combo at the time.

256
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,260
Hyung Gil Han wrote articles, and your father, Joon Seok, took pictures.

257
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,640
I heard they got a lot of exclusives.

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,940
The tip is true, no doubt.

259
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,740
The slush fund is going to move tomorrow.
We're going to follow them secretly.

260
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,260
We're planning on seeing who the recipient of the money is.

261
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,280
We can't just look. I have to take pictures of it.

262
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,540
I'll take pictures, and win a photography award this year.

263
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,140
That's why we're here to borrow a car. Lend us a useful guy.

264
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,780
We have to chase it.

265
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,060
You saw it in movies, right?
Car action, yeah!

266
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,780
Please! How is everything in the world fun to you?

267
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,260
Is it no fun? But I'm having so much fun!

268
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,360
I just have to lend you a car?

269
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,360
Of course not.

270
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,520
If we leave Driver King Kim Moon Sik out of the equation, it's going to be a car melodrama, not car action!

271
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,340
Stop it. It's not funny.

272
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,700
It's not funny? But, car melo...
Car... Camera...

273
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,220
The next day, they were in a car my brother was driving,

274
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,420
and the three of them left together.
And then...

275
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,080
Hyung Gil Han was dead, and your father...

276
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,760
on the charge of killing that hyung, was arrested.

277
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,760
How about the other person?

278
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,120
Your brother?

279
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,400
He was the witness to that murder case.

280
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,220
What we have to find is Hyung Joon Seok's testimony on that day he was arrested.

281
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,980
On the investigation records, Hyung Joon Seok definitely

282
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,380
would have talked about that day's incident.

283
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,520
But?

284
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,320
I've been investigating here and there, but

285
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,780
I keep getting blocked.

286
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,000
They said they can't show me the investigation records.

287
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,660
The autopsy results were lost.

288
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,220
These are everything I've investigated so far.
I'm giving everything to you.

289
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,260
Be careful.

290
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,760
- I will.
- I also couldn't trust you.

291
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,000
I've been fooled too many times.

292
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,440
The people whom I had hired
went over to my enemy the next day.

293
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,500
That's why, I told the police.

294
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,580
Healer would be beside Chae Yeong Sin.

295
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,300
- That's why probably--
- Yes, I saw.

296
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:16,420
Those people following Chae Yeong Sin?

297
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,180
But can I leave work early today?

298
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,480
President? I have a lot to investigate.

299
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,420
Okay.

300
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,720
Seoul Police Station

301
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,440
What?

302
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,860
What is this? Is it finished already?

303
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,560
What--

304
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,240
Why is it so fast?

305
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,160
It can't be faster than this.

306
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,440
The autopsy results for President Hwang Jae Gook are already out.

307
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,740
The test for the drug we're suspecting
that he used for suicide is already out too.

308
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,740
That drug is exactly what killed Go Seong Cheol.

309
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,160
See? There's also the train ticket.

310
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,140
In conclusion, Hwang Jae Gook killed Go Seong Cheol.

311
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,160
The end.

312
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,100
And? So you're going to wrap up the case?

313
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,460
Yes. It's all over.

314
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,580
Ah, seriously.

315
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, now that the case is solved this quickly,

316
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,660
should I at least congratulate you?

317
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,380
Congratulate, my ass.
It's not only that.

318
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,120
Hwang Jae Gook's suicide note is
like a huge gift basket.

319
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,480
That suicide note...

320
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,780
There were a few names in that suicide note, right?

321
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,480
There was also Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan.

322
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,400
Something about offering and accepting bribes from those people and whatnot.

323
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,740
Healer, that guy... He seems to have
held hands with the very higher-ups.

324
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,800
The people who can easily solve
the problem of being a murder suspect...

325
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,900
Then, is it that guy again, Healer?

326
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,620
It's been five years. I told you...

327
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:57,480
that he f***s me over in this way.

328
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:07,220
Resident Registration Number
Park Bong Soo

329
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,680
At his own house in Daechidong, Gangnam,

330
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,220
President Hwang of Empire Costruction was
found dead by his security guard.

331
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,320
In his study where the corpse was found, the drug and a suicide note were also discovered.

332
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,100
In his suicide note, he admitted to prostituting women to influential men

333
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,660
and getting favors from them in return.

334
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,620
The police will form a special investigation team...

335
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,500
- Yes, I got it.
and without any limit,

336
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,280
we will investigate thoroughly...

337
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,640
Father, Yeon Hee, is all ready?

338
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:54,520
The case of you and Hwang Jae Gook will be
closed as no right of arraignment.

339
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,680
It's a problem how Kim Ui Chan is going to come out.

340
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,340
Don't worry about anything for now, and just stay at Sokcho.

341
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,880
The son of that family almost went to prison,

342
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,300
but our Hyungnim saved him for free.

343
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,420
If you go there, you'll be taken care of.

344
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,980
If they possibly make you upset, just give me a call right away.

345
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,980
To me, I will run to you right away
and show them what's the proper way to replay...

346
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,720
I would teach them--

347
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,520
Aigoo. How do you not know when to stop?

348
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,620
I'm done, done.

349
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,340
Let's go. I'll take you to the terminal.

350
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,320
Attorney.

351
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,380
It's a request.

352
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,220
Let's not do things like thanking.

353
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,180
I find those tiring.

354
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,360
Thank you.

355
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,320
Yes.

356
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,460
Ah, I'm also not keen on thanking as well.
Let's just call it even between us--

357
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,280
I won't forget you for the rest of my life.

358
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,040
You can't forget me. You don't know
when I'll go find you and tell you to pay back.

359
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,620
Welcome.

360
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,080
What do you want?

361
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,400
If it's just coffee, I can make it.

362
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,900
If it's something complicated, then I'd have to call for someone--

363
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
Is Chae Yeong Sin here?

364
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,120
Huh?

365
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,000
I heard she came here a while ago.

366
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,700
- Please come in.
- Yes.

367
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,260
Please have a seat over here.

368
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,960
Wow, this is new.

369
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,580
A combination of a cafe and a legal office.

370
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,300
This is my father's job, and the other one...
well, you can say it's his hobby.

371
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,320
President Hwang Jae Gook is dead.

372
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,800
Yes. I was also surprised.

373
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,840
You father works as a lawyer, right?

374
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,560
Does he also secretly record those who come for legal advice here?

375
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,020
Impossible. No, he does not.

376
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,860
Here's one.

377
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:13,820
And to film the room without any blind spots,
over here would be a nice place.

378
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,800
Ah! Here.

379
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,860
Two.

380
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,400
What kind of bastard is it to put these in someone else's--

381
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,680
Is it the first time you're seeing these?

382
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,460
Why did you come here?

383
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,380
And how did you know
there are things like this here?

384
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,780
You know Healer, right?

385
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,900
Someone gave us a tip.

386
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,880
That Healer would be beside you.

387
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,580
Do you not know that?

388
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,300
I know Healer. The night errand guy.

389
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,080
He's very expensive, and nobody has seen his face.
I know that much.

390
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,300
An important video from President Hwang Jae Gook's house has gone missing.

391
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,300
But, that video has popped up at Someday News.

392
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,500
And then now Hwang Jae Gook is dead.

393
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,240
Interesting, isn't it?

394
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,600
Which part of that is?

395
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,240
It's my understanding that the Healer got the video out of Hwang Jae Gook's house.

396
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:18,250
So, about Hwang Jae Gook's death,
maybe (he killed him as well), no?

397
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,170
From what I hear, the Healer does not hurt people.

398
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,690
Hmm. I guess your information hasn't been updated yet.

399
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,340
We think of the Healer as the suspect in at least two murder cases.

400
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,020
But what's more interesting is that Hwang Jae Gook

401
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,830
confessed that the Healer's first alleged murder was his doing

402
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,840
in his suicide note even though no one asked.

403
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,570
- But?
- Huh?

404
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,720
You are a reporter, no? Please think a bit.

405
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:59,600
So. Don't you think someone might have sat next to him and told him what to write in that suicide note?

406
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,310
Or, maybe it was written in his place? That's what I imagine.

407
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,230
Ok, let's see. What is this?

408
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:36,040
There's something that looks like Kim Moon Ho's notes on the news, and there are

409
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,580
Newspaper articles, and...

410
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,460
What's this?

411
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,930
Healer.

412
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:53,620
Ahh, the names of the police station, prosecutor and detectives who were in charge of that case are written here.

413
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,100
A mail came.

414
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,210
It's actually been a while since it came, but I've been thinking about it.

415
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,560
Ahjumma. I won't take any other job until I have finished this.

416
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,370
So please understand.

417
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:09,790
The sender is C Y S @

418
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,580
S O M E D A Y

419
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,610
You read it, Ajumma.

420
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,290
I should read it?

421
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,430
Since when did I read them myself?
What's with you this time?

422
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:22,810
E-mail Subject: I am Chae Yeong Sin.

423
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,510
If I have a request to Healer, I don't know what process I have to go through,

424
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,140
or how much money is needed.

425
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,890
Wait, stop, stop, stop. I'll read it. I'll read it. Send it to me.

426
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,460
Send it to me Ajumma.

427
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:51,160
♬ It feels like you’re mine, although you're not,
it seems like you’re mine, ♬

428
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:58,530
♬ It feels like I'm yours, although I'm not,
it seems like I'm yours ♬

429
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,380
What the heck.
Ajumma

430
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:08,660
If this mail is really reaching you, Healer, I have no way of knowing.

431
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,280
But I'm still writing it.

432
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:28,040
I am Chae Yeong Sin. I have to meet you, Healer.
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

433
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,820
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

434
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,570
If you tell me not to look, I will cover my eyes again.
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

435
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,930
♬ Together you and I ♬

436
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,950
♬ Such a rush of emotions ♬

437
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:49,160
♬ There's no way we can push it away ♬

438
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,520
If you tell me not to say anything, I won't make any sound and stay still.
♬ 'Cause they'll never tear our love apart ♬

439
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,540
♬ Our bond will never break ♬

440
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:02,800
What I want is that you hear my words and come to me.
♬ Do you believe in the power ♬

441
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:06,110
That you are watching my back from somewhere.
♬ Of everlasting love? ♬

442
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:10,750
It would be nice if I could just know that. That much is enough.
♬ We can make it if we stay together ♬

443
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:16,730
So, this is also a date request.

444
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:19,350
Will you accept it?

445
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,190
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

446
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,350
So, what will you do?
♬ We'll always stay this way ♬

447
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,880
You're really going on a date? You shouldn't.

448
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:38,920
You said this with your own mouth. That you won't approach Chae Yeong Sin until your father's issue is cleanly taken care of.

449
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,390
She said she'll cover her eyes. And it's okay not to talk.
♬ Oh my love ♬

450
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:45,680
She wrote that herself.
♬ I'm all yours ♬

451
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,570
Where does such an awful date exist in the world?
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

452
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,500
Why? What?

453
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,840
Let's face it. Objectively, Chae Yeong Sin is alright.
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

454
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,710
Her father's profession is okay, and she has a steady job.
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

455
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,990
Her personality is not that bad either, just a bit weird sometimes.
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

456
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,410
Her looks? Superior level.
♬ My love will always grow ♬

457
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:14,700
What are you talking about? Ajumma, I...
♬ And I won't let go ♬

458
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Shut up and listen to the end. If she's like that,

459
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:22,830
she can meet a good guy with a good personality
and a stable job without any problem.

460
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,170
Someone who will happily take care
of his wife and children for his entire life,

461
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,550
moving into bigger apartments and buying annuity insurance.

462
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,920
There are many guys she can live together with like this. But . . .

463
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,160
A guy like you, who hasn't shown her his face,
who can't even tell her his real name,

464
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,120
and who can't say anything other than ask her to go with him to some uninhabited island,

465
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,000
why would a guy like you shake her heart?

466
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:51,030
If I show her, it will be alright, no? Things like my face.
♬ And do it all again ♬

467
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,620
Hey, you dog poop! If Chae Yeong Sin knows Healer's face, will she keep her mouth shut towards the police?

468
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,450
If she does, she'll become an accomplice immediately.

469
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,960
Should I tell you what the penalty for such a crime is?
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

470
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,410
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

471
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,340
That's why, Healer. Don't do it.
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

472
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,370
Just let her be.
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

473
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,160
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

474
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,510
But she asked. I have to answer.
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

475
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,400
♬ My love will always grow ♬

476
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,270
My answer...

477
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,510
♬ My eternal love. ♬

478
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,440
The person who provided the information was very concerned for your safety.

479
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,670
Of course, it would have been more favorable for me to stake out quietly near you to catch the Healer,

480
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,350
but I was worried. I'm an expert on the Healer.

481
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:14,150
He has no sense of good or evil, social justice, patriotism, or devotion to the people.

482
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,640
He's just on the side of whomever has more money.

483
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,550
Someone like that has also begun to murder.

484
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,860
It's scary, no?

485
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,480
How dates work is that...

486
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,490
Honey, it's cold, right?

487
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:20,660
First, you have to walk together.

488
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,640
You laugh together and chat.

489
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,700
Sometimes fighting, walking together like this.
♬ Love, it isn't just a dream ♬

490
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,680
♬ Now that you are everything to me ♬

491
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,530
If we walk for a while, we'll get hungry.

492
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:41,960
Then we'll have to eat.
"What will we eat?" "I'll take this."

493
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,300
"No, I want that."
"How can you always say to eat only what you like?"

494
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,840
"Hey, when did I?"
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

495
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,760
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

496
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,750
If you're on a date, you have to watch a movie. You don't like places with lots of people, do you?

497
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:06,580
Then... how about a midnight showing? There aren't that many people, and even if there are people, it's dark.

498
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:12,330
What sort of movies do you like? It's not okay if we don't get to sit next to each other, so

499
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,610
let's watch the same movie.

500
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:24,450
This Friday night, I'll wait at the theatre.

501
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:27,870
How long should I wait?

502
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,870
♬ And together we'll sail through it all ♬

503
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,540
Welcome, Chae Yeong Sin.

504
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,120
What kind of movie do you like?

505
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,700
Classic masterpieces to current showings

506
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,760
comedies, melodramas, action. Just say what you want!

507
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,280
Well, it's hard to say...

508
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,840
Can we choose the one
with the longest running time?

509
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:22,600
♫  The memories of meeting you are a dream like lie ♫

510
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:29,400
♫  I'm still waiting here for you ♫

511
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,400
♫  Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♫

512
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,000
♫  As you look at me ♫

513
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,800
♫ Why can't I say anything? ♫

514
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:56,060
♫  When I have so much I want to say. ♫

515
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,160
♫  The moment you turn around ♫

516
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,760
♫  Why are you so distant toward me? ♫

517
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,720
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

518
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:16,560
♫  I love you, there's only you ♫

519
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,100
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you.  ♬

520
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:30,320
♫  Even if I can't touch you,
Even if i can't hug you, or
Even if I cry by myself, it's okay ♫

521
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:37,180
♫  I'll always be looking at you ♫

522
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,080
♫  It's you ♫

523
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:34,220
♬ Meeting you was fate.

524
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,200
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine.  ♬

525
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:48,000
♬ As I can't go back to the time before loving you,  ♬

526
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,000
♬ I am returning to you ♬

527
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,800
♫  I love you, there's only you ♫

528
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,280
♬ There isn't anyone else but you. ♬

529
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,580
♫  Even though I can't touch you, hug you, or cry by myself, it's okay ♫

530
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:22,320
♫  I'll always be looking at you ♫

531
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:31,260
♬ Come back to me. ♬

532
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:37,740
♬ There isn't anyone else but you. ♬

533
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:45,080
♬ Even if I can't have you.
Even if I can't say anything,
I love you like this.  ♬

534
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:51,960
♫  I'll always be looking at you ♫

535
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,820
♫  It's you ♫

536
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,260
There's a car prepared in front of the theater. They'll take her home safely.

537
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:12,640
So, from doing a reply what...

538
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:12,960
President Kim Moon Sik.

539
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,860
Oh, Assemblyman. What brings you here without notice?

540
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,060
Do you think I don't know what's going on right now?

541
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,460
You're going in to sink me and take my place?

542
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,040
When did you start planning this?

543
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,240
Kim Moon Ho, your younger brother,

544
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,840
that bastard always talks about progressivism
or whatnot, like a commie, but

545
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,340
in reality he was your agent, right?

546
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:40,260
You used your brother to stop me

547
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,000
and used your sly tongue to move the Elder behind my back!

548
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,640
Damn, you wicked bastard!

549
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,920
Hey! Hey!

550
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,780
Where are you going?

551
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:59,500
I think the Assemblyman is a bit worked up. Let him rest

552
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,220
and escort him on his way out.

553
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,960
I am Kim Ui Chan! Do you think I'll go down for a mere betrayal like this?

554
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:10,280
No way! The Elder isn't that easy person
who would be fooled by you, Kim Moon Sik!

555
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,760
And all that loyalty I've been offering to him so far,

556
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,400
it's something you can't even imagine.

557
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,500
Let me go!

558
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,160
A call from Healer came.

559
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,080
'I heard about the results.

560
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,980
The video in question will be destroyed, as promised.'

561
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,100
Destroy? Don't we have to get it back?

562
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,180
This is what he said.

563
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:46,640
The video he showed you was everything he had.

564
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,560
He's also apologizing for the ruckus he caused.

565
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,060
Should I check if he's telling the truth, or--

566
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,920
I would have to have him. Healer.

567
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,500
It wouldn't be easy. Because we've framed him as a murderer last time--

568
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:09,180
Find a way. He's in a contract with Moon Ho, right?

569
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,660
It seems so.

570
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:12,520
It's always been like that, right?

571
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,500
For a person I have to have,
we put a lot of effort,

572
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,960
and if doesn't work, you take care of it. Let's just do it according to how it's usually done.

573
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,280
I understand.

574
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,760
What about Madam?

575
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,560
She went to meet Joon Seok's wife.

576
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,200
Did you tell her?

577
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,860
When you don't even know what his wife would tell her.

578
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,680
My wife said she wants to meet her.

579
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,460
It was something someone who doesn't ask for much asked me. I have to do it for her.

580
00:49:54,810 --> 00:49:57,320
Please have some tea.

581
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,720
Okay.

582
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,340
Jeong Hoo's mom, please look at me.

583
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,320
How could I? With what right can I look at you?

584
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,560
If I knew you were going to act like this,
I shouldn't have asked you meet me.

585
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,840
How did you find me?

586
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,200
I did my best to hide myself.

587
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,260
Until now, I... I still live with the photo of the five of us beside my bed.

588
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,880
If I suspected Joon Seok, Jeong Hoo's father, for even a moment, I wouldn't do that, would I?

589
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,600
Seeing how you would say it like that...

590
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,480
I know how much you trust him.

591
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,120
But the world doesn't.

592
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:43,060
They say that he killed his friend and ended his own life.

593
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,340
How do I win against the world?

594
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,280
Jeong Hoo's mom.

595
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:50,480
My husband killed your husband. That's what they said.

596
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,860
That's why you can't come find me and ask me to meet you like this.

597
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:58,920
What do you want me to do?

598
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,020
I saw a man who looks a lot like Joon Seok not too long ago.

599
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:18,180
That's why I thought of you.

600
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:23,720
I know that at that time, you left for Jeong Hoo's sake

601
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,920
in order to not to let him be scorned by the people.

602
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,340
I know that you left your young son to avoid that.

603
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,920
I also lost a child.

604
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,980
I wanted to meet with you and talk to you.

605
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,460
We were close back then, weren't we?

606
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,980
- Myeong Hee.
- Yes.

607
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:49,600
My Jeong Hoo... hearing that he's a son of a murderer,

608
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:55,200
of course I hated that as well...
but no.

609
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,640
That wasn't everything.

610
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,760
I wanted to clear Jeong Hoo's father's name,

611
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,160
so I went around and did anything I could.

612
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,760
But, someone suddenly came to me.

613
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,440
Telling me to just do nothing.

614
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,720
If I don't want to hurt Jeong Hoo, just do nothing.

615
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:21,940
Who? Who said that?

616
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,940
You live with him.

617
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,520
I thought you would also know about that.

618
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,640
Good morning!

619
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:45,680
- Where is everyone?
- I don't know because I'm too busy.

620
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,420
I think I am doing too much work compared to how much monthly salary I receive.

621
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,940
But, because I don't complain,
everybody thinks it's a given.

622
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,040
People need to express their complaints
at every chance, indeed.

623
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,000
- Chief.
- Chief is busy.

624
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,420
- Where is everyone?
- Everyone is out to gather data, after being instructed.

625
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,120
Except for someone who is 25 minutes late.

626
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,600
- Did Park Bong Soo go too?
- Park Bong Soo?

627
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:11,580
The boss gave Park Bong Soo a secret order.

628
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,900
That's ridiculous. You've noticed it too, right Chief?

629
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,780
They're strangely close. What is it?
Why are they close? Huh?

630
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,700
They don't have any similarities, and they don't understand each other well.

631
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,680
You're overflowing with energy today.
That's good.

632
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,580
Come over here, and let's divide up the search articles.

633
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,040
Hey, Chae Yeong Sin! That brat, seriously...

634
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,340
She's always too consistent (at ignoring me).

635
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,340
What's going on?

636
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:41,440
From my investigation, the records security room of that police station has the records of your father's case.

637
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,240
Because it's a case from the 90s,
it's probably kept as actual documents.

638
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:49,240
But you wouldn't get it through ordinary means, right?

639
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,100
If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to do it at night?

640
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,980
It's difficult to do it at night because the security would be tight.

641
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:57,260
Let's just do as we usually do.

642
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,800
I'm searching through the database right now, so just look for a hole to get in.

643
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,520
Welcome.

644
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:29,840
What the hell? What's going on?

645
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,680
- You're going to the security room, right?
- Yes.

646
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,900
These as well, please.

647
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:08,680
- I'm sorry.
- Are you alright?

648
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,640
I'm sorry.

649
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,820
No, Son Heung Min scored 12 goals when he was with Hamburg,

650
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,900
but now with Leverkusen, he's still at 11 goals.

651
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,320
Ah right, right. Hamburg.

652
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,320
I keep getting confused.

653
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,760
This way. Be careful.

654
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,880
106: Document Room

655
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,520
Seo Joon Seok's case is #92-8273.

656
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,640
Find first the files for 1992.

657
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,060
Case Records
#92-8273

658
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,780
Case Records

659
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,660
There's nothing? No testimonies, or police investigation records?

660
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,600
It's what I thought.

661
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,320
They took it out early.

662
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,420
When you say "someone" took out the files...

663
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,640
that means we have to find out who "someone" is.

664
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,320
Although I have a few people in my mind...

665
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,900
I am not sure who exactly is among them.

666
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,650
Then, we have to find out.

667
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,880
What are you thinking?

668
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,560
I'm thinking of doing it well.

669
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,520
Jeong Hoo.

670
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,440
What are you going to do?

671
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,540
The case records...
You said they show it to immediate family.

672
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,820
Are you out of your mind?

673
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:08,780
I'm immediate family, right?
My father's immediate family.

674
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,520
You've gone crazy. You finally--

675
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,580
Resident Identification Number
Seo Jeong Hoo

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,780
You are Seo Jeong Hoo, right?

679
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:46,260
Yes, I'm Seo Jeong Hoo.

Inaccessible Document
Detaining the requester is required

683
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,440
Yes, please talk.

684
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,800
Please wait a moment.

685
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,800
President.

686
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,460
Someone has appeared looking for the records of Seo Joon Seok.

687
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,780
W-who?

688
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,080
It's Seo Joon Seok's son.

689
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,740
What instruction should I give?

690
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,760
Seo Jeong Hoo?

691
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,600
- Is it here?
- Yes.

Someday News

693
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,220
I just have to buy half meat dumplings and half kimchi dumplings, right?

694
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,300
You have to reimburse it this time!

695
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:25,720
If you try to get by again...How many times has it been?

696
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:28,940
Until when do I have to do dumpling errands?
Geez, seriously.

697
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,140
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin?

698
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,060
Yes?

699
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:37,020
I'm Kim Moon Sik, Reporter Kim Moon Ho's brother.

700
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,860
Ah, so you're Je Il's Newspaper's....?

701
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,420
I've heard a lot about you, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

702
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:46,820
Oh. Hello.

703
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:28,780
♬ Meeting you was fate  ♬

704
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:34,720
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine ♬

705
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:42,580
♬ As I can't go back to the time before loving you ♬

706
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,700
♬ I am returning to you ♬

707
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,700
You're Seo Joon Seok's son, right?

708
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,700
I saw this person before.

709
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,620
Why didn't you tell me who Chae Yeong Sin is?

710
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,860
Because I had to protect that child.

711
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,100
I like Chae Yeong Sin.

712
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,200
Don't tell me to run away.

713
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,160
How could you meet that child, Hyung?

714
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,780
When you're not quivering, and you're not on your knees.

715
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:10,600
Seo Jeong Hoo, that child. Did you bring him in?

716
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,740
What have you guys done?

717
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,660
What have you done to us?!

718
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,480
Healer! You rascal, where are you?

719
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:20,200
♬ The more bruised my heart... ♬
