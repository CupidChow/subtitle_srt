1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,200
Oh, this bastard, you give me quite a familiar impression.

2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,660
Hey. Aren't you the guy
whom our CEO really wants to see?

3
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,040
Episode 5

4
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,490
Hey Partner, see you again.

5
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,860
How many?

6
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,080
Two pills...

7
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,180
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

8
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,580
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

9
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,740
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

10
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,000
♬ Together you and I ♬

11
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,650
♬ Do you believe in the power ♬

12
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:11,480
♬ Of everlasting love? ♬

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,370
♬ We can make it if we stay together ♬

14
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,830
♬ Our love is just enough ♬

15
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,310
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

16
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,120
♬ We'll always stay this way ♬

17
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,000
♬ We can start at the end of time ♬

18
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,970
♬ And do it all again ♬

19
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,620
♬ Oh my love ♬

20
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,330
♬ I'm all yours ♬

21
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,050
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

22
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,500
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

23
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,630
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

24
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,780
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

25
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,030
Miss, are you alright? Were you the one who reported?

26
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,300
Oh...

27
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,570
♬ And I won't let go ♬

28
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,030
Where's the boy who reported?

29
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,520
Pardon?

30
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,820
Park Bong Sook, is he still here?

31
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,570
Bong Sook! Park Bong Soo!

32
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,740
Is there anyone else who was assaulted?

33
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,240
Would you come to the police station to file the report, or would you like to look for him?

34
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,670
Bong Soo!

35
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,970
Father, did Bong Soo go there?

36
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,660
The kid suddenly disappeared, and I don't know his phone number.

37
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,330
- Excuse me, Miss.
- Dad, nothing happened to Yeon Hee, right?

38
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,290
Father, please stay by Yeon Hee's side.
I'll be right there.

39
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,060
Yes.

40
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,620
Ah. Where could he be?

41
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,490
Were there really some gangsters?

42
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,070
You should tell me!

43
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,140
Wait a moment, please.
My junior has disappeared.

44
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,580
Then, is it not assault, but kidnapping?

45
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,960
Bong Sook!
Park Bong Soo!

46
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,350
Park Bong Soo!

47
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,030
Bong Sook!

48
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,580
Park Bong Soo!

49
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,030
Bong Sook!

50
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,580
Park Bong Soo!

51
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,610
Park Bong Soo!

52
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,920
Minion

53
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,780
Mr. Reporter arrived an hour ago,

54
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,160
and then he ate dinner with some woman
and is now doing the dishes.

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,840
Jeez, I'm hungry.

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
But, is this his house?

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,520
Seems like a reporter makes a lot of money.

58
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,940
The house is really...

59
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,900
It's like the old days.
There are a lot of leftovers.

60
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,560
My hands are usually big (makes big servings).

61
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,680
Your brother didn't come home today,
so there's a lot more left.

62
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,380
You're always making food
for one more person, aren't you?

63
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,140
Just disregard it. Pretend you don't know.

64
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,670
Can I talk about THAT?
That child...

65
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,190
About Ji An?

66
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,790
Can I do it?

67
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,840
Should I not do it?

68
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,410
If Ji An is alive right now,

69
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,400
how old would she be? What would she be doing?

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,770
About these things...
can I talk about them?

71
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,290
Noona?

72
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,760
She'll be turning 28 on her next birthday.
And,

73
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,640
I don't know what work she'd be doing.

74
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,620
I don't know what food she likes.

75
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,730
If she's alive, wouldn't she be a reporter like you and Hyung Gil Han?

76
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't kids usually, just like their parents--

77
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:46,310
Ji An is dead.

78
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,450
I'm saying "if".

79
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,420
If that child was alive, how could I not know?

80
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,090
There's no way I wouldn't know.

81
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,820
I understand. I understand.

82
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,730
If the daughter is alive, how could the mother not know?

83
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,240
Stop.

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,350
After abandoning my living daughter,

85
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:09,140
it's not right for me to live by myself.

86
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,550
Then, that child, without a mother...

87
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:19,650
one year, ten years, twenty years, twenty-one years,
twenty-two years...

88
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,100
But I lived well by myself.

89
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:30,160
I lived well, slept well, laughed just fine, like this...

90
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,570
Like this...

91
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,880
Noona, Noona... I was wrong.

92
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,170
Sorry, sorry, you don't have to think about it. Don't think about it!

93
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,300
Please, please!
Noona, Noona!

94
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,470
Noona! Noona! Don't think about it.

95
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,240
- Myeong Hee!
- Noona, please, please...

96
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,720
Myeong Hee!
Are you alright?! Myeong Hee!

97
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,630
Come back to your senses!

98
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,620
Hyung, I shouldn't have said that... I just...

99
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,660
Go out.

100
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,140
Come to your senses, Myeong Hee!

101
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,370
Come back to your senses.

102
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,700
So you're saying... that I wouldn't be able to protect my article nor my source?

103
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,480
So, you... can I call you sunbae?

104
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,530
Seems like no. To Reporter Kim Moon Ho,

105
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,850
you're telling me to hand over my source to you? Why?

106
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,980
Your source is probably in danger right now.

107
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Do you not feel if she's in danger or not?

108
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,380
You don't fully grasp the whole situation now, do you?

109
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,900
What you set off, and how this would go from here in the future ...

110
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,880
You don't know at all, right?

111
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,250
I am your fan.
No, I am a die-hard fan.

112
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,300
The Seongwoo Foundation case that you investigated,
its illegal slush fund and making its Chairman resign, and...

113
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,370
Where was it...?The tax haven in the Virgin Islands.

114
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,300
The BM international's stock price manipulation case that you chased until the end

115
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,000
and made the incumbent Prime Minister resign,

116
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,790
I saw them all from my college days.

117
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,080
I even memorized some of your reports,
line by line.

118
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,850
All of them...

119
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,430
Did you really collect all those news materials yourself?

120
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,090
And not that you found some inept reporters like me, telling them to hand over their articles and sources to you?

121
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,870
But you did go to that war zone, where was it again... Iraq, right?

122
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,150
But you did go there yourself with your camera, at the scene where that little girl lost her family because of a massacre, didn't you?

123
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,790
I saw all that and thought, "This is really awesome."
I felt moved...

124
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,880
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yes?

125
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,240
The article you put out this time,

126
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,010
whether you put it out because you didn't know better, or you caused some trouble while trying to put on some courage in your own way...

127
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,730
but if you can't handle it anymore,

128
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,640
come see me.

129
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,060
ABS - Reporter Kim Moon Ho

130
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,200
You see, when people can't sleep,

131
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,540
they think about all sorts of things.

132
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,520
I, for a lot of times...

133
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,120
I imagined it many times.

134
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,240
Receiving a business card from you, like this.

135
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,110
It was my dream.

136
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,890
It was like looking at Noona's eyes from before.

137
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,510
Those eyes that stared at me directly,

138
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,490
and even that way of talking.

139
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,900
Is Noona alright?

140
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,140
Let's talk inside.

141
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,040
What did you say to your sister-in-law?

142
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,250
What is it that made her convulse?

143
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,510
What did Doctor Oh say?
Last week, Sister-in-law...

144
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,970
She had a health check-up, didn't she?

145
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,090
Same as the last 20 years,

146
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,050
Rehabilitation Medicine, Neurology, Psychiatry,

147
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,190
she visited all those departments
and got a bundle of pills.

148
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,840
So what do you want to say? Nothing has
happened to your sister-in-law for a while.

149
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,680
She didn't have seizures for months.
She was doing fine.

150
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,700
Tell me.

151
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,140
Someone contacted me two months ago.

152
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,520
Noona's daughter, Ji An...

153
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,940
That her grave needs to be moved to another place.

154
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,380
Did you tell Myeong Hee?

155
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,270
Not yet. I was going to tell her when everything was done.

156
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,010
Before I heard those words...

157
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,170
I was told the grave was empty.

158
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,610
In that grave,

159
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,820
there were only a few stones inside the coffin.

160
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,780
Placing Ji An to rest in that grave...

161
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,120
Wasn't it you who did that?

162
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,120
Is Ji An really dead?

163
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:08,910
Or rather, did you lie to Noona,

164
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,670
that a living child is dead?

165
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,460
Ji An is dead.

166
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,400
- And if she's alive?
- She's dead.

167
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,510
How hard it was for your sister-in-law to accept that truth.

168
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:26,070
You know how difficult it was for her to start living again.

169
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,630
That's why,

170
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,610
Ji An can't be alive.

171
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,460
She can't be alive?

172
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,780
What words are you saying there? You're saying...

173
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,140
If she were alive,

174
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,140
you'd let her die again?

175
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,820
Why are you putting it in this way?

176
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,000
Twenty-three years ago,

177
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,160
did you do the same?

178
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,170
Is that how you took care of Hyung Gil Han as well?

179
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,790
Since he can't be alive?

180
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,390
Do you have to make me speak about that accident again?
Do you have to hear it again?

181
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,910
Was it really an accident?

182
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,920
Yes?

183
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,500
What are you going to do if you know the truth?

184
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,260
- Hyung.
- The present, where you don't know about it,

185
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,320
or after you know about it...

186
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,580
will anything change?

187
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,030
There's nothing you can do, no?

188
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,230
What have you done?

189
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,170
What did you do to those people?

190
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:43,750
It's what you're speculating in your mind right now.

191
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:46,090
What am I speculating though?

192
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,680
You know everything about me, don't you?

193
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,700
Except one.

194
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,340
Do you think I

195
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,140
would not read

196
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,000
a book like "Arch of Triumph" in my life?

197
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,260
You know all the things that have been going on in this room.

198
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,200
But you

199
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,260
didn't do anything until now, no?

200
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,970
You didn't stop me

201
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:24,310
or report me to the police.

202
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,350
Nor report me in your news.

203
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,670
Because I know there's no use for it, even if I do.

204
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,850
That's because, Moon Ho...

205
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,700
you, too, are on the same side as me.

206
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,180
You and I, since that day in 1992 until now,

207
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,240
we have been on the same side.

208
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,700
You still can't acknowledge that?

209
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,040
What are you doing?

210
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,710
Without a job, it's your training time now, but what are you doing?

211
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,130
Since we are not busy, let's think a bit.

212
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,510
Organizing the situation.

213
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,210
First, Bae Sang Soo's guys found out you are Healer, right?

214
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,990
And Sang Soo who received that info is now racking his brains, right?

215
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:43,910
What? Healer showed up? Why? Where?
Next to a woman called, Chae Yeong Sin.

216
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,650
Fine. I was momentarily out of my mind, so I did something stupid.

217
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,490
I acknowledge it. Okay?

218
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:55,070
Then what will Bae Sang Soo do now?

219
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,690
There's no mistake.

220
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,940
It's that guy.

221
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,200
According to the rest of the guys, he's so similar to the guy

222
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,920
they fought against at the subway from last time.

223
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,880
Is that the woman this bastard ran interference for?

224
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,500
It looked like they were not in a normal relationship.

225
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
If it's not a normal relationship,
is she either his lover or his wife?

226
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,690
Or is she someone he eats with,
or if they go to motels together?

227
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:25,610
We don't know that much.

228
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,230
- Name?
- It's Chae Yeong Sin, a reporter for Someday News.

229
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,210
That reporter for the article you told us to take care of last time...

230
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,990
- She wrote it?
- That's correct.

231
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,180
Oh, that's interesting.

232
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,400
Then their connection would be that.
That is...

233
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,770
Mhh.

234
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,290
Starting with her address,
dig into all personal information about her.

235
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,760
Hey. Look into it.

236
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:05,430
From now on, around Chae Yeong Sin, there will be
a lot of Sang Soo's guys looking for you.

237
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,170
... is what we have to think, right?
Then what should we do?

238
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,070
No need to think about what we should do.

239
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,800
You must now absolutely leave that girl's side and stay far away from her.

240
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,860
You should not even look in the direction
where she exists on this earth

241
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,110
because Sang Soo's guys will be looking at that girl's workplace,

242
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,210
house, relationships, schools, and even her grades.

243
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,090
Sang Soo's cronies. How far would they go?

244
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,480
How far what?

245
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,180
If they accepted a job,
say, kidnapping, or blackmail...

246
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,440
will they do those things?

247
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,200
Well, they may run a wholesome and legitimate business,

248
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,930
but if they do their work wholesomely and legitimately,

249
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,740
they wouldn't be able to gather money to buy a building.
We should look at it that way, shouldn't we?

250
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,720
If...

251
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,680
This is just a wild hypothetical "what if"...
Those guys...

252
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,690
If they're looking for me and I don't show up, then they would have to go and find out from Chae Yeong Sin, right?

253
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,500
Then how far...
Hmmm, well...

254
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,380
By chance, kidnapping, imprisonment, or torture...

255
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,660
they wouldn't do those things to get info from her, right?
♬ Love, it isn't just a dream ♬

256
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,380
Hey, Healer.
♬  Now that you are everything to me ♬

257
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,270
What do you think? Do you think they would do that?
♬  Now that you are everything to me ♬

258
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,050
Chae Yeong Sin...
Is she that pretty?

259
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,370
♬ Oh love is the sweetest thing ♬

260
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,170
I saw her picture, and she's quite pretty.
♬ I smile at every being with a skip in my heart♬

261
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,930
Is she prettier in person? Is she sexy?
♬ I smile at every being with a skip in my heart♬

262
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,450
Ah, this Ahjumma, seriously!
♬ the moon, the sky, ♬

263
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,150
Are you starting to be senile tonight?
♬ the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

264
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:57,210
A while ago, the moment I told you to run away quickly, you ran to her right away.
♬ but I only have eyes for you ♬

265
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,500
And now too, let's say,
there is a fire burning your foot,

266
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,610
but you're worrying about her? Is that it?

267
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,140
- Ahjumma.
- Is she that pretty?

268
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,710
Don't.

269
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,850
You're a wanted suspect.
You became a suspect for murder not too long ago.

270
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:20,690
I thought you're going to buy an uninhabited island and leave this country. If it's not a girl who would follow you, then don't do it.

271
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,000
No matter how pretty she is, do not do it.
Do not start anything.

272
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
♬  Love, dazzling at first sight♬

273
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:32,360
♬ Challenging now everything we thought we knew was right ♬

274
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,210
♬ Oh love, it is our destiny. ♬

275
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,400
♬ We're caught up in a daze of only you and me.  ♬

276
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,330
When humans look at chimpanzees or tigers, they just say, "It's just a chimpanzee," or "It's just a tiger".

277
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:50,590
Among those, it's hard to find a slightly prettier chimpanzee or a slightly more handsome tiger.

278
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,750
In my eyes, humans are the same.
♬ but I only have eyes for you ♬

279
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,320
They all look the same.
♬ and I'm home when you hold me tight♬

280
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,950
But, among the similar human beings, she's quite different.

281
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,480
If you ask me how different...

282
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,330
she's like a leopard that I saw from a documentary before.

283
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,790
That leopard that had hurt its legs, crossed paths with a pack of hyenas.

284
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,450
It was obvious that it definitely wouldn't win, even more so because it was injured,

285
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,770
but that leopard attacked first and did not back away.

286
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,930
You thief! That's my bag, right?
♬ I'll be by your side with bated breath♬

287
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And you're a thief.
♬ and (together) we'll sail through it all♬

288
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,400
I'll stop them, so you run away.

289
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,980
That girl was the same.
It's not that she wasn't scared because she did not know better,

290
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,290
but she was brave, despite knowing how scary it was.

291
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,220
After watching that documentary, I really cried a lot.

292
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,960
Thinking about it now makes me teary-eyed again.

293
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,560
Anyway, I'm like that too.

294
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,780
Running away and hiding...
That's not my style.

295
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,450
Minion
Untitled message

296
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:34,550
When savage beasts are pitched against each other, there isn't anyone who isn't scared. Every one of them is scared.

297
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:39,310
But the one that shows fear first loses its life.

298
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:46,010
That's why before the enemy who is out to catch me and grasps my weakness, I will attack first.

299
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,950
That is how one survives in the animal world.

300
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,520
That one. That big guy is Oh Yong Sik.

301
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,760
He's Bae Sang Soo's left-hand man.

302
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,470
That guy playing with the toy at the roofdeck.
Alias: Yoyo.

303
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,010
Bae Sang Soo's right-hand man.

304
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,910
You know a lot about these guys.

305
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,950
Because I've been following them for several years now.

306
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,610
They put a huge sign on the building
and give out their business cards for sales,

307
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,490
but if we dig into them,
there will be a lot to find.

308
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,820
That means, you haven't been able
to dig into them properly?

309
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,120
What?

310
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,530
Those hackers Bae Sang Soo brought in...

311
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,470
They can even hack into the Pentagon.

312
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,750
So, this is how we judged.
"Because we are...

313
00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,160
targeting them right now,
they're playing modestly."

314
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,160
As we were looking into this Someday News reporter, an interesting tidbit came up.

315
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm talking about the first thing you ordered us to do.

316
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,960
You told us to find the errand guy called Healer and take care of him, didn't you?

317
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,180
It seems that he is related to this reporter.

318
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,660
And I've come to a conclusion.

319
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:27,630
You said this reporter wrote some unpleasant article, right?
With that incident...

320
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,840
There must be some connection to Healer, that bastard--

321
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,570
- President Bae.
- Yes.

322
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,440
Don't form judgments.

323
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,770
Huh?

324
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,720
I don't need you forming judgments.

325
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,410
Just properly do as you are ordered.

326
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
I understand. I'm sorry.

327
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Did you find out where that woman Joo Yeon Hee is?

328
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,260
We are sure that the Someday News reporter
knows where she is. We're on stakeout for now.

329
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,040
How about Healer?

330
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,410
Since we now know how to lure him,
we'll take care of him right away.

331
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:03,430
Do it, then.
Call me after you're done.

332
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,450
I've gotten the promises of cooperation
from major daily newspapers.

333
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,370
We've also finished the talks with the broadcast stations.

334
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,730
But it would be difficult to cover this up 100%.

335
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,860
On-line sites and podcasts,
those trivial places

336
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,520
will keep trying to cling to it...

337
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,780
Does it matter?

338
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,770
This case isn't a small one.
It's about a candidate for the next Mayor of Seoul

339
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,310
got sexual favors for a bribe from a president
of a construction company.

340
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,440
The female victim has now officially filed a report with the police.

341
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,560
There is talk that the opposition parties started to investigate this case on their own, so it's hard to cover it up completely.

342
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,910
You said those are trivial.

343
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,020
Do you know why they have been trivial?

344
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,280
Because they can't be unified.

345
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,170
They just babble alone in their rooms.

346
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
So, there is nothing they can do.

347
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,200
Other than continuing to exist trivially.
Don't you think so?

348
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,900
Yes.

349
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,600
Next.

350
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,600
About Bong Jin Life Insurance, there is a tip
coming from the prosecution, ...

351
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,890
- But...
- Yes?

352
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,150
About Healer.

353
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,700
Ah, are you talking about the errand guy?

354
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:27,010
It's a name I'm used to.
We called him that back in the day.

355
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,060
A long time ago.

356
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,210
How many?
Don't follow anyone without fear.

357
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,790
You'll really die.

358
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,350
It's him. I'm right.
That guy is that guy, Healer.

359
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,470
But, why me?
Why?

360
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,190
Why?

361
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:23,130
Ah, no!
I told you not to go near the windows.

362
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,550
What if those guys followed me?

363
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,420
Look who's outside.

364
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,640
Did someone come? I knew it!

365
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,000
What should we do? These gangster bastards!

366
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,540
No, it's that guy.

367
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,400
What?

368
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,760
Hyung-nim!

369
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,900
Hurry and come.

370
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,300
Hyung-nim.

371
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

372
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,830
Hey, Park Bong Soo!

373
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,060
Sunbae, I'm sorry.

374
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,110
Are you alright? You're not hurt?

375
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,780
I-I'm alright.

376
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,250
But, I ran away first.

377
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,300
I know you told me to watch over Sunbae, but...

378
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,710
It was too scary. What should I have done?

379
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:50,330
I couldn't do anything.
And when I got back to my senses,

380
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,750
I was already on the run by myself.

381
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,920
You said this guy got hit a lot, didn't you?

382
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,350
Yes. You possibly didn't pass out after getting hit, did you?

383
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,370
Ah, that's true. It's hurting on this side...

384
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,770
Hey. Let's see.

385
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:17,520
Here. Over here hurts a bit.

386
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,340
Ah, I'm a bit ticklish.

387
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,470
He looks fine.

388
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,920
But why were you sleeping outside?

389
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:37,950
Ah, I was worried about Sunbae.
It's a bit inappropriate to wake her up during the night...

390
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:43,030
I was thinking, "What should I do? What should I do",
but I was also sleepy, so I...

391
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,880
What's wrong with your hand?

392
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,280
I don't know. Must have been hit.

393
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:53,670
Ah, I must have fell after getting hit.

394
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,860
Let's see.

395
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,690
It hurts.

396
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,190
Bong Sook!

397
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,250
I'm not Bong Sook. My name is--

398
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,380
But thanks to you calling the police, I survived.

399
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:17,610
You're such a scaredy-cat, but you still did the report after getting beaten up.

400
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,680
Come here.

401
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,160
E-Excuse me, Sunbae... it's not right over here.

402
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,340
Don't you know how much I was worried about you?

403
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,320
Aigoo, really! I'm proud of you, really!

404
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,900
- You're so adorable!
- Sunbae...

405
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,220
I know you find me adorable, but the situation right now is...

406
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,250
Ah, right! Dad, you know you can't go with Yeon Hee to the police station with just the two of you later, right?

407
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,500
And since this house isn't so safe either, so...

408
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,150
Who do you think I am?

409
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:56,410
I have a lot of close friends that will come running with just one call!

410
00:32:56,410 --> 00:33:00,940
Fraud friends, gangster friends, theft friends, etc.
I have all sorts of friends.

411
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,620
If I use my network of emergency,
everything will be done...

412
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:10,130
Ah, but... do you still have a long way to go before you finish applying medicine?

413
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,230
Why are you two, a man and a woman,
holding the hands so long?

414
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,860
It's done. Let's eat.

415
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:22,040
Hey? Me too?

416
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:27,040
So, when us three are eating here,
will you just be there, sitting and starving?!

417
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,220
Let's go!

418
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,910
But...

419
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,120
Yeong Sin made these braised potatoes.
Please have a taste.

420
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:02,150
Here. My Chae Yeong Sin knows how to make only three dishes.

421
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,400
Braised potatoes is one of them.

422
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,070
It's not just three. There's braised potatoes, and kimchi fried rice, and also...

423
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,920
Curry, curry! And there's also potato...

424
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,590
Let's eat now.

425
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:13,950
I'll eat well.

426
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,030
I'll eat it well.

427
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,030
I...

428
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,120
Why aren't you eating?

429
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,140
Are you a bread person too?

430
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:38,510
Go down if you want. Cheol Min is making toast right now.

431
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:44,260
No, there are just too many side dishes.

432
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Gyeong Jae, search all the bids Hwang Jae Gook has participated in for the last three to five years.

433
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,530
If President Hwang Jae Gook offered sexual favors
for compensation, among those bids,

434
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:16,260
there must be some bids related to Kim Eui Chan.

435
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,110
Yes. I understand.

436
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:22,080
- Go to Public Procurement Service.
I will give a call to Chief Oh there in advance.
- Yes.

437
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,650
How many actresses were there under Hwang Jae Gook's entertainment company?

438
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:29,320
Here, Sunbae. There are around 12 people.

439
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,650
Wow, this guy really smells fishy.

440
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,590
Well, why would a man running a construction company extend his business to an entertainment management agency?

441
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:41,200
There's no one famous among them. Those girls were casted here and there with a promise of becoming famous.

442
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,060
But being famous, my ass. Needless to say, he dragged them to all those occasions to entertain the higher up...

443
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,930
Needless to say?

444
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:51,540
- Ah, that is...
- It's obvious there's no need to say?

445
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,410
Are you a reporter or a shaman?

446
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,380
I was wrong.

447
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,220
Investigate each actress under that company.

448
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,760
Find out if they were subjected to the same treatment as Joo Yeon Hee, or if they knew what happened to Joo Yeon Hee...

449
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,330
Please leave it to me.
You know my major is interviewing women, right?

450
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,330
You need to contact Assemblyman Kim Eui Chan's side too, though... Among his aides...

451
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,760
Sunbae.

452
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,800
- Do you know anyone on that side?
- Behind you.

453
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,350
I put someone else on Kim Eui Chan
and Hwang Jae Gook's cases.

454
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,110
You have some other work to do.

455
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,050
You have to go to the Philippines.

456
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,850
You know the case that the daughter of a Korean CEO of a construction company there got kidnapped, right?

457
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:42,410
- I know.
- You take charge of it.

458
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,840
That kidnapping case happened a year ago, didn't it?

459
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,880
As the number of Korean companies expanding their businesses overseas is increasing, the number of criminal cases like this is also increasing.

460
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,080
Let's put the focus in here...

461
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:56,870
Is it your thought, or is it from above?
Or outside?

462
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:57,780
This special?

463
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,620
Urgently dig out a case from one year ago,

464
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:06,880
put Kim Moon Ho on it, and send him out of the country.
That plan.

465
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,300
Moon Ho.

466
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:17,160
You see, when Noona lays out her cooked meals, she adds decorations.

467
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,250
Sometimes she puts herbal leaves or some flowers.

468
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,570
So... in this department,
can't you just add my reporting

469
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,570
as if you're adding the decoration?

470
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,850
When all the TV stations would be reporting from the same POV and same sequence,

471
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,290
(you can add) a twist to the news from me at least...

472
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,390
Is that not possible?

473
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,650
We're in the Department of Special Reports, which belongs to the News Department.

474
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,610
I'm managing that special,

475
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:52,290
and I am ordering you, who is my subordinate right now to do this.

476
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,980
What should we do?

477
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,030
Do I have to beg you,
holding my hands like this?

478
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,790
I am talking to you right now.

479
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,810
What are you doing?

480
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:32,090
Right now, you're very childish.
You know that, right?

481
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,580
Are you a twenty-year-old kid?

482
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:41,060
Min Jae, smile some time. It's such a pity.

483
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,950
Your smiling face is really awesome.

484
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:01,730
I, News Section Deputy Chief Kim Moon Ho, am resigning
due to personality differences with the company (ABS).

485
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,870
Do you just want to switch positions with me?

486
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,910
My chair looks more comfortable, right?

487
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,590
Huh? No, it's alright.
Mine is good enough.

488
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:33,090
Why not? The sun comes in well through this window too.

489
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,100
It's not good for my skin.
I might even get freckles.

490
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,500
Chae Yeong Sin, you wench!

491
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,700
I won't do it again.

492
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
What? What is? Which one?

493
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,500
What?

494
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,330
As a mere reporter,

495
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,570
I uploaded a news item without Chief's permission.

496
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:52,910
Although that was a scoop
that nobody else could dare touch,

497
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,310
and it reached the highest number of hits
in the history of Someday News.

498
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,930
No matter how much it dominated
the top search list,

499
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,190
- how dare this mere reporter...
- Gosh, this little...

500
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,950
- Reporter Yeo.
- Yes, Sir?

501
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:08,170
What is happening to
Reporter Chae Yong Sin's article today?

502
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,270
Is it still in the top search results?

503
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:13,700
No. It's been a while since it's been gone from the search results.

504
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,210
An exclusive, you see...

505
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,650
it only becomes an exclusive if someone takes on it.

506
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:22,790
Even if you sell off this country
or build an empire on Mars,

507
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:25,690
if no one is interested in it, it's just trash. Trash!

508
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,110
Just trash you can't even use as a toilet paper!

509
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,000
That's correct.

510
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,120
- Reporter Yeo.
- Yes?

511
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,280
Was there any who picked up the articles
about Kim Eui Chan and Hwang Jae Gook?

512
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,380
There are a few of them,
Oh Country News, Case and the Truth, and...

513
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,450
Aigoo, I ought to...!

514
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,850
Not those kinds of sites which play by themselves!

515
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,950
I'm talking about newspapers or TV stations
that all the people actually read and watch!

516
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,650
There's none.

517
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,250
And...

518
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,780
This came into our office.

519
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,880
From Assemblyman Kim Eui Chan's office,

520
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,480
we have been slapped with a defamation lawsuit.

521
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:11,060
This is ridiculous! I've never used
Kim Eui Chan's name! When did I--

522
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,250
Yes? Let's take a look.

523
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,830
Assemblyman Mr. K, serving his third term, is a candidate for Mayor of Seoul.

524
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,350
Aigoo, this is even more definitive than using his real name.

525
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,670
Here again, his real name,
there we go again, his real name...

526
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,980
I did something deserving of death.

527
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,230
But Chief... do you think it will cost
a lot to have this lawsuit...?

528
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,480
Aigoo, really!

529
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,420
It's one of the two. First.

530
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,240
I can't resign.

531
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,120
This is unfair.
If I committed a crime,

532
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,530
what's that... it's only because I drank too much...

533
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,300
and I hadn't slept properly for days that
I was not in my right mind. It's because of those!

534
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,670
- Then second.
- I'll do everything.

535
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,270
- Do it correctly.
- But that is--

536
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:05,320
-Huh?
- Writing an article, or finding evidence to be submitted for the trial,

537
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,400
do it properly and find something that is useful (to us).

538
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,380
That is how we live.

539
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,320
Remember what I just said.

540
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,740
Because those are fine words...

541
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:24,640
that are difficult to come out of my mouth.
My stomach hurts.

542
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,150
Ahjumma, are you still upset?

543
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,380
Ahjumma. Ahjumma.

544
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,860
Min Ja. Darling.

545
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,100
This crazy jerk.

546
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,720
Your anger would have dissolved in a day anyway, so why are you grumbling?

547
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,300
You should keep this in mind.

548
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,900
Whether you get arrested by the police,
or your identity gets revealed to somebody else,

549
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,650
- I will be throwing you away so quickly...
- I know.

550
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,800
If you want to preserve your life in the prison,

551
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,300
you have to erase every bit of memory about you.

552
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:20,870
Would there even be a memory with you, Ahjumma?

553
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:24,260
Do I know your face or your address?

554
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,390
What, huh?

555
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,440
Min Ja isn't your real name either, is it?

556
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,120
And so what? Are you going to stay there, keeping up your Superman act?

557
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,940
Superman? What did he do?

558
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,060
You don't even know Superman?
Aish, no matter how you don't watch movies...

559
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,030
There are a lot of "-man"!
Which "-man" is it?

560
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:46,650
There's someone like you who joined a newspaper office because of one girl.

561
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:49,910
Then what, what, what?

562
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,270
I sent you a picture.

563
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,650
In that picture, there are three more people, except my father and Teacher.

564
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:57,700
Find out who they are.

565
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,700
It would be nice if I could just ask Teacher myself,

566
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,620
but, really... that old man is still out of contact, isn't he?

567
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,240
Ah, too sweet.

568
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,680
Also, Dae Yong is currently following Bae Sang Soo.

569
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,200
At the right time, she will call you.

570
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,150
In that case, please get on it.

571
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,150
Right time? What time? What am I going to do?

572
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,810
- Bae Sang Soo, that guy-
- Bong Sook!

573
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,610
Do you know how to drive?

574
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:32,980
Yes.
I have a Class 1 license...

575
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:35,460
- That's great.
- W-w-w-w-where are you going?

576
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,680
Something important.

577
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,250
PHONE sending...

578
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,840
Right now, a South-Pacific beauty in 36-25-36
is next to me.

579
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,900
So quickly record your message, and then hang up quickly, okay!

580
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,940
Don't call! Please!

581
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:14,850
Hey, Jeong Chi Beom.
("Jeong Chi Beom" also means "political prisoner".)

582
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,330
Your student...

583
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:19,690
is starting to develop interest in your friends.

584
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,210
Should I just leave him be, or what?

585
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:24,170
Also, about your student...

586
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,790
he still isn't aware of it, but...

587
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,130
He seems to be confused about his work and life because of a woman.

588
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,640
It puts me in an awkward situation.

589
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,680
Should I keep on watching him? When he does not get his mind straight,

590
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,180
I'm thinking of replacing him.

591
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:42,260
Are there any candidates?

592
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,410
Someone who can take on as Healer.

593
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:50,620
- Depuis tu a partir, (Since you are going)
- Huh?

594
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,960
je ne peux pas ( I can't )

595
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,980
vivre sans toi.  (live without you.)

596
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,610
Tu ma monde et mon amour. (You are my world and my love.)

604
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,570
sing any song in any place like this?

605
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:28,580
It's not any song.

606
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:32,720
I don't like the songs nowadays, so I only sing old classics.

607
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,480
And when I sing a song,
it's always in a specific timing.

608
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,780
When I'm really happy,
or when I'm really angry,

609
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,980
and just like right now,

610
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,570
when I'm restless or scared, or when I'm nervous.

611

♬Will I get used to this as day by day passes by ♬

613
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:59,770
(in informal speech) Did you make an appointment?
That person Hwang Jae Gook,

614
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,860
will he meet us if we go?

615
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,880
How could that be?

616
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,380
But who am I, huh? For many years,
in this rough entertainment industry,

617
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,140
I am used to shadowing, stakeouts, and fearless entries,
so I will take care of it all...

618
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,250
But did you just lower your speech to me?

619
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:18,930
Huh? Impossible. (in honorifics)
You probably misheard me.

620
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,550
No. I heard it clearly. You, against me--

621
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:27,290
- I think we're here.
- Is it here? Is it? Really?

622
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,240
- This is bad.
- What is? Why?

623
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,160
I don't feel good about this.
So not good.

624
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,280
There is a method of just passing by.

625
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,260
Or, we can also do a U-U-U-turn here.

626
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,450
We can't do that. Stop the car. Stop it.

627
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:21,470
No, that was wrong. Pass first. Pass.
Let's make a plan first.

628
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,580
Go.

629
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,300
No, stop.

630
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,620
Let's go head-on. Alright.

631
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,750
Head-on.

632
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,410
No, go. A little.

633
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,230
No, stop. Stop.
I have my pride.

634
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:43,160
Pride.

635
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,000
I'm scared. Let's go straight first.
Let's make an appointment first. Go, hurry!

636
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,300
Aigoo, President Bae.
What's up?

637
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,480
Are you here to surveil
if your boys take good care of me?

638
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,770
Your kids are working well.

639
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,290
Those dregs of reporters can't even come near me.

640
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,270
I brought the reporter.

641
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,070
What is it?

642
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,990
This is the reporter who first wrote about you.

643
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,000
She's probably hiding Joo Yeon Hee, that woman.

644
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,090
It's this woman? Wow!

645
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:22,740
It wasn't a man, but a woman?

646
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,070
Hello. I'm Chae Yeong Sin, from Someday News.

647
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:44,090
If it's alright with you, I have a few questions...

648
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,390
for you. That's why I came.

649
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:53,100
Oh. Not through phone nor e-mail,
but you personally came to find me?

650
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,600
Wow, awesome! A reporter who uses her feet.

651
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,100
She has some guts, and her liver is big too.
(A Korean expression of being fearless)

652
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,260
I thought you wouldn't pick up even if I called.

653
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:07,660
To be honest, I thought I wouldn't be able to meet you in person,

654
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:12,130
so I only came to take some pictures of the gate...

655
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,710
Aigoo, look at her.

656
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,660
Quite useful.

657
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:21,430
How about I scout you, Miss?

658
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:23,160
How do I dare...
I don't do those things...

659
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,220
Please, our entertainment company is quite big.

660
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,360
We give out quite generously in our contracts as well.
Generously.

661
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,310
President Hwang, do you know Joo Yeon Hee?

662
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,970
She's an actress under your company, Empire Entertainment.

663
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:50,060
The more I see you, the more I like you.

664
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:55,100
You know that she has filed charges with the police against you, right?

665
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,400
Breach of trust and bribery, semi-rape,

666
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,270
and also assault.

667
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:06,930
We also have pictures of her from the hospital after getting beat up.

668
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,780
We want to hear your side.

669
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:15,660
But, you don't have manners.

670
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,870
How old are you, Miss?

671
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,980
Old enough.

672
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,800
But you still don't get it?

673
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,500
Even if you keep writing about it,
there will be no place to take that article.

674
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,720
There is. We, Someday News...

675
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,650
That newspaper, should I make that company
undergo some tax investigation?

676
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,430
If the owner of that company hears about it,

677
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,430
he would come running to me right now
and kneel before me.

678
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:39,080
- But, President--
- Joo Yeon Hee.

679
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,880
Where is that b**ch right now?

680
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:45,890
President, your way of talking...
gets gradually cheaper...

681
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,840
What? She was assaulted?

682
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,360
Like this?

683
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,880
Are you talking about this?

684
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:18,700
Sunbae, let's go.

685
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,680
- Move.
- I'm really scared.

686
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,230
I can't do this anymore. I'm not doing it.
Let's go, please?

687
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,680
You can't leave yet.

688
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,810
I have a lot of things to teach that lady.
President Bae, you heard, right?

689
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,790
I still have a lot to say!

690
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,210
Interview?

691
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,990
- Sunbae!
- Yes.

692
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,370
- I will bring all the girls under my company,
so try asking them!
- Sunbae!

693
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,770
Those dregs who bet their lives
to become clowns, I took them (in my company).

694
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:05,380
What immeasurable grace
I have bestowed upon them,

695
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,400
ask them, then!!

696
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,570
Sunbae! Sunbae!

697
00:54:56,570 --> 00:54:59,310
Sunbae!

698
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,210
Mom!

699
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,840
Mom.

700
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,660
This is the right time.

701
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,260
Right now?

702
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,350
Hyung! There are so many of them!

703
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,790
Hey, Miss, come here.

704
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,630
Let's do the interview.

705
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:56,130
Profoundly, and in-depth.

706
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,890
Hey!

707
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:50,760
I'm connected.

708
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,020
Alright!

709
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,710
What the?
Did you press it?

710
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,940
No.

711
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:40,120
Open it.

712
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:48,950
What? Hey! Hey! Hey!

713
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,730
Why? What?
WHAT?!

714
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:08,210
What are you talking about?
My car is possessed by a ghost?

715
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:10,540
Alright.

716
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:12,380
I will go check about it for a moment.

717
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:15,410
Alright.

718
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:19,530
You guys follow me,
and you guys, stay here.

719
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,500
Sunbae! Sunbae!

720
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:40,230
Sunbae!

721
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:49,270
Hey, Miss Reporter!
Is it your first time seeing someone get beaten up?

722
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:55,300
You can't even look, and you write an article fearlessly like that?
You see, an article...

723
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:01,740
you must only write one if you go to the scene with your own feet, and you see and hear it personally!

724
00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:24,370
Alright. Now that you've seen it, you must write one.

725
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:28,630
What are you going to write now? Tell me.

726
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,960
Hey! Damn!

727
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:55,410
Look up!

728
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:58,540
If you're that scared, (how would you write)?

729
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,710
T-tr...

730
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:10,040
What?

731
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:15,050
- T-tr...
- Speak louder! I can't hear you!

732
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:20,930
T-tr-trash that can't even be recycled...

733
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,120
You're ... trash.

734
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:56,640
President! President!

735
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,550
Bong Soo! Bong Sook!

736
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,770
Sunbae!

737
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:08,230
Are you okay?

738
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:10,440
Save me!

739
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,780
Bong Soo, look at me.

740
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:19,210
Just follow me. You can do that, right?

741
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,510
♬ Oh my love ♬

742
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,260

Healer Preview

749
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,200
The reason why I'm appearing in places where that reporter is

750
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,060
is because she is a bait I'm using.

751
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,470
Joo Yeon Hee is sued?

752
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:09,330
You're Healer, right?

753
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:13,210
I have neither video file, nor power,
nor the money to go through the trial.

754
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:16,470
Truth... Who wants to know about it these days?

755
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,350
I can say it's certainly
Je Il Newspaper's President, Kim Moon Sik.

756
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,320
Also the guy who killed Go Seong Cheol and framed it on me.

757
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:25,430
I have someone I like again.

758
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:26,300
I think I've already met him.
