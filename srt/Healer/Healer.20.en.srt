1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,120
Final Episode

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,010
Ah man, this is awkward.

3
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,260
Question... 1.

4
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,110
Yes, I'm Healer. You don't need to know my name.

5
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,930
2. What I do.

6
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,170
Well... it's a night errand man.

7
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,310
My skills are... the best in the field.

8
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:57,030
3. Was this my dream job?

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,270
Seriously, what kind of a question is this?

10
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:10,270
To be honest, I was going to do it until I could buy a desert island in the South Pacific.

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,340
There's a particular island I want.

12
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,500
Last time I checked, it was still available.

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,560
At any rate, then one day,

14
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,910
I met some girl.

15
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,470
Man, she made me lose my mind.

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,950
So... I changed my dream.

17
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,980
There are also words that my teacher left me.

18
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,740
I decided to try living like other people, with my woman, having kids and stuff.

19
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,780
I thought it would be easy.

20
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,170
But they just wouldn't leave me alone.

21
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,400
They'd keep jabbing me, kicking me in the shins ...

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,130
What pissed me off the most, though,

23
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,060
was them messing with my people.

24
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,280
Let's go.

25
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,480
I could come in and have a cup of tea or something.

26
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
- See you tomorrow. Drive safely.
- Yes.

27
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,240
- Bye~
- I'll be off, then.

28
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:26,910
Why did they close already at this hour?

29
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,160
Dad...

30
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:37,450
Why have you come so late? We've been waiting forever.

31
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,370
Jeong Hoo!

32
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,570
You need to look at whom you're attacking.
Close your eyes!

33
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,860
Hello,

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,060
my name is Seo Jeong Hoo.

35
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,430
I couldn't tell you my real name

36
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,800
because of some personal circumstances.

37
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,750
Yeong Sin, are you ok watching this?

38
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,240
I'm not looking.

39
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,230
Thugs like these may come again.

40
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,260
- Yeong Sin.
- Eyes closed.

41
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,480
- Are you done?
- Yup.

42
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,130
I'm sorry. I'm about to talk about

43
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,440
things that these guys shouldn't hear.

44
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,890
Also, call the police.

45
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,570
Yes, roger that. (Utmost formal speech)

46
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,510
Say that some burglars raided the cafe.

47
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,090
Don't say anything about seeing me.

48
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,890
Yes, I'll do that.

49
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,300
♬ Love, it isn't just a dream ♬

50
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,800
♬ Now that you are everything to me ♬

51
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:21,550
Hey, wait a sec. You mean your name is not Bong Soo?

52
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,230
That's right.

53
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,540
Are we in danger? My Yeong Sin included?

54
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,580
Yes, for the time being.

55
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,720
Explain what this is all about.

56
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,870
My father, my teacher, and Yeong Sin's father

57
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,880
died because of some bad guys.

58
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:55,100
Well... so, I mean... actually, it's...

59
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,950
Well, Dad, our fathers were reporters,

60
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,150
and they died while uncovering the corruption of those bad guys.

61
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,460
Yes, that's right.

62
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,010
But nobody would punish those bad guys.

63
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,670
- Nobody...
- So those guys are still doing wrong to this day.

64
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,480
- They've been doing that all this time.
- Yes.

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,620
- That's why he's fighting them to stop them.
- She's right.

66
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,870
- As a result, they're playing dirty like this.
- Playing dirty...

67
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,720
They even sent these thugs to me to blackmail him.

68
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,290
- As she said.
- Wait a moment.

69
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,240
So, what is it about a murderer and what was that about reporters?

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,930
Well, at any rate, because of these circumstances, I'll have to take Yeong Sin with me.

71
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,820
What did I just hear?

72
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,610
Well, as you can see, this place is too dangerous.

73
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,300
We have a few safe houses.

74
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,140
- Man, seriously!
- Don't, Hyungnim.

75
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,410
That won't do. I can't send my daughter to some guy whose name keeps changing.

76
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,310
No way in hell am I allowing that!

77
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,640
He says no.

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,040
Yes. Got it.

79
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,830
We'll see if we can rent or buy the house right next door.

80
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,380
For now, we'll consider this place as our safe house and I'll be back later.

81
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,240
Hey, hey there...

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,300
♬ I'll be by your side with bated breath ♬

83
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,700
Just 5 seconds.

84
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,590
♬ And together we'll sail through it all ♬

85
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,050
Done.

86
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,660
- Come soon.
- Alright.

87
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,120
♬ And together we'll sail through it all ♬

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,210
Don't skip your meals,

89
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,780
and listen to your father.

90
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Enjoy... your meals.

91
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,980
Isn't he funny?

92
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,310
How can there be so many houses?

93
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,830
And there are people living in each of those.

94
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,350
A nurse will come soon. If you need anything else, just call me.

95
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,190
Alright.

96
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,400
Noona,

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,900
let's have dinner together tonight.

98
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,310
I'll do the cooking, and you do the dishes.

99
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,340
I have something to tell you.

100
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,250
I'll tell you tonight. I will.

101
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:41,230
I'll be waiting. Off you go.

102
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:10,860
Min Joo (Democracy), Min Joo, where are you?

103
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,520
I'm here!

104
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,580
Yes, this is Kim Moon Ho.

105
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,180
If you have a tip, you should call Someday directly...

106
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,240
Where did you say?

107
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,320
I'm Kim Moon Ho.

108
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,250
Did you just call me?

109
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,800
You had a tip related to the Elder?

110
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,050
How does a highschooler know the Elder?

111
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,870
Hello, look at me. Look at me.

112
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,280
Help me.

113
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,060
Student! Student!

114
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,430
Are you ok? Hello there!

115
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,260
You're Jeong Hoo's friend!

116
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,820
Yes!

117
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,080
You have no sense of caution, just like you'd be out of toilet paper in the potty.

118
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,430
Don't you know that for people living off their reputation like you, this is more effective than just killing?

119
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,050
You must be Jeong Hoo's partner...?

120
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,210
Reporter Kim Moon Ho did things with a minor.

121
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:18,640
Attach a picture to that rumor, and you're done for.

122
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,340
Even if the truth is revealed later, so what? Done.

123
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,210
I see.

124
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,100
Do you remember Go Seong Cheol?

125
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,800
The man from LA who was killed?

126
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,190
It's a copy of the video clip he had brought over.

127
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,860
How did you...?

128
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,970
If you saw the monstrosity of information I have on my clients,

129
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,210
you'd probably faint in shock, Kim Moon Ho.

130
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,750
Ah, also, I would advise that you stay away from the Someday office for now.

131
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,180
Distorted propaganda Someday should be closed!

132
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,560
There are loads of people who'd testify that you physically assaulted them around there.

133
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,270
Dang,
(False Reporting/ Dividing the Country)

134
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,540
How can they put something like this up?

135
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,410
What is this?

136
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,540
Fellow citizens! Propaganda journalist
Kim Moon Ho must apologize!

137
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,790
Apologize! Apologize! Apologize!

138
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:15,440
Apologize! Apologize!

139
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,720
Apologize! Apologize!

140
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,220
Hurry!

141
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,410
Do you work here?

142
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,400
Who, me? Ah, yes, yes.

143
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,420
Close it, close it, close it!

144
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,120
Man, those old folks sure can rap!

145
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,430
Man, those old folks...

146
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,710
Hey, what are you doing?

147
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,910
Well, it's just that...

148
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,070
What? Is it a thief?

149
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,790
Hey!

150
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Ah, I just stopped by for something I needed.

151
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,150
This is the recording they wanted. The tip from Russia.

152
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,830
We are closed for a few days.

153
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,140
Recording started. I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin of Someday.

154
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,960
May I ask the name of the person providing the tip?

155
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,010
I'm calling from Russia right now.

156
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:30,190
I want to talk with Reporter Kim Moon Ho. I don't trust anybody else.

157
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,930
Reporter Kim Moon Ho is not in the office right now. If you'd tell me...

158
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,070
My name is Kim Jae Yoon.

159
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,280
I'm a researcher working under Dr. Nikolai Kozirov. I...

160
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,660
This is all there is to the recording. They've heard this much, too.

161
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,650
But can we get anything useful from this limited amount?

162
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,510
Alright. I'll get going then.

163
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,260
Hey, hey, where did you get in? I'd been standing here all this time!

164
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,980
When I blinked my eyes for just a split second, he was right there!

165
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,610
Park Bong Soo, something feels really different about you today.

166
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,550
His fashion style is different!

167
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:11,020
No, his face is somewhat different. What could it be?

168
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,940
- I'll deliver this.
- Hey, wait.

169
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,720
Yes.

170
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,460
Hey, wait, Bong...

171
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,960
Man, what a wonderful world we live in...

172
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,860
You should shampoo at home.

173
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,180
Just what is he doing?

174
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,320
It kind of feels like he's saying goodbye...

175
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
You should go out the door if you're saying goodbye!

176
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,660
There's no door out this way!

177
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,920
Question: Do I remember anybody from my previous jobs?

178
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,590
I usually don't remember people's names.

179
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:56,500
The names I need to know for a particular job are sent to me by my partner, and after the job's done, I delete them.

180
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,750
My line of work is really simple, you know.

181
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,800
I take a job, I do it,

182
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,990
then, come home and open a can of beer like this, and that's it.

183
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,030
So there isn't really anything much to say about that.

184
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,050
What was the most challenging job I have ever done?

185
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:40,570
It was about finding some girl.

186
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,380
The first time I met her was on a bus.

187
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,210
I don't remember her face from our first encounter. I wasn't really interested back then.

188
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,620
But this girl chased me back.

189
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,300
She was so fearless.

190
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,330
Be quiet.

191
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,530
- Hey,
- Shhh!

192
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,380
it hurts.

193
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:16,090
I hurt her from the beginning.

194
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,860
She's someone who has difficulty breathing even just hearing the "V" for violence.

195
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,990
But I didn't know that.

196
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,880
Now that I think about it,

197
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,860
her life was totally screwed after she met me.

198
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,660
She'd get hurt every day, get injured...

199
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:44,630
almost die, even.

200
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,210
When she's actually someone that smiles a lot.

201
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,930
Don't forget. That you smile a lot by nature.
♬  Because the only person in this world ♬

202
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,790
♬  who makes me smile is you♬

203
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,300
♬ Don't cry anymore. I will protect you.♬

204
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,160
The next question is...

205
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,310
What was it?

206
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,020
So this is that troublesome LA video clip, then?

207
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,970
You don't know how many people died because of that video clip.

208
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,360
The freelance reporter who recorded it died.

209
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,140
Then Go Seong Cheol, who stole it to sell it off in Korea, died.

210
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,360
And you can count in Hwang Jae Gook's death, too, which was to cover up the death of that Go Seong Cheol.

211
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,240
At any rate, why isn't Jeong Hoo coming? It's night already.

212
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,230
He can't come yet.

213
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,450
- Why not?
- Because he's waiting.

214
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,260
- For what?
- A piece of good news.

215
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:05,580
Gladly, gladly, let's forget...

216
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,030
Last nigh...

217
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,020
How did it go?

218
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,450
I went to the evidence storage, but...

219
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,050
Just talk!

220
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,020
Park Dong Cheol's murder tool, that iron pipe...

221
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,890
has no fingerprints on it.

222
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,320
Shouldn't they have collected fingerprints from it already?

223
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,610
There's no record, and the pipe itself is clean.

224
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,800
Not even a drop of blood is on it.

225
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,530
Then... the list of fingerprints we gave you...

226
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,600
Is only good if there's something to contrast them with.

227
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,300
New hit.

228
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,330
I had set up a filter already.

229
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,090
About 15 minutes ago, a file was sent to the police department of Seocho.

230
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:29,260
A video of Park Dong Cheol murder confession.

231
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,620
My name is Seo Jeong Hoo.

232
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,500
On January 27,

233
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,840
the Park Dong Cheol murder case that happened behind the Holy Mother Cathedral

234
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,860
was my doing.

235
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,940
Park Dong Cheol wouldn't pay up his gambling debts,

236
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,960
so we struggled a bit, then I grabbed a pipe nearby...

237
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,730
Sunbae, just tell me already.

238
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,350
What is your relation to this Seo Jeong Hoo?

239
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,140
We're citizens of the same country.

240
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,000
Did you hear that?

241
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,500
I could hear it clearly. So what happens now?

242
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,640
If the criminal confesses but doesn't turn himself in,

243
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,830
they'll place you on a national wanted list.

244
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,170
Printing off your face in full HD quality.

245
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,360
Ah, I knew things were going too smoothly to be real. Well then, plan B it is.

246
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,590
What is our plan B?

247
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,840
Well, we'll have to work one out starting now.

248
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,870
Jeong Hoo,

249
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,200
Yes.

250
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,840
Chae Yeong Sin is here with me.

251
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,170
She heard it all.

252
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:50,200
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

253
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,360
- Jeong Hoo.
- Yes.

254
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,990
Let's get that crazy old man

255
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,950
before you get caught. Then it should be fine.

256
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,610
Yes.

257
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,440
If

258
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,960
by any chance, even getting that old man doesn't do it,

259
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,110
then we can run away together.

260
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,650
Are you stupid? What about your father and your mom?

261
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:23,550
My father will understand, and my mom...

262
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:28,940
doesn't even know I exist, so it's ok.

263
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,470
There are lots of places where nobody will find us in this world.

264
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,850
So don't worry a thing. I'll look into it.

265
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,950
♬ I love you.  ♬

266
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,680
Jeong Hoo, are you listening to me?
♬  There's only you.♬

267
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:50,820
Jeong Hoo!
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

268
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,030
What kind of a man would turn his girl into a fugitive?

269
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,770
Chae Yeong Sin really has no clue about guys.

270
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:08,960
♬ I will always be looking.
It's you. ♬

271
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,130
I guess we're having a guest.

272
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,430
Noona packed a lot of food.

273
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,210
Yeong Sin's father?

274
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,100
Yes, hello. My name is Chae Chi Soo.

275
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,420
I'm sorry. The child in the picture is so pretty.

276
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:57,170
Ah yes, my Yeong Sin is indeed very pretty.

277
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,570
How did you raise your daughter

278
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:05,070
into such a bright and caring person?

279
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:10,650
Ah yes, others are surprised by that, too.

280
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,150
This is when she was little.

281
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,790
She grew so fast.

282
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,440
Take a look.

283
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,660
Back when the cafe was a teahouse.

284
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,140
Here, too.

285
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:09,770
I came to think that my birth mother might know already.

286
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:13,390
I must take after her.

287
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,380
You know, I don't talk about it if it scares me.

288
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:22,670
I laugh harder when I'm scared.

289
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,650
Whereas you withdraw when you're scared.

290
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:30,990
Is it because you don't want to show that you're scared?

291
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:38,310
Jeong Hoo, where and what are you doing by yourself?

292
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,200
MAIL RUSSIA
Via Airmail

293
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,570
To: Kim Moon Ho

294
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:40,730
You punk. You're still clueless.

295
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,560
How long was your love?

296
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,710
Just 10 years? What could you know from that?

297
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:54,580
Look at me. My love has lasted almost 30 years now.

298
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,230
You can talk about love only after this much experience.

299
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,120
Who measures love by time?

300
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,520
Even if it's only for one day, the depth and sincerity is what counts.

301
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:11,860
You've always been such a good talker.

302
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:15,010
You're such a put-down, punk.

303
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,220
Joon Seok's son is here.

304
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,670
Have a seat. What are you waiting for?

305
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,500
Jeong Hoo,

306
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:42,630
you know uncle Moon Sik, right?

307
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,110
You're Kim Moon Sik, Ajussi.

308
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,690
Aren't you too young to confuse names?

309
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:57,220
I'm Oh Gil Han,

310
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,880
and this uncle is Kim Moon Sik.

311
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,710
He does resemble Joon Seok.

312
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,490
That's why I just felt so sad from the moment I saw him.

313
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,280
But, it's only the looks that are similar.

314
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,260
Don't get your hopes high. Kids these days

315
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,750
don't have the guts or passion we had back in our days.

316
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,080
My sentiments, exactly!

317
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,060
This day and age is too affluent for such spirits.

318
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,890
That's right! Right!

319
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,510
Right!

320
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:38,590
Since when did this ajussi turn like that?

321
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:41,390
He doesn't stay that way.

322
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,700
Only after having a drink in the evening...

323
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,750
Ah, I originally come to ask a favor to that ajussi in there,

324
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,110
but I guess I have no other choice.

325
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,130
This is what I had confiscated from you the other day.

326
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:18,190
It had a lot of interesting phone numbers.

327
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,350
I need to meet the Elder.

328
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:33,510
He's not someone just anybody can see any time.

329
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,770
A package came from Russia.

330
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,870
Why don't you give him a call? He seems to be so interested in this country, lately.

331
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,220
This is what the old man is waiting for, you know.

332
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,660
Why are you so angry?

333
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,960
Ah, I just get pissed off whenever I see him.

334
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,160
To see him doing so well when he killed my teacher.

335
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,460
Isn't that right, Ahjusshi?

336
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,490
The content inside?

337
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,260
Would you take me off the wanted list if I bring it to you?

338
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,520
Would you delete the video recording you gave the police, too?

339
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,160
If you bring the stuff in first.

340
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,640
What was inside the package?

341
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,170
- Just this cell phone.
- And in there?

342
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,660
One video clip.

343
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,160
Of people collapsing and throwing up at a village hall of some sort.

344
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,740
Child, you still don't know?

345
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,420
If you work for me, nobody will be able to touch you,

346
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,030
whether you're a murderer or whatever,

347
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,830
it's okay.

348
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:00,190
It's... a bit hard for me.

349
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,540
I don't really want much in life.

350
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,770
Just living comfortably with my girl.

351
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,620
To be chased by the police and be threatened by your thugs,

352
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:21,080
it's ok if it's just me, but I really can't stand messing with my girl.

353
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,480
First off, where is the thing that woman sent?

354
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:43,390
It's got the Dugok-ri video clip. It's the real thing.

355
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:48,650
So that woman tried to send this to Kim Moon Ho, then?

356
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,580
And it was

357
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,980
you who intercepted it in the middle?

358
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,390
Well done.

359
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,630
Is the person watching this Reporter Kim Moon Ho?

360
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,370
I have something to tell you.

361
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,480
Miss, can you spare me some time?

362
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,020
I told you not to do something like that anymore.

363
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,030
Would you like to go out for a drive in the middle of the night?

364
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,050
- Where to?
- Wherever you want.

365
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,930
When I hold his hand, the feeling of "it's okay now"

366
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:30,870
gradually spreads to my whole body from my hand.

367
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:38,750
A marvelous, unique, one and only hand that can say, "it's okay now."

368
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,840
Question: The things I like:

369
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:52,070
High places, the first snow, small hands,

370
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,590
white bedding, and that hair.

371
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:03,370
The things I hate: Anything and everything that keeps me away from those.

372
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,010
Ah, just, really, that...

373
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,560
What?

374
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm normally a person who's alone.

375
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,520
So when there's another person breathing in and out next to me, it just messes up my hair and drives me crazy!

376
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,900
So when a big person like you is sitting there twiddling like that...

377
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,760
Incoming international call

378
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,640
Hello, this is Kim Moon Ho.

379
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,880
Is this really Reporter Kim Moon Ho?

380
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,960
Do you know my voice? This must be Kim Jae Yoon.

381
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,260
Yes, this is Kim Jae Yoon.

382
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,400
I'm in Dalian, China, right now, and will be entering Korea soon.

383
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,410
Can we meet at the airport?

384
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,210
I'll go back right after I see you. I don't have a visa to visit Korea.

385
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,880
Hello? Kim Jae Yoon?

386
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,270
The person who sent that video clip

387
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,900
is a Korean Chinese biochemist named Kim Jae Yoon.

388
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,610
With our huge funding, that research group developed a new type of live bacteria,

389
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,730
but Kim Jae Yoon destroyed it all recently,

390
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,800
leaving only a small sample.

391
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,670
She seems to be bringing it to Korea.

392
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,960
A message from China came through!

393
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,990
So this is what your face looks like?

394
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,430
When I think about all the disgrace you've caused me all those years...

395
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,920
Man, some team work.

396
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,640
That woman is coming to Korea today.

397
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,630
She booked a ticket. I'll go bring her in.

398
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:13,680
No need to bring in the woman.

399
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,920
As long as you secure the live bacteria.

400
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,150
The date for the general meeting
(of shareholders) has been scheduled.

401
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:33,280
At the upcoming meeting, there will be a discussion about whether CEO Park Jeong Dae will keep his post.

402
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,140
CEO Park must attend and explain his accomplishments and failures.

403
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,550
Who's trying to climb up the ladder taking advantage of this situation?

404
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,920
Does he mean to do a coup d'état or something?

405
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
The current situation is rather grave.

406
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,380
Not only was your personal identity revealed, but the core of our existence was almost uncovered.

407
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:03,170
Don't you think your allegiance shifted too easily?

408
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,360
I'll see you at the general meeting.

409
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:15,130
She is a Chinese citizen with no Korean visa, but is coming to Korea.

410
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,980
There is one airport where you can stay in Korea for 120 hours without a visa when you're coming from China.

411
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,630
There's only one airplane that comes in to that airport today from Dalian.

412
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,590
Then, all we have to do is just go see her.

413
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,620
- Do you want to do that interview?
- Really?

414
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,120
You guys are just so cheerful.

415
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:40,640
Listen, that crazy old man is going to send down at least a few dozen of his thugs there.

416
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,050
Even for Healer, there's no way he can overcome an army!

417
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:46,690
Then what should we do?

418
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,260
Let's do a live broadcast.

419
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,350
It's powerful.

420
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:57,910
Not many people can commit a crime while being on a live broadcast.

421
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,250
Ah, man... what am I doing with these civilians...

422
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,440
Ah, come on.

423
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:10,740
This is Yoon Dong Won.

424
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,530
Zip up first.

425
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:19,970
- Sunbae!
- Wash your hands, too.

426
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:23,110
Your fly's still open. Zip up first.

427
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,750
Just kidding.

428
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,120
Sunbae!

429
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,550
Ice cream... they don't deliver that, you know.

430
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,490
What is this?

431
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,630
What kind of crazy people...

432
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,420
actually did this kind of experiment on a village in the Republic of Korea?

433
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,050
It's a video personally recorded by a researcher who was part of that experiment,

434
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:50,780
and my guys went to meet with that researcher.

435
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,550
You go and help them.

436
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,110
You need to answer something first.

437
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:02,630
You and that guy Seo Jeong Hoo are Healer, right?

438
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,190
You need to open up to me at least this much to work with me!

439
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,480
- Yoon Dong Won.
- I don't know.

440
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,380
Just 'fess up, already.

441
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,830
Healer. And his partner, right?

442
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:21,350
Current addresses of seven hackers you've been chasing for the past 5 years.

443
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,900
Se, se, seven?

444
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,370
Including Devil Wing's?

445
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:31,780
Plus the real name and address of the one that hacked into Samoh bank last year.

446
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,990
Argh...

447
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:45,250
You'll see that genius hacker of the Elder when you go to that airport, that Ahn dude.

448
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:51,840
Sunbae, let me ask you one question.

449
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,600
People are pretty much the same, you know.

450
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,880
But we can kinda read people.

451
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,550
People who should live for this world's sake,

452
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,140
people who are better off dead for this world.

453
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,270
Seo Jeong Hoo, that punk, which side is he?

454
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,840
Ah seriously!

455
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:37,750
Since Kim Moon Ho trusts you a lot, Mr. Seo Jeong Hoo,

456
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,140
stay by his side for now.

457
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,570
Stay by his side.

458
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:49,270
When you see Kim Jae Yoon,
first verify whether she has the live bacteria.

459
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,300
Verify first.

460
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,610
After you secure it, you just need to kill her.

461
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,770
Kill her?

462
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:02,200
Ah, you don't have to do it yourself.

463
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,420
In the back.

464
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,500
All you have to do is get her near him.

465
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,440
It's simple.

466
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,920
Simple, huh?

467
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,810
Let's go. Let's go.

468
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,890
Young Shik, get in there.

469
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,260
- You follow me.
- Yes.

470
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:49,370
The one over there is Seo Jeong Hoo, right? He looks like he's one of them.

471
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:53,270
And those guys are Double S Guards...

472
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,690
Jeong Hoo.

473
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,080
We shouldn't act that close, you know.

474
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,560
Must you really go this far?

475
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:26,240
Since this is plan B. If this doesn't work out, we have to devise a plan C, you know.

476
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,510
It can get dangerous.

477
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:32,430
Nah, this is really dangerous.

478
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:35,240
- Boss,
- Let's reconsider this.

479
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,780
- Is that a habit of yours?
- What?

480
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,080
To think only. To run simulations all the time and never actually take part in the real deal.

481
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,800
How come you never lose to me even once?

482
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,810
Uncle...

483
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,240
What did you say?

484
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,580
I can't repeat that.

485
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:03,360
The passengers from Dalian are going through immigration. She'll be out soon.

486
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,520
Closed for repairs.

487
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,850
Kim Jae Yoon should call soon. Standby.

488
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:24,460
Stand by your man~ Bara bara bam.

489
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,260
Ajumma.

490
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,990
This is Kim Moon Ho.

491
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,170
Get close to Kim Moon Ho so we can hear the phone conversation.

492
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,750
Also, don't take it off.

493
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,390
Miss Kim Jae Yoon, yes, I'm waiting.

494
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,730
Once you come out, you should be able to see me.

495
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,180
Ah, you've seen my face in the news, right?

496
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,250
I'm rather famous.

497
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:05,950
This is Reporter Chae Yeong Sin. I'm a hoobae of Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

498
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,910
Once you get to the immigration, Reporter Kim Moon Ho will be waiting just outside,

499
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,120
but ignore him and turn left, and you'll see an escalator.

500
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,810
Get onto it and come to the woman's rest room on the second floor.

501
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:35,000
Miss Kim Jae Yoon, come this way.

502
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,880
- But I'm not Kim Jae Yoon...
- We've been waiting for you.

503
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,280
Has it been a long time since you've been to Korea?

504
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,390
How was the flight?

505
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,970
I'm not Kim Jae Yoon.

506
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:54,170
- You're not Kim Jae Yoon?
- No.

507
00:46:54,170 --> 00:46:56,650
Oh, she's not Kim Jae Yoon!

508
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:01,940
I'm sorry. I must have had the wrong information.

509
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,860
I'm sorry.

510
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,470
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin from Someday News.

511
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:33,210
This way.

512
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,260
You're getting on a plane to Beijing in 30 minutes, right?

513
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,040
This is the last of the live bacteria.

514
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,360
This is a USB card containing the records of our research.

515
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:59,360
May I ask for an interview during your layover?

516
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:06,250
I know the place is rather off-putting.

517
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,670
It's too dangerous, right? I take it back.

518
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:15,240
I've applied for asylum.

519
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:18,360
Would this interview help with that?

520
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,340
We are all ready here. Let's start.

521
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:49,670
Yes, I got it.

522
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,850
Reporter Yeo, it starts now!

523
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:56,140
- Now, now, now!
- Okay, okay, okay!

524
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,080
Hello, I'm Kim Moon Ho from Someday News.

525
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,140
At this moment, Someday is at an airport.

526
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,240
We are here to meet with a biochemist researcher who came from Russia through China.

527
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,540
It's okay so far. Let's wait a bit more.

528
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,590
First, let us show you a video clip.

529
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:42,230
Do you remember the case called "The Horror of Dugok-ri" that happened in September of last year?

530
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:48,440
All the residents of a village came down with an inexplicable illness, and 5 of them died from it.

531
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Somebody claims that this incident was a deliberate experiment of a research group.

532
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,230
There is a live bacterium our research group found during our research of water quality.

533
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,530
And we are secretly conducting further research to enhance the toxic nature

534
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:05,000
of that bacteria so that it would harm people.

535
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,900
Just what is the purpose of such research?

536
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,630
From what I heard, after polluting the water like that,

537
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,320
they'll claim that a private business should be in charge of managing the quality of water.

538
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,130
In other words, privatization. To move the public opinion that way.

539
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,380
Search all women's restrooms in the airport.

540
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,100
Yes, sir!

541
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:32,480
Where are you, Seo Jeong Hoo? The broadcast has started.

542
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,210
If you don't stop this, you're done for.

543
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,330
Don't do it. I'm against this. Let's stop here.

544
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:08,880
What is the situation, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin?

545
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,910
(The camera)

546
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:27,870
This person...

547
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,010
- (Are you ready?)
- (You're dead.)

548
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:38,290
You may scream now.

549
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:48,710
What is this?

550
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,780
I secured it!

551
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,930
Camera!

552
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:06,880
Get rid of it! Just get rid of it!

553
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,770
Don't shoot, I said.

554
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,080
What?

555
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,280
What's going on?

556
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,250
Are you crazy?

557
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:23,980
Just push forward!

558
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,340
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Come this way! Take the camera away!

559
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,700
Miss Kim Jae Yoon!

560
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,550
Yeong Sin! Yeong Sin!

561
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:35,040
Hey, bastards!

562
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:38,290
Chae Yeong Sin, no!

563
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:43,670
Stop there!

564
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:38,590
Call the ambulance!

565
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:42,190
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

566
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,220
I said, call the ambulance! 119!

567
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,840
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

568
00:53:50,340 --> 00:53:54,870
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

569
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:16,600
One person died from a shooting at the international airport.

570
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,700
The person who infiltrated a live broadcast to assassinate a whistleblower

571
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,370
and was killed turned out to be a hired assassin.

572
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:26,510
Yes, I felt my life was threatened.

573
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:29,910
But if you're human, you feel your conscience needling you.

574
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,800
Kim Jae Yoon -- Informant

575
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,700
I couldn't remain silent.

576
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:42,020
The person who hired this assassin was the CEO of Omega Holdings, Park Jeong Dae.

577
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,420
This is the so-called LA video clip we have just acquired.

578
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:51,640
It shows CEO Park Jeong Dae meeting with the Russian chemist, Dr. Nikolai Kozirov.

579
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:56,390
The prosecution plans to charge Mr. Park Jeong Dae with the Dugok-ri case.

580
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,310
The real name of the person who died in this case was revealed to be Park Bong Soo.

581
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:03,640
He apparently used several different names.

582
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:09,030
He's been revealed as the suspect of many other cases besides this attempted assassination case.

583
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,380
Chae Yeong Sin, no!

584
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:37,180
Stop there!

585
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,480
Call the ambulance!

586
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,040
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

587
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:58,010
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

588
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:03,090
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

589
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,840
Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

590
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,570
Wanted Murder Suspect

591
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,080
Chief Kang, you worked hard today.

592
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,510
You too.

593
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,140
Hello, Chief Kang.

594
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,120
- Where are you right now?
- Five,

595
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,650
four, three, two, one.

596
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,210
I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin of Someday News.

597
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,730
You were on a wheelchair yesterday at the trial. I take it you've recovered already?

598
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,310
Do you have time for just a few questions?

599
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,730
Or I can contact your secretary to schedule an interview...

600
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:11,050
The things I like: the sound the camera shutter makes,

601
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:15,380
his big hands, smiling eyes,

602
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:18,010
and big embrace.

603
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:26,750
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

608
00:58:43,350 --> 00:58:49,490
The things I don't like: anything and everything that keeps me away from those.

609
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:54,060
♬ 'Cause they'll never tear our love apart ♬
