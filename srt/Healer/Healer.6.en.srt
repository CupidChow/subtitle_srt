1
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,410
What's that?

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,550
Hey, look up.

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,840
If you're that scared, (how would you write)?

4
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,190
T-tr...

5
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,720
Hey!

6
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,700
Alright!

7
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,490
What's going on?

8
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,050
I can't hear you! Talk louder!

9
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:25,570
Tr- tr --tr which can't even be recycled ....

10
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,800
You are ... trash!

11
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,540
President! President!

12
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,090
Bong Sook!

13
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,610
Sunbae!

14
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,360
Are you okay?

15
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,350
Save me!

16
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,430
Are you ok...

17
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,310
Episode 6

18
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,060
- Bong Sook.
- Yes?

19
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,700
It's hectic out there, right?

20
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,420
Yes. It is hectic.

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,310
My hunch as a reporter is telling me, "Don't miss this chance."
So, get ready.

22
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,760
Huh? Get ready?

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,680
Car key.

24
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,790
Ah, car... here.

25
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,540
We'll be running towards where the car is right now.

26
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,080
You go to the car at the speed of light and start it,
and I, at the same speed, will get on it...

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,670
lock the car, and get away. Ready?

28
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,560
Can we switch?
You drive, and I...

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,410
I'd... better be ready for some emergency situation...

30
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,820
If I had a driver's license, why would I bring you here?

31
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,540
- Ready?
- Ready.

32
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,210
- Go.
- Go. Go.

33
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,760
We're leaving now. I need you to get rid of them.

34
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,840
- Catch him!
- Don't! Don't!

35
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,590
Make any tiny scratch on my car, (and you're dead!)
Just wait.

36
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,640
Just wait!

37
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,210
DON'T DRIVE MY CAR!!!

38
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,830
Just wait, wait!

39
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,700
How can I get rid of them? Can I just hit a few of them?

40
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,180
Ah, whatever!

41
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,130
Don't touch my car!

42
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,800
Block him!
BLOCK!

43
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,940
Car keys!

44
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,670
Hey! What's this!

45
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,670
Hey, catch this one!

46
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,400
Isn't that Bae Sang Soo's car?

47
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,420
Did you see it? It's Bae Sang Soo, isn't it?

48
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,200
What's going on...

49
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:40,340
Ahjusshi! Please take us to the police station!

50
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,890
Those people....
that is.... those thugs, they...

51
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,510
Bong Soo! What's wrong? Were you hurt?

52
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,080
Hey, hey!

53
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,940
Hey!

54
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,230
Hold up, hold up.

55
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,170
Using force by a group of people in broad daylight,
and even possessing weapons?

56
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,700
What is with this bastard?

57
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,020
Severe violent language and threats now.
Okay, keep going.

58
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,310
But this rascal...

59
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,150
Detective Yoon, hello.

60
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,580
What brings you here?

61
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,960
What about you?
What are you doing here, Punk?

62
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,200
So all these guys are your guys?

63
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,900
Are you a detective?

64
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,030
Ah, yes.
I'm from the Police Cyber Crime Unit, Yoon Dong Won.

65
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,970
You have something to report, right?

66
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,470
I have some things to ask too.

67
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,100
Ah, that is...

68
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,750
Bong Sook? Bong Sook?

69
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,770
Where did he go?

70
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,010
Where is it?

71
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,320
Dae Yong is now going toward the underpass.

72
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,880
Make a turn at the three-way intersection.
Go towards a warehouse.

73
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,600
Dae Yong, you heard, right?

74
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,330
You're dead.

75
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,520
Hey! Stop the car!

76
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,560
You're not stopping?!

77
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,940
I'm in front of the warehouse.
Hyung, where are you? Where do I go?

78
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,850
Should I stop here?
Should I just pass then?

79
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:21,370
Ah, why are you not answering!

80
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,190
Who are you?

81
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,610
- You're a girl?!
- Hyung!

82
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,210
When are you coming?
Why are you not coming!

83
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,180
What is this girl saying....

84
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,860
Be quiet! Be quiet!

85
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,540
Ah, really.
Let's not waste our energy.

86
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,470
I will just have a talk and go.

87
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,560
You, you're Healer, aren't you?

88
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,280
Bingo.

89
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,550
As expected, you show up where that Someday reporter is.
Is that it?

90
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,980
That's right.

91
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,230
What's it? Are you and that b*tch...

92
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,230
Why is the CEO of a company using

93
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,330
such rubbish words?

94
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,330
The reason why I appear where that reporter is,

95
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,230
is because she's a bait I'm using.

96
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,610
- A bait?
- It's because I want to meet you quietly like this.

97
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,570
After following you guys, I learned you seem to have a lot of interest in that reporter.

98
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,090
So I have followed her for a few days.

99
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:13,380
See? You've been caught.

100
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,860
You bastard.
If you wanted to meet me, come to my office--

101
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,150
What are you doing?

102
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,920
This one is the one you use everyday.

103
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,170
- Hey, hey!
- Don't laugh.

104
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,390
And this one is for VIP,
seeing it has fewer fingerprints on it.

105
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,730
What is the lock pattern for this?

106
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,310
Do you think I'll tell you that easily?

107
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,590
Hah, jeez.

108
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,740
How dare you...

109
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,280
Let's see.
The handcuffs look great.

110
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,950
Then I'll upload this on your homepage.
Your underlings will surely like this.

111
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,790
Title is, "Restrained by Healer-nim..."

112
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,290
-That...
- Look forward! Forward! Forward!
Would you please look forward?

113
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,480
I can decode it anyway if I spend a bit of time,
but I'm asking you because it's bothersome.

114
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,710
Ah, those pictures I took earlier.

115
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,130
Can I upload them to the Customer Support Board
on the Double S Guard's homepage?

116
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:14,970
(Tell me) the pattern.

117
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,950
V and 1, after V, keep making 1.

118
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,950
V and 1.

119
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,570
It works.

120
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,510
Only one person on your contacts.
Master?

121
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,320
- It's my lover, why!
- Recordings...

122
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,800
Wow, there are.
Just as I expected, this is how you do business.

123
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,000
Always record your conversations with your customers.

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,060
In other words, better safe than sorry.
Let's see, the recent recording is...

125
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,620
I'm talking about the very first order you gave us.

126
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,680
You told us to find the errand guy named Healer

127
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,170
and take care of him.

128
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:59,050
- It seems that he is related to this reporter.
- Hey, hey!

129
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,550
Hey, we're working in the same field.
There's something called business ethics!

130
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,940
That's right, that's true.
But I don't have that.

131
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,760
This guy is totally disappointing.
Hey, you punk,

132
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,700
your name, Healer, is really famous
in this field, isn't it?

133
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,140
Now that I see you,
using threats and blackmails...

134
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,300
Were you this kind of a dirty coward? Huh?!

135
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,420
Did you find out where Joo Yeon Hee is?

136
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,910
We are sure that the Someday News reporter
knows where she is.

137
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,630
- We're on stakeout for now.
- How about Healer?

138
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,150
Since we now know how to lure him,
we will take care of him right away.

139
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:32,970
Do it, then.
Contact me after you're done.

140
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,650
This man...
Who is it?

141
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,890
Why? Are you going to threaten me again?

142
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,160
He's one of them, right?

143
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,240
If you don't say it yourself,

144
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll give your Master a call and ask him directly then.

145
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,980
I'll immediately send him the pictures I took earlier too, and tell him this.

146
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,460
"Hello, I'm Healer."

147
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,300
"I heard it from Master's errand guy."

148
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,310
"You told him to take care of me, right?"

149
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,890
Can I do that? Ah, sorry. I'm really sorry.

150
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,110
Ah, what should I do...

151
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,790
I happened to threaten you again.

152
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,150
Sang Soo?

153
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,890
Yes?

154
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,890
Ah, yes.

155
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,440
They've just arrived at the police station.

156
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
It's Joo Yeon Hee.
No doubt.

157
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,060
I told them to circulate the press release statement
to the reporters of the major media companies.

158
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,430
The news reports will be released, starting from
the on-line sites of the newspapers today.

159
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,670
It's not the first or second time; they'll take care of this on their own.

160
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,290
- Here.
- Thank you.

161
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,880
So, you went to President Hwang's house

162
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,020
to have an interview, that's it?

163
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,980
Yes, I did, and then...

164
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,920
We saw how one of the actresses under his company got assaulted.

165
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,060
I almost got assaulted as well.

166
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,100
There were a lot of men around, right?
Do you know who they are?

167
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,650
Ah, right.
Those guys almost kidnapped me last time.

168
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:56,130
- Kidnap?
- Among them, there was a guy playing with a toy, right? Like this, that guy.

169
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,510
That guy was certainly the guy who harassed me last time.

170
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,950
In fact, I filed a report last time too.

171
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,850
But, I didn't know exactly who they were.

172
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,090
Now that I know them, I would be thankful if you would handle this well.

173
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:10,210
You know Hwang Jae Guk's minions back there, right?

174
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,170
Is there anyone who could verify your words?

175
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,780
Of course. My hoobae saw everything.
He was there with me.

176
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,220
He was beaten up last time.

177
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,180
Beaten up? Does he have
any medical report about that?

178
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,200
- Ah, that...
- Are you talking about that guy earlier who bumped into my car and then took off?

179
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,150
Ah, yes. He's a bit of a scaredy-cat.

180
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,110
He has a habit of running away when he gets scared.

181
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,390
How scared must he have been, that kid.

182
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:39,650
But, by any chance...

183
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,860
do you know Go Seong Cheol?

184
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,420
Who?

185
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you not know him?

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,350
Can you give me a hint...

187
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,310
Any how, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin, you wrote this

188
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,830
article a few days ago, right?

189
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,230
Yes, that's right.
It's mine.

190
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,390
The reason I went to meet with President Hwang is to write a follow-up article to this.

191
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:21,880
And the victim J from this article,
is it Joo Yeon Hee?

192
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,400
Wow. Detective, your investigation skills are awesome.

193
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,540
Well. It's not that my investigation skills are awesome,

194
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,260
but rather this woman has been sued.

195
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,660
Filed by Hwang Jae Gook.

196
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,660
That Hwang Jae Gook, that trash--
He sued Joo Yeon Hee?

197
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,010
Why? For what?

198
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,130
He also sued Someday News.

199
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,010
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin, your Chief Editor, all included.

200
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,310
Let me do a search first.

201
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,770
Hwang Jae Gook Joo Yeon Hee

202
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,370
Police Civil Complaint Desk

203
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,930
Excuse me.

204
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,540
Excuse me. How much longer do we have to wait?

205
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,040
- For what?
- I already told you earlier that we're here for the investigation of the victim.

206
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,640
Please wait.

207
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,230
Identity of the Blackmail Girl
Aiming at the Political/Financial World

208
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,030
The Bribery of Sexual Favors Case Is Just
the Gold Digger's Self-fabricated Story?

209
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,950
... tried to seduce Assemblyman K, but
as he wasn't interested...

210
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,870
... impersonating a celebrity, seducing high-profile figures in the political/financial world...

211
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,390
Excuse me.
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

212
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,410
Detective, I'm not under arrest now
for this investigation, am I?

213
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:10,040
Ah, no. It's not like that.
I just have a few questions-

214
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm a reporter for Someday News.
If you have some questions,

215
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,630
please just give me a call.
I'm available to talk anytime.

216
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,060
I'll go first. Good day!

217
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,570
Hey, Miss!

218
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,990
Joo Yeon Hee?

219
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,560
Ah, yes.
This person is Joo Yeon Hee.

220
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:31,820
- Then, who are you?
- I'm accompanying her in a fiduciary capacity.

221
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,060
Here.

222
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,310
I'm Attorney Chae Chi Soo.

223
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,370
So you know the fact that Miss Joo Yeon Hee
is on the wanted list.

224
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,670
On the wanted list? Who is...?

225
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,510
Oh, Yeong Sin? I'm at the police station.
I'm busy right now, so I'm hanging up.

226
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,240
Ah, Dad! Please pick up!

227
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,590
Defendant Joo Yeon Hee.

228
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,290
Defamation by blackmail
and publication of false rumor.

229
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,970
So far, her whereabouts have been unknown.

230
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,110
That's why she's wanted.

231
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,570
Attorney.

232
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,740
Wait a moment.

233
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,160
We're here to testify as the victim.

234
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Then I guess you need to testify as the suspect as well.

235
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,370
ABS Reporter Kim Moon Ho

236
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,670
ABS: Asia Broadcasting System
Reporter Kim Moon Ho

237
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,470
Yes?

238
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,270
Hello, I'm Chae Yeong Sin from Someday News.

239
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,070
Do you remember me?

240
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,230
I know. I remember you.

241
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,540
Do you remember telling me to call you if I can't handle it any more?

242
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,160
I really don't want to acknowledge it,

243
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,520
but that's why I called you.

244
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,820
By chance, if I...

245
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,310
if I hand over to you all the materials I've collected until now, including the source, will you do a report on it?

246
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,620
Not just an ordinary news coverage,
but a proper news coverage.

247
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,570
That source... is it Joo Yeon Hee?

248
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,210
Yes.

249
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,350
Are her words all you have, or do you have any other evidence?

250
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,760
I have a record containing the messages sent between Kim Ui Chan and Hwang Jae Gook.

251
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,900
And we also have her medical report she got
when she was assaulted.

252
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,130
What about video files?

253
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,210
What?

254
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,830
From the beginning, Joo Yeon Hee said she had been blackmailed (by Hwang) because of the video files.

255
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,800
In your article, I mean.

256
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,760
Video...

257
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,770
I don't have one.
If I have it, then I

258
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,910
would have no reason to call you.
I would just put it out!

259
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:35,120
I have neither video files, nor power,
nor the money to go through the trial.

260
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,170
Our newspaper is just a B-level online newspaper,
so even if I put out some articles,

261
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,340
if they are not picked up by portal sites,
that's the end.

262
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,780
But you said you can do it.
You said you have power.

263
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,110
Chae Yeong Sin, listen up.

264
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,250
I'm listening.

265
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,510
Last time, the higher-ups would just block a news they didn't like. No one could put it out.

266
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,110
A reporter just had to put his/her life on the line back then.

267
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:57,830
That's how they were able to put the news out.
But times have changed.

268
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,920
Now, they just produce numerous garbage news
and bury it with them.

269
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,780
How can they do that?
People

270
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,750
find trash more interesting than the truth.

271
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,040
And so what?

272
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,450
The truth.
Who wants to know that nowadays?

273
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,380
So what? What do you want me to do?

274
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:17,040
The truth that nobody is interested in,

275
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,460
do you still want to let them know?

276
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,610
Jeez, seriously.

277
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:30,410
Hey there. I asked you if you can put it out if I hand you over the news.

278
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:34,810
Just answer me if you can or if you cannot.
Why are you suddenly acting like a teacher--

279
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,870
Why do you want to let them know so badly?
You can just walk away from it now.

280
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,250
Right now, Joo Yeon Hee is about
to be arrested unjustly.

281
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,780
Should I just leave it at that?

282
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,710
Because you can't just let that happen,
you're dumping it to me?

283
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,330
When was it that you were talking
about some "hand it over to me" bullshit...

284
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,190
W-what?

285
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,350
You just have to put my name
as the source of every material.

286
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:02,840
If there are some lawsuits, I'll be the one to be sued!
You just have to report it!

287
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,880
- Really?
- Yes!

288
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,330
What are you doing here?

289
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,270
Waiting for the house owner.

290
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:21,110
But you know the pass code anyway.
Why are you waiting outside?

291
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,850
It's because I have to be cautious around the house owner, for some strange reason.

292
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,870
I'm trying to be cautious.

293
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,340
Kang Min Jae is acting cautious around me?

294
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:35,470
Wow, this is some main news.

295
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,850
I know some attorneys at the law firm they are
using, so I will check with them.

296
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,050
First, how many attorneys will be on this case...

297
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,680
Damn it... All they have is money...

298
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,780
For now, go back in.

299
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,570
- Yeong Sin...?
- Hey, Yeong Sin, what are you doing here?

300
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,490
Joo Yeon Hee! Joo Yeon Hee!

301
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:28,440
Joo Yeon Hee! Joo Yeon Hee!

302
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,950
The Joo Yeon Hee case just went from the politics desk to the social news desk.

303
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,860
The focus will be, "A new type of blackmail/fraud scam is getting serious."

304
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,540
A blackmail/fraud scam?

305
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,480
Young females are targeting the famous figures
and approaching them intentionally.

306
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,650
After leading them to dates or sexual intercourse,
they are demanding money and valuables, that's the story.

307
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,450
And the example of that case is Joo Yeon Hee.
Is that what they are saying?

308
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,550
Joo Yeon Hee is the most malicious one among them.

309
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,630
She blackmailed by conspiring with an entertainment news reporter and putting up an article with initials.

310
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,620
The victim is an assemblyman who is
the candidate for the next Mayor of Seoul.

311
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,120
There is also a talk that she demanded
three billion won (USD 3 million).

312
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,650
- How much money did you demand exactly?
- Is it three billion or four billion?

313
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,670
You pointed out some assemblyman from the ruling party, but he's saying that he met you just once at a dinner party.

314
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,750
- Which is the truth?
- We will tell you later!

315
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,850
Is there any other accomplice,
or did you do it by yourself?

316
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,210
Did you come here today voluntarily?
I guess you will be investigated without detention.

317
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,700
- Come on, get out of our way!
- Did you really do it by yourself?

318
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,810
There is talk that you were contacted by some people from the opposition party. Who was it?

319
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,360
Please say something!

320
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,450
The case of politicians getting bribed with sexual favors, which was once the hottest online issue,

321
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,210
is becoming clear to be a self-fabricated story
of one wanna-be-celebrity.

322
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:48,490
This seems to be the example of "the gold digger's fraud"
which is frequently spotted these days.

323
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:58,190
As expected, your skills are great.

324
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,010
You said you learned by helping your Noona cook since you were young, right?

325
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:07,530
I want to eat some food made by that Noona.

326
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,570
The first woman in your heart...

327
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,330
Has that girl eaten the food prepared by your sister-in-law?

328
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,720
You still remember that? Forget about it.

329
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,950
What woman in the world would forget such words?

330
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,170
We had been a couple since we joined the company.

331
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:30,520
But the man wasn't saying anything,
no matter how long I waited.

332
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,970
So, the girl proposed first.

333
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,480
You don't know how much courage it took for me to do that, do you?

334
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,830
But... the man's reply...

335
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,850
"Min Jae, there's the first woman in my heart.

336
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:59,700
That's why you'll be the second,
no matter how much you try.

337
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,100
Will you be alright with that?"

338
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,050
You said you didn't like that.

339
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,820
What girl in this world would say she's alright with that?

340
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,410
Let's do a toast to that 'first woman'.

341
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,560
Stop it. I'm already sorry to you as it is.

342
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,650
How about for Reporter Kim Moon Ho's resignation?

343
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,990
I'm in for that one. Cheers.

344
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,160
You're not entering your brother's company, are you?

345
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,450
I don't know. I might.

346
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,460
You won't. If you do that, you would not turn in your resignation letter in that cool manner.

347
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,560
You're so embarrassed you'd end up resigning quietly.

348
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,920
I guess you can even write a thesis about me, huh?

349
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,060
What is it? You should at least give an explanation.

350
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,560
You should do that much for me at least.

351
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:17,200
There's a kid I want to raise.

352
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
And?

353
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,330
I'll teach her the basics first, and then she'll be quite useful.

354
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,930
- And?
- And then...

355
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,910
Will you take her in?

356
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,800
Is it a girl?

357
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,830
It's a kid, I told you.

358
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,740
Why would you leave?
You can just take her in at the TV station.

359
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,670
You said that wouldn't do.

360
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,810
What are you saying?

361
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:49,020
You said we can't take on Joo Yeon Hee's case.

362
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,030
If I do that, I won't be able to teach her properly.

363
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:57,180
Her dream is to become a proper reporter.

364
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,820
And what you just said...

365
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,300
What's with me taking her in later on?

366
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,540
What are you going to do then?

367
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,940
Who is that kid?

368
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:23,750
With your first woman...
What is it?

369
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,210
Min Jae.

370
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,100
You...

371
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:32,140
why are you making me say these words?

372
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,780
Why did you make me like this?

373
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,950
I have a debt to that woman.

374
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,340
A very huge debt in my mind.

375
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,840
I want to pay back that debt.

376
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,440
After you pay her back, will the first spot in your heart be emptied?

377
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,380
That's my wish.

378
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,680
After you pay her back, what happens next?

379
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,640
I'll leave.

380
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,910
Where?

381
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,910
Maybe Alaska or Africa?

382
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,920
Either to a very hot place, or a very cold place.

383
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:49,230
I've lived very lukewarmly up until now.

384
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:56,480
President, is the delivery address right?
I've arrived, but no one is here.

385
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,030
Just leave it? Where?

386
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,710
Ah, yes yes. There it is.

387
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,760
Dispensary

388
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,950
Ahjumma

389
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,380
Honey, I'm not here right now.

390
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,810
Record what you have to say, and you have to end it like this.

391
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:04,410
"I love you . . . "

392
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,550
Seriously!
What is wrong with her?

393
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,910
Ahjumma, what are you doing that you're unreachable for the whole day?

394
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,450
You also heard what Bae Sang Soo has recorded, right?

395
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,450
With that much information, we can be sure
it was Je Il Newspaper's President Kim Moon Sik.

396
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,350
He's also the guy who ordered me to meet
Go Seong Cheol and get the file from him,

397
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:29,300
and who killed Go Seong Cheol
and framed me with it, right?

398
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,220
If not, why would he order Bae Sang Soo
to take care of me?

399
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:41,880
So... that's why I, on the the opposite side,
would like to take care of him.

400
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,900
I need your help.
Seriously! Where have you been all day long?

401
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,420
Even if you're not in your office,
why are you not picking up your phone?

402
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,330
Why is a cellphone called a cellphone?
It's because even if you're going somewhere, you can take a call...

403
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,620
Anyway, please call me.

404
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,080
You heard it, right?

405
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,510
Even if I don't tell him, Jeong Hoo, that guy, will know about it on his own.

406
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,490
The fact that Kim Moon Sik was his father's friend.

407
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,800
Did you take care of the surveillance camera?

408
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,650
I did. Relax.

409
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:27,510
Kim Moon Sik, his father,
me who is his teacher, Myeong Hee,

410
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,810
and even Gil Han.
He will find out all of them were friends.

411
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,200
If you taught him properly, it's only a matter of time before he gets to know that.

412
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,970
He'll know how his father died too, right?

413
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,860
Wouldn't he end up knowing?

414
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,030
It seems his mother told him his father died because of an accident,

415
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:46,780
but if he digs in a bit, it would come out, wouldn't it?

416
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,880
If he can find newspaper clips from that time.
Seo Joon Seok, born in 1960,

417
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,780
killed his friend because of money.
While being investigated by the police,

418
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,630
he killed himself due to a guilty conscience.

419
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,380
Detective Jo, you've still got it!

420
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,160
That venomous snake teeth
which don't know how to care about others.

421
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,050
Ah, you don't like being called a detective.

422
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,240
But you've spent a few years with Jeong Hoo, didn't you?

423
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,200
What do you think, Detective Jo?

424
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,950
If he knows his father was that kind of person, what would his reaction be?

425
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:27,010
He already has some autistic symptoms, doesn't he?

426
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:33,570
His wish is what? Leaving everything behind to buy an desert island and live there by himself?

427
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,350
Aigoo, this timid kid.

428
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:37,680
Hey, Jeong Chi Beom.
(Sounds like a person's name but also means "political prisoner")

429
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,960
- What?
- You lived with him for years, and you still don't know?

430
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,450
Know what?

431
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:46,510
Jeong Hoo, that kid, never abandoned anyone.

432
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:49,610
It's that all the people around him threw him away.

433
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:55,180
His father, his mother, and his grandmother...
You, his teacher, also did the same.

434
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,340
Let's take a picture!
Stand up!

435
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,820
Hey, Moon Sik!

436
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:09,150
Ah, how tacky you guys are!
What picture...

437
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,660
- Look at him, jeez!
- Smile, alright?

438
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,580
Let's go!
Cabbage kimchi!

439
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,580
Kimchi!

440
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,480
Bong Sook, is this your phone number?
It's me, Sunbae.

441
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,840
Hey, you %@ bastard!

442
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,920
After leaving your sunbae in that chaos by herself, you're going into hiding without even calling me?

443
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,740
Do you want to die?
You're so dead!

444
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,600
Wow, seriously.

445
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,060
Are you okay?
This is my number, so call me to let me know you're okay.

446
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,760
I'm so busy I couldn't take care of you today.
You're okay, right?

447
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,110
I want to die right now.

448
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,870
What's with her?

449
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,930
'Do you want to die? You're so dead!'

450
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,030
Look at how she talks, jeez...

451
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,480
'Are you okay? You're okay, right?'

452
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,020
Seriously.

453
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,680
I... want to die right now.

454
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,740
Want to die?

455
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,160
Have some hot chocolate.

456
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,040
You couldn't even eat dinner properly.

457
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,970
Miss, a soldier being sent to war needs to eat first.

458
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,910
That's how you are able to fight.

459
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,780
Here, drink some.

460
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,440
The amount of the money is bothering me.
Have you ever talked about money? Especially three billion?

461
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,380
Have you ever talked about this amount of money?

462
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:33,890
Nothing money-related.

463
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:40,350
Ah, last time...

464
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,600
I said that I would sue him if he keeps forcing me into prostitution.

465
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:50,630
President Hwang asked me how much he would need to give me and if 30 million won ($30,000) would be enough.

466
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,850
And so, I, while crying...

467
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:59,530
I told him it's not a matter of money. Three billion won wouldn't be enough, let alone 30 million!

468
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,020
I think I did that.

469
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,220
He recorded it. He recorded that.

470
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,500
That...

471
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,770
Also, one more thing.

472
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,530
If we look at this, violation of the Law of Information Network and Information Protection...

473
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:22,980
This is talking about revealing someone's personal information and privacy at online sites.

474
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,330
This... is trying to argue about
the article Yeong Sin wrote.

475
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:31,450
What personal information?
I've never used his real name! My article was just...

476
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:33,050
Shut up.

477
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,460
Yes, Sir...

478
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,930
Hey, Cheol Min. Print out the article Yeong Sin wrote.
I need to check it word by word.

479
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:43,840
Yes, Hyungnim.

480
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,540
Hello? Hey, Park Bong Soo!
Why are you calling only now!

481
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,480
Ah, you're too noisy!

482
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,470
Alright.

483
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:06,230
For someone who works in an organization, do you have any common sense about hierarchy?

484
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:09,770
Even if you ran away, you still must report to me!

485
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:12,860
I'm sorry, Sunbae.

486
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,030
What's wrong with your voice?

487
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,180
I've been throwing up after being scared from a while ago.

488
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:22,220
I got home and fell asleep.

489
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:29,290
You... Do you usually throw up if you're scared or frightened?

490
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,250
Ah, really, I'm embarrassed...

491
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,270
Sunbae, this is a request.

492
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:39,430
I hope you don't tell this to anyone else.

493
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:45,080
What's so embarrassing about that?
Everyone of us has a weakness.

494
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,180
To be honest, I'm like that too.

495
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,810
When I get too scared, I can't breathe properly.

496
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,210
But is that embarrassing?
It's just uncomfortable, isn't it?

497
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,680
Bong Sook, are you listening?

498
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,650
Yes, I'm listening. (in informal speech)

499
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,920
Anyway, it's enough that I heard your voice.

500
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,170
Will you be able to come to work tomorrow?

501
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,690
I should go.

502
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,460
Then, take your time.
I'll tell the Chief.

503
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:19,500
But, I feel sorry too.

504
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,200
You're a still newbie,
but I dragged you to such a scary place.

505
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,180
Anyway, good night.

506
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,920
Alright. You too, Sunbae.

507
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,360
- Hold up.
- Huh?

508
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,540
I'm right!
You've been talking to me informally!

509
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,810
Ah but, what's that message you sent me?

510
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,690
That you want to die right now?

511
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,070
Ah, that.

512
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,770
It's a bit long if I tell you.

513
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,490
Are you alright if you don't sleep now?
Is your stomach alright?

514
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,170
I'm laying on the bed.
I'm alright now.

515
00:43:58,290 --> 00:44:00,560
About that article I wrote a few days ago.

516
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,460
That's getting a serious counter-attack now.

517
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:12,070
I, Joo Yeon Hee, and the newspaper have been tied together and got sued with a lawsuit.

518
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:18,320
Most of the media are on their side,
so the public opinion will be on their side soon.

519
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,700
It became a situation that I couldn't handle, just like what someone said.

520
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,690
Is that 'someone' Reporter Kim Moon Ho?

521
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:31,350
Hey, do not.
Don't even bring up his name.

522
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,610
Why not?

523
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:36,910
I swallowed all my pride and called him.

524
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,590
To Kim Moon Ho?

525
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:41,240
I told you to not even say his name!

526
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,820
Hey, that guy is washing his hands of this case
as the situation gets bad.

527
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:52,920
He's totally a mean jerk plus a cunning coward. His name is a waste on him.
("Moon Ho" means great writer.)

528
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,380
That person... is he that famous?

529
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,690
Hey, you're working in the media field.
How could you not know him?

530
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,860
He's at that level?

531
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,290
I liked him...a lot.

532
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:14,230
He's my idol, my first love.

533
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,930
And my long-time unrequited crush.

534
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:23,560
If it weren't that serious, would I put up
his poster on the wall of my room, not some idol star's?

535
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,540
And starting from last year, he's one half of my two-timing.

536
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,340
What are you talking about?

537
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:35,190
I've gotten another crush.

538
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,440
Sunbae, seriously... You're so cheap.

539
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,820
Who is the other half?

540
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,110
There's someone.
You won't know him even if I tell you.

541
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:47,950
Is that person a reporter too?

542
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,070
No.

543
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,870
He's a nighttime errand guy.

544
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,120
What?

545
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,570
There's that kind of work.
You don't know, do you?

546
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,060
Oh, yeah, I don't know.

547
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,390
Anyway, he's quite famous in that line of work.

548
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,080
All I heard about him are just rumors too, so...

549
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,940
But you know why they are rumors.
They're exaggerated and overstatements.

550
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:20,320
But I felt my heart go thump-thump.

551
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:23,820
I ended up fantasizing about him.

552
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,100
That's how my second unrequited love started.

553
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,670
But he's normally an expensive and secretive guy.

554
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,690
I was wondering if I would meet him ever in my life.

555
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,470
But, I...

556
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,540
think I've met him.

557
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:48,730
You met him?

558
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,150
That nighttime errand guy?

559
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,560
Yes.

560
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,360
I didn't see his face, but the feeling...

561
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,270
You know, that feeling...

562
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,470
That feeling...

563
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,160
What am I saying now?
I've gone crazy.

564
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,580
Any how, you're weird, Park Bong Soo!

565
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,650
I... what?

566
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,260
You...

567
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:29,380
seem comfortable now.

568
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,950
Just like...

569
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,380
we are sisters?

570
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,260
Go to sleep.
I have to go back and size up the situation. I'm hanging up.

571
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,140
The feeling is... what?

572
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,210
Sisters?

573
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:47,620
You called for me, Elder?

574
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,530
Welcome.

575
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,390
You've worked hard this time, President Kim.

576
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:56,140
I only did as you have taught me.

577
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,550
Have a seat.

578
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:10,720
President Kim, you'll have the usual,
cognac on the rocks, right?

579
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,980
Thank you.

580
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,860
In fact, cognac

581
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,240
is best to drink straight

582
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:24,940
because cognac is originally
something you enjoy with its fragrance.

583
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,020
But this is also just a theory.

584
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:35,090
No theories in the world are

585
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:40,180
more correct than my taste, my preference.

586
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:45,120
"In the universe, taking one step forward is important."

587
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,320
Because the center of the universe is myself.

588
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,310
Don't you think?

589
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:55,350
To understand that state of mind,
I'm still far behind.

590
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,630
Assemblyman Kim.

591
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:04,020
Yes, Elder.

592
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,530
But still...

593
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:10,220
we're living with other people (in a society).

594
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,490
At the very least, there

595
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:16,490
are lines which we must not cross, right?

596
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:17,870
I have no excuse.

597
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:23,300
No way... that you're believing
the old saying, "A hero tends to like women"?

598
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:27,240
It's not. That's not it.

599
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,190
It's the same for President Kim here,

600
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:35,230
but to put you as the mayoral candidate for Seoul,

601
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,430
there are a lot of people who worked hard for it.

602
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,870
But because of a woman,

603
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:48,140
if you're disappointing all of us,
it puts us in an awkward position, right?

604
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,410
There will be no second time for this.

605
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,940
It was only a momentary mistake.

606
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:01,900
While being the subject of great expectations,
which I don't deserve,

607
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,090
I was under severe stress.

608
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,760
This is not an excuse, though...

609
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,720
Please give me one more chance.

610
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,030
I'll do it.

611
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,380
You can leave.

612
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,520
Thanks for your hard work.

613
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,460
Why are you getting lighter?
It's making me nervous.

614
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,490
How can you be the same as always?
Making me feel apologetic.

615
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,580
You don't say anything even if it's bothersome.

616
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,010
It's not bothersome. Never.

617
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:06,460
How could that be?
You're also human.

618
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,070
Please don't over-think about it.

619
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,210
Did you take your medicine?

620
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,080
I ate already.

621
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,250
The lights are alright with you, right?

622
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:29,040
Go to sleep. I'll leave when you fall asleep.

623
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,190
Do you want me to read it out?

624
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:48,210
What did you do today?

625
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:51,520
Do you not feel sleepy?

626
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,500
No.

627
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:05,790
Today... Today, I met the half-witted people again.

628
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:09,640
When I saw those halfwits,

629
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,880
to such stupid and vulgar people

630
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:20,750
full of disgusting greed,
like bugs full of disgusting eggs...

631
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,530
Is it right to leave the country in their hands?

632
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,700
I had those thoughts.

633
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,180
Kim Moon Sik, you changed a lot.

634
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,270
But you just said I am the same as always.

635
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:38,740
The college student Kim Moon Sik
was timid and did not talk much.

636
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:42,670
You were my friend who always
took the back seat and sat there smiling.

637
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,370
I would have been like that.

638
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:48,650
The Kim Moon Sik today...

639
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,160
is just like King Arthur's wizard,

640
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,630
Merlin. Should I say it like that?

641
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:59,920
Wise, sly,

642
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,690
and full of tricks.

643
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:06,470
Either compliment me or criticize me.
Choose one only.

644
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:10,100
Kim Moon Sik.

645
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,660
Please speak.

646
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:19,770
By chance, do you want to become King Arthur
instead of Merlin?

647
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,730
You don't like it?

648
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:29,370
For the past 20 years, you've been climbing higher and higher,

649
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,080
and you've also become stronger.

650
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,120
Is it still not enough?

651
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,570
Myeong Hee.

652
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:44,490
I did not change one bit from when I was a college student until now.

653
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,490
When you were shouting for democracy and looking for justice,

654
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,560
I was only driving, but

655
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,180
I still did it.

656
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:56,690
Saying it's not right when it's not right.

657
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:00,020
I still want to do that, even now.

658
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:02,330
That which is not right is not right.

659
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,960
But in order to do that,

660
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:11,170
I only learned that I needed power.

661
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:20,330
Okay. I understand.

662
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,660
Sorry for asking and arguing about you.

663
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:34,870
Sleep.

664
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:42,740
Quickly.

665
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:01,970
Ah, really! Why is there no call? Why?

666
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:03,610
- Reporter Yeo.
- Yes?

667
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,020
Are you sure there is no call from the President?

668
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,600
There wasn't any.
I did not even go to the bathroom. There wasn't any.

669
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,250
It's strange.

670
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,760
He said he would send a lawyer this morning.

671
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,380
He said he would send a lawyer he knows by the morning.

672
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:22,080
If it's morning, then we'll have to wait until 11:59.

673
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,020
- You...
- Chief! Chief!

674
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,380
Oh, why?

675
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,980
- Over there...
- Did the lawyer come?

676
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:30,080
It's not it. Right now, out there...

677
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:38,160
Wow, he looks like Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

678
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,270
You're Chief Jang Byeong Se, right?

679
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,940
Ah, yes. I'm Chief Jang Byeong Se.

680
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,680
I'm Kim Moon Ho.

681
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:05,250
What brings Reporter Kim Moon Ho here...?

682
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:10,500
Ah, are you here to collect data because of that article?

683
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,760
Please take care of me from now on.

684
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,170
You scared me.

685
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,220
You're here early.
How are you feeling?

686
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,070
I'm fine. (in honorifics)

687
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,020
You're not talking informally.

688
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:56,340
Is someone moving in?

689
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:01,950
The size of this newspaper...
Is the space I'm seeing now all you have?

690
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:05,810
Ah, over there is where the Marketing and Sales team are working.

691
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,910
In this place is where the design and editing is...

692
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:12,950
But, I asked you earlier.

693
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,070
Why are you here...

694
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:16,640
Hello! Good morning!

695
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
Stop for a moment.

696
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,620
I will be making a video (camera) team
for Someday News.

697
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,720
I will be in-charge of it.

698
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,010
Wha...t?

699
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:31,040
That person is really Reporter Kim Moon Ho.
You're surprised, right?

700
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,590
For that, we'll need more space
for the camera team and the editing room.

701
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,350
We'll have to use one more floor of this building, wouldn't we?

702
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,950
Ah, Reporter Kim Moon Ho.
The CEO of our Someday News

703
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,570
is also the owner of this building. And so...

704
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,570
Wait.

705
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:49,580
Hello? I'm busy right now, so I'll call you later...

706
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,780
Ah yes, President.

707
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,010
Yes.

708
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:56,930
What?

709
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:58,750
Okay.

710
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,640
- Yeong Sin.
- Yes, Chief?

711
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:08,450
Our President says he sold this building.

712
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:11,960
He also sold this newspaper.

713
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,740
To whom?

714
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,550
I think I can use this room after cleaning it up.

715
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,590
But still need some space to put video equipment...

716
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:27,710
If you're talking about video equipment, are you talking about cameras...?

717
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,260
Tell them where to put those things, please.

718
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,220
Ah yes. Please go this way.

719
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,990
Yes...

720
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:41,180
It's this way, this way.

721
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:50,950
- Chae Yeong Sin?
- Yes?

722
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,510
Aren't you supposed to be very busy by now?

723
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,910
Me?

724
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,020
What time is it right now?

725
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,890
It's 8 right now...

726
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,930
Call home.
Tell them you won't be home for the next few days.

727
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:23,040
♬ I don't know why my eyes only look for you ♬

728
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:28,830
♬ Or why it hurts while looking at you ♬

729
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:35,910
♬ Or why my heart beats like crazy ♬

730
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:38,910
♬ I don't know ♬

731
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,620
Healer Preview

732
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,150
Do you know who Kim Moon Ho's first woman is?

733
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:48,520
He says it's all to pay back his debts to that woman #1.

734
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,790
Kim Ui Chan is announcing his candidacy for the Seoul Mayoral position. I'm thinking of sending you there.

735
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,050
I'll do it.

736
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:56,560
Are you trying to stop me from meeting Kim Moon Sik?

737
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,240
Then I'll meet him today, right now.

738
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,870
Find out if Chae Yeong Sin is adopted or not.

739
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:05,400
A new commission from a customer came

740
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,600
asking for Chae Yeong Sin's protection.

741
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,620
You like hitting people, do you?
But you never got hit.

742
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,350
Who are you?
Who am I?

743
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,270
♬ Or why my heart beats like crazy ♬

744
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:29,380
♬ I don't want to let you go ♬

745
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:33,380
♬ Like dreaming with my eyes open ♬

746
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:39,150
♬ You're so near, but you seem far away ♬

747
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:44,300
♬ Please stay by my side,
if I am able to say those words ♬

748
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,100
♬ I'm scared that you'll leave ♬
