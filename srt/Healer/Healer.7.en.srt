1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,730
Episode 7

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,100
Hey, Poop Dog! Are you awake yet?

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,590
An upgraded morning call, chicken version.
Awesome, isn't it?

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,890
That thing I faxed you is a plane ticket.
Boarding time is this afternoon.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,130
Get up, pack your things, and get your passport.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,950
You have to get to the airport
two hours before boarding time...

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you talking about?
What plane ticket?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,390
Your teacher decided on your destination.
Seems like Australia...

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,060
What? You talked to Teacher? When?

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,810
Where is he right now?

11
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,760
Go there and stay for a year.
Enjoy swimming,

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,730
catch some alligators, or if you have more time, learn some English. That's what he said.

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,440
Ah, really. Teacher, that old fogey!

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,870
I need to meet with him. Give me his number.
You know his number, don't you?

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,970
Errand guy Healer would be on leave until you come back.
End.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,820
Ah, come on. What are you on about out of the blue?

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,860
I even found out everything about Kim Moon Sik.

18
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,240
- All I have to do is meet with him–
- Your teacher says he will meet with that person.

19
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,350
Why?

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,190
This young man! If the elders say something, please listen!

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,080
Elders, what a load of bull.

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,390
What is it? What are you two on about?

23
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,180
- What is it?
- Hey. Jeong Hoo.

24
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,580
Jeong Hoo?

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,050
Healer, pack your things for now.
Pack your things, and I'll slowly--

26
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,600
Forget it. I'm leaving.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,860
You're going to the airport, right?

28
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,130
I'm going to work.

29
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,290
You promised! You said you're only going to stay beside that girl and do your bait game for three days!

30
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,060
Three days have already passed!

31
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,620
Jeong Hoo... since when did you call me tenderly by my name?

32
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,700
What about Teacher? Has he called me even once after abandoning me by myself?

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,600
And what now? He bought me a plane ticket? Why?

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,400
So I won't go to work for the newspaper?
Then I should go.

35
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,200
So I won't be able to meet with Kim Moon Sik?
Then I should meet with him today... as soon as possible.

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,730
Hey, you poop cat! That's why--

37
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:38,230
That's why! If he has something to tell me, tell Teacher to tell it to me personally. Teacher, that old fogey!

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,920
I wasn't planning to come.
My animal instincts tell me something.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Over there, some kind of a trap is set up.
If I get caught in it, it will break my ankle at the very least.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,150
That's why I should not come closer, and instead, run away.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,640
A nighttime errand guy.
There's that kind of work.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,700
Everything I heard of him were just rumors.
But you know how rumors are.

43
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,800
They're exaggerations and overstatements.
But, for me...

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,860
My heart goes thump-thump.

45
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,820
I end up fantasizing about him.

46
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,520
That's how my second unrequited love started.

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,470
It's true.
I wasn't planning on bidding anyone farewell.

48
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:44,610
What farewell should I say to the people I won't ever meet again?
It'd be ridiculous.

49
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,450
Therefore, the reason why I am here today...

50
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,480
is just because of Teacher, that evil old fogey.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,560
What? Go and catch alligators?
Geez.

52
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,720
Ah, that scared me.

53
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,380
I told you, didn't I? There's no way that punk would follow such an unconvincing order.

54
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,820
What are you going to do now?

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,480
That little peanut grew up.

56
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,340
He's grown up a lot, of course. Honestly, his skills are a lot better than yours.

57
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,370
No way, surpassing one's teacher isn't that easy.

58
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,940
What are you going to do?

59
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,490
Her face... is an A on an A-to-F scale. Not bad.

60
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,850
According to my preferences,
she's too skinny,

61
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,410
but that's only when I compare her to those South Pacific beauties.

62
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:58,180
Her back silhouette is also... wow, good too.

63
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,320
Wow, those bright eyes...

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,690
Her IQ is probably 124 at least.

65
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,620
What are you mumbling about?

66
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,530
Judging from my experience, such a woman like her won't be satisfied by such a young kid like him.

67
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,660
... So your outfit today is okay. Pass!

68
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Still, someone who is old enough,
with an aura of deep discernment about life,

69
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,650
I think she will be attracted to a man like that.

70
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:36,360
Looking at this, we need to send Jeong Hoo on a plane now.

71
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,720
And, I'll take over that empty spot naturally and

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,070
smoothly--

73
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:51,000
Ah, why are you reacting so aggressively?

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,450
Chae Yeong Sin?

75
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,720
Yes?

76
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,260
Aren't you supposed to be very busy by now?

77
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,850
Me?

78
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,860
What time is it?

79
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,780
It's 8 o'clock right now... Ah!

80
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,590
Call home. Tell them you won't be home
for the next few days.

81
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,850
This guy... What's he planning on doing?

82
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,440
He purchased both the on-line newspaper company
and the building that company is located.

83
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,490
He sold all the stocks he had and even sold the property in Yongin.

84
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,950
Well, both those stocks and the property...
They were under his name only, though.

85
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,880
Do you think it'll be okay?

86
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,310
He called and said that he would use them (money), because he thinks he would use them in a better way than I would.

87
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,570
Especially for those stocks... (Will it be alright) to sell them without the Elder's permission...?

88
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,850
Secretary Oh.

89
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,900
Yes.

90
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,200
It has been about 20 years
since the Elder sent you to me, right?

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,850
It's 22 years.

92
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,660
Is the Elder still first?

93
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,460
I'm sad.

94
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,520
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

95
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,170
No, I was early.

96
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,240
Sit down, Chief Kang. It's been a while since we ate together like this, right?

97
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,260
You're going to talk about Reporter Kim Moon Ho, right?

98
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,960
Is that uncomfortable?

99
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,780
Then, rather than food, please buy me alcohol.
I need alcohol.

100
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,900
It's weird.

101
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,180
Are you okay?

102
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,120
I feel better. It's weird.

103
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,000
I almost lost it in the company.

104
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,560
Thanks. I feel like I can live now.

105
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,190
Th...when..when you're scared you said you can't breathe, right?

106
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,560
But, why now?

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,890
I don't know, I guess they have been accumulated.

108
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,490
Hey, should I go to some shaman
and get some ritual?

109
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:22,480
For the last few days, so many accidents and incidents have happened to me. You know those gangsters, right?

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,970
The other night, those guys were waiting for me at an alley,

111
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:29,370
and that trash, Hwang Jae Gook-

112
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,560
I had a dream about that bastard last night, so...

113
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,090
But, when you came to work that unrequited love person was waiting for you.

114
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,900
Wow, you won't have any choice
but to be out of breath...

115
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,180
Bong Sook, you...
You shouldn't be like that, seriously.

116
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,970
Last night, I became a bit weak emotionally,

117
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,440
so, all right, I admit I did blurt out some words.

118
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,170
But, you can't use that as my weakness.

119
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:13,140
Do you really not kn-kn-know Reporter Kim Moon Ho
for any personal reasons?

120
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,050
Ah, it feels like he came here for you.

121
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,920
Ey. Hey...why would that person come here for me--

122
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,720
Really?

123
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,170
But that person is your unrequited love.

124
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,660
C-c-c-can't y-y-you sense such a feel...feeling?

125
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,280
You've never had unrequited love, right?

126
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,930
Why do you do those kinds of things?

127
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,410
Unrequited love is

128
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,920
done because you can't sense anything whatsoever.

129
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,260
One day I'm watching the news
and that person is there.

130
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:10,050
Oh ... Something is making my heart flutter a lot.

131
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,230
That face and his smile just come into my heart.

132
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,890
What is this?

133
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,290
But that's all. There's nothing more you can sense.

134
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,420
That's why it's unrequited love.

135
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,120
And another day I heard from someone.

136
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,990
There's an errand guy,

137
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,880
and this guy doesn't do anything that hurts others.

138
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,710
-There might be some jobs that can hurt...
-They said he's always alone.

139
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,340
He's in the dark by himself.

140
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,310
No one can recognize him. Why?

141
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,430
Because he has to be alone.

142
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,210
That feeling... You can't even imagine it, right?

143
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,890
I know that feeling a bit.

144
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,870
When I was little, I was also in that situation.

145
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,230
I wished that no one would look at me,

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,900
that no one would know me,

147
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,680
then I would be alone.

148
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,900
Ah, look at this.

149
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,450
Eh? What?

150
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm blabbering useless things to you again.

151
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,550
Aish, seriously.

152
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,790
But, how did you know?

153
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,220
Eh? What?

154
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,890
My medicine...how many pills I take.

155
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,000
Ah, that... No...

156
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,520
D-d-don't people usually take t-t-two pills for medicine?

157
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,890
It's always two pills when taking medicine.

158
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,320
Hehe. Correct answer, two pills.

159
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,900
It's two pills, right? Sunbae, two pills.

160
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,890
Her name is Chae Yeong Sin.

161
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,460
That girl might have been the last straw
for Kim Moon Ho. That's how I'm thinking.

162
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,120
I know Moon Ho a bit,

163
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,470
and I can't believe it.

164
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,750
Just what kind of a girl is she?

165
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,570
I don't know.

166
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,950
I don't want to know.

167
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,170
Why?

168
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,750
Because she might be a young and pretty lady.

169
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:54,020
I still can't recover from the fact

170
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,370
that your brother dumped me.

171
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,550
That's regrettable for me too.

172
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,850
I was waiting for a day

173
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,120
to call you Sister-in-law, Chief Kang.
I mean it.

174
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,260
As a person who could've been
called Sister-in-law,

175
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,580
can I ask you this?

176
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,130
Anything.

177
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,430
Kim Moon Ho's first woman.

178
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,320
Do you know who it is?

179
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,520
He talked about this...

180
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,100
That the reason why he turned in his resignation letter

181
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,970
and moved to a no-named online newspaper company

182
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,920
is all to pay back the debt to the first woman.

183
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,490
He said debt?

184
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,880
He said he has a debt in his mind.

185
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,310
It seems you don't know either.

186
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:41,070
We're not siblings who share each other's feelings.

187
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,830
If that's the case, then I don't have a source anymore for interviews.

188
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,830
It's dead-end now.

189
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,450
I'll just drink, then.

190
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,810
Contact Bae Sang Soo,

191
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,480
and have him investigate Chae Yeong Sin
thoroughly right away.

192
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,800
Is there something specific that you would like to find out?

193
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,690
I was told the grave was empty.

194
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,720
Wasn't it you who put Ji An to rest in that tomb?

195
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,930
Find out if Chae Yeong Sin is adopted.

196
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,290
Adopted?

197
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,940
Yeah, adopted.

198
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,690
If that's the case, how and when it happened,

199
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,630
if she knows herself,

200
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,030
I need to know.

201
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,980
I'm in charge of the homepage. I do everything in art design, editing, and marketing.

202
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,120
Before entering this company,
I was working to make a homepage...

203
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,620
Then, you can make a video page for Someday.

204
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,410
There are some things as models, so keep that in mind.

205
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,560
The deadline is tomorrow.

206
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,200
To-tomorrow?

207
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,420
Excuse me, the introduction to our office

208
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,590
isn't supposed to be done so roughly like this.

209
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,200
Go to Public Procurement Service.
You can contact that number and give my name.

210
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,670
They'll tell you where you need to go and find out what.

211
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,550
- And you...
- My name is Noh Seon Jae.

212
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,250
Print out the items from that list. The goal is simple.

213
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,850
Finding out President Hwang Jae Gook and Kim Ui Chan's relationship.

214
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,060
- Yes!
- Move, move, move!

215
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,480
Excuse me, wait a minute.

216
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Even if we look like nothing, we have articles
of our own that we upload every single day.

217
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,250
We have a special article that we're in the middle of preparing right now, too.

218
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,560
But, if you take all those out then...

219
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,770
You receive press release materials
from each entertainment agency, copy and paste.

220
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,290
Why don't you and I work on such things later,

221
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,810
and just let the kids run around the scene.

222
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,600
It seems you have a misunderstanding...

223
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,460
Yesterday afternoon, Kim Ui Chan put in
his complaint to reporters

224
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,070
saying he can't even drink, he's never been to a hostess bar in his life, and being accused for getting sexual favor is so unfair.

225
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,060
This is the list of high-class bars in the neighborhood
where Hwang Jae Gook often appears.

226
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,830
Investigate every single one of them and find out which bar Hwang Jae Gook goes to.

227
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:46,530
You look like you can run well,
you want to become a reporter doing leg-work??

228
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,670
I...I...

229
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,760
- If you don't have confidence, then Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yes.

230
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,490
Look through every hostess bar in that neighborhood
and meet every girl (hostess) and bouncer there.

231
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:56,910
- And all massage parlors there, drivers...
- I'll...

232
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,780
I do it. I'll work hard.

233
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,550
Then, you follow me.

234
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:04,460
Excuse me, Reporter Kim Moon Ho?

235
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,770
- "Sunbae."
- Eh?

236
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:09,070
"Sunbae."

237
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,430
Ah, Sunbae.

238
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,510
Ah, this guy here...Park Bong Soo is a complete rookie.

239
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,150
It's a bit risky to send him alone. So, I'll go with him,

240
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,820
- organize it, and then give it back to him...
- Follow me.

241
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,980
Ah, he's a complete rookie.

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,200
Park Bong Soo, in this kind of situation,
how far can I appeal...

243
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,100
no, how far do you think I should appeal?

244
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,500
I have an authority over HR too...

245
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:32,990
I seriously...

246
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,960
You can't give it to him.

247
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,830
I'll be back.

248
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,300
But, can I have your phone number? In case of emergency,

249
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,500
I...I might need to give you a call.

250
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,220
So, your number is 010-

251
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,160
Oh, never mind here...

252
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,190
If you can type it in, your number.

253
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,040
Ah, thank you.

254
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
Now, come this way.

255
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,050
Ah, wait a bit. I'm sorry I just sent you a text.

256
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,140
This is my mobile profile.

257
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,460
It came out yesterday, so it's completely new. Then, I'll be going now.

258
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,070
Now, this way.

259
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,230
Ah, I have to go out here.

260
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,890
Fighting! Yes, I'll work hard.

261
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,090
Park Bong Soo.

262
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,200
Kim Moon Ho and his brother.

263
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,220
I need to find out what these guys are planning.

264
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,200
Hello? Healer?

265
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,620
Just a while ago, I planted a program on Kim Moon Ho's phone.

266
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,910
Go through his phone and connect mine with his.

267
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,380
It's still not too late. If you take a cab right now and go to the airport...

268
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,170
No.

269
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,460
Why are you making me say the same thing twice?

270
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,380
Here, I'll say it once more.

271
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,320
Tell my teacher.

272
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,330
I'll wait until the sun sets...

273
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,880
If he doesn't show up by then,

274
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,710
then he won't be hearing me calling him teacher ever again.

275
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,920
One is a poop dog,

276
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,950
and the other is a mutt.

277
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,550
I've been partners with these two for the last 10 years--

278
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,630
So, what are you going to do now?

279
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,050
You're not going to do the thing Kim Moon Ho asked you to do, right?

280
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,370
I'm going to do it.

281
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,970
Why?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,270
I have nothing particular to do until sunset.

283
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,800
So, you're going to dig through hostess bars
and investigate?

284
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,470
We don't do something that amateur.

285
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:39,920
You're not going to tell me to look through every CCTV around that area, right?

286
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,170
- Are you going to do it for me?
- Without getting paid?

287
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,460
Do you think I went crazy?

288
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,110
Exactly.

289
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,860
Tell this to Teacher. The sun is short. It's going to set soon.

290
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,350
What?

291
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,480
The thing is...

292
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,820
Why are we... going there again?

293
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,970
Ah, why are you changing
into your work suit in broad day light?

294
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm curious.

295
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,470
Ah, you don't even respond if I ask you.

296
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,000
It's because I have a stomachache.
Since I went to that house, my stomach doesn't feel well.

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,400
My burps aren't coming out either.

298
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,690
Hyung, you can't digest? Do you want me to stop by a pharmacy? You need to take some medicine.

299
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,530
That's why I'm going, to digest.

300
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,230
On the way, I can take care
of some other business too.

301
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:42,730
What are you saying? Whenever you talk,
you always make it so that only you can understand.

302
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,960
I just looked through Kim Moon Ho's phone,

303
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,850
and he's the client who paid well,
asking to get Chae Yeong Sin's DNA sample,

304
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,960
investigate her, and find out what her dream is.

305
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,660
It's Kim Moon Ho just as you suspected.

306
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,470
There's something I didn't tell you.

307
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,310
What?

308
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:11,680
Actually, this client gave a new assignment yesterday.

309
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,380
Why are you telling me that now?

310
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,330
What did you hear this morning? Didn't you hear me
saying Healer's business will be closed for a while?

311
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,940
Closed?

312
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,800
Watch the front. The front.

313
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,550
So, what's the assignment?

314
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,800
Protect Chae Yeong Sin's safety.

315
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
Protect what?

316
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,030
Especially, watch out for Je Il Newspaper's CEO, Kim Moon Sik,

317
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:38,580
and Bae Sang Soo's gangs who are suspected
to be Kim Moon Sik's underlings. That's what he said.

318
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,350
Kim Moon Sik is that guy's brother. What is this?

319
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:47,470
This suspicious and funky smell in this household.

320
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,800
-You know?
-Of course, Oriana Fallaci.

321
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,890
This person is my #1 role model.

322
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,740
- Let's start.
- Eh?

323
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,180
You said she's your role model. You know Fallaci is the queen of interviews, right?

324
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,690
"Fo sho" I know that...

325
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:13,020
Your language should be clear and classy.

326
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,330
Of course, I know.

327
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,360
Have you even done an interview before?

328
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,740
You're making me sad. Even if I look like this,
I'm a veteran reporter of Someday News.

329
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,040
I mostly interview top class stars...

330
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,450
Following them around like paparazzi?

331
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,130
Crawling around someone else's parking lot and looking for someone's licence plate?

332
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,970
Also, this Someday.

333
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,860
Isn't it a B class ranking that can't even
get invited to a star's party?

334
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:49,770
Then what should you do? Wait outside the restaurant

335
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,050
and take a picture of the star after they finish eating? And that's news?

336
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,190
Is that it?

337
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,700
Is that ... well ... Is that bad?

338
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,410
Like Reporter Kim Moon Ho...

339
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,860
Sunbae.

340
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:09,340
If the reporters don't follow around political and financial news like you do, Sunbae, are they laughable?

341
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,800
I'm sorry, but Korean citizens like entertainment news
rather than political, financial news.

342
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,000
Ask people on the streets. What news do they watch first when they get up in the morning?

343
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,320
Political section? No, it's the entertainment news.

344
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,790
How many people do you think would know our country's political leaders?

345
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:32,640
But they basically know most of the idols and drama characters.

346
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,200
So, I crawl around the parking lots

347
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,090
to find out what the country wants to know and find out...

348
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,110
This Sunday...

349
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,180
I'm not finished talking yet. I crawl around...

350
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,070
Kim Ui Chan will announce
his candidacy for the Mayor of Seoul.

351
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:49,250
I'm planning on sending you to his press conference.

352
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,790
We need to find any opportunity to question about Hwang Jae Gook and Joo Yeon Hee.

353
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,800
Directly to Kim Ui Chan in front of thousands of cameras and mics.

354
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,460
But that's easier said than done...

355
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,440
I'm planning on teaching you "that know how".

356
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,630
Do you want to do it?

357
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,400
I want to do it.

358
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,800
It seems Hwang Jae Gook's side brought in a terrifying law firm team.

359
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,730
But I'm not even a professional in this field,

360
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,020
and our side's evidence is lacking.

361
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:34,730
So, I'm going to need help.

362
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:39,840
I'm a witness. What they did and how I got victimized,

363
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,770
I know everything, but what more evidence do you need?

364
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,960
I'm saying I'll tell my story that I forever want to hide and just die instead.

365
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:50,930
Joo Yeon Hee.

366
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,570
Tell them to go through Hwang Jae Gook's house.

367
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,420
There's evidence there.

368
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:00,080
He filmed all the things he made us do, so...

369
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,630
In order to go through the house,
we have to have a seizure and search warrant,

370
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,770
and for that, the nature of his crime
needs to be convincing.

371
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,400
But in order to make it convincing,
we need that evidence.

372
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,740
What kind of a law is this?

373
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,960
The law is always like this.
The ones who have (money) slip out on their own,

374
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,960
and the ones who don't, get caught every time.

375
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,380
Hyungnim.

376
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,190
I'm now working as a lawyer here.

377
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,300
Yeong Sin requested to take care of her.

378
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,850
I'm watching over her now.

379
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,360
Eh. We'll need more than you.

380
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,700
You couldn't even get rid of the reporters at the police station.

381
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,560
That's why there are tons of "dirty" news reports
about Joo Yeon Hee now.

382
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,830
Hey, you punk!

383
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,360
So, I called in some guys.

384
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:58,000
Have you been well?

385
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,390
Wow, your head is just shining. Come here.

386
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,640
Originally, I was going to just call one or two of them.

387
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,430
But, the news spread, and they said they needed to pay back their debt to you.

388
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,100
So, they just...

389
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,720
You guys. Greet him.

390
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,680
Hello, hyungnim.

391
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,980
What is that?

392
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,380
Hey, hey!

393
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:53,050
It seems so. Healer, that bastard,
who put the handcuffs on you...

394
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,920
What's going on?

395
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:04,950
Who are you? Who are you, bastard? How did you get in?

396
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,220
I studied a bit on the way here.

397
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,010
You've collected a lot of antiques,
President Hwang Jae Gook.

398
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:28,160
This is the one you purchased for 1.5 billion won
(USD 1.5 million) in September last year, right?

399
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,330
Hey! Who's out there...?

400
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,460
If you don't be quiet, I'll cut this up.

401
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,400
Wow, this crazy guy.

402
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,820
Like this.

403
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,890
This crazy bastard!

404
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:57,320
You like to hit people, right?

405
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:02,090
But there weren't many times when you were hit.

406
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,420
Ah, seriously. I was going to end it quietly today, but what can I do?

407
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,270
Oh! Ow!

408
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,730
Aigoo, stop it. Stop it. Just go!

409
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,840
Are you okay, President? President!

410
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:38,350
Aigoo, aigoo. Please save me! Wait, wait. Here.

411
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,090
Here, here. I have more cash than this.

412
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:47,740
If you go in the bedroom, there are dollars too. Watch, watch.

413
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,620
Take this instead. This is expensive.

414
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:56,310
Wow... you're turning me
into a petty thief in a second.

415
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:02,480
Aigoo, mother. Please, tell me what you need. Anything.

416
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,320
Ah, right. I have something I need to ask you.

417
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,610
Yes?

418
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,340
You know the bar you go to often, right?

419
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,530
What?

420
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,180
The name of the bar?

421
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,400
Luna Moon.

422
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,090
- Luna Moon?
-Yes.
- Thanks!

423
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,330
And...

424
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,220
Don't hit people from now on.
You've been hit, so you know it hurts, right?

425
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,260
Yes.

426
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,440
Especially, don't hit women.

427
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,430
So embarrassing. Why would a man hit a women?

428
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,880
I won't hit them.

429
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,250
Where's the video?

430
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,490
What?

431
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:47,190
You have it. The one where you videotaped the women for your business.

432
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,710
Thanks.

433
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,570
Huh?

434
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,520
Let's use a good safe.

435
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,640
This won't even take 30 seconds.

436
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,740
Aigoo, mother.

437
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,690
- President!
- Move! Out of the way!

438
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,410
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

439
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:13,860
Look at how I look. What is this at my own house?!

440
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,810
Damn! Aigoo!

441
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,710
Ah, now I feel refreshed.

442
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,500
Sit.

443
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,700
I heard from Chief Kang that you're close with Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

444
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,540
Close...yes that's right.

445
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,100
You know that Moon Ho is my biological brother, right?

446
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,890
Yes, of course.

447
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,520
I know, yes.

448
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,980
You also know he turned in a resignation letter to that company.

449
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,960
I heard.

450
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,390
So, I have a request.

451
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,380
Please tell me.

452
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:25,600
This is a quite sensitive request.

453
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:36,800
I understand. You want me to go find Sunbae and change his mind. That's...

454
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,600
Please turn in a resignation letter.

455
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,030
-What?
-Turn in a resignation letter to your station (ABS),

456
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,600
and go next to my brother, Kim Moon Ho.

457
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,500
Chief Kang said if it's you, he might take you in.

458
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:59,320
Excuse me... the place Sunbae went is
an online newspaper company,

459
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,870
and you want me to write a resignation letter
for a public TV station and go there...?

460
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,000
Yes.

461
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,800
Then, you want me to be a spy?

462
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,600
Yes, exactly.

463
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,090
But, CEO...

464
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,890
Connect me to the HR manager.

465
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,570
Yes, I understand.

466
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,270
I won't request this for long. You just need to stay by him for a few months.

467
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,230
-I'll put you through to him now.
-Yes, Mr.CEO.

468
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:33,660
Yeah, I'll send a guy named Lee Jong Soo there,

469
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,220
so please write an employment contract
for him as the deputy chief of our news department.

470
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:42,530
I promised him double of his current salary,
so take care of it in that way.

471
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,690
Well, it's the actual practice from now on.
The interviewee is me.

472
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,170
You want me to interview you right now?

473
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:55,070
There's stuff you want to know. For example, why is Kim Moon Ho here?

474
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,620
Exactly, why are you here?

475
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,920
Are you dumb? Do you think I would respond if you ask me like that?

476
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,390
Excuse me, I'm sorry. But, we have something to talk about, so can you leave for a bit?

477
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:12,060
Lacking kid. An interview is done
even in the middle of war.

478
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,450
He said you can continue.

479
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,770
Yes.

480
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:24,660
Excuse me, Reporter Kim Moon Ho?
Actually there is something I can guess.

481
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,080
Your time at the news station wasn't good lately, right?

482
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,720
You kept ignoring the news station rules and kept reporting your own reports...

483
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,530
Don't make it seem like you know. If I feel as if you know a lot, then I would want to hold back first.

484
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:43,490
How much would I know?

485
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,170
But, it's because it's really weird. Reporter Kim Moon Ho can quit as a reporter.

486
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:51,120
I've thought about it, but it's weird it turned out like this.

487
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,630
What are you asking? The question has to be clear for the answer to be clear.

488
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,690
So, why did you come to this news company?

489
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,550
-What is that?
-What?

490
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:06,300
If it were you, would you answer obediently to such a question? Does a reporter not have any manners?

491
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:12,440
I'm requesting you. If it's a bit much to tell me the whole thing then if you just give me a hint...

492
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,420
A servile reporter is disgusting, you know.

493
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,360
Let's give up. What, veteran reporter? Do you even know what the word veteran means?

494
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,630
-Throw your shoe at least.
-What?

495
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:36,210
You need to catch my attention in order to keep doing the interview.

496
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,160
So, at least take off your shoes and throw it at me.

497
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:49,230
Uncle. Uncle Moon Ho, this broke.

498
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:53,540
It's all broken. You need to fix it for me.

499
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:57,120
I have a test tomorrow. Let me be.

500
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,160
I'm going to hate you.

501
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,470
Why not?

502
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:05,990
I'm really really going to hate you.

503
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:13,940
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

504
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,310
You little peanut.

505
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,640
No, I'm taller.

506
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,010
I'll catch you and eat you up. Come here, Ji An.

507
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:27,340
Ji An! I'm going to grill you!

508
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,740
Ah, I caught you.

509
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,100
I'm sorry, Moon Ho. We're late, aren't we?

510
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,420
If I mess up this test then you guys are taking responsibility alright?

511
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,530
Hey, hey don't say that to Moon Sik.

512
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,350
He already doesn't like you
babysitting our Ji An.

513
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,490
Oh Ji An, what time is it right now
that you're not sleeping but bothering your uncle?

514
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,440
Do you want to sleep with Daddy?

515
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,030
No, I'm going to sleep with Uncle. He said he's going to put me to sleep.

516
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:59,840
Uncle Moon Ho needs to go home now.

517
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,640
Uncle.

518
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,330
You little peanut.

519
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,920
No, I'm taller.

520
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,040
We're finished.

521
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,570
You've worked hard.

522
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:31,180
Here, I found a few helpful interviews for you to look at. So, look over them.

523
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,200
Ah, yes. Thank you.

524
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,940
He didn't take any of the money in the safe,

525
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,560
and just took one hard drive.

526
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,790
What's in that hard drive?

527
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,840
It's contents about the women Hwang Jae Gook took over.

528
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,180
It seems to include everything
from the drinking party to the bedroom.

529
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,500
According to Hwang Jae Gook,
he was going to use it to control his girls, but...

530
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:09,130
He was probably going to use it as a threat
to the guests who are getting "the service".

531
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,160
Is Kim Ui Chan among them?

532
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,690
He said Kim Ui Chan usually met
with Joo Yeon Hee at an apartment.

533
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:18,530
How much of it was recorded?

534
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:24,290
The camera was only in the living room, and the part recorded was only the part where they drank.

535
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,350
I know Kim Ui Chan; his habit is dirty.

536
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,770
It'll be hard for those babies (trees)
to go through this winter with only that.

537
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,610
I don't think rice straw pads will be enough.
What about giving some supplements?

538
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,540
Yes, I'll do that.

539
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,370
Isn't it you who's going to freeze first, then the trees?

540
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,420
It's cold, so just do enough.

541
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,130
Why did you come so early?

542
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:23,810
What? You sound as if you don't like it.

543
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,610
What did you do today?

544
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,450
There will be an exhibition on Chilean wines.

545
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:31,780
I was planning on ordering it online, so I searched online.

546
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,880
Also...

547
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,960
I read half the book you gave me.

548
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,830
And?

549
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,270
Look at where I'm looking at.

550
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,260
What are you looking at?

551
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,920
Soon this side will become yellow from the sunset.

552
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,730
The sky lately has gone crazy.

553
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,280
The sunset color is so awesome.

554
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,960
When is it coming out?

555
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,420
Aigoo, that eagerness.

556
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,980
You will never be able to fix it in your life.

557
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,890
I like it now.

558
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:41,510
I want time to stop right now.

559
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,560
Don't you feel the same, Moon Sik?

560
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,250
Look at us right now.

561
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,110
Oh, hey.

562
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,760
Hit it. Grab it.

563
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,440
Ah, hey! That's it, you're doing great.

564
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,250
Hey, hey. If I go easy on you, you're not going to learn anything.

565
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,210
Hey, hey! That's it! You're doing great!

566
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,990
I don't like it.

567
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,260
Why?

568
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,430
It's confusing. There's nothing set for sure either.

569
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,900
Living like this forever?

570
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,230
I don't like it.

571
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,350
Still, isn't your future more stable than ours?

572
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,350
You're going to inherit this junk yard too.

573
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,610
Hm? Hey.

574
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,880
CEO Kim.

575
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,740
You're not that interested...
in a guy like a CEO of a junk yard, are you?

576
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:39,750
You're going to become a reporter, like Gil Han.

577
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,390
I heard you guys are applying for the same newspaper company.

578
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,290
Yeah.

579
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,350
Joon Seok is also going to take it. Do you also have plans to be a reporter?

580
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,110
He doesn't.

581
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,120
This guy's thinking is simple.

582
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,780
Just wherever you are, Myeong Hee.

583
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:04,400
Hey, you're a man. Just ask her.

584
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,950
I like you.

585
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,170
What do you think?

586
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,230
That way you'll be able to start something or get dumped.

587
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:17,300
I think that you'll be dumped 100%, but who cares?

588
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,500
You can just drink alcohol all night,

589
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,390
and then get over it and become friends again.

590
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,410
Take care of it quickly.

591
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,360
That kind of thought is like moths.

592
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,860
If you keep dragging it on, it will eat up
the friendship of us, five friends, in the end.

593
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,470
It's sunset.

594
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:55,850
The sky... started to be dyed.

595
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:09,890
When he'd sent the message it had changed direction and he asked for verification,

596
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,890
he couldn't believe it.

597
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,600
I'm sorry. What did you say?

598
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,020
Commander Wreford-Brown demanded reconfirmation, did he not?

599
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,170
I do not-- I know when we gave the order to sink.

600
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,450
And that is all in the public domain.

601
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,700
I know it was right to sink her.

602
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,500
Come to the rooftop. -Healer

603
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,270
Gift-Item which came out from Hwang Jae Gook's safe.

604
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,710
Wait a minute.

605
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:30,130
You're still here, right?

606
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,520
You need to confirm I take this.

607
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,400
So, you're still here, right?

608
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,500
You see me, right?

609
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,540
Talk to me.

610
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:46,360
I... I won't look.

611
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,940
Look. Right now...

612
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,670
I'm covering my eyes.

613
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,880
I can't see anything.

614
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,760
So come out and talk to me.

615
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:05,430
I have something to ask.

616
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,290
So...

617
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,760
if you're Healer and you're looking at me now,
please answer me.

618
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,910
I won't take up your time for long.

619
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:18,970
I'll just cover my eyes like this and ask you a question.

620
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:34,800
The thing you want to ask...

621
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,560
What is it?

622
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,290
You're Healer, right?

623
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,570
That's right.

624
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:50,860
Last time, it was you who saved me at the alley, right?

625
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:54,400
That time...

626
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,310
When I was about to get dragged away
by the gangsters, you showed up and saved me.

627
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,340
You also gave me my medicine, and...

628
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:09,060
And hugged me, right?

629
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,760
Did you perhaps,

630
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,820
well...

631
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,080
take my bag last time

632
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,240
and cut my nails in the restroom?

633
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,930
You're the same person, right?

634
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:31,110
Also, you gave me this

635
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,250
as a gift.

636
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:38,840
But, why are you doing this?

637
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:46,520
This is just my thought.

638
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,530
Maybe I'm too delusional thinking in this way, but...

639
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:53,690
I'm usually like this, so I'm just going
to throw my question out there.

640
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:59,500
When you clipped my nails last time

641
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,160
was it to do a DNA test?

642
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:09,880
After that you looked after me, right?

643
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,780
So, that's why you could come and save me
on the day the gangsters showed up, right?

644
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:20,190
But, why?

645
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,980
Perhaps...

646
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:28,260
are you my biological father?

647
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,020
If not, my biological brother?

648
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:39,730
That DNA test,

649
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,850
you did it for a paternity test, right?

650
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,470
If not, then there's no way you would do all this...

651
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,290
Who are you?

652
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:06,550
Who am I?

653
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:18,290
♬ It's a beautiful feeling, what we've got deep inside ♬

654
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,200
I told you, didn't I?

655
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,750
Eh?

656
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,310
Don't follow anyone fearlessly.

657
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:29,240
A person who comes near you and is nice to you...

658
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,960
Be careful of that person.

659
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,250
What does that mean?

660
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:37,380
Why?

661
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:48,260
♬ We can make it if we stay together, our love is just enough ♬

662
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:55,520
♬ Oh, my love, I'm all yours ♬

663
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,580
Excuse me.

664
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:59,210
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

665
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,890
Are you still there?

666
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,820
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

667
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,780
You left?

668
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:16,300
♬ My heart's aflame, and it's burning in your name ♬

669
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:24,120
♬ Even through the sands of time, my love will always grow ♬

670
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,220
♬ My eternal love ♬

671
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:35,670
The sunset is beautiful.
That the sunset is glowing...

672
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,760
Means that the sun's setting soon.

673
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,350
And it also means that Jeong Hoo will be
totally pissed off at you,

674
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:46,160
and become like a bull in a china shop.

675
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,970
Long time no see, Detective Jo.

676
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,600
How was the South Pacific?

677
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,260
It was blue and hot.

678
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,520
But, I guess you still worried about your student since you ran right over.

679
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,250
My student probably went over to that guy's house by now, right?

680
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,470
He probably did.

681
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,440
Detective Jo, do you believe in fate?

682
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:09,570
Rather than fate I trust in my newly bought
kimbab (Korean style sushi roll) maker.

683
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:14,610
It rolls really well. It doesn't burst
even if I just roll it roughly.

684
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:18,700
It was around this time of year in 1981,
when I was arrested, wasn't it?

685
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:24,290
You were quite notorious. I heard they beat
you up a lot to make you name your friends.

686
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:29,890
But even the detectives who beat you up were tired of beating you, cursing at you that you were disgustingly tenacious.

687
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,370
Ah. I believed

688
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:39,960
that if I kept my mouth closed,
the other four guys would become happy.

689
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,570
I thought so.

690
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:45,540
But, after 11 years, when you were released,

691
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:50,100
you saw that among your four friends,
two were dead and one was paralyzed.

692
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:54,730
Only one friend became super successful, so you thought it was suspicious. Why didn't you dig into it?

693
00:51:54,730 --> 00:51:59,840
Dig into what? The truth?
If I find out something after digging into it,

694
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,620
then do you think they'll be happy?

695
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,930
Happy?

696
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:12,290
Ah, why do I get a stomachache whenever I hear those words?

697
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:18,790
Be happy. Be rich. They say those crap.

698
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:22,640
That's why the truth and the crap have similar nuances too.

699
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,900
So, I decided to just bury them, but Detective Jo...

700
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,530
-What?
-It seems that a crappy truth has fate.

701
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:37,360
That's why it draws people in.
Just as now, Jeong Hoo is drawn to it.

702
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,510
The end of truth can't only be happiness.
It can also be hell.

703
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,570
Even so, you can't help it because it's fate, right?

704
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:45,270
♬ The dream like a lie
The memories of meeting you ♬

705
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:52,120
♬ I will still wait for you here ♬

706
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:58,380
♬ I can't move because my heart flutters ♬

707
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:04,400
♬ When you look at me ♬

708
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:11,810
♬ Why I can't say a word ♬

709
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,140
Who are you? Who am I?
♬ Although there are so many things I want to say ♬

710
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:27,390
♬ The moment you turn around,
why does it feel so remote to me?  ♬

711
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:32,220
They said he's always alone. He's alone in the darkness.

712
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:38,880
I know that kind of a feeling a bit.
I wished that no one would look at me,

713
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,860
that no one would know me.

714
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,700
♬ I have nothing but you ♬

715
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:52,970
♬ Even if I can't go to you or hug you
or cry by myself, I'm okay ♬

716
00:54:52,970 --> 00:55:03,630
♬ I will always watch over you ♬

717
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:31,300
The camera is malfunctioning for now.
Only an empty room will be recorded.

718
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,890
If you call someone it'll get noisy.

719
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:40,530
Then, the madam will wake up.

720
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,430
Perhaps...

721
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,350
are you the person called Healer?

722
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:51,100
Bingo. Please take a seat.

723
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,800
Rotate your seat towards the screen.

724
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,460
Is it correct that you are the one who asked to get

725
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,170
the video files on that screen from Go Seong Cheol?

726
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,240
And the one who murdered Go Seong Cheol and framed it on me

727
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,470
was also you.

728
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

729
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,090
A video file that you want to keep as secret even to the point of murder.

730
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:47,780
That's great, so I have a bit of a talent for hacking.

731
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:54,490
I can slip that video file into any station or 9 o' clock news.

732
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:58,660
As a live broadcast to the whole nation.

733
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:03,400
Where anyone everyone can see it all.

734
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,360
I heard that an errand boy named Healer

735
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,200
has very high credibility, though.

736
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:14,890
That he never steals the items of his client,

737
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,700
and never makes a copy (of the client's item) like this.

738
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:22,200
That's before I was framed as a murderer.

739
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:26,510
If you need money, tell me the amount.

740
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:32,450
Can't it be a bit fresher line?
Everybody says the same thing.

741
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:37,060
"I don't know you're saying. How much do you need?"

742
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,000
It's getting a bit boring.

743
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,400
What is it you want?

744
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,610
The real murderer.

745
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:12,910
You have exactly three days.
Turn in the real murderer to the police.

746
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,670
Then, I'll make it as if the video didn't exist.

747
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:20,340
You want me to believe those words?

748
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:24,810
As you already know, I live off my credibility.

749
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:30,540
If a rumor spreads that I took a client's property,
then it'll put me in a tight spot too.

750
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:34,240
I'll give you three days.

751
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:40,900
Hwang Jae Gook's safe.
Did you break into it too?

752
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:48,200
That's my trade secret. I'm sorry.

753
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,700
That emergency alarm is broken.
You'll need to repair it.

754
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,430
Joon Seok!

755
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,500
You're Joon Seok, right?

756
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:50,560
♬ I don't know why my eyes only look for you ♬

757
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:56,430
♬ Or why it hurts while looking at you ♬

758
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:03,630
♬ or why my heart beats like crazy ♬

759
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:10,030
♬ I don't wanna let you go ♬

760
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:11,070
What warning?

761
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:15,360
You won't ever contact Chae Yeong Sin personally.

762
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,920
Where did you find this?

763
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,840
Do you know about the nighttime errand boy?

764
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,710
Joon Seok had a son, right?

765
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:24,210
Jeong Hoo, Seo Jeong Hoo.

766
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:27,500
You met him? Did you see his face?

767
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,420
Can I ask what you requested of him?

768
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:34,200
That's everything about Chae Yeong Sin.

769
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,540
I've got an informant. Awesome!

770
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:39,700
Hello? Is there anyone there?

771
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,900
♬ If I'm in your mind ♬
