00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,180
Episode 10

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,250
Today at 4 pm, Kim Ui Chan will hold a press conference to officially announce his Seoul city mayoral candidacy.

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,450
At the same time, Someday Daily will be doing its first internet broadcast.

4
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,800
Only those reporters on the list can go in.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,060
The other reporters or broadcasting stations
that are not on the list

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:21,470
can neither ask any questions,
nor enter the press conference hall.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,950
Someday or Monday, with this name,
we can't even dream of going in.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:28,220
GK's Representative Kim Se Gwang's son

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,100
is having an engagement party in the room next door.

10
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,930
Are there people you know?

11
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:36,690
It won't be easy for them to stop
the guests for that party.

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,270
Huh? Camouflage penetration?
Us?

13
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,200
Happy worker Kim Ui Chan, for a more special Seoul, and more special citizens
Justice Democratic Party Kim Eui Chan's Seoul Mayoral Candidacy Announcement Press Conference

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,890
Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan will arrive discreetly at the press conference location,

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,620
so he doesn't take any silly questions on the way to the press conference room.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,300
Let us go in, please!

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,550
Only press companies on the list are able to enter the press conference room.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:11,630
Questions will be also asked in the pre-determined order on the pre-determined topics.

19
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,180
So, there isn't a chance for anything unexpected to happen.

20
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,910
What the higher-ups are most worried about is the issue with that woman.

21
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,090
You know, that woman who sued Assemblyman Kim for sexual assault.

22
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,160
You know that nothing similar to that can come on air, right?

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,290
We are aware.

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,190
Our station is the only one covering this press conference live,

25
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,370
so let's be absolutely careful so we don't get blamed.

26
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,660
We will be careful.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,110
They arrived just now.

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,790
Someday News

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,280
I think this is good enough for the photos.

30
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,500
- Will you really be alright?
- What do you mean?

31
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,980
You are this generation's symbol of conscience and truth.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,100
But if you go around promoting yourself like some kind of a celebrity, won't you look bad?

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,170
One of my friends told me that I'm addicted to popularity.

34
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,240
If I really have popularity, please sell it all.

35
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,080
-Sell it?
-Kim Moon Ho who escaped from the shackles of public broadcasting has begun a show.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,760
Let's see how funny it is.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,870
I got it, then. We, the entertainment news reporters, have a pretty tight bond with each other, you know.

38
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,740
Even if higher-ups interfere our work,
that's just about how "sexy" the titles of articles are.

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,730
We'll try to create a ruckus.

40
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,700
Thank you.

41
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm sorry, but your company's name is not on the list.

42
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,420
- Oh, please, check it again, please!
- Sorry, no. Next!

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,180
No, you can't enter. I'm sorry. Next person, please.

44
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,480
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're controlling this area right now.

45
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,960
Who, and for what reason, is controlling me?

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,310
Oh. The Crystal Room Engagement Hall. We want to check on the preparations. We're cousins on the groom's side.

47
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,120
Ah, yes the engagement.

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Oppa, I'm about to get in a bad mood. Do something about it.

49
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,930
Oh. Who should I call?

50
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,200
Should I call for Secretary Kim? Or Secretary Park?

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,780
Call the CEO of this place. Tell him
to come here himself before I explode.

52
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,160
When people like us explode there's societal criticism. So before that...

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,490
Oh, the Crystal Room is that way.

54
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,920
You need to go inside.

55
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,990
Oh, it's cramped.

56
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,160
We're sorry.

57
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,570
The women's restroom? How can I go there?

58
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,280
Then how do you expect me to go inside the men's restroom?
Hey!

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,930
What are you doing...
Hey, what's wrong with you two...

60
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,600
Yes, Sunbae. We're all set. We just have to get in.

61
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,110
Your job is to get a chance
to ask a question, no matter what.

62
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,000
It doesn't matter if you don't get a response.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,130
Just ask as many questions as you can, and then transfer it to the live feed. I'll take it from there.

64
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,770
Okay, I can ask questions. I'll do that.

65
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,980
Why do you keep calling? I'm busy.

66
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,470
Why are you busy? What are you doing there that makes you busy?

67
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,900
I'm being a reporter right now.

68
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,800
Exactly. Why are you playing a reporter right now?

69
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,790
Someone's doing a press conference right now. I have to go film it.

70
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,390
Who?

71
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,680
I don't know. I heard the name earlier, but I didn't memorize it.

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,040
There are probably dozens of cameras there, and you're just hanging around.

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,290
I'm good at avoiding cameras. Don't worry. I'm busy. I'm hanging up now.

74
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,060
You have detectives on you now.

75
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,290
Dae Yong took photos and sent them to me. They are looking into everyone around Chae Yeong Sin.

76
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:04,010
You've already been photographed.
What? You're good at avoiding cameras?

77
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,410
Park Bong Soo. Will they do a background investigation on him?

78
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,620
These are guys under Yoon Dong Won.

79
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,510
Don't you think we should think about why they're investigating Chae Young Sin?

80
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,960
I'm getting suspicious. Get out of there as soon as possible.

81
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,330
I can't right now.

82
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,200
Why not?

83
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,970
I've received a commission.

84
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,930
How can you receive a commission without me knowing? From who?

85
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,420
From myself.
To stay next to Chae Yeong Sin.

86
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,250
I'm busy. I'm hanging up now.

87
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,550
What are you doing? Finish up and come out.

88
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,500
PHONE sending...
PHONE Connect

89
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,780
Detective Jo, I'm busy.

90
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,150
Whether it's the old guy or the young one, these guys, really...!

91
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,720
What again?

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,190
The reins have finally come loose on your pupil now. What are you going to do?

93
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,730
Personnel Records

94
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,770
These people here, I want to cross-check one by one.
I want you to get the data of their identity information.

95
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,730
See if their addresses and work experience
are correct. Oh, right...

96
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,510
Face, that's important.
These pictures in here,

97
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,650
check if they match with other IDs like their drivers' licenses.

98
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,000
- Okay.
- Thanks.

99
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,950
Welcome. It's just about to begin.

100
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,100
Let's watch. We can talk after we've watched it.

101
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,870
Coming up next, Live Broadcast of Kim Ui Chan's Official Declaration of Candidacy for Seoul Mayor Press Conference

102
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,600
Alright, let's start.
High, cue.

103
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,000
Captions coming in.
Captions, in.

104
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:48,450
First off, we'll have Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan present his personal statement regarding his candidacy.

105
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,640
My beloved Seoul citizens, you have all worked hard today as well to get through

106
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,270
the difficult times in this tough world.

107
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:06,180
I, Kim Ui Chan, for the citizens of Seoul,

108
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,840
am here today with the intention of lightening
their heavy and weary minds as much as I can.

109
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,950
Seoul is the center of South Korea.

110
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:18,610
If Seoul weakens, Korea weakens.

111
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:24,630
If Seoul stands firm, Korea stands firm.

112
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,630
I am Reporter Yoo Jae Seok from Jeong Dong Newspaper.

113
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:40,400
Your public promise of securing the safety of Seoul is interesting. Please elaborate further.

114
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,580
Welfare, urban development, or creating more jobs.
All of them are also important.

115
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,410
But everyone is now overlooking
what's more important.

116
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,660
It is none other than the health of our Seoul citizens.

117
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,130
Under our feet right now

118
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:01,170
flows something that endangers our health.
That is water.

119
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:06,290
Do you think the water we drink is safe?

120
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,740
No, it is not.

121
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,330
But, why is no one saying anything about it?

122
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,650
This cannot be solved individually.

123
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,580
It's difficult for me to take a call right now. Let's talk later.

124
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,240
No, we have to talk now. It won't take long
so give me some of your time.

125
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,280
What is the matter?

126
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,030
I think I have to let you know first.

127
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,730
You should be the first to know more than anyone else.
You, quietly.

128
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,520
Tell me. What is it?

129
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,370
I, Kim Ui Chan,

130
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,100
have a concrete vision and plan

131
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,640
for Seoul's tap water system.
I want to point that out.

132
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,720
Please ask the next question.

133
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,460
You have to grab an opportunity to ask him about Hwang Jae Gook and Joo Yeon Hee.

134
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,360
To Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan, in front of those cameras.

135
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm asking if you want to do it.

136
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,470
Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan, you know Joo Yeon Hee, right?

137
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,880
I am Reporter Park Seong Sik from Jo Han Daily.

138
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,480
You said you would not commit to a negative campaign,

139
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,020
- and so, what kind of campaign plans you have...
- You might as well

140
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,700
throw your shoes. You need to catch my interest in order to continue with the interview.

141
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,790
Yes. Ummm, my campaign...

142
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,890
The strategy would be...

143
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,550
It has been said that Empire Construction Company's CEO Hwang Jae Gook introduced her to you.

144
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,390
What kind of favor did he want in return?

145
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,230
What is she?!

146
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:20,270
In 2011, when Empire Construction won
the bid of sewerage construction,

147
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,100
you were the chairman of Strategy
and Finance Committee then, weren't you?

148
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,940
Right after that, you purchased
an apartment in Seocho District,

149
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,720
and that apartment was the place you used to meet Miss Joo Yeon Hee secretly.

150
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,330
What did you say?

151
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:37,980
I'm saying sorry. It would've been better
if it weren't you to control the outside broadcast ban.

152
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,760
But, it's you.

153
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,190
All we needed was 30 seconds.

154
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,350
That's why the only thing I could do was drag you out of there.

155
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,730
I'm sorry Min Jae.

156
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,310
We, Someday News, and Reporter Kim Moon Ho
will be reporting about this matter.

157
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,140
Who Kim Ui Chan's woman is and
what his relation is with Empire Construction...

158
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,180
If you now go search Someday News, you'll find Reporter Kim Moon Ho-

159
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,020
- You're working hard.
Justice Party Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan's Candidacy for Seoul Mayor

160
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,870
I'm Kim Ui Chan.

161
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,690
Did they say it is Someday News?

162
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,690
I will go make a call for just a moment.

163
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,570
What call?

164
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,960
For now, I think we need to use all the emergency contacts we have and have them control the media, newspapers, TVs...

165
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,150
You heard, right?

166
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,330
Get on it.

167
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,440
Earlier, that woman in red ...

168
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,800
I will take action for that.

169
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
What kind of action would you be taking and how?

170
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,660
A reporter asked a question during
the press conference. Is that a crime?

171
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,030
It can be a crime. I will make it so.

172
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,630
She's already

173
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,640
a reporter who has come out on a national public broadcast.

174
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,900
She's also quite a pretty and assertive reporter.

175
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,750
If you do anything to that lady,

176
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,700
that will actually become the top news.

177
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,610
Kim Moon Ho is warning us properly right now.

178
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,790
"Don't mess with that child."

179
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,160
We, Someday News, have acquired a video on CEO Hwang Jae Gook's prostitution.

180
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,750
We have secretly received this information from an anonymous informant.

181
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,680
In this video, there are 14 men who are accepting sexual favors.

182
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:54,350
One of them is pointed out to be Assemblyman K who has announced his Seoul mayoral candidacy today,

183
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,100
and though we were in the process of verifying it, he couldn't give an answer as you all saw.

184
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,270
We have asked the woman involved.

185
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:06,070
What did she hear when she was first
introduced to Assemblyman K?

186
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,240
How did he tell you about Assemblyman K?

187
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,590
You mean Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan?

188
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,710
Yes.

189
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,820
That he'll become the future mayor of Seoul.

190
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,700
He also said that whoever holds the position of Seoul City Mayor will later also become the future President.

191
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,220
I've fully mobilized all the emergency contacts
of the media departments of politics and local news.

192
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,550
- But...
- But?

193
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,620
It sprung out from a totally unexpected source.

194
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,680
This is coming up as a main issue on each media company's entertainment section or online entertainment news sites.

195
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,700
With the photos of Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

196
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,270
As if they've been waiting for it,
they're reporting it all at once.

197
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:01,410
Reporter Kim Moon Ho's doing well.

198
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,420
I will try finding a solution.

199
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,280
Chairman Kim.

200
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,170
Yes?

201
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,730
I think we will have to throw him away.
Kim Ui Chan.

202
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,660
We can still cover for it. That's why--

203
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,330
Would you like to...

204
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,410
have that position?

205
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,590
We, Someday News, cannot do a broadcast every day.

206
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,960
We could be on-air once a week, but not for a long time.

207
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,170
But even if we just go on-air once,

208
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,380
we won't do a broadcast which shouldn't be on-air,

209
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,360
or which will cover the eyes of the powerless people
for the powerful people's sake.

210
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,000
We will be here again when we have
something that we must say.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,810
We will conclude the first broadcast of Someday News with this.

212
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:59,930
Thank you for watching our news.

It's Sunbae Kim Moon Ho, right?

244
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,880
1) A senior she respects, and a junior he takes care of.

245
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,910
2) A man-woman relationship.

246
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,480
What number could it be?

247
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,650
If it's number 2, then it's good to give up early.

248
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,680
If it's number 1, then I might as well make my move...

249
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,650
Ah, it's cold.

250
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,200
Not at all. I just did what you said.

251
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,100
But I did better than I thought I would.

252
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,370
Actually, I surprised myself.

253
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,280
I really didn't know I had such a nut-job attitude in myself.

254
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,690
You know I'm usually timid and reserved.

255
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,130
You did well.

256
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,720
You did even better than I thought you would.

257
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,860
Wow, I got complimented.

258
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:46,190
It'll get hard starting from now. You'll face things you thought you would never before, and you'll need to fight them.

259
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,440
I'm prepared for it. Teach me please.

260
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,930
Alright, take a rest today. Jong Soo is there, right?

261
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,770
I'll give him a call to give you a ride home.

262
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:59,500
No, he doesn't have to.
It can become a gender discrimination.

263
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,600
Do as I say.

264
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,400
- Alright, I'll take a rest.
- Okay.

265
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,220
- Wait, Sunbae.
- Yeah?

266
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,740
You're also a better person than I thought.

267
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,480
I was mistaken for a bit.

268
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,640
Thank you.

269
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,870

Thank you Ji An.

273
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,960
Oh, Park Bong Soo. It's seems you're getting better at catching onto things as days pass by.

274
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,140
Your sense to catch on is growing like corns with gene engineering.

275
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,160
Kid...

276
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,280
One thing that I really don't like about Sunbae Moon Ho is

277
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,490
this person doesn't know the feeling of a dinner outing.

278
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:34,430
We, people who work in an organization,

279
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,650
when we accomplish something like we did today...

280
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,830
... and right after finishing one project,

281
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,770
we should have some dinner outing and go to the karaoke room.

282
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,170
- What, what?
- Right there. You see that alley, right?

283
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,020
What? Where did they go?

284
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,350
Hey, hey. Turn around. Make a U-turn.

285
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,710
Stop! Stop!

286
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,700
- Wait just a moment.
- Why, why?

287
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,180
Sunbae, hurry, hurry!

288
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,070
Why, why, why? What are you doing? Why?

289
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,520
Go first, go first.

290
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,350
- What?
- There.

291
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,720
What are you doing? Where are we going?

292
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,360
Sunbae.

293
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,280
- Say it.
- Let's... dine out.

294
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,920
What?

295
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,810
The two of us, let's go out to eat.

296
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,080
To drink?

297
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,330
- Just the two of us?
- Yeah.

298
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:56,000
Okay, actually earlier it was a bit awkward with Jong Soo, right?

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,160
Of c-c-course.

300
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,930
Shouldn't we go drink wine
while wearing these clothes?

301
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,480
Huh?

302
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,210
Alright, let's go have a good time today.

303
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,300
Ah, wait.

304
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,420
Can't we go where I want to go?

305
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,600
Do you have somewhere in mind?

306
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,260
But, there isn't any wine there.

307
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,670
Then, what? Soju?

308
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,520
This way.

309
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:15,650
Youngster, what was your name?

310
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,880
If you keep glaring at the world like that,

311
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,260
nothing comes out except tears.

312
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,810
Just for once, close your eyes.

313
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,790
Then open them again.

314
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,650
Then, you'll be able to see things you haven't before.

315
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,350
That's called growth.

316
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,120
Deceiving the world,

317
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,810
testifying falsely,

318
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,860
and betraying a friend.

319
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,890
That...

320
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,570
is growth, you say?

321
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:55,520
That's right.

322
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,650
That way you'll live.

323
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,440
Also, the woman you worried about so much,

324
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:06,720
she'll be able to live too.

325
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:12,070
She will be able to get the best treatment
from the best medical center.

326
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,000
For now you need to live.

327
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,220
That way you'll be able to do something.

328
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,490
Whether it's atonement or love.

329
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,760
Realizing those means growth.

330
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:36,900
So, what was your name again young man?

331
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,150
You came by yourself?

332
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,790
That's what I'm saying. Why am I by myself?

333
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,770
I'm not even a loner.

334
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,860
What is this?

335
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,000
It seems it's Reporter Choi and Park's clothing.

336
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,210
Those people...they leave me out only.

337
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,200
Am I really a total loner...?

338
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
Everyone went to a dinner outing. Let's go together.

339
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,500
Oh, company dinner?

340
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,030
Yeah, Kim Moon Ho...what should I call him?

341
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:26,380
- Sunbae, Sunbae.
- President? Reporter?

342
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,320
A bar should be at a lower level,
not a high place like this...

343
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,500
It's better at like, say, a basement.
Not here, but...

344
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,460
I...

345
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,020
Uh, I...

346
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:53,650
I like high places.

347
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,150
So...

348
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:59,200
should I say that I like looking at people from high up?

349
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,380
There are a few places like this around Seoul,

350
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,740
which I share with security guards,
or which are sometimes demolished soon...

351
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,010
It's....like my secret place.

352
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,610
You like looking at people from high up?

353
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:21,850
Then I can see people, but they can't see me.

354
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,720
A secret place?

355
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,100
A secret place.

356
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,780
You're at floor 19.

357
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,400
This way.

358
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,640
What? You can't open it?

359
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:31,020
That...the key was in the clothes that we took off before ...

360
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,680
Geez.

361
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,160
If you tell anyone else about this, you'll die.

362
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,540
Wow.

363
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,720
Wow!

364
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,760
Wow.

365
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,260
The day I first went to your house,

366
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,880
your father gave me a few warnings.

367
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,780
My Dad? What'd he say?

368
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,860
First, not to let you drink.

369
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,900
Especially when the dinosaur story comes out, it's dangerous.

370
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,100
Ay, when was...you're talking about a long time ago.

371
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:10,060
It's been a long time since I've talked about dinosaurs, and nowadays I drink well.

372
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,360
So, it won't happen. Hurry and give it to me.

373
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,200
Also, secondly, don't let you open this kind of can.

374
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,100
One out of every three times you'll cut your finger.

375
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,080
Somehow, once in a blue moon, while opening them, I somehow cut it. He's overreacting.

376
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,330
Hey.

377
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,070
Here.

378
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,210
It's nice here.

379
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,420
That's a relief.

380
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,540
It looks like it won't snow.

381
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,360
Yeah.

382
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,540
It won't snow today.

383
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,040
- Park Bong Soo.
- Yeah?

384
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,540
Today, tell me your story.

385
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:16,380
I tell you my story every day.

386
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,680
I'll listen to you today.

387
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,350
Well, life situations or love.

388
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,840
I'm a good listener. Listener, a person who listens well, you know, right?

389
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,180
That person still hasn't come yet?

390
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,720
The person you're waiting for.

391
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,360
That isn't your story, it's mine. I said to say yours.

392
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,330
- My story then?
- Right.

393
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,350
Can't it be me?

394
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:05,330
Instead of that person whom you're waiting for but doesn't come, can't it be me who is staying beside you like this?

395
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:14,990
Hey, you can't make a joke. Your jokes aren't funny,
and it makes someone confused.

396
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:22,310
If you want, I can live the way you want me to.
♬ I will still be waiting here for you... ♬

397
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:28,380
For a long time, staying carefully...
right next to you
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

398
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:35,220
♬ As you look at me ♬

399
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:42,700
- Are you confessing right now?
- Yeah.
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

400
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,000
- Sincerely?
- Yeah.
♬ when there are so many words I want to say. ♬

401
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:57,190
Ah, think about it for a little bit. Don't answer yet.
♬ The moment you turn around, x  ♬

402
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,940
♬ Why are you so distant toward me?
Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

403
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,720
I don't have to think about it.

404
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,220
Right now, I cant.
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

405
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,080
There's no space here. It's like that right now.
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

406
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,640
- Because of that person?
- Yeah.
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

407
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,820
Because of that person.
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you. ♬

408
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,300
Sorry.
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

409
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,910
♬ I'll be looking at you always ♬

410
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,140
I see.
♬ I'll be looking at you always ♬

411
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,880
Are you done like this?
♬  It's you. ♬

412
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,620
I'm done.

413
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:43,050
I'll give up.
♬  Meeting you was fate. ♬

414
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:48,870
I was really scared.
♬ Before I knew it, the fate was mine. ♬

415
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:55,880
- But Park Bong Soo.
- Yes, Sunbae?
♬ As I can't go back to the time before loving you, ♬

416
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:59,640
You were really weird just a second ago.
♬ I am returning to you ♬

417
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,130
It seemed like you were a completely different person .
I am returning to you ♬

418
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,160
Well, maybe.
the more I long for someone--
♬ There isn't even  ♬

419
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,440
Wow. It's my first time confessing and getting dumped in about 3 seconds.
♬ anyone else but You. ♬

420
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,150
Don't be too hurt.♬
Even if I can't touch you. ♬

421
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,890
I'll try.
♬ Even if I can't hug you ♬

422
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,790
The person you're going up against is a bit strong.
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

423
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,110
Stop it.
♬ I will always be looking.  ♬

424
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:32,510
Ah, what is this? Is it fun to hit the same spot where it already is injured?
♬  It's you♬

425
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,130
Seriously.
♬ The more bruised my heart ♬

426
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,220
I'm sorry.
♬ The more bruised my heart ♬

427
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:43,000
♬  the more I long for someone. It's you. ♬

428
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,660
Hey, Park Bong Soo.

429
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,600
What?

430
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,400
When did you start liking me?
♬ I love you. Come back to me. ♬

431
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,120
Was it the first time you saw me?

432
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,380
Is it that "LAFS"?
(love at first sight)
♬ There isn't anyone else ♬

433
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,240
You're too noisy.
♬ but you. ♬

434
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,840
♬ Even if I can't have you,
Even if I can't say anything ♬

435
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,440
♬ I love you like this. ♬

436
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:21,400
♬ I will watch you always ♬

437
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:26,480
♬ It's you ♬

438
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,950
Resident registration number
Park Bong Soo

439
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,420
Did you find it?

440
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,710
- Ah, I got the pictures.
- Let me see them.

441
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,690
Wait .

442
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,340
Aiyoo.

443
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,480
Yes, this is Yoon Dong Won.

444
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,640
Hwang Jae Gook?

445
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,360
Yes, I just went to his house today.

446
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,420
Dead?

447
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,060
Suicide?

448
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:29,230
So, after Detective Yoon Dong Won came, no one came in?

449
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,410
He's been by himself here with the door locked.

450
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:38,130
He didn't come out for dinner or get any phone calls,
so we got worried and unlocked the door to come in but...

451
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,600
-Aren't you going to look at this?
-Send it to my mail. I'll look at it later.

452
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,560
Oh, Detective Choi. This is Yoon Dong Won.

453
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,080
Yes.

454
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,670
Hello.

455
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,580
I kept insisting it couldn't be suicide,
so I could start to investigate the scene first...

456
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,840
Did anything come out?

457
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,860
Too many things came out.

458
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,480
It's not like it's some treasury.

459
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,800
First, the suicide note.

460
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,220
He confessed to all his wrongdoings
and said he was sorry to leave first.

461
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,700
Also, generously, he wrote down all his wrong doings.

462
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,440
He was sorry to the pitiful ladies,

463
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,000
and he even killed someone.

464
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,400
Then you're saying that's Go Seong Cheol?

465
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:07,210
One day he was on a train to Busan,

466
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,200
but the guy next to him kept making a ruckus.

467
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,270
So, he gave him some drug and he died.

468
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,790
Also, he kept thinking of that every night, so he couldn't live anymore.

469
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,130
This is probably that same drug...
that he took himself.

470
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,410
Also, even more generously,

471
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,230
he even left the train ticket from that day.

472
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,050
Oh, while living I have never met anyone who was this generous.

473
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,980
What do you think?

474
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,210
Mi Bong High School

475
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,990
Hey, Seo Jeong Hoo.

476
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,940
I'm Gi Yeong Jae, your dad's friend.

477
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:25,040
Come with me.

478
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,350
Where are you going?

479
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,010
Hey kid, your grandmother passed away while you were in the youth detention center.

480
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:35,260
Are you going to go back to your mom who remarried?

481
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,150
That's a bit difficult. That family's living very happily right now.

482
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,930
If you go, you're going to disrupt that.

483
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,680
You have no where to go.

484
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,040
I sold your grandma's house.

485
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:55,860
With the money from selling your Grandma's house, I gave your grandma her funeral

486
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,680
- and the rest of it, I...
- Give it to me.

487
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,260
- Right now?
- My money.

488
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,320
I said to give it to me.

489
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,140
I don't want to.

490
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,310
Give it!

491
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,430
I said, give it!

492
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:19,780
Hey, you thief. Give me my money!

493
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,330
Oh, gosh.

494
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,060
It's in here, so try and take it.

495
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,050
Try to take it anytime.

496
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,610
I don't have any intention of giving it easily.

497
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,080
Try to take it with your strength

498
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,150
or steal it.

499
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,400
But, if you want to take this from me,

500
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,430
you're going to need to learn a lot.

501
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,760
Hey!
Stop!

502
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,430
Come on.

503
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:17,380
Come on. Come.

504
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:23,500
Come on.

505
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,470
You punk.

506
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,340
Hey!

507
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:47,020
Hey!

508
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:19,670
Hey!

509
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,300
- Which side is better?
- Old fogey.

510
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,520
Just take out the kimchi. The ramen is done.

511
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,540
- Which side?
- Ah, seriously.

512
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,330
This side.

513
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,200
Of course. Of course, it's the South Pacific beauty.

514
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,780
Ah, this looks good.

515
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,220
What's this? Are you going somewhere?

516
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,850
To the South Pacific. Going to the place where you can see bikinis for a whole year.

517
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:28,810
Paradise.

518
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,030
When will you come back?

519
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:34,520
I'm not coming back.

520
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,350
Here, take this. I'll give it to you.

521
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:41,180
There's a phone number in there.
It's your food line from now on.

522
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,920
If you call, a really foul tempered woman will get it.

523
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,210
From now on, do well.

524
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:49,310
Ay, Teacher.

525
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,690
You became an adult today.

526
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:56,150
Now you can live well by yourself.

527
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:59,180
Oh, oh, oh!

528
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:01,000
Wait, wait, wait, Teacher.

529
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,760
Even so,

530
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:05,900
I made two servings of the ramen.

531
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,610
You eat a lot.

532
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,780
But, hey... Teacher! Teacher!

533
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,840
Teacher, you're going to be right back, right?

534
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,790
You're lying to me right now, right?

535
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:20,520
Teacher, wait. Teacher.

536
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:24,940
It's my birthday today! Teacher!

537
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,000
- You said you wouldn't be back again.
- I did?

538
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,450
-Why did you come?
-Oh, there were two girls fighting over me...

539
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,030
how can girls fight that aggressively...

540
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,870
Why didn't you...

541
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:07,350
call even once?

542
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,550
Did you not want to or...

543
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:17,550
did you forget me completely?

544
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:23,600
You know, I have this big stone in my stomach.

545
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,590
But, whenever I see you, it tangles up. It hurts.

546
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,420
Why are there so many people who hurt when they see me?

547
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,000
Detective Jo keeps on calling.

548
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,570
She always calls

549
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:40,630
whenever I'm in bed with a woman.

550
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,770
Detective Jo said this.

551
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:56,360
You want to know about this picture.

552
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,140
I told you. What more do you want to know?

553
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:05,050
Ask me. I came to answer you.

554
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,850
My father...

555
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,380
why did he kill himself?

556
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,000
- You knew?
- Yes.

557
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,630
Since when?

558
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,490
Since I was very little.

559
00:49:24,490 --> 00:49:28,460
Around me there were a lot of senseless adults.

560
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,230
But why do you ask that now?

561
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:32,740
I went to my mom to ask her.

562
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:34,680
A middle schooler went around every neighborhood

563
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,930
and even missed a week of school.

564
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,600
I found her like that.

565
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:46,360
But, I couldn't ask her.

566
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,110
Right when she saw me, she

567
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:51,720
started crying,

568
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,300
so I pretended that it didn't happen.

569
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,670
Father simply...

570
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,490
was involved in a traffic accident.

571
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:06,700
Now, look.

572
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,460
He's here with friends smiling.

573
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,670
There's no way that a person living and smiling well like this would suddenly do such a thing.

574
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,160
I especially liked this photo because it let me think like this.

575
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,820
That's great. Then just continue to think like this.

576
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,300
I did until I discovered the exact same photo in that guy's house.

577
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,600
The guy who framed me into a murderer.

578
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,690
Now.

579
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:35,290
This guy, and this woman, the house where they both live together...

580
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,220
Jeong Hoo.

581
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,690
So, my father...

582
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,040
why did he commit suicide?

583
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,640
When he had me and my mother, why on earth?

584
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,090
If you know, what will change?

585
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:57,900
If I know,

586
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:00,780
I can probably find a reason.

587
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,640
- Reason?
- Teacher.

588
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,960
I...

589
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,030
don't have a reason to live.

590
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:15,520
That's why I'm afraid.

591
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,140
If one day, suddenly, just like father...

592
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:22,430
Ah, I really should stop now!

593
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,220
Ah, I can't do it anymore. I might be like this.

594
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,790
I'm afraid.

595
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:33,090
Father, was he like that?

596
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,960
Did my father also

597
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,270
not have a reason to live?

598
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,590
Your father, Joon Seok, was a reporter.

599
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:48,500
He was following a case.

600
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,890
In his pursuit, he discovered some easy money.

601
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:57,670
I heard that he killed someone because of that money.

602
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,830
My father... My father...

603
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,700
killed a person?

604
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,780
It was written like that on the document.

605
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,760
As soon I got out of prison, I turned everything inside out.

606
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:18,010
My father k-k-kill- killed someone?

607
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,800
Because of his guilty conscience,
during the investigation,

608
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,250
he did commit suicide, but that was strange...

609
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,880
Hey, Jeong Hoo.

610
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,750
Ah, so my father k-k-killed someone.

611
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,180
Ah, that's why. That's why he killed himself?

612
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,520
Come to your senses and listen.

613
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,230
That is what they said.
But I didn't believe in that.

614
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,210
So then! So then...

615
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,650
then,

616
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,320
Father is a murderer.

617
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,700
And...

618
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,760
I am... a thief.

619
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:03,220
- It's like that.
- First, listen to what I have to say.

620
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,920
It's disgusting.

621
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,590
Ah, I'm seriously going crazy.

622
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,730
Couldn't you have not answered me?

623
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,860
Why did you answer?

624
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,500
Since when do you listen to my words and answer so nicely?

625
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,210
Why would you answer me, you old fogey?! Why?!

626
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,350
You shouldn't have answered me.

627
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:48,250
Listen well, Seo Jeong Hoo.

628
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,000
Your father, Seo Joon Seok, is not someone who would kill someone.

629
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,500
I know that.
You may not know, but I do.

630
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,790
If you're going crazy like that, find out about it properly.

631
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:06,880
Who killed your father.

632
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,110
What?

633
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:11,740
I... gave up on that halfway.

634
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:15,950
What do you want to do?

635
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,910

637
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,940
Request to Healer

638
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,810
Someone is calling from the entrance of the building.

639
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:13,090
Request from the entrance of the building for a visitor.
Will you connect the line?

640
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,500
There are five people in the photo, but there's a sixth person.

641
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:58,840
The person who took this photo.

642
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:04,250
When I was going around investigating what happened to your father, I couldn't meet him.

643
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:08,020
Because that child was still very young then.

644
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,530
Was it because I wanted to protect him?

645
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:15,260
He was a younger brother to all of us.

646
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,570
If I have a request to Healer,

647
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:34,540
I don't know what process I have to go through,

648
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:38,640
or how much money is needed.

649
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,520
If this mail is really...

650
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,940
reaching you, Healer,

651
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:53,630
I have no way of knowing. But I'm still writing it.

652
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,820
Jeez.

653
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:49,540
I'm Chae Yeong Sin.

654
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,060
I have to meet you, Healer.

655
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:58,920
Will you meet me?

656
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:03,050
This is my request.

657
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:28,900
Healer

658
