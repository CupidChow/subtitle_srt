1
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,380
Joon Seok.

2
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,790
You're Joon Seok, right?

3
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,780
Right?

4
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,510
Myeong Hee.

5
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,760
- Myeong Hee!
- Let me go.

6
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,540
That person...

7
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,880
What did you just say?

8
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,270
You saw it, right? It's Joon Seok.

9
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,620
What are you saying?

10
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,700
That person, right now...

11
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,760
By Joon Seok, do you mean Seo Joon Seok?

12
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,920
It can't be him, right?

13
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,960
Myeong Hee.

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,130
That's right.

15
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,600
It can't be.

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,190
Joon Seok, who died 20 years ago, having the same face as back then...

17
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,810
He can't be here.

18
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,100
Why am I like this?

19
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,660
Did they look that much alike?

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Joon Seok and that person just now?

21
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,580
Is that so?

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,420
Episode 8
You'll catch a cold.

23
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,880
- The man yesterday was a thief?
- Yes.

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,690
Because I appeared right on time, he couldn't steal anything and was running away.

25
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,080
Do you know how surprised I was when you suddenly appeared in front of that thief?

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,240
I'm sorry for saying such silly things.

27
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,300
Did they really look that much alike? That thief and Joon Seok?

28
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,120
Actually, I wasn't able to take a good look at his face, because of his dark glasses and hat.

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,790
You know I sometimes have dreams with my eyes open because of the medicine.

30
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,290
Is that why you daydreamed with that normal face?

31
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,230
Stop it.

32
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,060
I ask you for a favor.

33
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,220
Talk.

34
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,660
It suddenly came to mind, now that I've dreamt of him.

35
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,630
I want to know Joon Seok's wife's contact number.

36
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,280
After Joon Seok died, I heard she remarried.

37
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,180
Wouldn't it be uncomfortable for her if you contact her?

38
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,120
I still want to know.
Please look into it.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,750
Alright.

40
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,180
I'll come back.

41
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,260
I'll wait for your return.

42
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,940
Joon Seok had a son, right?

43
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,390
Yeah.

44
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,190
- Name?
- Jeong Hoo. Seo Jeong Hoo.

45
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:05,440
- How old is he?
- He was born exactly one month before Ji An.

46
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,270
Ji An was born in January,
and Jeong Hoo was born in December.

47
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,840
I remember he's considered a year older Oppa because of the one month difference.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,850
So, right now, he's 28?

49
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,290
Okay.

50
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,090
Ahjumma. Call.

51
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,070
Honey, I'm not in right now.

52
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,700
If you have something to say, please leave a message.

53
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,870
Pretending you're not there to avoid answering me...

54
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,410
I know that.

55
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,480
Ahjumma,

56
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,820
is this why you and that old fogey wanted me to board the plane?

57
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,180
The wife of this household knows my father.

58
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,130
She also has the picture with my father in it.

59
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,840
What is this?

60
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,370
You don't want to respond?

61
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,980
Then I'll just go and ask her directly.

62
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,220
'I am Seo Joon Seok's son who works as Healer,

63
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,810
but who are you, Ma'am?'

64
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,790
I understand. I'll hang up.

65
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,880
Kid, have you been well?

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Ah, this perverted old man, really.

67
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:05,080
Her name is Choi Myeong Hee.

68
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,400
There's one woman on that picture of your father with four others, right? It's her.

69
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,480
Would that be enough for you?

70
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,290
That's still not enough for you, right?

71
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,970
Ah right, I'll go to you.

72
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,560
Are you crying? You're crying, right?

73
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,630
Did you miss me that much?

74
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,740
Seriously, just wait. Don't cry.

75
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,610
Ever since my mother left home
when I was eight years old,

76
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,250
I haven't cried because of any people.

77
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,930
I've also never had anything to expect from them.

78
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,800
What I hated the most in this world

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,300
is a human's understanding and interest.

80
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,110
Aigoo, these brats.

81
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,840
How could you not come to school for one week without notice?

82
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
Raise your hands properly, punk!

83
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,190
Seo Jeong Hoo, this kid,
will give you quite a bit of headache.

84
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,330
So please understand him.

85
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,760
Both of his parents are gone.

86
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,470
He lives with his grandmother.

87
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,230
Why?

88
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,280
I heard his father died when he was young, and his mother got remarried.

89
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,390
So this guy has a lot of temper inside.

90
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,070
How did your father pass away so early?
Was it because of an illness?

91
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,430
It's not because of an illness.

92
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,890
- He did it to himself (suicide).
- Pardon me?

93
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,840
You know, by himself.

94
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,850
It was such a tragedy.

95
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,200
There's no way Jeong Hoo, this kid, could be normal inside.

96
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:06,470
So I hope you please just understand him and give him your attention.

97
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,760
What!

98
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,070
What do you want?!

99
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,330
Don't mess with him. Leave him alone.

100
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,500
Let's just give him a break.

101
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,270
What break, huh?

102
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,920
- Let go! LET GO!
- Stop it!

103
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,700
LET GO OF ME!

104
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,250
Chae Yeong Sin

105
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,030
Yes.

106
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,160
Hey, Bong Sook...

107
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,380
Where are you? You did not go around searching for bars the whole night, did you?

108
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,890
Did you get some sleep?

109
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,470
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

110
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,130
Bong Sook? Park Bong Soo?

111
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,560
Yes.

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
Are you okay?

113
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm alright.
(in honorifics)

114
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,100
What's wrong with your voice? Bong Sook-ah.

115
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,900
Yes.

116
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,310
Why are you suddenly talking formally?
You're making me worry.

117
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,900
Then, should I not?
Talk formally, I mean.

118
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,990
Shut up.
Alright, pick one.

119
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,820
East or west?
Which side for you?

120
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,880
For what? (in informal speech)

121
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,160
I received something from someone last night.

122
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,400
When Kim Moon Ho comes to work,
I have to report it to him anyway, but

123
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,840
I am deciding now how much I should show him.

124
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,200
So, is it east or west?

125
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,910
Look here. Sunbae, the thing is...

126
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,030
East or west.

127
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,810
East.

128
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,300
I have to go that way, right?

129
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,560
- I've got it. I'm hanging up.
- Wait a minute.

130
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,340
Sunbae, about you reporting it to him...

131
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,690
Did you eat this morning? If not, go ahead. It's okay if you're late.

132
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,480
What I hate the most in this world
was a human's understanding

133
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,030
and interest.
It "was".

134
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,370
I WAS like that.

135
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,260
My father, who specialized in defending criminals of theft and assault, said,

136
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,420
"A person still has to trust people. "

137
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,600
One in fifty would betray you after trusting them.

138
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,350
Don't live doubting the other 49 because of that one person.

139
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,450
Even so, that person said this.

140
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:19,000
I told you not to follow just anyone fearlessly.

141
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,860
If someone friendly approaches you to become closer to you...

142
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,690
be more careful.

143
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,310
Excuse me. Are you still there?

144
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,240
Excuse me.

145
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,290
Ah, what are you doing?

146
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,200
Aigoo, I just wanted to ask you something.

147
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,840
What is it?

148
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
This is Someday, right?

149
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,470
Someday is on the third floor.
What are you here for?

150
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,240
Are you a Someday employee?

151
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,090
What about it?

152
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,950
Has Sunbae Kim Moon Ho come to work yet?

153
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:06,180
Not yet. But...do you know him?

154
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,430
If I say in the terminology of martial art novels,
to the "human" Kim Moon Ho,

155
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,630
among all his pupils, I'm considered
"Big Brother", which means his best pupil.

156
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,260
It's nice to meet you; I'm Lee Jong Soo.

157
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,210
Then you should know Kim Moon Ho as a person well.

158
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,110
Well, I know a lot about him, uselessly, yes.

159
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,480
How is he?

160
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,150
Huh? You want to dig into him?

161
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,630
Then let's exchange.

162
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,790
I'll tell you about Kim Moon Ho and in return,
you'll tell me what you know about Chae Yeong Sin.

163
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,480
Do you know Chae Yeong Sin?

164
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,630
I don't know her, so I'm gathering info about her in advance.

165
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,370
So, what kind of woman is she?

166
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:50,450
I heard some rumors that Sunbae came to this newspaper because of her.

167
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,510
Does she have a seductive glamorous body,

168
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,650
or is she the pure and innocent type who stirs up men's protective instincts 100%?

169
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,360
It's probably neither of them.

170
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,160
Ah, she must come from a wealthy family.

171
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,490
Ah, he must like a woman with a wealthy family.

172
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,710
Oh!

173
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,190
Sunbae!

174
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,280
Why are you here?

175
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,480
Hello.

176
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,770
I missed you.

177
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,480
Chae Yeong Sin.

178
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,350
Did you finish your homework?

179
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,430
Anyway, I was waiting to tell you because I have something to tell you.

180
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:30,560
It's a bit awkward to tell it to you if there are people around, so if we could go somewhere quiet...

181
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,070
You're going out looking like that?

182
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,380
The renovation of my office is finished.
It's quiet when you close the door.

183
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,060
Are you by chance embarrassed about me?

184
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,540
Why? Why?

185
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,840
Wow, that was Chae Yeong Sin. Wow.

186
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,280
There's about 220 hours of footage in this hard drive.

187
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,090
As you can see, it's a secretly filmed video of influential men from all sorts of backgrounds sexually harassing

188
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,270
actresses from Empire Entertainment.

189
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,080
- Did you watch all of this?
- Yes, I did.

190
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,230
- All night?
- All night.

191
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,450
Well, I did some fast forwarding and also stopped while I took some notes,

192
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,610
and I almost threw up and swallowed it back. But yes, I watched all of it.

193
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,890
Where did you get this?

194
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,810
What?

195
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,980
This hard drive.

196
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,640
Uh, the thing is...

197
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,430
That's right. Who gave it to you?

198
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:43,930
Is there an inside informant?
Who is it?

199
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,020
Honestly, I was reluctant.

200
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,650
- What?
- About whether I can trust you or not.

201
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,270
Hey Yeong Sin, what are you saying right now--

202
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:59,950
I've been gathering data about this informant since a long time ago.

203
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,850
Also, it was hard for me to meet him.

204
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,980
And, although I don't know why yet,
he's favoring me for now.

205
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,740
But you might try to intercept all I've gathered

206
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,690
by saying that you're my sunbae.

207
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,170
Actually, I'm scared.

208
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,980
When she's lacking sleep, she loses it sometimes, like now.

209
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,550
- But this kid...
- So,

210
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,140
if you promise to let me handle contacting this informant, no matter what--

211
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,050
-I promise...
-Who is it?

212
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,330
Do you perhaps know what a night errand boy is?

213
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,170
You start it again--

214
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,630
There is one that goes by the codename, Healer.

215
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,980
No, why would you really ...

216
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,020
Did you perhaps...?

217
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,790
Do you perhaps know of him?

218
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,360
I do.

219
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, wait! Right now, there is a confidential meeting inside, so only staff can enter that room.

220
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,670
Okay.

221
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,030
- Hello, I found that out.
- Hey, a bit...

222
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,480
Come back in a bit later.

223
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,890
I'll go out in a minute.

224
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,670
So, you know you told me to find out about
President Hwang Jae Gook's favorite bar?

225
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,840
So... I... myself found it.

226
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,110
The name is... the name is...

227
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,200
Ah, Luna. It's called Luna Moon. Luna Moon.

228
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,950
Sunbae, were you up all night?

229
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,750
But you should still wash your face.

230
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,350
Hey, I washed...

231
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,080
- Luna...?
- Yes!

232
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,450
You have one e-mail from Healer@moebius.com

233
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,000
This thing I just watched.
"An e-mail from Healer has just arrived."

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,760
This Healer...

235
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,400
Is it really that Healer?

236
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,410
Is it?

237
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,370
Ah, then where should I write down this bar name?

238
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,080
This...

239
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,360
Ah, seriously.

240
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,130
Could you... leave us for a bit?

241
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,620
What?

242
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,110
Ah, yes.

243
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,350
- Hey, Park Bong Soo.
- W-wait a minute. Wait a minute.

244
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,200
- What should I do about Luna Moon?
- Later, later.

245
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,430
healer@mobius.com

246
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,160
This is the email of the Healer that I know.

247
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,610
Most famous hackers and police hackers

248
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,960
attempted to find the owner of the email, but failed.

249
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,150
Some hacker tracked it for 3 nights and 4 days,

250
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,850
and the final destination was tracked back to his own house.

251
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,070
The e-mail address of such legends...

252
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,540
But why would that Healer send an email

253
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,740
to you?

254
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,650
It's interesting.

255
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,770
Ajumma, did you send an email to Kim Moon Ho?

256
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,560
Yes, just now.

257
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,650
You told me to send it.

258
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,960
You need to protect Chae Yeong Sin, but from who

259
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,380
and why. You wanted me to request
to get the detailed data.

260
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,110
Ajumma, why of all times now....

261
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,440
I've tuned the frequency of the bug.

262
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,800
But, who are you trying to eavesdrop on?

263
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,730
Wait, be quiet for a minute.

264
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,040
Do you know Healer personally?

265
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,770
I don't know.

266
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:10,150
Then, you asked him as a client?

267
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,890
Yes.

268
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,680
Then, the one who requested to bring this hard drive was you?

269
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,170
I didn't exactly ask for that,

270
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,070
but it seems he stretched the meaning of my instructions.

271
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:43,180
Can I ask you what exactly you asked for?

272
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,660
No.

273
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,940
Why not?

274
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,220
I've told you many times.

275
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,380
You can't get a good answer
from your interviewee in such ways.

276
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,590
Not long ago I was almost kidnapped by gangsters.

277
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,460
But that time Healer saved me.

278
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,000
Did you also ask for that?

279
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,950
You have neither a skill to soothe the opponent,

280
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,200
nor the logic to intimidate (the opponent).

281
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,890
Also, a while ago he stole my bag and took my fingernail clippings.

282
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,180
Was that also...

283
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,970
Did you order it?

284
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,130
Let's do up to here. You can leave.

285
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,830
Why would a famous reporter, Kim Moon Ho, do a background check on a B class reporter whom he never knew?

286
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,560
Why do you need to protect me,
save me, and take my DNA sample?

287
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,760
Isn't it weird? How can I not ask when it's weird? How can I just end it here and leave?

288
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:44,600
You have no ability nor a line of reasoning, but you have some guts.

289
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:53,770
After I left my TV station, I was thinking of having my own newspaper.

290
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,560
So, I was looking here and there, and Someday happened to be one of them.

291
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,780
Before I make a decision I need to do some background check.

292
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,180
All of the reporters in the company. I needed to
find out what kind of skills and backgrounds they each had.

293
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,300
Then it wasn't only me, but all ...

294
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:16,270
Yes, I did a background check for all the reporters here, not only you.

295
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,580
Then, what about my DNA?

296
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

297
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,730
What about protecting me from the gangsters?

298
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,170
I need to protect you. You need to be my bulletproof vest now.

299
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:35,310
Even a mere foot soldier is still important.

300
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,900
Is there anything else you want to ask?

301
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,100
Since I, your interviewee, started to open my mouth,
you need to sink your teeth into me.

302
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,330
It's fine.

303
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,330
What's fine?

304
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:53,730
Just... this feeling is dirty.

305
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,760
Why?

306
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,550
It's because it's humiliating.

307
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:03,200
Remembering the things I said to Healer yesterday,

308
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,060
just makes me want to die.

309
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,100
I thought that person...
To me...

310
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,070
Never mind.

311
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,990
You met him? Did you see his face?

312
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,560
If I saw it I would've recognized it. How much that person

313
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,210
looked at me as a pathetic and absurd girl.

314
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:37,030
Thank you for answering my questions. I'll be leaving now.

315
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:54,760
Wow. Writers are quite scary.

316
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,660
How can he lie so smoothly like that?

317
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,090
Those guys are even doing bullsh*ts creatively, are they?

318
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,020
That's everything about Chae Yeong Sin.

319
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,880
Just as you asked, Chae Yeong Sin was adopted when she was 8 years old.

320
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,440
Did you say 8?

321
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,830
It seems she was found as a lost child
when she was 5.

322
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,550
After that, several times she was adopted
and then sent back.

323
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,320
When she was 8 years old she was adopted by Chae Chi Soo.

324
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,590
Chae Chi Soo is the attorney who's currently taking on Joo Yeon Hee's case.

325
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:11,210
Where's the location where she was found alone?

326
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,810
It was in Seoul.

327
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:17,110
I heard it was around Shindangdong.

328
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:22,300
She was found behind a trash bin
at some alley around Shindangdong.

329
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,200
When they first found her, she couldn't talk, so they diagnosed her as mute.

330
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,440
Even on the adoption document when she was adopted
by Chae Chi Soo, it's marked as speech disorder.

331
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:04,710
Is there something you need for me to do?

332
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,630
Something to do?

333
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,180
No, there's none. You may leave.

334
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,000
Find Ji An. If I can't find Ji An, I...

335
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,710
I won't be able to meet that person
even after I die. How will I meet him?

336
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,450
Moon Sik, please.

337
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:44,030
Please, find my Ji An. Please.

338
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,870
Please.

339
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,730
Oh, it's here. On the 27th of the last month,
around at 6:30 am,

340
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,380
a trash truck driver found her.

341
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,240
She was hiding behind the trash can, so he couldn't see her at first,

342
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,950
but he was surprised when he found her while cleaning the trash.

343
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,200
Mommy...

344
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,370
Why did you do it?

345
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:05,810
Hey, you should have just brought her. If you were going to live scared like this, why didn't you just bring her?

346
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,060
Why? Did you think that if Ji An were here, Myeong Hee wouldn't be able to leave Gil Han?

347
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,860
Then she wouldn't come to you, right?

348
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,510
Right?

349
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,030
Wow. How am I always correct like this?

350
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,770
Why did you do it?

351
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,960
We were friends.

352
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,330
Moon Sik, you were our friend.

353
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,400
A friend...

354
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,110
shouldn't do that.

355
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:19,240
Seeing CEO that shaken is the first since 10 years ago.

356
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,470
It seems the child who was lost in 1992
is purposely approaching the CEO.

357
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,740
It seems she approached Kim Moon Ho first,
and he's already on her side.

358
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,600
I don't know the exact motive.

359
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,250
Should I find out the motive first?

360
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,460
You know, Kim Moon Sik is the top class.

361
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,680
Out of all the students I've raised,

362
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,100
he's bright and smart, yet knows his place.

363
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,800
While he knows his place,
he's not servile either.

364
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,900
He's a great commander who knows when and
how to move, hide, charge, and retreat.

365
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,260
But,

366
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,360
Moon Sik has one and only weakness.

367
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,560
That person's daughter. That person's daughter can

368
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:13,000
make Moon Sik into a balloon doll in a second.

369
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,730
You know there's that thing... the balloon with arms and legs that dances in front of stores.

370
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:22,320
The one that pops with one touch from a needle.

371
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,380
We shouldn't let that happen to Moon Sik.

372
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,350
Yes, Elder. Then, I will cut off the bud
before it sprouts.

373
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,750
Warning Kim Moon Ho clearly,

374
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,840
and making sure Kim Moon Sik won't need
to know about it... I will take care of them.

375
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,650
Yes, Elder.

376
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,710
Be especially mindful of Secretary Oh Tae Won, who is beside Kim Moon Sik. And,

377
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:11,570
do not make personal contact with Chae Yeong Sin again.

378
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,780
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yes?

379
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,200
Would you be able to interview Joo Yeon Hee?
We'll mosaic her face and her voice.

380
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,340
Get into details, focusing on Kim Ui Chan's involvement.

381
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,790
- I got it.
- Hey, Rookie.

382
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,700
Yes.

383
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,930
Do you know how to work a camera?

384
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,160
Yes, I've used a cellphone camera a lot of times--

385
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,150
Take these and film Chae Yeong Sin's interview.

386
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,830
Ah, no, no, but this camera is too--

387
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,510
Do you perhaps know any detective?

388
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,230
All the detectives I know are higher-ups
who are close to politicians.

389
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,600
You're thinking of reporting Hwang Jae Gook and the video, right?

390
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,150
If we bring out the news report first, they can conceal the evidence.

391
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,540
It's right to work in step with
a police investigation for this kind of case.

392
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,640
And also it's for us to avoid
becoming an isolated island (outcast) later.

393
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,460
For that, we need a detective
who will work in step with us.

394
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,030
There's one.

395
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:02,160
I know a detective who was
keeping an eye on Hwang Jae Gook.

396
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,760
I think he'll probably like it... that video.

397
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,980
Good.

398
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,540
And, you!

399
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,160
Yes.

400
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,830
This is Lee Jong Soo, a rookie
of mine from the TV station.

401
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,360
Although he may look like he's slacking off, he's quite competent.

402
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,420
Hello. I'm Lee Jong Soo.

403
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,790
Can I keep him here?

404
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,340
No... well... do we really need him?

405
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,620
Why would you leave that nice place and come here? I really don't understand you people.

406
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,170
Tell him what you told me before.

407
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,040
- I came as a spy.
- What?

408
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,970
CEO Kim Moon Sik...

409
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,600
So, this person's biological brother, asked me to go next to him and be a spy.

410
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,210
But, you want me now to tell him to do it ...?

411
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,710
As I told you, his skills are good.

412
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:50,970
We need a person.

413
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,040
- Didn't you hear me?
- We're going.

414
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,560
What did I say to focus on during the interview?

415
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,420
Focus on Kim Ui Chan's part.

416
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,820
- Why?
- Eh?

417
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,840
Why do you have to focus on Kim Ui Chan's part?

418
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,870
He told me to do it... seriously...

419
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,590
The thing I did all night...

420
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:16,810
"You worked hard," those three words...

421
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:21,700
Will the linch pin of his life all crumble down
to pieces if he says them? Aigoo, come on.

422
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,950
But, this car. Is this yours?

423
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,410
Huh?

424
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,630
Ah, your family must be well-off.

425
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:38,390
Of course, you're someone who got this job through money.

426
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,400
♬ Love, it isn't just a dream ♬

427
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,500
♬ Now that you are everything to me ♬

428
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,890
♬ Oh, love is the sweetest thing ♬

429
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,330
No. Oh, hey, hey!

430
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,000
♬ With a skip in my heart ♬

431
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,330
Oh, Yeong Sin! Yeong Sin!

432
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,930
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

433
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,690
So pretty! How long has it been?!
♬ But I only have eyes for you and I'm home ♬

434
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,040
Yeong Sin!
♬ When you hold me tight ♬

435
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,730
Yeong Sin, you can't become prettier like that!
Someone will snatch you away!

436
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,780
Yeong Sin, you still are not married?

437
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,420
Shall I find some guy for you?

438
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:49,320
Hey, hey, shut up! Yeong Sin can't get married?
Why would she?

439
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,800
She's too good. I can't let her go!

440
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,090
Yeong Sin! Do you still know how to do that?

441
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:59,400
You know, that!
Like this, like this.

442
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,350
♬ Love, dazzling at first sight ♬

443
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,760
♬ Challenging now everything
we thought we knew was right ♬

444
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,470
Hey! You're not leaving? You guys aren't leaving?

445
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:16,880
Aigoo, what's wrong?

446
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,650
You guys, seriously. You're not leaving? You're not leaving?!

447
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,390
Hey, hey! Because of you, we haven't had any customers today!

448
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:28,010
I couldn't even sell a single cup of coffee! You said you would leave when Yeong Sin got here.

449
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,580
- Alright, alright!
- See you again, Yeong Sin!

450
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,500
♬ When you hold me tight,  ♬

451
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,930
We're almost finished getting ready.

452
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:42,680
Eh hey, Secretary Oh. You are really...don't worry.

453
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,860
We, Double S Guard, rather than using our bodies

454
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,690
are better at using our brains.

455
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:54,190
Also, one of the kids I have is from China who was hard to bring.

456
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,890
It's one hour?

457
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,570
I understand. We'll be ready.

458
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,730
Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry.

459
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,350
Ah, this old man. So much nagging.

460
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:10,540
Alright, alright! I'll give you guys one hour.

461
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,630
You must absolutley finish it in one hour.

462
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,150
In any newspaper they...

463
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,800
won't listen to their story.

464
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,150
They won't listen to them.

465
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,790
They won't listen to them.

466
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,740
So, you're going to do the interview?

467
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,530
We're going to mosaic your face
or just shoot your back.

468
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,850
We're going to change your voice completely.

469
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,840
What do you think?

470
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,930
I want to do it. I've said since the beginning that

471
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,540
I'll do everything that I can do.

472
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,140
No, wait a minute.

473
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,150
After seeing some of their lawyers

474
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,880
if we say, "Uh", they will say it was ah,
and if we say, "Ah", they will say, "See, it was ah!"

475
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:05,110
Those guys are going to nitpick at every little detail,

476
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:10,320
so if we have an interview with the media, it can be used unfavorably to us during the trial.

477
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,400
- Attorney.
- Yes?

478
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,460
I've never asked to be looked favorably upon from the start.

479
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,970
I just asked (your help) not to let
those people live well on their own,

480
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,810
and not to let me die alone.

481
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,590
I will discuss further with my client,

482
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,600
and review what to say and not to say if we have an interview, then I will let you know.

483
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,860
Yes.

484
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,780
- Do you know how to assemble that?
- Huh?

485
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,640
Well, usually this kind of thing is
supposed to be assembled, so...

486
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,110
It will work out one way or the other, right?

487
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,860
I'll get on it myself.

488
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,600
Ajusshi, I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

489
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,420
Shall I make you some toast?
With jam, or ham and cheese...

490
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,140
Do you really know how to assemble that?
Should I look for the manual and read it out to you?

491
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,530
Forget it.

492
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,530
Well, I heard from your teacher that your father was really bright with mechanical things.

493
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,300
Whichever machine it was, if he just saw it once,
he made it work or fixed it.

494
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,960
Kim Moon Ho sent an email.

495
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,520
But, it's a warning.

496
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,270
What warning?

497
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:41,500
Warning: Don't ever make any personal contact
with Chae Yeong Sin again.

498
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,510
Seriously.

499
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:49,330
Why don't you just follow him?
If you don't, he might not pay us.

500
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,490
Then, everything will end pointlessly.

501
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,470
Wow, a new one is nice.

502
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:59,750
- How expensive is this?
- I'm not sure.

503
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:03,620
Let me see... Good, not bad.

504
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,670
Wow, this is good. The image is coming out.

505
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,200
Good, when we have Yeon Hee sit there...

506
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,520
Should I do it a bit from the side?

507
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,350
What are you doing?

508
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:24,140
- Making contact.
- What?

509
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,630
A personal contact.

510
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,180
Like this.

511
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,360
This guy is not quite all there, either...

512
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,420
This loon! Why don't you just poop instead?

513
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,700
Did your teacher call you?
I thought you were meeting him today.

514
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,270
Ah, I was talking to your teacher a while ago.
He said something strange.

515
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:51,330
He wanted to know if you like fruits or chocolate?

516
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,720
He's asking out of the blue.

517
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,880
Is that some kind of secret code
between the two of you?

524

W-what are you doing?

525
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:37,670
A camera test.

526
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:38,780
E-excuse me.

527
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,700
Leave me alone. I don't feel good today.

528
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,340
If you don't feel good, isn't it normal to drink

529
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,260
or to cry?

530
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,860
One, two, three. Mic test, one, two, three. Ah ah ah.

531
00:39:55,830 --> 00:40:01,580
Hello, everyone. You're now watching one female human,
who has been rejected by the two men she had a crush on,

532
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,390
Man #1 and Man #2, at the same time,

533
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,030
but are still appearing at the scene
with a professional reporter's mindset.

534
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,080
Man number 1 called her a human shield.

535
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,920
Number 2 thinks she is a delusional attention seeker.

536
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,560
However, gladly, gladly, let's forget that.

537
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,760
That sad dream I dreamt last night.

538
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,980
Like the morning sun makes
the darkness disappear.

539
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,980
Let's forget about it.

540
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,580
Let's say that never hap...

541
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,740
The weather is nice. They said the first snow was going to fall today.

542
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,920
First snow my butt. Those liars...

543
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,960
We're all ready. Let's start the interview.

544
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,120
Yeah. Let's go.

545
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,480
Did you know what kind of a place that was?

546
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,520
He said it was just a person who helps our company,

547
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,780
and so I should greet him.

548
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,420
-Who did?
-President Hwang Jae Gook.

549
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,400
What did he say about that Assemblyman K?

550
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,560
You mean Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan?

551
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,580
Yes.

552
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,660
He said that he is someone who will become the mayor of Seoul in the future.

553
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,220
And that the position of the mayor of Seoul is that of someone who can become President of Korea later.

554
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:57,520
So if I looked good to that man,

555
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,660
he said my life would get better later.

556
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,720
You wanted your life to get better?

557
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,920
Is that why you didn't refuse and went to that kind of place to meet high class people.

558
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,920
And you met Kim Ui Chan too?

559
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,820
I went too far. Then let's go to the next ques...

560
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,440
Because you don't know.

561
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,280
Since you don't know, you might ask it like that.

562
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,420
You don't know how scary those people are.

563
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,200
Those people, for their money and their positions,

564
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,720
in order to protect their own,
they will be willing to do anything.

565
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,520
Doing that is "common sense" to them.

566
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,340
- Are you ready?
- You're ready, right?

567
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,740
Yes.

568
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,720
Yes, this is Park Bong Soo.

569
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,300
-Hello?
-Hey.

570
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,240
Kiddo.

571
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,520
Ah, this old fogey. Do you know what time it is...

572
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,980
Where are you right now?

573
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:23,860
Do you like chocolate or sweet potatoes?

574
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,400
Seeing that you're blabbing random words,

575
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,060
you had no intention of meeting me, right?

576
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,260
Run quickly, let's meet at your house.

577
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,900
Run quickly. Then do I have to run right away?

578
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,700
- Look here, you old fogey--
- Don't be late.

579
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,660
You know I don't wait more than 5 minutes
for a man, right?

580
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,800
Wait, wait.

581
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,780
Since when was it 5 minutes? Hel--

582
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,260
Teacher, hello?

583
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,960
- Please tell them I left first.
- Wait, wait.

584
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,280
Take this with you.

585
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,180
Yeong Sin told me to pack you some things to eat, so I packed some delicious...

586
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,380
What day

587
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,540
i-is it today?

588
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,780
Today is the 22nd.

589
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,800
- Ah, is that what it was?
- Why?

590
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,660
It's my birthday.

591
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,380
Ah, this old fogey.

592
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,380
Hey, take this.

593
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,100
Hey!

594
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,780
Hello?

595
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,860
Chae Yeong Sin.

596
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,480
- Sunbae?
- It seems you'll have to come over right now.

597
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,800
Take a taxi and come right over.

598
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,760
What is it?

599
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,440
Ah, yes, yes.

600
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,580
Dad, I'll be out for a while.
See you later, Yeon Hee.

601
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,260
- Hey, where are you going? You spent the night out yesterday too.
- It's for work.

602
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,800
- Who? Chief Jang?
- No, Sunbae Kim Moon Ho.

603
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,520
An informant has come forward. Awesome.
I'm going.

604
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,540
- Hey, hey, Yeong Sin. Yeong Sin!
- Don't I need to bring a camera or recorder?

605
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,760
Hey, Yeong Sin. Did you take your hat?

606
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,260
Wrap your scarf well.

607
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,180
Kyungminnam intersection?

608
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:29,220
Ah, yes, I know where that is.

609
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,520
That building is empty right now,

610
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,960
I'll leave the back door open, so come up to the roof.
(same line from the text message)

611
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,100
Also, as soon as this call ends,
turn off your phone since someone can track you.

612
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:42,900
- Can you please go to Kyungminnam intersection?
- Yes.

613
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,670
Turn it off right now. Then see you there.

614
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,180
Yes.

615
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,220
What grade are you in?

616
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,680
Yes, it's Kim Moon Ho.

617
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,360
You shouldn't forget the kindness of your family,
who cared for you and brought you up.

618
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,320
Hello?

619
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,580
You shouldn't turn against your family for one girl.

620
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:40,520
She's a bad woman.

621
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,160
Please get back to your senses and come back.

622
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,180
Everyone's waiting for you earnestly.

623
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,920
Chae Yeong Sin

624
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:57,060
The phone is turned off...

625
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,240
New Mail.

626
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,540
Yes, why?

627
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,680
A mail from Kim Moon Ho came saying that he can't get in contact with Chae Yeong Sin.

628
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,580
Chae Yeong Sin is at her house.

629
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,040
He called the house, but they said she took a call and ran out in a hurry.

630
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,980
But, they said she went out taking Kim Moon Ho's call.

631
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,160
What does that mean?

632
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,620
I'm thinking if she got caught
in a trap of voice falsification.

633
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,920
Who? Why?

634
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,620
Kim Moon Ho said a warning from the Elder came.

635
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,040
Elder?

636
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,160
- Who's Elder?
- I don't know.

637
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,580
- Kim Moon Ho said he's going to go to his brother first.
- The tracker is still on Chae Yeong Sin's bag.

638
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,100
She only has that one bag. She always takes it with her,

639
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,840
- so...
- I know. I'm in the middle of tracking it.

640
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,980
I'll also send this to Kim Moon Ho. The side who gets there faster...

641
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,880
Where is it?

642
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,340
It's around Paju.

643
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,100
Oh, can I get a receipt?
I need to get the expense reimbursed.

644
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,640
- Thank you. Work hard.
- Bye.

645
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,600
Is this door not the right one...?

646
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,660
Sunbae.

647
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,780
Kim Moon Ho Sunbae?

648
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,800
Hello?

649
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,000
Is anyone here? Hello?

650
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,830
Going up.

651
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,130
Tenth floor.

652
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:07,810
Hello, this elevator is broken.

653
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:12,020
Hello? Is anyone there?

654
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:14,210
Hello?! Can't you hear me?

655
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:50,900
Save me. There's someone in here.

656
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:54,030
Save me. There's someone in here.

657
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,970
Save me.

658
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,840
Save me!

659
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,040
Save me!

660
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,820
There's someone in here.

661
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:20,850
You almost died. Are you crazy?

662
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,810
Even if you do it for money.

663
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:38,240
Thank you for saving me.
I survived, thanks to you,

664
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,810
but if we both fell from there, we both would've died.

665
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:44,580
What is that?

666
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:52,100
Are you still here?

667
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,650
You're still here, right?

668
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:06,260
You're Healer, right?

669
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:10,500
I don't know how much Sunbae gave you,

670
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:14,950
but I owe you my life now.

671
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,820
But, I don't have any money, so I can't pay you with money.

672
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:24,290
I'm sorry.

673
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,900
Thank you.

674
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:59,780
Ever since I was alone and up to now,
I've never expected anything from a human.

675
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,860
So, I was okay.

676
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:17,380
Whether someone understood or misunderstood me, it didn't matter.

677
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,710
I was like that.

678
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,710
♬ It's a dream that is like a lie,
the memories of meeting you ♬

679
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:13,620
♬I'll still wait for you here♬

680
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,590
♬I feel nervous that I cannot move ♬

681
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:25,780
♬ As you look at me ♬

682
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:34,120
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

683
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:40,100
♬ when I have so much to say to you ♬

684
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:48,750
♬ The moment you came back... ♬
Healer - Preview

685
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:52,070
Someone definitely tampered with the elevator.

686
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:56,620
You called me by another name, didn't you?
Was it Ji Eun or...?

687
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,710
Did you decide to not be human anymore?

688
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:01,580
You shouldn't have messed with Ji An.

689
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:07,390
I thought he'd suddenly pop out from behind me if I waited for him.

690
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:08,440
But he's not coming.

691
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,760
Are you saying Ji An is alive?
Did you find her?

692
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,090
You said a famous reporter, right? I'll do it.

693
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,200
Let's go.
To become famous.
