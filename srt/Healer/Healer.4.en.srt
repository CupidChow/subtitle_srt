00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,870
Episode 4

2
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,510
You're awake now, huh? Seeing how your heart is racing, you're awake.

3
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,980
Why is a guy who stays up all night waking up at a time when normal people wake up?

4
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,590
Are you really going to work at that newspaper office?

5
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,380
You idiot who will die in a sh*tty situation
while being stubborn..

6
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,490
I told you not to do it.

7
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,410
You're going to be working with civilian people
with your bare face.

8
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,230
Don't you know that as one more person remembers your face, it endangers you 12 times even more?

9
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,830
Let's just lie low for 3 months.

10
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,610
After 3 months, the detectives will drop the case.

11
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,860
I'm telling you it will become an unsolved case in an instant!

12
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,640
You thick head...

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,950
Ahjumma.

14
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,820
Detectives are also busy. There are a lot of other cases.

15
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,760
That woman, Chae Yeong Sin, has become a proper bait.

16
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,180
One fish has already taken that bait.

17
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,760
Whether he's the fish who killed Go Seong Cheol and framed me as the murderer,

18
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,490
or if there is a bigger fish behind that fish...

19
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,080
I have to find that out.

20
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,170
If after 3 days and there's still nothing,
I'll wrap it up cleanly.

21
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,070
How is it? Do I look like Park Bong Soo the reporter now?

22
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,970
Take off the glasses. In your case,
a bare face is the disguised one.

23
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,420
Yes.

24
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,170
You must never show your true colors.

25
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,980
You also must not do anything that would make you stand out.

26
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,710
If someone curses you, just listen to it.
If someone hits you, then just take the hit!

27
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:49,750
If your senior says anything, it's always a straight "yes".

28
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,730
What?

29
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,570
Park Bong Soo has to write 60 news articles a day.

30
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,930
You write them fast.

31
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:03,210
Articles... I mean news articles...
You want me to write 60 news articles a day?

32
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,970
Ah, me?

33
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,060
This.

34
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,900
- Do you see the "Real-time issue"?
- Yes.

35
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,120
You must write articles on these searches.

36
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,700
Each search would have 6 articles, for a total of 60 articles.

37
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,880
For the contents... you can just reuse what other articles have reported.

38
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,230
For the title, it must be very provocative.
End of explanation.

39
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,290
I wrote 2 versions of the article.
One is a strong one.

40
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,140
The 2nd one has a sexy appeal.
Please choose according to your liking.

41
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,540
Really really amazing.

42
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,460
Just put it out once. Just once, really.

43
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,220
If you really want to put it out that much, then put it up on your own blog.

44
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,830
You know I don't do those things.

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,390
Really? Then take this time to make your own blog.

46
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,240
What could be a nice title for the blog?

47
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,980
Oh, right. "Reporter Chae Yeong Sin's vomits."
That sounds awesome.

48
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,880
Wait, are you scared, Chief?

49
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,110
Our Chief is now scared...

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,680
You told us to find the deepest secrets of celebrities.
Shake them well and suck them up dry.

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,140
Since this involves politics, you're scared.

52
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,100
Do you think this content is scary enough?

53
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,790
Look at it. Look, look.

54
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,110
She's not even a star actress, just a starlet who had her body forcefully taken away from her.

55
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,500
- Not simply taken away-
- But...

56
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,710
She did not commit suicide nor is it a murder.
How is this newsworthy?

57
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:47,530
So what? Does someone have to die first before we give our attention to them?

58
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,290
Of course.

59
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:54,140
Wow. Look at how humane you are, Chief Jang Byeong Se.

60
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,200
Aren't you even embarrassed to go home
and hear your kids call you Dad?

61
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,870
You talk very dangerously.

62
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,250
Respectable Chief, you see...

63
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,810
Please let me sleep.

64
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,430
So if you don't put this article out, you won't be able to sleep?

65
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,760
Because your sense of justice is stirring inside you?

66
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,750
No, this starlet actress attempted suicide.

67
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,850
She's in my house right now.
To be specific, she's in my room next to my bed.

68
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,230
And so what?

69
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,090
I can't sleep if I share my room with someone else.

70
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,520
It's already been a few days, and it's driving me crazy.

71
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,330
So we have to put this article out as soon as possible,
and with this article, they can go to the police

72
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,440
and threaten them or whatever just to have them start on the investigation right away.

73
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,020
And when something starts at least, this girl wouldn't
have any time to think about suicide for a while.

74
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,300
Then I can send her back to her home for the time being, and I will finally be able to sleep in peace.

75
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,900
Do you understand what I am saying?

76
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,820
- Yeong Sin.
- Yes, Chief?

77
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:02,700
Kim Ui Chan. Since he's a Mayoral candidate for Seoul, we can't use his real name.

78
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,510
I'll go with K then. His initial K.

79
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,370
The only name we can use is the woman victim's name. Do you want to do that?

80
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,780
That's not right!

81
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,390
So don't do it.

82
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,030
And come here, you punk.

83
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,580
My ears, ears! Be careful!

84
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,090
Keep quiet, shut it!
You, punk...

85
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,810
Just train your junior well, okay?

86
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:24,450
Work hard.

87
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,390
Chief... Ah, seriously.

88
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,170
It'd be good for you if you stand aside.

89
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,360
This Siberian **** copy machine bastard a**hole!
(The word 'Siberian' works like a convenient substitute for f*ck)

90
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,310
You copy machine! Are you not going to come to your senses?! Ah, I should just..!

91
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,450
What the heck?

92
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,430
Please leave your cellphone with me.

93
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,390
It would make things difficult if any conversation
from this room is recorded or leaks out.

94
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,210
This is a kind of unwritten rule.

95
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,840
Search me very thoroughly.

96
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,200
I've hid a handgun too.

97
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,990
Oh, Reporter Kim.

98
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,140
I am a fan of yours.

99
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,770
Do you know how much all of us wanted to see you?

100
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,600
Wow, you look so much better in person.

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,120
It's nice to meet you.

102
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,020
If I didn't meet with you today, my brother said he would cut off my allowance.

103
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,790
It's an honor to personally meet people who work behind the scenes.

104
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,620
Oh, Reporter Kim, this way please.

105
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,000
Ah, sit down. You haven't eat dinner yet, right?

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,750
The Chef here is someone we got from France.

107
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,420
He won first place in various global cooking competitions.
The food is great.

108
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,420
I am scared that people of such high positions have summoned a mere reporter like me

109
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,640
and even offered me food.

110
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,930
Can I ask you first why we are here?

111
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,900
He is indeed a reporter.
He's different from those common politicians.

112
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,710
Look, he's looking for facts right away.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,390
What is it, that so-called "fact"?

114
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,230
The fact is this.

115
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,810
Reporter Kim Moon Ho, we have chosen you.

116
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,630
These gentlemen are hoping
to put you into politics.

117
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,730
I am not. I want you to join my newspaper.

118
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,870
Isn't it like that, as always?

119
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,560
I won't let that happen. If Reporter Kim Moon Ho

120
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,180
becomes a "free agent",
my newspaper will be the first choice for him!

121
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,430
Stop talking nonsense.

122
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,150
How does it work for you, Reporter Kim?

123
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,740
Don't you have any interest in pursuing politics as our, the media's, representative?

124
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,670
I think Reporter Kim Moon Ho is currently the right man for that.

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,130
He's a star, in addition to being handsome.

126
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:47,000
This is really important.

127
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,650
What's more important is his spirit of defiance.

128
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,300
He has been speaking his wild comments according to his conviction, so the young people love him.

129
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,100
We're a bit weak with (appealing to) younger people.

130
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,500
Reporter Kim, come bring them to us.

131
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,290
I have a question.

132
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,920
You said, "we". Who exactly are "we"?

133
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,600
Mr. Seo,

134
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,700
what should we ask our Reporter Kim Moon Ho here to do first?

135
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,360
How about starting off with the campaign for Seoul Mayoral Candidate Kim Ui Chan?

136
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,000
Ah, that sounds good.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,620
Soon there will be a launching ceremony for his campaign office. He can start to show his face from there.

138
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,450
We must make use of his visual a lot.

139
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:46,650
So that at least it's worthwhile to bring a star in.

140
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,230
Reporter Kim,

141
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:55,820
trust us. We'll slowly turn you into an elite...

142
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,770
until you reach the peak...

143
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,810
with us.

144
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,960
Then, I will make the layout of him

145
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,340
being a spokesperson for the Mayoral Candidate Kim Ui Chan's campaign office.

146
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,130
Alright, alright, alright.
Let's all have a toast.

147
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,360
Huh? Reporter Kim.

148
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,550
Alright.

149
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,760
Ah, it must have been tiring
for you to come all the way to Seoul.

150
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,700
It's my case, so I need to come to
where any leads can be found.

151
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,450
I could have just sent you the files.

152
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:38,970
Well I wanted to hear some explanations from the man who chased him (Healer) for the past five years.

153
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,240
Is Healer the right guy?

154
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,710
Let's go.

155
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:49,690
Go Seong Cheol arrived at Incheon International Airport and took the airport shuttle bus,

156
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,430
and got on Subway Line 9.

157
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,170
On that day, there was a problem
on Subway Line 9.

158
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,980
Between Gayang Station and Joongmi Station,
they say the subway train stopped there for a while.

159
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,760
We speculate that someone hacked into
the system of the subway and stopped the train.

160
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,240
Huh?

161
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,280
Can they also hack the subway?

162
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,660
At the previous station where this subway stopped,
some of CCTVs were stopped for a moment too.

163
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,190
And at the same time at the next station.

164
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,600
- Ah, these guys are...?
- It's confirmed they are from the Double S Guards.

165
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,170
Double...
What is that?

166
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:38,170
They are errand guys who are the same as the Healer.

167
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,750
They might be the biggest errand company in the country.

168
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,010
So these guys are in cahoots with Healer?

169
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,130
No, I don't think it's that.

170
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,010
It seems like they are put on Go Seong Cheol by the other side.

171
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,320
It's complicated.

172
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,980
How did you know?

173
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,050
Let's take a look.

174
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:06,010
I found this after digging into the SNS (social networking service), a video filmed by one of the subway passengers.

175
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,510
Because the subway stopped at a place which is not a station, it seems this person started to record it.

176
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,090
This is Go Seong Cheol who was murdered.

177
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,730
That seems to be Healer next to him.

178
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,770
And...

179
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,410
So there were other people
who were chasing after him...

180
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,720
These are guards from Double S.

181
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,930
Please send this video to my e-mail.
Let's watch this slowly.

182
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,780
Yes.

183
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:45,300
The hacker who can even stop the subway lines.
Incredible.

184
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,230
But, is the police station safe then?

185
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,780
There is no one from the outside who can hack into our system.

186
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,570
But I am not so sure about inside jobs.

187
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,810
Warning!

188
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:26,730
Yoon Dong Won, this damn hardworking bastard.

189
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,280
Exactly when is this bastard retiring?

190
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,430

200
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:35,110
Boss

201
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,770
Yes, Boss?

202
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,760
Healer, that punk, turned off his tracker again. Find him.

203
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,170
I'm not telling you to do something after you find him.
I need you to be on his tail.

204
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:52,120
You know, right? Even I know he hates having someone on his tail.

205
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,630
But the situation is making me nervous.
My senses tell me something's not right.

206
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:03,110
Find Chae Yeong Sin first, since he said
he would stay next to that girl for the time being.

207
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,910
Chief, I have a question.

208
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,800
It's time to eat, not ask questions. Just eat.

209
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,350
What's that about you getting fired from a newspaper company a long time ago?

210
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:29,630
Hey, you guys, watch out how much she's drinking.
I can see she's getting drunk gradually.

211
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,540
You got fired after writing an article that the higher-ups told you not to write, right?

212
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,550
You got fired because of fighting for the truth, right?

213
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:40,980
Stop her. Stop her, stop her!

214
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,880
Oh, oh!
Such a waste!

215
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,330
It spilled.

216
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,300
Hey, that was not a long time ago, okay?

217
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,390
I'm not that old to say that it was a long time ago...

218
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,370
If it's not an event from a long time ago,

219
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:59,550
then inside you, there still must be something inside you that is alive and stirring.

220
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,210
Hey, did some alien lay some egg in me?
What's alive and stirring inside of me?

221
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,600
I am trying to talk about something serious right now. Why do you keep brushing me off?

222
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,990
Exactly. While we eat, stop being serious and just eat, please!

223
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,380
Here, say ah.

224
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,570
- What's with the meat?
- Hey, you eat it.

225
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,740
Hey, stop her. Stop her. Stop her!

226
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,440
Stop...

227
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,590
Our Chief became a typical rigid old man
who went through all hardships.

228
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,080
So, an article about politics is
too, too, too scary for him.

229
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,100
He's come to write nothing
but stories about some other people dating.

230
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,320
Ah, this is really sad, what a tragedy it is!
Sad, sad!

231
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,800
I need a young man. A fresh and young--
Hey, where did my junior Park Bong Soo go?

232
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,870
He's coming soon. He said he needs to go somewhere first.

233
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,570
Huh? Why?

234
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,440
Why? He didn't even get permission from his senior, why?!

235
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,130
You look like your father.

236
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:41,400
After your father died, it was hard on me every time I looked at you.

237
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,080
You like potatoes braised in soy sauce, right?

238
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,560
Hurry up and eat.

239
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,360
Mother, you should eat too.

240
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,810
I grilled some mackerel that you like.

241
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,530
Mom, are you going somewhere?

242
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,620
Yeah, I'm going somewhere.

243
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,250
Where are you going?

244
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,300
A bit... far.

245
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,540
When are you coming back?

246
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,200
I probably...

247
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,500
won't be coming back.

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,470
Why not?

249
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,560
I'm sorry.

250
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,460
Then... should I go look for you, wherever you are?

251
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:10,370
Eat. I'll go after you finish eating.

253
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,500
Don't slip out of your after-school academy.
I will be outside waiting for you when you're done, alright?

254
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,400
- You didn't answer me!
- I said I got it!

255
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,180
Hello?

256
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:28,010
I don't know who invented shaved ice with red bean,
but I want to send a thank you card to that person.

257
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,500
Mom, about your son...
what year is he in?

258
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,170
He's in his third year in high school.
Ugh, he doesn't even study a bit.

259
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,730
How disobedient he is...
He makes me get older.

260
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,730
How about you husband? Did he cut down on his soju intake?

261
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,290
That person cutting down on alcohol?

262
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,190
He has too many excuses for that, so he can't do it. He might as well just cut down on food.

263
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,170
What's wrong, Jeong Hoo,
that you even came to my house?

264
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:56,230
I...

265
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,100
This picture...

266
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:04,910
These are Father's friends, right?

267
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:07,290
You still carry this around?

268
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,350
I don't have a lot of pictures with me.
That one is one of the few.

269
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,580
What about these people?

270
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,050
Do you know them well?

271
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,730
Not well. They are his college friends.

272
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,840
This guy here worked for the same newspaper company with your father.

273
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,030
His wife was a reporter too, I think?

274
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,380
Oh, this lady and this guy are a married couple.

275
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,510
Does anyone know where they are now?

276
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,670
I don't know. This was long ago.

277
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,010
Look at how young your Father is here.
When I'm already this old.

278
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,370
I got hooked with this face.

279
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,970
Do you have some of Father's belongings?

280
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,040
Probably not.
That would be weird if I have them in this house.

281
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,930
Is that so?

282
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:03,380
- I'll look for it. Jeong Hoo, you...
- Why?

283
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,640
Why do you always order shaved ice with red bean
when you hate red beans?

284
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,540
I like red beans.

285
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,720
But you always push them to me like this.

286
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,060
But you like them.
These red beans.

287
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,810
- Ah, please.
- There's a lot left though.

288
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:35,540
- Still, we have to go now.
- There's still this much left!

289
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,730
Aigoo, I'm sorry. I'm late.

290
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,030
But wait. It's already over?

291
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,830
No, everyone is still here.
Please go inside.

292
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,120
It's my junior!
His name is Park Bong Soo. Bong Soo, Bong Soo!

293
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,360
Oh, you're leaving first?

294
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,480
She's a little drunk.

295
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,850
Ah, how many times should I tell you for you to believe me?

296
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:58,530
I'm not drunk at all. I take my alcohol well.

297
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,900
Being drunk is my wish,
but annoyingly, I've never gotten drunk easily.

298
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,070
You are drunk.

299
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:08,310
Have I told you?
You see, the brains of humans...

300
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,170
have three layers, did you know that?

301
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,730
Reporter Chae's been talking about dinosaurs for quite some time now. She's really wasted right now.

302
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,370
Ah, I'll take her home. Please go inside.

303
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,080
In this brain, in the center of it,
I mean, the core of those three layers...

304
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,050
But, the meat is still there inside.

305
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:29,490
Sunbae, let's go.

306
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,900
- You want to hear about it, don't you?
- Yes, now.

307
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,990
- You want to hear about it, don't you?
- Of course, of course.

308
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:38,880
The Chief says that since we don't know what trouble Reporter Chae will cause,

309
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,410
you must never leave her by herself before she gets to her own bed at her own house!

310
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,340
Okay! Fighting!

311
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,470
♬ Now that you are everything to me ♬

312
00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:01,230
♬ Oh, Love is the sweetest thing, smile at everything ♬

313
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,210
Mister, inside the brain of humans, in the middle part,
this here...

314
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:09,520
About this big!
This, this, the size of a ping pong ball...

315
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,950
There's a dinosaur brain inside them. Dinosaur!

316
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,070
It's inside your brain, Ahjusshi!
What's its purpose?

317
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,300
It's an essential part of our survival.

318
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:27,580
You must listen to this part.
Ahjusshi, focus here.

319
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,390
Taxi! Taxi! Wait just a minute, Ahjusshi.

320
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,410
- Hey, Sunbae! Sunbae, let's go!
- being angry, fighting...

321
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,340
- Hey!
- Stepping on someone else, hurting and kicking others, or killing...

322
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,370
This... "I just need to survive".

323
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,150
Sunbae, Sunbae, Sunbae! The taxi is here.

324
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,580
- Let's go.
- Let go of me! Let go of me, you rascal!

325
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,200
- Sunbae, first... Oh, wait!
- I'm not done talking yet!

326
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,090
You, you dinosaur bastard!

327
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,020
The dinosaur...
Let's talk about it after we get in the taxi.

328
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:08,180
♬ Sky stars can shine on my world tonight  ♬

329
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,080
♬ But I'll need the bus. Will you come home? ♬

330
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,330
♬ Will you hold me tight? ♬

331
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,530
- Hey! Hey, Yeong Sin!
- Sunbae, Sunbae.

332
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,900
Hey, hey! Look at her. Her eyes lost their focus.

333
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,720
Hyungnim, Yeong Sin is totally drunk.

334
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,670
How much did you drink?

335
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,160
Dad.

336
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,610
I sometimes think about dinosaur brains.

337
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,280
Those guys are quite pitiful.
What can they possible do, right?

338
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,320
You have drank a lot.
But, who are you?

339
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,730
Ah, yes. Hello, I'm...

340
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,340
This punk! He's my junior.
His name is...

341
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:02,710
Bong Soo. Bong Sook. (Rose Inn's song - "Bong Sook")
Bong Sook-ah.

342
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,940
Hello.

343
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:13,160
Bong Sook Ah! That's right!
For what are you trying to go home...

344
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,620
Ah, ah. Please take her.

345
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,660
Yeong Sin, let's go.

346
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:22,140
Why now? Why, why?

347
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,850
You can't go home, when there are still drinks left...

348
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,750
Where, where? This woman is strong!

349
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,480
Ah, yes.

350
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,920
Hello, I'm Park Bong Soo.

351
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,210
I'm Sunbae Chae Yeong Sin's junior, her direct junior.
That's why I took her home tonight.

352
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:49,450
I live in Incheon.
Looking at the time right now,

353
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,880
the buses and the subway have all stopped.

354
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,820
Ah, I've been listening to Sunbae's dinosaur talk for 40 minutes straight during the taxi ride.

355
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,980
Also the taxi fare was too expensive.

356
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,020
And I also have no money.

357
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,170
Please let me sleep here for just tonight.

358
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,710
- You're her direct junior?
- Yes.

359
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,920
Then, you'll be always together with Yeong Sin?

360
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:31,110
Well, that way, I could learn from Sunbae, right?

361
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,130
Why suddenly...? This is the first time we've met...

362
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:42,460
Where are we going? Excuse me, I'm sorry. Please spare me.

363
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,820
I seriously didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,270
The bed.

365
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,980
Ah, Joo Yeon Hee!

366
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,720
Yes?

367
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,510
Did I tell you?

368
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,760
When a person is born,

369
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,210
inside his head, there is nothing but a dinosaur brain.
Did I tell you about it?

370
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,770
Tell me tomorrow. Just sleep for now.

371
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,920
And then it grows to the next stage.

372
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,930
That's a mammal's brain.

373
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,660
It becomes complete during adolescence.

374
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,160
It's responsible for emotions.

375
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,030
The pain you're feeling right now,

376
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:29,960
and this frustration that I feel as I look at you...

377
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,000
You're drunk. Please go to sleep.

378
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,130
There's an important part left!

379
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:40,020
And now for the last stage, the part that only humans have is

380
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,360
the brain of primate mammals, the frontal lobe.

381
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,790
This... is what separates humans from dinosaurs

382
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,320
or other animals.

383
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,390
In women, they say its development ends at about age 25.

384
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,500
But, in my case, it's been a while

385
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,720
since I've turned 25.

386
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,780
And so!

387
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
What are you doing?

388
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,980
Do you think I'm drunk right now?

389
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,980
You reek so much of alcohol right now.

390
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,450
Well, then let's say I'm drunk, all right?

391
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,710
Let's create some trouble.
Something that only a human can do...

392
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,630
Creating trouble while being drunk.

393
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:42,120
What we are going to say starting now,

394
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,470
I wish that Yeong Sin wouldn't know about it.

395
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,390
Of course. I understand.

396
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:50,820
Sunbae... will not know.

397
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,280
Since you're going to be around Yeong Sin,

398
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,940
I have a favor to ask of you.

399
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,400
Wait... Is this... a favor?

400
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,830
No.

401
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,850
There are a few warnings I have to give you.

402
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,830
There are three, Hyungnim.

403
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:09,930
Three...

404
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,580
- First of all...
- Yes.

405
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,080
Make sure she doesn't drink alcohol.

406
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,480
That would be hard though,
since Yeong Sin's hands are usually fast.

407
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,470
Especially!

408
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,070
If the dinosaur talk starts coming out, that's a warning sign.

409
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,090
Even if she doesn't drink that much,

410
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,620
three or four times per year?

411
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,400
But every time she drinks, she causes trouble,

412
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,100
a grand trouble.

413
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,930
- Secondly...
- Yes, secondly.

414
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,360
Don't let her open cans.

415
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,690
C-cans?

416
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,090
If she opens cans, she scrapes her hand.

417
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,230
Once every three or four times, she always draws some blood.

418
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,450
And you must never!

419
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,870
Ah, yes.
N-never, never.

420
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:59,220
Don't let her go to a scene of violence no matter what.

421
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,210
Violence?

422
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,690
My child, when she was young...

423
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,310
She had some accident.

424
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,700
That's why when she sees violence,

425
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,370
you see, that is...

426
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,830
She goes into a seizure.

427
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,600
Ah, but this is violence...

428
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,960
She cannot breathe properly.

429
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,040
Pardon me? Breathe?

430
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,240
So, this is some kind of post traumatic stress...

431
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,080
She will have a chest pain
with hyperventilation, something like that.

432
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,950
So, what you meant is...

433
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,510
At a scene of violence, even if she's just looking, she's going to be in pain...?

434
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,510
Don't try to know more.

435
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,870
In any case, you must never!

436
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:57,250
Violence! Assault! Please don' t let

437
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,360
our Yeong Sin go to any scene of violence.

438
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,590
I understand...

439
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,280
It's a favor.

440
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,760
It's a favor, yes...

441
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,080
- It's a favor.
- Yes, it is...

442
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,350
No.

443
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,250
These are a lot of books.

444
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,430
When did you say you reported for the first time?

445
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:27,530
It was the 17th of last month.

446
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:33,180
On the 17th, actress J...

447
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:36,300
reported H, who runs a construction company,

448
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,200
to the police for sexual assault.

449
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,790
I will write the next lines strongly.
Will that be alright?

450
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:50,190
I already told you to write only the truth.

451
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,020
...threaten he will spread the video...
Coerce them into performing sexual favors for wealthy men...

452
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:16,070
Moreover, it has been revealed that one of the men,
H, had forced them to entertain is...

453
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,730
a member of the current ruling party

454
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,100
who has been serving long-term as an assemblyman.

455
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,840
Mr. K. is included...

456
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,290
How about the names? They all have names,
why are you not writing those names?

457
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,200
In that case, then I would have to put your name out as well.

458
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,450
Put it out, please. My name does not matter.

459
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,310
I don't want to.

460
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,040
Why? Are you scared?

461
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,770
Yes. I'm completely scared.

462
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,440
After your name gets revealed to the world,
what happens next?

463
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,030
Are you saying you don't care about what happens then,
is that it?

464
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,220
"You die, and I die".
That doesn't work.

465
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:04,330
"Even if you die, I must live".
That's the right thing.

466
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:16,140
[Exclusive] Seoul City Mayoral Candidate, Mr. K, accused of accepting sexual favors.
Police lax investigation makes victim distraught.

467
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:27,280
Dinosaurs, mammals, and humans.

468
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,240
The article has been released.

469
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:44,260
What's with that woman?

470
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,590
Why are there so many women?!

471
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,300
Boss

472
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,410
Boss?

473
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:23,910
Hyung. That...that...

474
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:31,910
You... did you think you'd be able to follow me secretly, you punk?

475
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:36,000
That's not it. What I'm saying is...

476
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:39,300
Ah, this is not it.

477
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,750
Here.

478
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,020
From now on, follow that guy instead of me.

479
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,180
Hyungnim

480
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
Who is this man?

481
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,900
Do you not even watch the news?
He's a star reporter that comes out on the news.

482
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,660
Follow him closely 24/7,
and report to me whenever he moves. Go.

483
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,140
But still...
The boss is nervous about you.

484
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,500
You even turned off your tracker.
It's not that she asked me to tail you,

485
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,890
but you know... to watch over your back...

486
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,920
Huh?

487
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,800
Excuse me.

488
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,440
Hey, Miss.

489
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,710
Seriously.

490
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,430
That's...

491
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,740
That's my spot.

492
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,130
Hey,

493
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,820
you said you can't sleep if someone is next to you.

494
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:48,370
I'm that 'someone'.

495
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,240
Hey.

496
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:55,940
Hey. Hey!

497
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,390
I'm next to you.

498
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,870
So, you...
Hurry back to your room..

499
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,500
Hey...

500
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,380
But this woman...

501
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,090
Without fear...

502
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,330
One, two, three.

503
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,500
Cabbage kimchi!

504
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,370
Done!
Alright!

505
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,990
Toast, toast!

506
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,640
So you're the first among us to get a house?

507
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,300
You envy me, right?
You're admiring me so much, right?

508
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,410
Oh, my stomach hurts. My stomach hurts!
(Idiom for being very jealous)

509
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,680
Congratulations, the house is really pretty.

510
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,300
More than half of it is on a mortgage.
It'll be tough times from now on.

511
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,570
Where is Ji An?

512
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,470
She was playing with Jeong Hoo a while ago.
Where did she go?

513
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,270
I know, right?

514
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,010
This bastard must really want to die.

515
00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,350
I should just...!

516
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,860
To protect our source,
I can't tell the details about it.

517
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,990
I can't tell you who K is.

518
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:19,810
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin is not here.

519
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,180
Where did Chae Yeong Sin go?
I thought someone saw her.

520
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,400
I thought someone saw her come to work!

521
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,480
I did not.

522
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,250
Take it down first. Take down the article.
This is bad.

523
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,640
Really bad.

524
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:34,930
The traffic right now is enormous!
It's the biggest for our newspaper...

525
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:37,230
Network traffic is not the issue right now!

526
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,770
We've also hit the top search!

527
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,910
Actress performing sexual favors and Assemblyman K!

528
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:45,480
Where did Chae Yeong Sin go, you punk?!

529
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,260
Chief is looking for you.

530
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,720
It's chaos now, chaos!

531
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,140
Hello? Hey, you.

532
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,560
What should we do? What should we do?

533
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,700
The article is written like this.

534
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,720
"Seoul City Mayoral candidate Assemblyman K,
member of the current ruling party"

535
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,420
This is Kim Ui Chan, no doubt.

536
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,620
Kim Moon Ho came to work, right?

537
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:23,410
Yes, I saw him enter the editing room just now.

538
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,540
- Listen up.
- I am listening.

539
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,100
It would be bad if Kim Moon Ho gets wind of this story.

540
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,510
Ah, I see.

541
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:32,320
I am going to put Kim Moon Ho on another story. So,

542
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,050
you, working with him for that story from now on,

543
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,810
your role is to make sure Kim Moon Ho does not work on anything else.

544
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:42,730
Chief, but I...
How could I dare do that to a senior...

545
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:44,900
I don't feel confident.

546
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,130
You said your family is from the province, right?

547
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,380
Yes. In Chuncheon.

548
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,500
If you don't have any confidence here, should I look into local broadcast stations there?

549
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:57,050
No! Allegiance!

550
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:04,060
That editing is not so urgent, right?

551
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,780
- Why?
- I got a tip about Chairman Yang of Woo Jang.

552
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,040
The prosecution has started on him.

553
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,250
It seems that the circumstance of him siphoning off his assets got noticed. You know many prosecutors in that section, right?

554
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,080
- Look into it.
- Why?

555
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:22,540
Those assets he siphoned off are art pieces.

556
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,620
You know it's an artwork special this week, right?
I'm thinking of including that in the broadcast.

557
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,070
Why would you come to this small editing room to personally ask me to do that?

558
00:46:31,070 --> 00:46:36,170
You could bring it up in the meeting later,
or you could even call me to your office.

559
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,780
It's unlike you, Chief Kang.

560
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,630
Do it. I'll notify the camera team.

561
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:44,680
Why are you following her, Jong Soo?

562
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,480
- Huh?
- You two don't usually go together, right?

563
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,280
Ah, that is...

564
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:03,480
Dang...

565
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:09,310
Is this about Kim Ui Chan?
Is this true, not just some bullshit?

566
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:12,200
- None of your business.
- How much did it blow? Did other media start writing about it?

567
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,910
It's about Kim Ui Chan.
It'd be buried in a day anyway.

568
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,200
- So-
- The reporter who wrote this is hiding the female victim, I see.

569
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,400
That's why he/she wrote this strongly.

570
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,690
- Where did this come from?
- Kim Moon Ho.

571
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:26,860
- Where is it?
- Huh?

572
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:34,430
Ah, it's just some small internet newspaper site.
The name was also weird. Was it Sunday or Some Day?

573
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,100
I told you to pay no mind to it.
It's not your role to get involved.

574
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:41,790
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin
- The politics desk will take care of it, and so...

575
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,200
So, you should take charge of Woo Jang's Chairman Yang.

576
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:50,680
What artworks and how much he has ...!

577
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,410
I already secured the cooperation of the media,

578
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,310
so it will die down soon.

579
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:11,130
But, there are also instances where it didn't die down.

580
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,930
But, what if it blows up?

581
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,190
It cannot blow up.

582
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,960
This is a story without any proof,
and to the mayor-to-be of Seoul,

583
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,440
this is obviously political slandering.

584
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,810
That's right. That's it.

585
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,460
Slander.

586
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,970
We cannot allow this malicious talk to stain an individual's reputation

587
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:39,830
or stir up the order of the society, so

588
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,330
we will take care of it.

589
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,470
Ah, this really...!

590
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,030
How embarrassing...
"Bribery by performing sexual favors"...?

591
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:49,700
Geez.

592
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:53,810
If my wife knows this, aigoo...

593
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,620
But still, there will be some people
who cling to it.

594
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:06,200
(For them,) President Hwang would be easier
than Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan.

595
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,720
Please be assured.

596
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,790
This secret, I will take to my grave.

597
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,730
That won't do, President Hwang.

598
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,540
- Pardon me?
- Secret?

599
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,390
Do you have any secrets?

600
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:26,720
Ah, no. I don't.

601
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,790
You said the whereabouts of that problematic woman is now unknown, right?

602
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,110
Yes. I'm sorry.

603
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,900
Who is that reporter?

604
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,240
Chae Yeong Sin from Some Day News.

605
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,670
Investigate her.
She's probably hiding the woman.

606
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,460
Bring that woman,
and silence the reporter.

607
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:57,250
You use whatever method is needed.

608
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,730
I will do as I see fit.

609
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,830
Hello.

610
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,670
Hey, that's him, right? Isn't it?

611
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,380
Wow! Amazing!

612
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,890
How many hits have we got so far?

613
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,730
Shut up!

614
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,170
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin is not here.

615
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:36,580
Ah, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin is not here.

616
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,640
Put it down, put it down!
It's too noisy.

617
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,360
I am told to put the phone down right now.

618
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:42,760
Ah, yes.

619
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,150
Ah, serio--

620
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,090
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

621
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:24,190
Ch ... Chae Yeo ... Yeong Sss .... Sin. That's right. I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

622
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,940
Can we talk briefly?

623
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,670
I'm your fan.

624
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,380
But, how could he do that?

625
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,340
Please give the article to me.

626
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,560
You probably won't be able to protect that article
nor the source (Joo Yeong Hee).

627
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,170
It's a shame if it (the article) gets buried like that.
So, please give it to me.

628
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,890
Wow, I didn't see him that way.

629
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:41,270
I have an eye for people, but I really didn't see him that way.

630
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:46,780
But he's a total hypocrite and a chunk of pretense.

631
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,480
But, why are you following me?

632
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,330
Ah, I left something at your place.
I have to get it back.

633
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,850
Kim Moon Ho, is that how he became a star?

634
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:07,660
Is that how he made it big, by taking away
and stealing stories from his powerless juniors?

635
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,390
But, when did you start talking to me informally?

636
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:17,380
I did? How could I?

637
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,490
Geez, seriously.

638
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:23,830
What should I do with this sense of horrible betrayal and deep indignation?

639
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:25,990
What do I do, huh?

640
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,000
Ah, I seriously...

641
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,230
That source of yours (Joo Yeon Hee)
would be in danger by now, I think.

642
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,120
There's no way you don't sense if there's danger or not.

643
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,800
You don't fully grasp the whole situation, do you?

644
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,090
What you set off, and how this would go...

645
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:43,860
You don't know, do you?

646
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,830
When did he see me that he's talking to me in banmal (informal speech)?

647
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,290
This human, he's rude!

648
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,780
Ah I, to that kind of human...

649
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,670
Ajumma.

650
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:08,230
Hey, you poopdog! Where are you?

651
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:13,070
I turned on my tracker. There's a CCTV right in front,
can you come in (the system)?

652
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:18,220
Why? Why? What is it? What?

653
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,670
Healer, run now.

654
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,640
They're Sang Soo's guys.

655
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,140
They're the guys who have once fought with you.

656
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,410
Your face is bare right now.

657
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,090
What are you doing? Hurry and run!

658
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,840
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

659
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,700
Who are you?

660
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,770
You don't need to know who am I.

661
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,620
You know Joo Yeon Hee, right?

662
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:48,020
Hey, if a person asks you something, you should answer.

663
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:49,270
Who?

664
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:52,970
Joo Yeon Hee. You know her.

665
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:56,280
Well, now, Reporter Chae, with us,

666
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,680
you're going to where Joo Yeon Hee is.

667
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,510
Do you understand?

668
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:04,030
Hoobae.

669
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,030
Yes, Sunbae?

670
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:12,080
I'll stop them, so you run away.

671
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,540
Go and call the police.

672
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:24,720
Excuse me. There must be something wrong.

673
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,550
Joo... What?
Joo Yeon Hee?

674
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,540
If you explain about her a little more,
I...

675
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:37,350
Ah, jeez... I'm starting to get frustrated now.

676
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,280
Hey, get rid of him.

677
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,740
Oh, hey, what's the matter?

678
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,740
Ow! It hurts!

679
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:57,260
It hurts. It hurts!

680
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,720
I'll go. I'll go!
Just leave him alone!

681
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,900
I'm going. I'm going!

682
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:04,780
Let's go.

683
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,290
Healer, you only got hit, right?

684
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,000
You did well.
Now get out of there.

685
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:05,170
My child had an accident when she was young.

686
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:08,890
She can't breathe properly.

687
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,430
Because it hurt so badly...

688
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:15,630
I wanted to die.

689
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,050
It hurt where I was hit.

690
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,230
You see, several of my ribs were broken.

691
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:37,380
I already called the police.
They will be arriving in 10 minutes.

692
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:40,150
Get out of there fast.

693
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,370
Ah, this woman, seriously!

694
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,170
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

695
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,570
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

696
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,620
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

697
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,930
♬ Together you and I ♬

698
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:55,560
♬ Do you believe in the power ♬

699
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:00,550
♬ Of everlasting love? ♬

700
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:04,290
♬ We can make it if we stay together ♬

701
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:09,830
♬ Our love is just enough ♬

702
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,210
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

703
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,030
♬ We'll always stay this way ♬

704
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,880
♬ We can start at the end of time ♬

705
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,860
♬ And do it all again ♬

706
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,460
♬ Oh my love ♬

707
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,300
♬ I'm all yours ♬

708
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:41,030
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

709
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:46,430
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

710
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,520
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

711
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:55,740
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

712
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,670
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

713
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:03,680
♬ My love will always grow ♬

714
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:08,770
♬ And I won't let go ♬

715
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:11,890
Healer Preview

716
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,900
It doesn't feel right...
It feels really bad.

717
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,820
Healer has appeared? Where?

718
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:17,870
Beside Chae Yeong Sin.

719
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:20,450
You just have to do as you are ordered.

720
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:22,000
I can't write my resignation.

721
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,870
This is really unfair!

722
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,830
Come find me when you can't handle it any more.

723
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,280
I sent you a picture.
Please look into who they are.

724
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,970
Since that day in 1992, we've been on the same side until now.

725
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:35,910
Do you know how worried I was for you?

726
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:39,130
Is Chae Yeong Sin that pretty?

727
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:39,600
That guy is that guy!
Healer, this bastard!
