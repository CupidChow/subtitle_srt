1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,100
(System checking)

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,200
Healer

3
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,670
Episode 1

4
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,410
I admit... that you're sexy.

5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,650
I also admit... that you have a nice bod.

6
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,230
The thing is though...

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,420
What is up with your clothes?! Too much coverage!

8
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,930
Failed

9
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,150
Doesn't this program come with an option to choose
the [character's] clothes?

10
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,230
I'll be the first to have the clothes option menu drawn up.

11
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:17,030
1. Bikini, 2. Belly Dance, 3. White laced maid's uniform...

12
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,890
And... 4. Playboy uniform

13
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,280
Good. A little more.

14
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,660
Why won't you pick up the phone, Oppa?

15
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,710
I told you not to interrupt, didn't I?

16
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,070
I told you not to interrupt without permission, didn't I?!

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,430
I told you not to ignore my calls cavalierly, didn't I?
You're not my favorite!

18
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,210
Let's get to work!

19
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,430
- What is it?
- It's a totally simple one.

20
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,950
- When?
- Now, right away.

21
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,260
By the way, it's suspicious.

22
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,770
What is?

23
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,570
There never was a simple one among the ones you claimed
to be simple, you know Ajumma?

24
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,790
But what's this you say it's totally simple?

25
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,210
That's why it's totally suspicious!

26
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,830
Just meet a person, receive an item,
let the client deposit the money...

27
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,140
That's the end. How much simpler can it get?!

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,750
I have a dream.

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,410
Two and a half hour ride on a speed boat from Panama Canal.

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,520
This desert island with lush vegetation

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,750
that is equipped with natural spring water
in the midst of insanely blue water.

32
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,910
This guy is my dream.

33
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,880
There's one towards the exit 3.

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,340
Wait a minute.

35
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,610
I got you.

36
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,220
I took care of that one too.

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,430
Did he suggest we meet here?

38
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,450
I guess he thinks it's safer to meet in a crowded place.

39
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,350
- But Ajumma...
- What?

40
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,510
This... how much did you decide on the fee?

41
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,510
Why?

42
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,110
The one that's sitting way over there.

43
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,500
And this one.

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,570
And another here.

45
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,470
Visible ones alone amount to 4.
And all of them have the same gear on their ears.

46
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,690
Who are they I wonder? Police?

47
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,270
Am I walking into a trap myself?

48
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,300
I don't think they're police.

49
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,900
Look, what budget do the police have to distribute
such premium equipment to line workers?

50
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,080
They aren't the police.

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,640
Look, you have to pay a minimum of $328 per piece
even if you buy in bulk.

52
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,320
It's not the police.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,390
So how much did you decide for the pay?

54
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,240
$5,000.

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,390
Not doing it.

56
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,270
I got prepaid though.

57
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,570
If it's $5,000, it'd be $2,500 for me. $2,500 for you.
Can't be doing all this for chump change.

58
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,230
I'm saying it's $5,000 per person.
$5,000 for me, $5,000 for you.

59
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,670
This is our first deal of the month.

60
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:38,090
This field has become fiercely competitive.
You're aware, aren't you?

61
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,050
I'm going crazy.

62
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:08,430
Wow...

63
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,010
Got it!

64
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,910
Received and sent.

65
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,370
Gosh ...

66
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,690
Excuse me.

67
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,520
Eastern/Western beauties all included! 120 teaser pix revealed.
Should sexy girls be stripped nude?!
http://www.xcrongirl.co.kr

68
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,700
Capture the shot and hack into it then...

69
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,920
Company... company... where is it?

70
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,420
What kind of company do you work for?

71
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,770
Yes, it is Double S Guard.

72
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,350
What? What did you say?

73
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,370
Double S. Sang Soo's gang.

74
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:16,910
- Ugh really?
- Your rival.

75
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,450
Ajumma, no matter how good an ace from the amateur league is, you don't compare him to a MLB player.

76
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,670
In the last 3 months, 1 out of 4 of our regulars switched over to them.

77
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:31,590
To them, we are the neighborhood grocery store, and Double S is the Gangnam department store.

78
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,450
Whatever, I don't know. When is the client arriving?

79
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,990
Twelve seconds later, the third car from the front [of the train].

80
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,960
So... what does he look like?

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,550
Name Go Seong Cheol
Age 41

82
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,360
GO SEONG CHEOL
1974.11.17
American Green Card
Address: 1440W 10152LA CA 9007, USA IDENTIFIED

83
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,980
Bingo.

84
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,930
You've come to meet the Healer?

85
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,450
Name: Seo Jeong Hoo (Code name: Healer)
Occupation: Night Errand boy

86
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,380
Monthly Income: 0 - billions of won
Current goal: Purchase a desert island (achieved 64% of purchase fee)

87
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,890
- Hello.
- Hello.

88
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,090
This elevator is going up

89
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,740
Oh, apartment 703 is my house. I'll take it.

90
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,490
Ah, yes.

91
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:28,190
Work hard.

92
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,860
- Who is it?
- Delivery.

93
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,260
Just leave it there and leave

94
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,540
Th-there is some sort of envelope here as well.
It looks like a police summons.

95
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,520
You need to sign for it because it's registered mail.

96
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,170
Or would you like to pick it up from the post office yourself?

97
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,490
Give it.

98
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:22,110
I said you have to sign here.

99
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,700
What's wrong?

100
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm alright.

101
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,510
I have a chronic heart...

102
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,810
This...

103
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,330
Could you please give me some water for my medicine?

104
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,510
Oh my.

105
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,780
Wait a second.

106
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,970
- Are you okay?
- Ah yes, I'm okay.

107
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,550
Whew. I think I can make it now. Thanks.

108
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,650
What about the envelope?

109
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,910
I already signed it.

110
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,110
You're Lee Jung Hun, right?

111
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,290
You see that I'm not.

112
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,970
Don't you know who I am?

113
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,910
No?

114
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,410
That's weird... Why isn't it?

115
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,470
Excuse me. Hey!

116
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,110
You know that Oh Seon Jeong lives in that apartment alone,

117
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,130
but there were men's shoes. The size at a glance is well over 270mm.

118
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,250
I even took a proper picture.

119
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,990
People usually say this is a scoop!

120
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,470
Hold on for a second...

121
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,410
Top Star "O" has a male companion's shoes in her apartment.

122
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,750
Too weak. Weak!

123
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,210
I swear, these are Lee Joong Bin's shoes.

124
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,210
Undercover story: Top Star "O's" apartment left with a trace of Mr. "L".

125
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,750
That's weak too. Weak, weak, weak! Look,

126
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,990
if you got into the apartment, you should have pushed for an interview or something.

127
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,310
Not a picture of the shoe stand. Something where Lee Joong Bin's clothes were strewn across her couch or something!

128
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,490
But what if I am sued for trespassing, are you going to pay for my release?

129
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,330
Then I'll go back in right now.

130
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,650
Just wait and see. I'm going to look through the whole apartment and find Lee Joong Bin's car.

131
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,450
If he came with his own car: 3389, if he came with his company's car: 5425.

132
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,070
There must be either one of these two.
My hunch as a reporter is-

133
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,030
That 18-year-old nephew bastard!
(Loosely, that f'in little sh*t)

134
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,810
What? What? Did Lee Joong Bin appear?

135
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:03,050
Hey. Yeong Sin. Yeong Sin.

136
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,530
This... this kid.

137
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,650
How can she not fear me, the department head?

138
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,110
She calls me when she likes and hangs up when she likes.

139
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,910
Hey, now she even speaks to me as if I was her friend.

140
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,350
Wow, look at this.

141
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,630
I'm going to teach you manners since you didn't learn from your mom.

142
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,630
- Hey! You there!
- Bastard!

143
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,710
What? You're in a chase at the subway?

144
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,830
How many should I beat up for you guys to do things properly!?

145
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,610
What? Healer?

146
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,110
You think it's that guy?

147
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,190
Is it the Healer without any doubt? Is it correct?

148
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,190
What does he look like?

149
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,770
You all have the pictures I handed out!

150
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,650
Compare. Are you sure?

151
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,810
Aish. Stop talking so much! Look at his physique not his face!

152
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,210
By the size, demeanor, and mannerisms!

153
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,570
Similar?

154
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,590
Wait a minute.

155
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:15,950
Since you picked up on it, nab him. Nab both of them.

156
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:19,210
Go Seong Cheol will talk after a few broken fingers

157
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,090
and get that Healer bastard.

158
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,870
I'm going to see his face this time.

159
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,570
That rat-like pest!

160
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,930
Where are you?

161
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,330
I said where in the subway!

162
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,330
Name: Chae Yeong Sin
Job: Internet Newspaper Assistant Entertainment Reporter

163
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,730
Healer? He's the healer?

164
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,330
Him?

165
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,930
Really? haha.
 Monthly income: 1,500,000 won
Current goal: To become a famous journalist like Kim Moon Ho

166
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,370
Oh! Reporter Kim Moon Ho!

167
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,990
Daebak!

168
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,150
Reporter Kim Moon Ho is here.

169
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,890
I think they're going to cover this story as a breaking news item.

170
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,850
In Sam Han Industry where there's
a labor-management negotiation that is currently happening...

171
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,950
Sunbae, relevant background story is here.

172
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,790
It looks like they will proceed with the layoff
as previously planned by the company.

173
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,270
And there is no severance package for those that were laid off. It all became invalid.

174
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,330
Then, among the union's demands,
what is acceptable (to the company)?

175
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,330
With the exception of the laborers who instigated the [strike],
the company's willing to forgo its right to have the illegal laborers arrested.

176
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,050
It's been revealed I think.

177
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:59,930
Please, save the familes of Sam Han Industry's union workers!

178
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,250
Save us! Save us! Save us!

179
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,810
The families of Sam Han Industry's union workers are losing their lives!

180
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,730
They're all slowly dying! Dying!

181
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:17,910
I'm Kim Moon Ho from ABS TV station.
Thank you for your hard work.

182
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:23,790
Please help me! Our husbands and
children are dying, one after the other.

183
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:28,550
Please save us! Citizens.. please save us!

184
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,170
What are you doing?

185
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,830
You are a famous person? . . . I recognized your face.

186
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,970
-You are a well known reporter, right?
-Do you have something to say?

187
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,150
My son's name is Sin Hyeong Cheol.

188
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,990
Sam Han Industry's Maintenance Department's employee, Sin Hyeong Cheol.

189
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,670
He's in the hospital right now, after setting himself on fire.

190
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,990
-I have heard.
-Why he did such a thing . . .

191
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,190
He is a very nice person, so there must be
a good reason why he did, what he did.

192
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,190
Therefore, I was going to ask the President about it, but . . .

193
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,210
They won't even let me in.

194
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,670
Please help my son!
How is he going to deal with this?!

195
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,110
So pitiful... Please help my son!

196
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,690
-Assistant Manager Kang?
-Yes, what?

197
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,370
Please, take care of the media conference here?

198
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,410
What are you saying?

199
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,850
- Jong Soo.
- Yes?
- Follow me.

200
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,450
- Sunbae!
- Reporter Kim!

201
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,910
Sunbae! Oh no, the door is opening!

202
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,770
Oh my! We have to tape this.
This segment is supposed to air by tonight!

203
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,430
Sunbae!

204
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,210
Name: Kim Moon Ho
Occupation: Famous reporter

205
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,210
Annual Salary: Income from TV station + Stock investment profits + Monthly real estate property rental profit + etc.. etc..= No previous calculation.

206
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,270
Current goal: To last each day.
And... to find that child.

207
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,270
I'm Kim Moon Ho from ABS.

208
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,070
Can I see you for a few minutes?

209
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,010
Thank you.

210
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,810
I am Kim Moon Ho.

211
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,170
Are you feeling all right?

212
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,390
Do you think you can do an interview?

213
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,510
Excuse me. He can't speak.

214
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,230
He has burns to his throat as well.

215
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,390
He can't talk.

216
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,790
Okay.

217
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,250
He can only move his right hand.

218
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,950
Therefore, he'll write it down, when he needs to say something.

219
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,210
He wrote this letter for the media. He wanted me
to show this to reporters, once they arrived.

220
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,990
It's been quite a while, ever since he wrote this.

221
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,110
But during that time, no one came by.

222
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,670
Please share our story with the world!

223
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:35,110
No one would listen to our story.

224
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:41,230
The company's claim of financial problems is false.

225
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,770
I'm very sorry to show up this late!

226
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,450
-What is this train's next station?
-What?

227
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,470
What's the situation, over there?

228
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,810
Next station's situation...

229
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,190
The situation is...

230
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,450
not good.

231
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,830
I think that Double S team guys were encamped ahead of time.

232
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,510
How many?

233
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:48,570
Were all of them dispatched? . . .Very many.

234
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,430
1, 2, 4, and 7...

235
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,370
Total of nine.

236
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,610
We're ready. There is no exit route.

237
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,910
You said it was 5,000,000 won,

238
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,330
and they mobilized their whole team?
Then how much are they getting paid?

239
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,290
Ajumma, what is wrong with your marketing intel?

240
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:13,170
Excuse me.

241
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,150
Can you hack the subway?

242
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,940
That station was line 9, right?

243
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,970
That should be a self operating train,
the latest model. Wait.

244
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:28,160
- Excuse me, Ahjusshi.
- Yes?

245
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,700
Those guys are trailing you.

246
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:38,510
What to do? I can't...from here.

247
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,210
From now on, trust me.

248
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,710
Trust me. All the way. Okay?

249
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,970
I'm Healer. I will save your life, okay?

250
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,300
Okay.

251
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,880
When I count to three, jump off.

252
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,650
J-j-jump off?

253
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,860
1...

254
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,200
2...

255
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,140
3.

256
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,570
Why? 3!

257
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,580
What the?!

258
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,190
- Seriously Ahjumma?!
- Oh, my mistake.

259
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,400
To Sinnonhyeon Station (On Line 9 in Seoul)

260
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,300
What's wrong?

261
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,500
- The item.
- What?

262
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,840
Give me the item. I have to check its authenticity.

263
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,280
Ahjussi, didn't you hear of my name?

264
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,860
The famous name that I complete every errand by contract without delay. That Healer is me.

265
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,510
This errand says to check the item's authenticity and the money will be sent.

266
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,730
So give me the item.

267
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,690
I will make sure your money gets deposited.

268
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,060
If you can save me first, then I will give you the item.

269
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:47,040
I doubt the guys tracking you will try to kill you . . .

270
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,870
Wow, you might die, huh.

271
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,390
- Okay let's run.
- You don't know what this is?

272
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,810
Client, you don't have to tell me what it is right now.

273
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,810
They're going to kill me.

274
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,020
I'm going to die!

275
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,140
- Save me!
- Ajussi..

276
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,830
Ajumma! Move the train, the lights are too bright.

277
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:13,610
Move the train? Then I will.

278
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,590
There is nothing wrong with the system on my end!

279
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,950
Maybe at your end, at the control center... oh oh.

280
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,820
What- get your lights!

281
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,550
Where are these bastards! Get them!

282
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,730
- When is the next train?
- The next train comes in 2 minutes and 10 seconds from the other direction.

283
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,790
You're still outnumbered.
Can you handle them by then?

284
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:09,750
What? Where? Hey!

285
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,060
2 minutes 3 seconds.

286
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:15,980
Even though I'm trying to understand this situation, for 5,000,000 won, this is outrageous.

287
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,820
Don't destroy the glasses. I don't have any spares.

288
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,390
Ah seriously, this ahjumma.

289
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,150
1 minute 20 seconds.

290
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,540
1 minute.

291
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,470
50 seconds.

292
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,360
Oh, wait! Let's take a break.

293
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,130
Let's clear away these guys from the tracks first,

294
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,560
and let's move away. Wait!

295
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,140
Hey, let's rest for a minute.

296
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,950
Healer?

297
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:54,710
Hello? Hello?

298
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,800
For just 5,000,000 won, this is really

299
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,360
not worth it. Ahjumma!

300
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,470
Our perspective is really simple.

301
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:26,830
The past president left some useful quotes.

302
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:29,790
As if the company didn't want to make
this decision but it is the only way,

303
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:32,390
we will say that you would be able to understand the company's situation,

304
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,130
and if you go against it, you are against the success of the company.

305
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,810
This is simple and explicit.

306
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:39,630
But still,

307
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,130
45 percent of Sam Han Industry global workers will be cut.

308
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,680
The opposition will be great.

309
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,480
They will ask what the government did until now,

310
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,080
and they will need further evidence to back up this decision.

311
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,980
Why will the government be a part of this mess?

312
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,300
This situation is all the union's fault.

313
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,400
Editor-in-chief, how have you maintained your position

314
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,980
with such shortcomings?

315
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,600
By the end of the day today,
our editorial will start like this ;

316
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,880
Extremely militant union's reckless strike
and the instigation from an outside organization

317
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,420
have driven a failing company into a corner,

318
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:20,220
and have endangered the livelihood and jobs of current workers in the company, who haven't participated in this illegal strike.

319
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,630
If, at least, such an illegal strike like Sam Han's
were not happening again,

320
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,130
that would be a great help to the economic revival and the improvement in the people's livelihood.

321
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,250
That's good. Let's do it that way then.

322
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:36,250
Then let's leave it at that. It is time for my wife's medication.

323
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,690
Y-y-you, so responsible for your wife, Chairman Kim. My goodness.

324
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,010
I envy your devotion.
 (Daksal: Chicken skin, makes me cringe/envy the love)

325
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,020
I will contact you again.

326
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,060
I was informed, the item is in posession.

327
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,660
The item was confirmed?

328
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,040
We confirmed it. It's authentic.

329
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,280
There was someone trying to steal it during the transfer?

330
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,570
Who was it?

331
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,310
That is...

332
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,010
Moon Ho?

333
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,070
Yes.

334
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,130
He should have used a professional.

335
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,430
Kim Moon Ho used the Double S Guards,

336
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,370
the biggest in the field.

337
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,310
They have a lot of staff and their technology is the most current.

338
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,570
And who is the guy who worked on our side?

339
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,540
A man named Healer.

340
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:44,600
This side is known to work by himself.

341
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,840
He has never revealed his identity,

342
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,200
and he never asks for the client's information either.

343
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,200
Other than his code name as the Healer, I couldn't find out anything about him.

344
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,960
- So?
- Huh?

345
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,640
Do they say the item is authentic?

346
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,710
They are depositing the money right now.
Please check.

347
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,040
Excuse me... What about that problem?

348
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,410
Ah, Ajumma, he gave me a condition.

349
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,060
Even if it's right now, he'd like to return to America.

350
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,550
He thinks he will get caught at the airport,
so he wants the guarantee of his safety.

351
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,660
Otherwise he won't give up the item.

352
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,700
Hey. Please pass on what I say.

353
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,950
If it's Je Il Newspaper level, it won't be such a difficult feat

354
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,820
to send me to America...

355
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,020
It will be a bit difficult to pass this on.

356
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,960
- Why is that?
- It is our business policy not to know the identity of our clients.

357
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,730
Is policy important at a time when my life is ebbing away?

358
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:53,580
Your life?

359
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,280
Mr. Client. You have a tendency
to overstate your situation...

360
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,870
I'll eiither be killed or captured without a trace

361
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,320
and rot somewhere my entire life. Does it seem like I'm
playing a word game to you? Huh?!

362
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,790
Ahjumma, you heard, right?

363
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:14,000
You've got new mail (1)

364
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,130
Go Seong Cheol that guy... seems to know that we are Je Il Newspaper.

365
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,450
Is that the case?

366
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,680
What are you going to do?

367
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,540
Does that mean the middle guy has also found out?

368
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,400
What did you say his name was?

369
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,830
It's Healer.

370
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,160
Healer?

371
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:53,640
Request.
Sender: Healer@moebius.com
Receiver: Client1403@daver.com

372
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,020
It's an issue of protecting the elder. There can't be a single mistake.

373
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,620
In everything. Not a single one

374
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,780
should leak out.

375
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,260
Understand that we will go directly to the news conference
site excluding that [story].

376
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,560
Should have come in just 10 seconds earlier! I was naked.

377
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,210
- Kim Moon Ho.
- That expression.

378
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,920
I don't want to hear it. Can't hear it. Can't hear it.

379
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,270
I'm sorry to say this but you can't put in the part about Sin Hyeong Cheol.

380
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,210
Min Jae.

381
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,500
Understand that. We will go right to the news conference site.

382
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,440
I edited Senior Manager Oh's footage already.

383
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,490
It doesn't amount to 3 minutes. It's only 2 minutes 45 seconds long.

384
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,760
Can't you even insert that?
I'm going to go in to a sulk!

385
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,210
I promised, that I would broadcast

386
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,040
Mr. Sin Hyeong Cheol's story. I promised, I'm telling you.

387
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,030
Cut me some slack.

388
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,400
Then let's treat it as editorial comment without the video.

389
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,780
The anchor will ask a question. Did you meet the man
who set himself on fire?

390
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:41,970
Then you answer. You answer exactly like this:

391
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,720
"I did meet. In order to prevent this type of extreme situation from reoccurring,"

392
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,920
"today's labor-management negotiation's settlement
is welcomed."

393
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,660
Then send it to the news conference site. Okay?

394
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,710
It's you who should cut me some slack, Kim Moon Ho.

395
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,310
Oh...

396
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:14,410
Good evening, Everyone.

397
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:18,060
Increase the light a bit more!

398
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,370
ABS Newsweek 7. 1, 2, 1, 2. Yes, I can hear clearly.

399
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,120
Labor-management, labor-management.

400
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,940
- Leave this out.
- I understand.
- Yes.

401
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:43,290
Kim Moon Ho.

402
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,620
Can you hear me?

403
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,280
Bureau Chief has come. I think he came to check up on you, Moon Ho.

404
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,560
You catch my drift, correct?

405
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:58,510
I won't repeat myself, Kim Moon Ho. Don't cause trouble.

406
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,270
Apparently the punks who do that kind of work are called
Errand Boys in that side.

407
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,340
In that side? If you're saying "that side" then which side is that?

408
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Well, they would be the kind of people who can hire errand boys.

409
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,720
Either they have a lot of money or a lot of political power.
You know the side that is high up.

410
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,700
Don't haphaphazardly pass over, but take more care.

411
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:29,770
Anyhow, among all of those [errand boys], the most famous one is called the Healer. Code name Healer.

412
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,480
Apparently he's near legend level in that field.

413
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,460
Just to mention the commission, it can range
from tens of thousands dollars to six-figure.

414
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:40,580
Then it would be impossible for you to pretend to hire
him for a case to meet up with him.

415
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:44,960
You just never know. Especially if you lend me a bit, Daddy.

416
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,000
Then I'll think about [lending you] up to 10,000,000 won,
if you bring a groom-to-be.

417
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,670
Really? Awesome.

418
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:59,240
Honey, greet my dad.
Which one is the most handsome today...?

419
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,370
It's nice to meet you, Father-in-law.

420
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:05,740
Father-in-law can only be after the wedding.

421
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,710
Elder, I love Yeong Sin so much.

422
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,680
So?

423
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,780
So... if you could loan me about 10,000,000 won before hand,

424
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,400
I can use it towards the investment to plan Yeong Sin's
beautiful future...

425
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,910
Then with that investment, you'd meet up with that Healer guy?
So what if you do meet, what then?

426
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,380
Then I'd interview him. I'm the best there is when it comes to interviewing!

427
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,220
Stop plastering all that. It'll be salty!

428
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,350
Dad, but that's not what's important. All the cases that
this Healer guy was hired for

429
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,540
are probably hitting the dead center of all the secret and

430
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,440
corruption of Korea's politics, economy, and society. You see?

431
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,080
I would poke a straw through it and suck it out

432
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,220
and write a book with my perfect writing skill.

433
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:53,570
- Isn't today Friday?
- If so, it'll become a best-seller for 3 months straight.

434
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:57,030
It's past 7, Missy.

435
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,310
Oh why did you only say that now?

436
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,800
Oh, oh, oh. You're dropping stuff everywhe... Hey!

437
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,110
Hey! Yeong Sin! Hey, take your gloves off!

438
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,460
I'm taking them off.

439
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,340
Reporter Kim Moon Ho, I hear that you've met with a person who attempted to set himself on fire.

440
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,920
Yes, I did meet with him.

441
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,350
From what is known, he allegedly selected this action in order

442
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:23,410
to protest against the Sam Han Industry's firing incident. Do you have any comments?

443
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:27,100
I suppose that could be one of the reasons.
"Sam Han Industries labor-management negotiation dramatic settlement - strike called off."

444
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:34,040
But there was decisively more critical reason for why he
decided to take such an extreme action.

445
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,200
This man who is bed-ridden with third degree burns at the hospital said this:

446
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,380
No one would listen to me.

447
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,550
Not a single sentence was written about them
in any of the newspapers.

448
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,650
He says that if he were to do this [extreme act],
perhaps someone would take a look at his story.

449
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,950
What did company side say about this incident?

450
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,640
I'm a so called reporter, yet only after that man reached his
his current situation

451
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,240
did I visit him to interview.

452
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:08,680
Prior to this incident, Sam Han Industry's dismissal incidents

453
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,810
weren't an object of our reporting, isn't that right?

454
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,190
Uhm, reporter Kim Moon Ho, so...

455
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,940
The first reason he came to make the choice

456
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:22,130
to pour kerosene over himself and set himself on fire

457
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,130
was us.

458
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,540
We reporters.

459
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,270
Wow...

460
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,720
This is my first dream.

461
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,340
Becoming this cool and sexy a reporter.

462
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,760
Since I lacked the brain cells to study, I graduated from a somewhat inferior college.

463
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,850
Since my father is extremely upright, I gave up early on
ever having a chance to study abroad to fill my resume.

464
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,540
Since I have absolutely no luck in testing, I failed every single newspaper and broadcasting company's open recruitment.

465
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,420
Still, I'm confident in my grit and passion.

466
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,620
That's why someday I will be able to make it.

467
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,340
Like this cool and sexy

468
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:16,580
legendary reporter whom everyone in the world would acknowledge.

469
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,360
What if... I still can't become one after trying and trying?

470
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,410
I'll worry about it then.

471
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,610
The chicken in the oven should be ready as well. There are dishes placed--

472
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,870
Nevermind, I'll do it. Just take it out.

473
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,530
Yes.

474
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,510
Wow, when did you prepare all of this?

475
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:27,200
It is amazing.

476
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,660
It seems like you prepare more as the years pass by.

477
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,400
My cooking skills are improving with time.

478
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,040
Aren't there too many cookies and cakes for a Gi Il?
 (Gi Il: anniversary for one's death)

479
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,460
I used to not let her eat even when she liked them

480
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,240
because too many sweets can lead to cavities.

481
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,720
Cavities... not a very good reason.

482
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm full of regret. That's why

483
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,750
I try to prepare all this on this day.

484
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,770
Is it okay?

485
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:11,650
I wanted Gil Han to be with us as well.

486
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:15,090
Of course.

487
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,630
Gil Han should be with us.

488
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,590
He is the father after all.

489
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:23,810
Oh the chicken!

490
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,090
Ji An's next favorite food after cookies.

491
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,170
Why isn't Moon Ho here?

492
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,530
He always helped each year.

493
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,310
Who knows?

494
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,390
Will you call him for me?

495
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:41,250
Tell him I'm very disappointed.

496
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,770
Yes.

497
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:03,310
Where are you? Your sister-in-law asked for me to call.

498
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,850
- Moon Ho.
- Yeah.

499
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:09,670
I don't think I can come back.

500
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,470
What are you saying?

501
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:13,570
Did you forget that today is Ji An's anniversary?

502
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,690
I know, but it looks like I can't go.

503
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,950
Take care of Noona.

504
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,990
Are you in trouble at work?

505
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:26,230
I heard you slipped up during a live broadcast.

506
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,070
Hyung, you know everything.

507
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,650
Is it because we all work in the same boat?

508
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:35,870
The information travels fast.

509
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:37,550
Don't stress too much.

510
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:40,470
I can only cover up your mistakes so much.

511
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,170
Take good care of Noona. I'm hanging up.

512
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,370
Moon Ho, no matter what, I am always on your side.

513
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,090
Understand?

514
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:05,490
Yes, did I call too late?

515
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:07,010
How did it go?

516
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,230
I was wondering why you didn't call.

517
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:15,010
No. The DNA results said that those two are not related.

518
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:17,930
Yes, I see.

519
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,870
How many times have we done this? Three?

520
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,850
Who exactly are you looking for?

521
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,170
I'm not sure. Someone I must find.

522
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,490
Another day passed by.

523
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:52,730
To me, every day is like homework.

524
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:00,770
I apologize. I dispatched most employees
of our Double S Guard, but...

525
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:02,270
Forget it.

526
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:06,390
The opposition had so many people!

527
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:09,310
They have intel that we don't have.

528
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:12,690
So we lost it just by a millisecond.

529
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,810
I am sorry.

530
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,010
It was such a little difference!

531
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,890
Is that person

532
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,590
the Healer?

533
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:29,930
- D-do you know?
- Yes, I was originally going to ask for their help.

534
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:34,830
- O-oh. N-no. President, wait, please.
-Good day.

535
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:36,330
H-hey.

536
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,830
Hey.

537
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,010
Healer

538
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,970
11.7 - 11.14, 1980

539
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:32,890
My life is tied to two events in the past.

540
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,470
The years 1980 and 1992.

541
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:43,710
I try to progress and move on,

542
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,530
but on a night like this, I collapse without a fight,

543
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,530
thinking again back to the times in the past.

544
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:00,610
- Hey, Min Ju.
- Min Ju.
(a pun ; "Min Ju" can be a person's name,
but also means "Democracy".)

545
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,510
November 1980
- Are you safe?
- I am back.

546
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,450
November 1980
You the one listening.

547
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,510
Let's record this and spread it

548
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:11,950
- Spread what?
- Our ramblings.

549
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,650
- Why?
- Because they don't allow you to listen.

550
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,530
Now today's talk, what we ramble and you must listen to, is

551
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,130
the merger of all media companies,
conducted by our dear President Jeon Doo Hwan.

552
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,990
The past two months, there have been approximately 1000 journalists fired from their positions.

553
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,530
So explain to me, why they were fired.

554
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,110
Don't be aggressive. If you ask questions like that, you'll be fired.

555
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,050
Fired. Fired!

556
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:47,270
If you look at all the journalists who stood up against press censorship, they were all fired.

557
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:51,730
"The press must maintain freedom of speech."
Those who wrote this resolution were all fired.

558
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,790
Any criticism of the government,

559
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,470
Moon Ho, when did you unbuckle your seat belt?

560
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:00,650
But isn't the press supposed to criticize?

561
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,770
Yes, they should. What would the point be if the media couldn't criticize and discuss issues?

562
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,270
If we can't discuss problems and suspicions, is that even a worthwhile media?

563
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,750
Media? Press? It would just be nonsense!
(Gaesori - dog sound, or nonsense)

564
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,380
The frequency is being caught in this area. I think they must

565
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,800
be broadcasting on the hill of Jangseungbaegi.
(at the South-western area of Seoul)

566
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,710
What are you doing! Go!

567
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:39,110
♫ I won't believe that you mean to say goodbye ♫

568
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:02,150
There is movement on the outside.

569
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,030
I think the police have caught on.

570
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:07,830
We will need to leave now.

571
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:18,950
Get out of the way!

572
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,240
Hey! What is this!

573
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,960
♫ The old saying that one who leaves
can never come back, ♫

574
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,380
♫ I heard it when I was immature ♫
Go! Turn the car around!

575
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,300
♫ My dear love who left Mountain Mansu ♫

576
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,400
♫ If I were to meet her today ♫

577
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,330
♫ With my lips that went through all joys and sorrows ♫

578
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:02,070
♫ I could've told you everything. ♫

579
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:08,740
♫ I've lived without knowing about the world. ♫

580
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:16,670
♫ I've lived without knowing about the world. ♫

581
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,260
♫ The old saying that one will become
indifferent after turning back, ♫

582
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:47,150
♫ How would we have known the true meaning of them? ♫

00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:51,240
♫ I'm like a statue crying ♫

584
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,620
- You there who are listening to this broadcast!
- I mean you! Yeah, you!

585
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,010
Will you convey these words when you see her?

586
00:50:57,010 --> 00:50:59,280
That we are so desperately like this looking for her.

587
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,940
Hey you punk! Where are you, doing exactly what?!

588
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,100
Are you even aware how desperately we're looking for you? Huh?!

589
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,200
- Min Ju. - Min Ju.
- Where are you?<

590
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,800
HERE IT IS!

591
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:20,580
♫ I've lived without knowing about the world. ♫

592
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:25,200
- Dude, your acting just killed!
- When that motorcycle flew like this~

593
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,070
His driving was totally....

594
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:30,890
Neither one of you were playing around for sure.

595
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,660
Hey. Don't mess with that, you punk.

596
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,670
Common. What harm will it do? Hey, Moon Ho.
Take a picture of us, will you?

597
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,260
We shouldn't be leaving stuff like pictures around.
It'll be dangerous.

598
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,810
Danger is our drinking snack!

599
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,260
Go on, Moon Ho. Take a nice one.

600
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,700
- Hey, hey. Stand up. Let's take a picture.
- Hurry, stand up.

601
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,410
- Hey, Moon Sik. Hurry.
- Hurry up.

602
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,500
You bumpkins! Like bush-leaguers.
What photograph!

603
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,520
Aiggo, aigoo. Jeez.

604
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,050
- Hey, smile, huh? Smile.
- Here we go.

605
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:06,740
Cabbage Kimchi! Chamchi (tuna)!

606
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,510
Ji An,

607
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:32,960
I will bake a purple cake for your birthday.

608
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,720
Today we have a pink cake. Do you like it?

609
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:50,460
Gil Han, you are there with our Ji An, right?

610
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,480
You...

611
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,610
have to stay together with Ji An.

612
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:00,890
Then...

613
00:53:01,950 --> 00:53:04,060
you could... to Ji An...

614
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,310
My time depends on the past.

615
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:28,640
Hence, I don't have a future.

616
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,940
Now, if I can find her,

617
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,550
perhaps tomorrow could come to me?

618
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:40,280
The result of the sample you've submitted last didn't match.
Please continue to work on finding her.

619
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:45,390

00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,060
I think a leopard or a wolf could be suitable.

621
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:13,860
Later I'm going to take one of those beasts
to the desert island and raise him.

622
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,010
Ajumma

623
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,100
I have a lot that I need. First, I have to get a yacht,

624
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,410
a power generator, and an ocean water purifier as well.

625
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,250
Why aren't you answering your phone?

626
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,560
I'm eating right now.

627
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:43,230
You know that case of the request to search for a girl?

628
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:46,310
I already found 3 people.

629
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:48,590
He says none of them are her.

630
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:53,570
But, this time, we really found a girl that just might be.

631
00:54:53,570 --> 00:55:01,000
She was apparently adopted 20 years ago, so when we traced
back to the point when she was adopted, it matches exactly.

632
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,180
Whew, this really is a valuable case, you see.

633
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:09,760
Even if it's the wrong girl, if we send over the DNA material,
we get a deposit per incident counted as a case.

634
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,630
This, this kind of case is the real cream!

635
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:17,850
I'm thinking of building a log cabin as well on the desert island.

636
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:22,760
Then I'll have to transport the building material,
so I guess I'll have to buy a yacht on the large side?

637
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:26,270
In order to do that, I have to earn a bit more money.

638
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,380
Just a little more by a lot.

639
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,770
My second dream is to find the biological parents who may be out there.
♫ It's a beautiful feeling. ♫

640
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,420
Aren't you sleeping?
♫ What we've got deep inside. ♫

641
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,220
- I'm going to sleep.
- Is your window closed?
♫ We've got a flame that will last forever. ♫

642
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:49,620
I'm going to close it.
♫ Together you and I ♫

643
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:54,470
♫ Such a rush of emotions. ♫

644
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:59,440
Go to sleep. Aren't you sick of sleeping late then running every morning?
♫There's now way we can push it away.♫

645
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:06,850
I'm going to sleep.Of course my dad is the major nagging evil lord Chae Chi Soo.
♫ They will never tear ♫

646
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,350
♫Still, I'm naturally curious.>
our love apart. Our hearts will never break.

647
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:13,200
What kind of parents were they?
♫ Oh, my love. ♫

648
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,000
Why did they abandon me?
♫ I'm all yours. ♫

649
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:25,250
Well, I don't blame them since I met my current dad as a result
of them abandoning me.

650
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:29,340
I just want to meet them once.

651
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:31,880
I wish I could see them even from afar,

652
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:36,850
the people called my mom and my dad.
♫ and it's burning in your name.♫

653
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:43,220
Then I feel I could be assured that I'm a real person and not an android.
♬ Even through the sands of time ♫

654
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:48,050
♬ My love will always grow and I won't let go ♬

655
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:54,160
My first and second dreams both feel as if
they are further away than 10,000,000 km.

656
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,730
Even if it's rather far-fetched, I believe in them.

657
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:02,090
If you don't give up, the dream comes true,
and if you are fated, you will meet.

658
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,350
So what did you say she looked like?
"Chae Yeong Sin, 3/4/88, 163cm/42kg, prospective reporter.

659
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,090
Name: Chae Yeong Sin, born on 1988.

660
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,600
Does not belong to or is a member of any SNS,
Blog, or Cafe.

661
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:15,040
I don't think she's normal, to be honest.

662
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,760
Bingo.

663
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:19,660
Healer Preview

664
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,170
The chick is unbelievably quick on the uptake, just my luck.

665
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,280
That's my bag, correct? So that makes you a thief.

666
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,490
I think it's the correct girl. This darling client has
made the second request.

667
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,830
Throw in your resignation. Then come to me.
I'll give you a news bureau.

668
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,020
- There's a case I'm chasing after.
- Wouldn't it be neater to take care of them both at the same time?

669
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,850
Hey, Healer. You've become a wanted.

670
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,520
Get out of there right now.

671
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,830
I think I have to stay around this girl a little longer.

672
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:49,200
I believe in things like that; connection, fate... things like that.
