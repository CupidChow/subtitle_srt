Episode 14

2
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,170
You can't go. Boss said not to go anywhere.

3
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,500
Boss, we just can't stop him.

4
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,790
For now, the delivery bike (one of their gangs)
is chasing him, but now what should we do?

5
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
Boss!

6
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,730
So where did that guy go?

7
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,810
Hello, it's Kim Moon Ho.

8
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,040
Do you remember someone named Gi Yeong Jae?

9
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,850
I heard that long ago you knew him well.

10
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,290
He's been pronounced dead. Request an autopsy ASAP.

11
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,170
And, secure all the CCTVs at the station.

12
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:25,630
Especially the one for the third floor, where the interrogation room is located. Check it immediately from last night until 8 am today.

13
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,950
Gyeong Seok, make sure this is done immediately.

14
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,290
Make sure right now. There can be no monkey business within the station.

15
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,430
Excuse me. Only authorized personnel are allowed in this area. That's the way to the morgue ...

16
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,990
Restricted Area

17
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,810
Reporter Kim Moon Ho!

18
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,950
Oh, hello.

19
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,580
I'm Yoon Dong Won, Cyber Crime detective...

20
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,450
We spoke on the phone the other day.

21
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,760
Why did you come here?

22
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,020
Say it isn't so.

23
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:55,210
I remember everything about your prank
like this last time, you know.

24
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,090
So would you stop and get up?

25
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,170
Teacher!

26
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,410
Hey, this is too much.

27
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,080
Stop...

28
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,100
Please stop it.

29
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,050
What is this? Hold on just a moment.

30
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,890
Hey! Hey!

31
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,680
Are you okay?

32
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,150
Are you okay?

33
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,120
People will be coming soon.

34
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,330
Hyung Yeong Jae.

35
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,080
Do you know him?

36
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,650
Yes,

37
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,600
I know.

38
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:55,360
But, how could you know about this
and come here right away?

39
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,980
To me, this man is like family.

40
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,070
You must know when a family member has died.

41
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,840
Hyung...

42
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,070
Now, I'll do it on my own.

43
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,660
Oh, hey, you said Team 3 is in charge of the Gi Yeong Jae case, right?

44
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,940
Tell them that it seems someone
has come by here in the hospital.

45
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,690
I'm not sure if it was because of Gi Yeong Jae,
but in any case, pass this message to that team ...

46
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,050
Hey, listen carefully. Starting today every agent on our team

47
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:17,240
who isn't out on an operation must defend the police cybernet.

48
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,540
A visitor is definitely coming back today or
at the latest sometime tomorrow.

49
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,810
The target (of this visitor) is
Gi Yeong Jae's statements.

50
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,170
We'll quietly lay a trap, wait, and then catch this guy.

51
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,030
On birthdays, you're supposed
to eat seaweed soup.

52
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,690
Seaweed soup on birthdays.

53
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,450
That's common sense.

54
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,250
What about cake?

55
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,800
Brat, cake is made by someone else.

56
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,770
This seaweed soup is going
to be cooked by this teacher himself.

57
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,860
They are not comparable to each other at all!

58
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,500
So, the cake!

59
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,840
Do you even know how to make it (the soup)?

60
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,460
I learned it all from the super market Ahjumma.

61
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,230
Water.

62
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,740
Beef.

63
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,140
And seaweed.

64
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,440
Is it okay not to wash it?

65
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,270
If you boil it, it will all be sterilized.

66
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,640
Damn. Damn!

67
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,210
- What is that?
-Damn!

68
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,990
Ta da. Take a look. Certificate of Pass.

69
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,300
This is proof of passing every subject on the Qualification Examination for College Entrance (Korean GED).

70
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,300
You saw right? Now give it to me.

71
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,620
Has this little s**t really passed that?

72
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,780
Give me the briefcase.

73
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,960
But how hard it was for me to obtain this...
Like this, I can't hopelessly (lose it to you) ...

74
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,600
What is this? Is there really
the secret book of martial art in it?

75
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,590
Didn't you say that my skill would improve exactly three times more once I learn this? If that's not true, see what will happen.

76
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,780
Depending on the person,
there may be some differences.

77
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,500
If someone learns it from a blank slate like you,

78
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,850
its effect can be... quite good. That's possible.

79
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,770
So give it to me. You promised.

80
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,360
Give it to me. Give it to me! Oh really ...

81
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,900
But why are you like this? You can't. No. No.

82
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,530
What is this? "Ajusshi is lonely"... The ladies here ...

83
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,170
You dirty old man!

84
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:25,340
You should preserve stuff that was really hard to get!

85
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,410
Jeez!

86
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,880
Jeong Hoo. Jeong Hoo! Jeong Hoo!

87
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,820
Some woman called me. She was sure you would come here.

88
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,950
She told me to stop you before it was too late. Wait a minute, stay still for a second, Punk!

89
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,710
She said, Jeong Hoo, you would kill that guy.

90
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,930
You wouldn't, right?

91
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,410
Move.

92
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,430
Don't. Don't. Don't.

93
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,780
Because of that guy you'll become a murder? Why would you?

94
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,960
Aish!

95
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,060
Hyung Yeong Jae would've also said this isn't right.

96
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,620
You know that, right?

97
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,470
Fine, so what am I supposed to do?

98
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,380
I'll find a way.

99
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,210
- What we can do.
- What are you talking about?

100
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,890
Tell me now what it is, right now!

101
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,690
You should let me do whatever it is!

102
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,610
So there... there is nothing

103
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,600
I can do, so...

104
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,920
tell me how I'm supposed to be doing anything!

105
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,390
That's how it is for me too. For the past twenty years

106
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,100
it was hard for me too,
because there was nothing I could do.

107
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,950
So,

108
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,800
give me a bit more time.

109
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,730
I'll definitely find a way.

110
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,740
I...

111
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,990
I summoned Teacher.

112
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,370
I summoned the person
who really didn't want to come.

113
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,480
Jeong Hoo.

114
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,290
Making him say what he didn't want to say,

115
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,910
getting angry at him after he told me that,

116
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,460
and because I was too busy being angry,

117
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,850
although he came back after eight years,

118
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,900
I didn't eat a single meal with him.

119
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,930
But

120
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,470
then, you know, that damned old geezer ...

121
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,430
Just cry. It's okay to cry.

122
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,200
So cry, Jeong Hoo.

123
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,020
Damn it.

124
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,500
Damn that nasty old geezer ...

125
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,420
I promise. Those people we see over there,

126
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,070
up to the men who were behind them, I will drag them all out.

127
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,860
I will definitely make them pay for this.

128
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,100
Just trust me.

129
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,270
- How?
- Jeong Hoo.

130
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:59,680
Other than stopping me,

131
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,760
what more can you do?

132
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,440
Oh, Reporter Lee, over there.
Take a photo that way, there.

133
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,340
Wow... That looks really good.

134
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,200
Aigoo, Madam you came.

135
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,740
- How are you? I'm Reporter Lee Myeong Jin from Asia Monthly.
- Welcome.

136
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,920
I'm sorry, but what can I do?

137
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,770
It's time for you to be resting ...

138
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,370
Since he already took a photo of you two,
why don't we take a few more?

139
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,910
Because CEO Kim is famous for your happy marriage,
the legendary lovey-dovey couple.

140
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,770
Please, let us take a few more.

141
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,920
Are you okay?

142
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,790
- Good. yes.
- Shall we take this?
- Yes.

143
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,620
Madam, please smile brightly.

144
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,710
About you running as a candidate
for mayor of Seoul this time,

145
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,580
actually, making that decision must
have been difficult for you.

146
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,890
Kim Ui Chan, the former candidate, resigned from the position in disgrace.

147
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,280
In addition, you don't have any political experience.

148
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,760
Because I have no experience in politics,

149
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,770
I'm dragged to that position as far as I know.

150
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,130
Because of the problem of the prior candidate,

151
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,030
what our party needs to promote the most right now

152
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,130
is something like transparency and reliability, you know.

153
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:48,570
This is also my weakness,

154
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,660
but I am always the same myself inside and out.
(meaning "not two-faced")

155
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,110
I can't hide anything.

156
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,240
Gee, I'm in trouble, aren't I?

157
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,010
He's not picking up?

158
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,150
I thought you were together all night.

159
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,940
That's what I say. He went out to workout in the morning,

160
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,270
but even though I waited to have breakfast together, he didn't come back.

161
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,570
About Park Bong Soo.

162
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,710
If it looks like a frightening situation,
doesn't he have a tendency to run away?

163
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,010
Therefore, last night or early this morning,

164
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,930
he might have seen something terrifying.

165
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,570
- What did I do?
- What cruel thing exactly did you yourself do so that

166
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,620
Park Bong Soo ran away at dawn?

167
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,430
And that he didn't even call?

168
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,620
And that he couldn't even come to work?

169
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,590
Ah, I'm terribly curious, huh?

170
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,270
I'm curious.

171
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,480
- Really ...
- Park Bong Soo is taking a few days off.

172
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm late too. The meeting will be in 30 minutes.

173
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,000
We have to be ready in thirty minutes.

174
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,050
Yes?

175
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,700
I would like to discuss something briefly with you.

176
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,190
- Come in.
- Okay.

177
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,230
Aren't we covering CEO Kim Moon Sik this time?

178
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,580
So?

179
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:09,720
And that is actually to dig up
the dirty side of Kim Moon Sik, right?

180
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,890
- That's right.
- So...

181
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,090
I think I'll need to meet him.

182
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:17,590
Don't you think I should personally meet him
and ask him?

183
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,280
"We think something is fishy about you
because of this and that. Are we correct?" Like that.

184
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,700
- That sounds right.
- The problem is

185
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,710
if he would accept our request for interview.

186
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,000
How about using your influence for me?

187
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,400
He's your brother after all.

188
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,840
- From now on he isn't.
- Pardon?

189
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,110
I've decided.

190
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,170
Kim Moon Sik isn't my brother. From now on.

191
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,880
Ah.

192
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,400
Brothers should get along. It would be nice if ...

193
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,140
I understand. Then, I'll contact his side myself.

194
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,160
You're going to meet Kim Moon Sik?

195
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Actually I

196
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,890
want to meet his wife.

197
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,360
I saw an article from a while ago. I saw this here.

198
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,050
Chairman Kim Moon Sik's relationship with his wife is so good.

199
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:12,450
Here, this person is the wife.

200
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,080
Ah, right. You know already. She's your sister-in-law.

201
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,690
Aigoo, I was confused. Please look at this.

202
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:26,740
Their relationship is no joke.
Seriously, reporters call them things like,

203
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:32,370
well, eternal brother-sister, eternal pure love, legendary lovebirds, stuff like this.

204
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,090
And so?

205
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,930
I know that you think poorly of Chairman Kim Moon Sik.

206
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:43,980
I also know that you think a person like him
shouldn't become the mayor of Seoul.

207
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,930
Well, since you are close to him you probably know better. But,

208
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:55,040
this is just my own small feeling and my own way of thinking.

209
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,190
If he is someone who loves just one woman for his whole life like this,

210
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:06,220
I keep thinking that maybe he isn't that bad.

211
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,480
My thinking might be biased, so you want to go meet him personally and then judge him?

212
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,840
Yes. Sorry.

213
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,780
I want to meet his wife once.

214
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,830
Let me think about it.

215
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,740
Thank you. Ah, then, I'll go.

216
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,430
Did Park Bong Soo call you about not coming?

217
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,080
He's sick.

218
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,010
Where is he sick? Was he injured?

219
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:43,000
Maybe a cold?

220
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,870
Ah, yes.

221
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,680
Park Bong Soo, have you caught a cold? Are you sick?

222
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,270
Can't you call? Then even a message...

223
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,310
Bong Soo,

224
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:02,650
Hey, Jeong Chi Beom (meaning "political prisoner").
I'll awaken my superpowers that have slept for a while.

225
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,430
Cheer for me from there.

226
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:13,610
Yoon Dong Won, are you waiting?

227
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:22,280
Hey! How did it go?

228
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,320
It seems someone has planted
a backdoor to our police net.

229
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,830
Move.

230
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,130
- What is the situation?
- It is very strange. The attacks are coming derivatively at once. It's the first time I've seen this.

231
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,930
I've seen many like this. Coming and going just like this.

232
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:41,630
Disappearing like a ghost, then unpredictably suddenly appearing again.

233
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,620
See this? Look at this!

234
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,660
Like this, exactly like this.

235
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,690
Exactly like this, if I catch you dozing off like this,
you're dead meat.

236
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,560
The guys we've chased for the last four months are inside.

237
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,160
We'll attack once the warrant is issued,

238
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,060
and we'll have to make sure they don't touch their computers.

239
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,200
Ah that really, really hurt!

240
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,040
Like this punk last time at the Sewoon Electronics Plaza,
if your mind is wandering, vacillating back and forth,

241
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,160
and you wait until they delete all their files,
would it be alright or not?

242
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,480
Fighting.

243
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,310
As soon as we open the front door, all of you should run.
No matter what, you must first secure their computers.

244
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:47,310
But, when will that damn warrant come?

245
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,840
What time is it now?

246
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,400
It's just really late...

247
00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:00,030
Why does this kid never learn? You get caught every time.

248
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,730
Today I really can't. It will be a problem if I'm not here.

249
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,410
My team mates are still very young,
I can't just leave it to them.

250
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,020
- It should be over soon. As soon as it's done ...
- Are you still a mother?!

251
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,990
Jo Min Ja, you're not going to come here immediately?

252
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:42,360
I understand. I'm going. I'm going now.

253
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,620
Is your son really sick? How old is he?

254
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,070
Four years old.

255
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,920
What's going on with a four year old that he has so many operations ...

256
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,950
Just go to the hospital.

257
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:09,190
Well here, we'll manage somehow.

258
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,940
The warrant came.

259
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,640
Let's go.

260
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,310
He came! He fell into our trap!

261
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:24,010
- Catch him!
- Yes!

262
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,460
It's a virus!

263
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,950
Are you a mother?

264
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,590
How are you a mother?

265
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:08,130
If you were a mother, if you were a mother...!

266
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:14,110
You should have been at his side when he died!

267
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,870
I know you guys worked hard, but it's
an order from the higher-up. Cover it up.

268
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,910
Cleanly delete the data you confiscated.

269
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,770
Are you listening to me? You know not a single thing can remain, right?

270
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,960
I got the testimony recording from your teacher.

271
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I watched it first. No matter how I look at it, it's not a message to the detectives, but to you.

272
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,510
I started working as the Healer a year after I was released.

273
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,510
The name Healer is from the magazine
that I had made with my college friends.

274
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,730
It's cool. Healer.

275
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,680
What's the most recent assignment you did?

276
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,040
You know Je Il Newspaper's CEO Kim Moon Sik, right?
He asked me.

277
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,060
My work is, I do everything for a lot of money.

278
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,990
Ethics, justice, I don't think about such things.

279
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,580
Ah... I should have lived thinking about it a bit more.

280
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:52,550
This is really like a signboard. If you don't know where you should go,

281
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:57,710
that kind of signboard. A cliff on that side, a construction site on the other.

282
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:01,620
Go back here.

283
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,190
Do you know Go Seong Cheol? He's from L.A.

284
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,770
Did you kill him? After you got a request?

285
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,440
I don't accept work like that.

286
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,200
If someone kills another person, he's not a human being anymore.

287
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,310
No matter how (I've lived),
I should die as a human being.

288
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:24,530
So that I can meet the people I wanted to meet again.

289
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:29,790
The people who left first.
I have one regret.

290
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,440
I should have stopped already.

291
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,620
I should've stopped this,
and had two kids with a woman I love,

292
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:44,270
one dog, two cats, three goldfish,

293
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,900
and lived while raising them.

294
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:51,010
I should've done that, huh?

295
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:57,480
Why?

296
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,970
After that there's nothing to watch...

297
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,560
- Why...
- You heard everything you were
supposed to, your teacher's will.

298
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,900
The woman you love, two kids, dog, cats, even a carp.

299
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,980
Should I make another alias for you?

300
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,270
Or shall I give Park Bong Soo proper roots?

301
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:19,110
I'll do it for you, as your severance pay.

302
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,730
- It's too late.
- What is?

303
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,810
She...

304
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,590
knows it all. Who I am.

305
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,670
I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait...

306
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,050
What are you talking about?
What does Chae Yeong Sin know?

307
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,450
That you are Healer? She knows everything,
and yet she's doing nothing?

308
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,850
She doesn't know everything.

309
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,150
She wouldn't know. If she's beside me, she will be hurt.

310
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,810
Even as far as being killed.

311
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,530
What are you saying now?

312
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:10,110
There's nothing I can do.
I'm going to get some sleep.

313
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,770
Okay. Rest. But then, Chae Yeong Sin really ...

314
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,070
- Ajumma.
- What?

315
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,850
No, just wanted to call you.

316
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,300
It should be a 10-minute item,
so with just an interview, it won't work at all.

317
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,450
Find some more video data.

318
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,770
When did you say the sponsor's night would be?

319
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,450
Sorry.

320
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,290
Yes, you must be, I guess.

321
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,090
Did you... write a letter of apology?

322
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,170
I wrote it. Fortunately, I could save my position.

323
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:48,230
Of course, no one is as capable as you
in this station. That's right!

324
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,910
-I'm sorry.
-You didn't come here just to say you're sorry ...

325
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,330
-Why did you come?
- It's true. I came to apologize.

326
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,080
That's okay. I know very well what kind of man you are.

327
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,360
- The problem is that sometimes I forget that.
- Was I that awful?

328
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,800
I asked why you came.

329
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:15,360
There was one hyung whom I was close to
when I was young ... He died recently.

330
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,880
- So?
- I think someone I know killed him.

331
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,340
Are you giving me some kind of tip?

332
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,800
There was also a child whom I was close to when I was young.

333
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,260
I've lost contact with him. If we count today,
it has been three days.

334
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,380
Kim Moon Ho.

335
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,890
If you look at the contact list in the phone,
there are groups, right?

336
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:44,270
Work, family, friends, etc.
But do you know that?

337
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,770
There is only one name in my group of friends. That's you, Kang Min Jae.

338
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,250
What are you doing now?

339
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,350
So I came to talk to my friend. There is nowhere else I can talk.

340
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,290
Do I seem lonely and pathetic?

341
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,190
You're not the type of person
who looks for a friend when lonely.

342
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:06,350
- Isn't that mean of you?
- You're scared.

343
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:11,610
- Honestly, you're very timid.
- Me?

344
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:17,310
Others might say you are brave,
but... no.

345
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,090
You always fight just to the extent of not getting injured.

346
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:26,770
If there is a really frightening opponent, you run away in advance... While making plausible excuses.

347
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,090
Do I?

348
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,970
So you have survived up to today.

349
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,670
You don't have to be embarrassed.

350
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:38,830
We're all like that.

351
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,990
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

352
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,690
Can you tell me where this address is?

353
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,690
There is no such address. I've been doing
real estate here for more than twenty years.

354
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,150
Miss Yeong Sin!
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

355
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,570
Because of the Kim Moon Sik Special,
we are now in a full scale war at Someday. 
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie

356
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:10,900
We're dying because of manpower shortage.
Then what are you doing, Bong Soo?
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

357
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:15,000
Call in sick if you are sick. If you don't like me, phone and say you don't like me.
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

358
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,290
Around 1997, the situation was pretty dire for Je Il newspaper, wasn't it?

359
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:23,100
At the time its owner was trying to sell a newspaper.
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

360
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,770
Today makes four days, Mr. Park Bong Soo.
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

361
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:32,570
You can't think you would be okay after not coming to work without any call for many days, you know?

362
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,650
You're already late. You've already missed the last opportunity for begging for my forgiveness.

363
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,450
Now, even if you come to me and beg for your life,
everything is so over, you know?

364
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:44,350
It's the end! The end! The end!
♫ I can't even return ♫

365
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,730
♬ to the time before loving you ♬

366
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:53,270
It's Chae Yeong Sin.
♬ So I'm returning to you ♬

367
00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:00,290
Today is the fifth day... perhaps
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

368
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:05,470
did I possibly do something wrong?
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

369
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,370
Because I said I will wait, can't you come?
♫ Even if you can't be mine, even I can't say it ♫

370
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,250
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

371
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:21,110
Should I just have said I won't wait, and said not to worry?
♫ I will always be looking at you ♫

372
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,800
♬ It's you. ♬

373
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,290
♬ The more bruised my heart is the more I long for someone. ♬

374
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,010
Then can I take back those words?
♬ The more bruised my heart is the more I long for someone. ♬

375
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:33,790
♬ It's you. ♬

376
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,010
This weekend there will be a talk show on ABS
with Kim Moon Sik. It will be a live broadcast.

377
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,610
We will receive it and make a delayed spike broadcast.

378
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,970
If there is a delayed spike broadcast ...

379
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,010
While being interviewed, Kim Moon Sik
will answer to some questions, won't he?

380
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,570
"What do you like?"
"I like kimchi jjigae (kimchi stew)."

381
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:01,730
Then, we will make a broadcast about that in 10 minutes.

382
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,870
"Does Kim Moon Sik really like kimchi jjigae?
Is his word really true?"

383
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:11,290
Ah, to do that, we should find out what kind of conversation they will have during the public broadcast, though...

384
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:16,330
We should. One advantage we have is that
they wouldn't make a talk show without a script.

385
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:19,410
Because they will ask only the prepared questions,
and he will give only the prepared answers.

386
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,670
So, so how will we manage to get their questions...?

387
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,650
- Jong Soo.
- Yes?

388
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:30,530
You're already being a spy,
so won't you become a double agent?

389
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:34,330
Well, Sunbae... Three months from now,
I will be specially hired by Je Il Newspaper,

390
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,670
as a Deputy Department Head, you know...

391
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,650
So, you don't want to do it?

392
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,530
All I need to do is to bring the script for the talk show, right?

393
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,750
That's right!

394
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,990
But where is Chae Yeong Sin?

395
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,370
Aigoo.

396
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:59,570
Why are you so out of it?

397
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,990
My mind is clear now.

398
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,430
Sorry. Did you have the meeting?

399
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,490
Give me your phone.

400
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,510
From now on, I won't make personal phone calls
during work hours. Really, I mean it...

401
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,190
Save this number.

402
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:36,150
The name is Choi Myeong Hee,

403
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,510
Kim Moon Sik's wife.

404
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,970
Thank you.

405
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,550
You call her yourself and ask
her permission for the interview.

406
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,530
I understand.

407
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,570
But...

408
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,790
If it looks like it won't work even if I try hard...

409
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,030
- can I use your name, Sunbae?
-Yes.

410
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,890
Okay! Then, I will call her right now.

411
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,150
Hello?

412
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,840
Hello, I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin from Someday News.

413
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:35,900
May I speak to Choi Myeong Hee?

414
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,050
I'm Choi Myeong Hee.

415
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,910
Hello, I'm sorry to suddenly call you like this.

416
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,840
How did you get this phone number?

417
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,270
Uh... Sunbae Kim Moon Ho told me.

418
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,830
He's my boss.

419
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:56,440
My Moon Ho is a boss... not a station reporter?

420
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,980
It has been a while since he's come to Someday News.

421
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,500
Didn't you know?

422
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,650
I didn't know.

423
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,890
Was it a secret? What to do...

424
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,930
Did Moon Ho tell you to call this number?

425
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:17,830
Actually, I pestered him a lot to let me interview you.

426
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,710
That's weird. He knows I don't meet people...

427
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:28,380
I'm asking you. I really have to meet you and ask you some things.

428
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,000
This is because of my husband's impending candidacy for Mayor, right?

429
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,710
He could be the next mayor of Seoul.

430
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,030
That is really a hugely important position.

431
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:44,380
He could be in-charge of the lives living and the like of more than ten million people.

432
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,840
That's why I wanted to know.

433
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,820
I wanted to know the thoughts of the person closest to candidate Kim Moon Sik.

434
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,790
- Your voice...
- Huh?

435
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,440
is pleasing to the ears.

436
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,210
Me?

437
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,550
Well, if you see me in person,

438
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,690
people say my looks are better than my voice...

439
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,850
It was a joke.

440
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,680
Will you please give me some time to think it over?

441
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,160
Oh of course!

442
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,480
If I make up my mind, I can just call this number, right?

443
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,250
Yes, my name is Chae Yeong Sin from Someday News.

444
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:24,220
I will contact you again through a text message.

445
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,820
Okay, I'll call you.

446
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:30,820
Okay, I'll wait for your call. Thank you.

447
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,640
Did you find it?

448
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,360
I found it, but

449
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,530
this car looks like it hasn't been used for a month.

450
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,480
The motorbike has not been used in a while as well.

451
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,620
The dust accumulated is no joke.

452
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,150
Is there another place besides this one?

453
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,990
That car was the last car that rascal used.

454
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,750
So this means he hasn't moved since then.

455
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,490
He's just been in his house all this time then.

456
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,130
Just tell me where hyung's house is. I'll go find him there.

457
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,830
Even if you go, you won't find it.

458
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,210
Why?

459
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:48,120
Even if you go, if he doesn't open for you, you won't be able to get in. His place is like that.

460
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,560
Excuse me, Customer?

461
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,490
We're not opened yet. We'll open in 30 minutes.

462
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,770
Do it. Open.

463
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,380
Right now. Immediately.

464
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,890
Okay.

465
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,350
What would you like?

466
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,190
Are there no women?

467
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,040
I don't make orders to a man.

468
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:41,650
Ahjusshi, a glass of milk, please.

469
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,370
Looks like there are women here.

470
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,800
Agassi? Please take my order.

471
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,010
Huh?

472
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,190
Don't do it. Don't do it.

473
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:56,350
That woman definitely knew about her husband's cheating ways last night,

474
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,890
so she's looking for an easy woman to act bossy on--

475
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:01,080
Agassi! My order!

476
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,490
Seriously, so much bad luck in the morning!

477
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,370
Hold it in. Hold it. I'll do it.

478
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:09,040
I just have to take her order, right? I'll do it.

479
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,740
She looks like her husband cheated on her!

480
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,880
What would you like?

481
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,160
If you're going to have breakfast, we have a breakfast set here. If not...

482
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,190
Sit in front of me.

483
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,200
I, to be honest, don't work here.

484
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,110
In front of me.

485
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,290
You don't remember my voice?

486
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,800
Miss Chae Yeong Sin, you know Mr. Park Bong Soo, right?

487
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,180
Bong Soo's mother?

488
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,010
I am absolutely not a mother.

489
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:11,140
Bong Soo has been absent from the office for the past few days, and I can't contact him.

490
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,750
Give me your phone.

491
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:15,280
My phone?

492
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,030
Here.

493
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:18,800
Is Bong Soo hurt?

494
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,420
Or did he go overseas?

495
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,300
These days, there is the roaming service which still makes you reachable even if you go out of the country...

496
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:28,580
But what are you doing?

497
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,860
That kid hasn't moved for the past 6 days.

498
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,070
I looked into the nearby supermarket and food delivery stores.

499
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:41,060
There's been no purchase of food, much less water, during this time.

500
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:45,180
Even if I go find him, I have no way of getting in.

501
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:51,250
There's one way left. To have him open his door and come out.

502
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:04,470
The words I said so far, how much do you understand?

503
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:09,240
Is he okay?

504
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,820
Is he not okay?

505
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,210
Where is he? Please tell me.

506
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,660
Where?! Please!

507
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,200
I had to see those eyes.

508
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,870
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

509
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:40,050
♬ when there are so many words I want to say. ♬

510
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,130
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

511
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:47,700
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

512
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,620
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

513
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:00,570
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

514
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:07,020
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

515
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,790
♬ Even if I can't touch you ♬

516
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,440
♬ Even if I can't hug you ♬

517
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,260
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

518
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:21,160
♬ I will always be looking. ♬

519
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:24,570
♬ It's you. ♬

520
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:34,040
♬ Meeting you was fate. ♬

521
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,970
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine. ♬

522
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,160
♬ As I can't go back  ♬

523
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,700
♬ to the time before loving you ♬

524
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,710
♬ I am returning to you ♬

525
00:48:53,710 --> 00:49:00,550
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

526
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:07,030
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

527
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,780
♬ Even if I can't touch you ♬

528
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,440
♬ Even if I can't hug you ♬

529
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:14,290
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

530
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:20,980
♬ I will always be looking. ♬

531
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:22,880
♬ It's you. ♬

532
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,040
♬ The more bruised my heart is the more I long for someone. ♬

533
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,060
♬ It's you. ♬

534
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:48,320
Bong Soo. Park Bong Soo.

535
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:51,720
Is anybody there?

536
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,510
Dispensary

537
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,240
Is anyone there?

538
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,900
Bong Soo.

539
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,510
Bong Soo.

540
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,930
What kind of sleep is this?

541
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,620
Open you eyes, huh?

542
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:48,460
This is not good. Let's go to the hospital.

543
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,110
I'll take you.

544
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:01,920
Sorry, I called the wrong number.

545
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,160
Bong Soo, I came.

546
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:17,940
Wow, awesome.

547
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:29,180
I'm dreaming of you...

548
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,670
Are you hurt?

549
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:36,270
Are you really sick?

550
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:40,460
Your hand is really cold...

551
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,170
It's cold.

552
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:48,100
I got it.

553
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,640
Is it a little warmer now?

554
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:45,290
Hey, why are you getting up?

555
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:48,260
I made egg porridge.

556
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,490
Have a taste.

557
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,250
What kind of dream is like this?

558
00:53:57,850 --> 00:54:01,700
How did you get in here? Who let you in? When?

559
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,470
Want to taste a bit? Mmh?

560
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,000
I took this month's leave at the company,

561
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,790
and told my father in advance. So...

562
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:22,710
I'm going to stay here until tomorrow at the earliest.

563
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:26,100
Even if you don't like it, I'll make you eat some of my porridge.

564
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,960
So, how does it taste?

565
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,690
Salty? Bland?

566
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,190
Chae Yeong Sin.

567
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,190
Ah, I needed some comfortable clothes, that's why I took some of yours. Please be understanding.

568
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:42,670
I don't know how you got in here,

569
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:48,390
but you shouldn't be here.

570
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:51,090
So leave.

571
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:56,470
And forget this place. Don't come again.

572
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:58,780
Leave.

573
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:04,090
Why? Do I have to

574
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:05,670
show you the way out?

575
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,630
Is that the real you?

576
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,090
The way you talk right now...

577
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:14,580
Is that the real you?

578
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,530
Park Bong Soo wouldn't say that.

579
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:22,950
You're a little scary.

580
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:26,200
Why don't you understand?

581
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:30,620
It took me all day to come to you.

582
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,040
So it's night now. Very dark.

583
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,370
So let me be here until the sun rises tomorrow.

584
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:42,230
If you tell me to leave then again, I'll leave.

585
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,260
It's salty. I'll have to put in more water.

586
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,010
I know I have to soak the dried pollack in water.

587
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,160
But how long do I have to soak it?

588
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:52,940
No, this is not the full one. In pieces.

589
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,120
The used water after washing rice? I threw it away.

590
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:01,320
Dad, I'll call you again later. I'll hang up.

591
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:50,490
You come to my house and sleep there any time you like!

592
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,920
I'm only staying for a day, this is unfair! You can't be like this!

593
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,930
I'm not leaving. I'm not.

594
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:08,890
Why are you not scared?

595
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:11,170
I'm not scared of you.

596
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:13,660
Don't you know who I am?

597
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,760
I'm hiding so much from you, but you...

598
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,030
You don't even have the slightest idea, do you?

599
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,940
I don't care.

600
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,800
Are you an idiot?

601
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,440
Don't make me leave.

602
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,780
If you make me leave, you'll cry your whole life.

603
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,590
I...

604
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,580
could get you hurt.

605
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,250
No.

606
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:49,410
You would never hurt me. Ever.

607
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,710
Don't make me leave.

608
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:21,670
Don't do it.

609
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,150
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

610
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:36,650
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

611
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,650
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

612
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:46,180
♬ Together you and I ♬

613
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:50,660
♬ Promise me this forever ♬

614
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:55,390
♬ We'll always stay this way ♬

615
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:59,240
♬ We can start at the end of time ♬

616
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:04,080
♬ And do it all again ♬

617
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:08,790
♬ Oh my love ♬

618
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:12,620
♬ I'm all yours ♬

619
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,280
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

620
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,820
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

621
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:26,900
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

622
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:32,170
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

623
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,010
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

624
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:40,100
♬ My love will always grow ♬

625
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:44,830
