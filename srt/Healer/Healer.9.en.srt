2
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:29,660
♬ Who are you looking at? ♬

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,670
♬ What are you thinking of? ♬

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,520
♬ I often just watch you from your side ♬

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,960
♬ You probably don't know ♬

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,490
♬ Your back feels sad ♬

7
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,790
Ji An! Ji An!

8
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,860
♬ When you turn around ♬

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,840
Ji An! Ji An!
♬ I want to spread my arms ♬

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,960
Are you okay?
♬ and hug you ♬

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,840
Are you okay?
♬ Don't go, I want to hold onto you ♬

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,000
Answer me!
♬ Don't know why ♬

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,630
Sunbae is...
♬ my eyes only look for you ♬

14
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,750
Yes, it's me. Look at me.
♬ my eyes only look for you ♬

15
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,600
You told me to come to the rooftop

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,180
so I tried to get to the rooftop.
♬ Why it hurts while looking at you ♬

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,140
The elevator was broken.
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy ♬

18
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,220
I really thought I would fall to my death.
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy ♬

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,690
That... that person.

20
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,640
That person appeared and saved me.

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,040
I didn't see his face.

22
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,670
That person, it's that person, Healer, that person. You know?

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,550
Yes.
♬ The words 'I love you' that I cannot bear to say ♬

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,180
♬ I'm scared that my eyes ♬

25
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,960
Stop, it's ok.
♬ would tell everything ♬

26
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,010
That person could have died because of me.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:03,040
Died...

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,310
♬ Why it hurts while looking at you ♬

29
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,830
Can you walk?

30
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,690
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy ♬

31
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,930
Let's go.
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy ♬

32
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,050
Come with me.

33
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,810
♬ I don't wanna let you go ♬

34
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,340
What?

35
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,130
Chae Yeong Sin.

36
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,370
My, my phone.

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,510
What?

38
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,210
My phone, that was my mom's.

39
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,730
I can't lose it.

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,030
It must be there, in the elevator that fell down.

41
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,590
Let's go first. About that, later.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,670
Let's go.

43
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,360
The elevator was definitely set up by someone.

44
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Seeing as they made it break and fall at that time, they must have been nearby.

45
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,600
That bastard... He really intended to kill
Chae Yeong Sin while watching her.

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,030
Alright, I'll look through all the CCTVs in the area.

47
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,030
Oh and also track where Kim Moon Ho is going right now.

48
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,560
You're asking me to track where he's going with Chae Yeong Sin, right?

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,980
Okay. I have my "babies" planted in Kim Moon Ho's phone
so that won't be a problem.

50
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,840
But Healer?

51
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,540
- Yes, why?
- What are you going to do then?

52
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,110
Oh, me.

53
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,730
I have something to find.

54
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,770
What was that sound? Healer?

55
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,210
Healer?

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,680
Hello?

57
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,300
Yes. I...

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,450
fell down.

59
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,890
Fell down? You?

60
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,450
The boy who doesn't fall down even if someone throws him fell down on his own?

61
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,690
And, why are your vitals like this? Your heartbeat is...

62
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,740
Chae Yeong Sin.

63
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,050
Do you know how to take a pulse?

64
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,020
There's someone ill in my family, so I've learned a bit.

65
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,010
Are you ok?

66
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,510
I'm ok.

67
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,460
It's ok if we don't go to the hospital?

68
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm not hurt.

69
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,820
It looked like you were having trouble breathing back there.

70
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:35,270
Just for a moment. I was surprised.

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,540
Now I'm alright.

72
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:40,640
Alright.

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,640
Did you meet the informant? Is it okay if we leave without meeting him?

74
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,460
Did I say that over the phone? That we had to meet the informant?

75
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,260
You told me to hurry and come because we had to meet an informant for Kim Ui Chan.

76
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,180
And?

77
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,780
I might be having my location tracked, so I should turn off my phone... that's what you said.

78
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,760
- That wasn't me.
- What?

79
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,510
Somebody used my voice to call. To call you.

80
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,680
The voice sounded completely the same.

81
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,290
Sorry.

82
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,930
- About what?
- It was a threat directed at me, but you were used.

83
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,650
So, someone pretended to be you and called me.

84
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:29,430
And broke the elevator on purpose so that I...

85
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,090
No way.

86
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,970
Let's go to my house. Your house is dangerous.

87
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,830
It's a single house, isn't it?
Anyone could get in any time.

88
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,770
How do you know my house?

89
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:48,180
Didn't I tell you? I did background investigations.

90
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,570
Wow.

91
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,050
Is this perhaps a penthouse?

92
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,900
So people do live in places like this.

93
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,730
Oh, look at the view.

94
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,420
If someone sees this all the time, don't they go crazy?

95
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,700
You stayed up all night yesterday, didn't you?

96
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,100
I dozed off for about an hour and a half.

97
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,370
And forty minutes ago you almost died.

98
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,990
Ah, yes.

99
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,380
But is your personality good or are you just dense?

100
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,160
The truth is, I want to sing a song.

101
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,050
But I'm holding it in.

102
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,750
You know how to drink alcohol, right?

103
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,860
I'll put a little in it.

104
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,260
And, I have something I want to ask.

105
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,690
But I'm holding it in.

106
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,120
Who sent you a warning, and why?

107
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,440
And what does it mean that they used me for it?

108
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,220
And earlier, you called me by a different name.

109
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,310
Was it Ji Eun?

110
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,550
Did I do that?

111
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,830
Yes, you did.

112
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,570
Ji Yeon or something...
Anyway, you called me with that name.

113
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,370
It's Ji An.

114
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,970
Oh Ji An.

115
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,030
She was a little girl I knew. I was in a hurry, so I made a mistake.

116
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,890
Drink. It's going to help you sleep.

117
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,610
Please tell me what you know. I have to know it.
I really nearly died!

118
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,560
Think later, sleep first.

119
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,450
If it's like that, I'll return home.

120
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,890
I told you, your house is dangerous.

121
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,900
It's going to be alright.

122
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,400
Because that person, Healer, will protect me.

123
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,910
Even in the elevator that was falling down,
he saved me, so--

124
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,640
You said you'd researched the Healer,

125
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,700
so you must know that he's a night errand boy.

126
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,010
He has one standard: money. If there's someone who offers him more money than I did tomorrow, he'll go to their side.

127
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,810
He has no morals or sense of justice. That's also why he can do that job.

128
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,700
Don't trust him.

129
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,410
But still...

130
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,130
You have a slight fever right now.

131
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,550
Sleep a bit.

132
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,190
- Sunbae, I...
- Please do that.

133
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,560
If not, I'll be too worried to leave.

134
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,170
I have somewhere I need to go right now.

135
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,470
Sleep well.

136
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,220
If you're listening, I want to tell you this.

137
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,650
Thank you

138
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,410
for protecting that child today.

139
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,310
Should I call it a payment for a dangerous job,

140
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,440
or a sign of gratitude.

141
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,170
I'm planning on depositing enough.

142
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,850
Also, let me request one thing.

143
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,080
If you get an order from the other side, not from me,

144
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,350
so...

145
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,000
if you get to stand on the opposite side,

146
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,600
then I hope you would let me know in advance.

147
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,290
Since I've been your regular client,

148
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,350
you'll do at least that much, right?

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,780
Trust. Trust at least once.

150
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,100
Then you'll be able to trust a lot more things.

151
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,250
A man who used to be a stranger back then,

152
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,530
Father, said this.

153
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,390
It's because you don't know,

154
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:31,780
but once you get to know me I'm a tin robot.

155
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,750
If you don't like me... th-then here. Do you see this?

156
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,960
You see the mole here, right?

157
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,310
If you don't like me, then just press here.

158
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,520
Then I'll start moving like this, and if you press it,

159
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,530
I'll turn out like this. I won't be able to budge at all.

160
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,780
I can't move. You want to try it? Here, try.

161
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,190
Then, you'll be able to trust my words.

162
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,690
It's no use.

163
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,760
Whenever the child sees a hole, she crawls into it

164
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,390
and doesn't come out for the whole day.

165
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,140
Does she even understand what I'm saying?

166
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,080
She listens well, but it's just that she can't talk.

167
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,050
Anyway, I also haven't seen her face properly.

168
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,460
If I leave the food out here,

169
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,780
she comes out when no ones out, eats it quickly, and goes back into hiding.

170
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,110
Then, where does she sleep?

171
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,170
That's the problem. What would happen when it gets deep into winter?

172
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:24,100
When we grab her by force and put her in her room,

173
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
how fast she is...

174
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,140
She runs out like a squirrel and hides again like this.

175
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,690
It's not that I don't understand her.

176
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,840
As you've heard, when she came here,

177
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,090
we really couldn't look at her
(because of her condition).

178
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,490
She had broken bones and bruises all over her body.

179
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,000
Lee Jung Sun and Han Young Ae (famous singers in 70's-80's),
these people were no joke,

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,350
but on top of that, another person was added.

181
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,370
That person is Kim Hyun Shik. Do you know him, or not?

182
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,760
You can't not know who he is.

Did the whole world become trustworthy
after I met my dad? Of course it didn't.

195
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,500
As someone always stabbed in the back if I became careless,

196
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,980
and if I opened up my heart,
someone came in and left a wound.

197
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,550
But, it was still okay.

198
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,900
If there was one person I could trust while living

199
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,770
even if I got stabbed in the back,
that didn't hurt me too much.

200
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,330
I was like that.

201
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,760
So, now instead of suspecting someone

202
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,410
it's easier to trust them.

203
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,890
Let's go.

Moon Ho.

211
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,190
-Go in, Noona.
-What exactly is the problem?

212
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,840
I have something to talk with Hyung about. I wish you won't hear it. So up to here, don't come any further.

213
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,070
What are you doing?

214
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,340
In your words, Hyung, what are YOU doing?

215
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,160
What is it?

216
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,860
Did you decide not to be human anymore? Look at me in the eyes and speak, in my eyes.

217
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,820
If you're not human anymore, then, what are you?

218
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,190
Speak so I can understand.

219
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,650
Did you make him do it this time again?
You usually don't get blood on your hands.

220
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,450
Do you know what he's talking about?

221
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,540
You shouldn't have touched Ji An.

222
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:50,130
You decided to end everything and did that, right?

223
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,310
Let's do it. Let's end everything today.

224
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,260
Did you... just say Ji An?

225
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,140
I can understand why you said a child who wasn't dead was dead.

226
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,960
You did it in order to save Noona who didn't want to live anymore, but...

227
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,140
Are you saying Ji An is alive? You found her?

228
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,530
Is that why you came at me and...

229
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,500
What exactly are you thinking right now?

230
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,640
Do you think I did something to her...

231
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,280
Stop it, because I think I'm going to vomit.

232
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,050
I didn't know. It's the truth. I didn't know.

233
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,020
If it's not you,

234
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,940
then is it that Elder that you serve?

235
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,100
It was a message that person was sending me.

236
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,290
-Moon Ho.
-Listen carefully.

237
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:05,180
Whoever that is, if he lays even a finger on Ji An again,

238
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,450
then Noona Myeong Hee will be the first to find out.

239
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,460
That's what you're scared of most, right? That Noona will find out the truth.

240
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,130
You're crossing the line right now.

241
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,950
You threaten me by using Myeong Hee?

242
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,430
There's no choice. I also love Noona Myeong Hee.

243
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,280
The noona whom I love

244
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,610
is living unaware in the same house as the guy who put her daughter into danger.

245
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:44,450
You want me to just watch?

246
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,230
I can't do that.

247
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,950
Did you brothers go at it again?

248
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,080
What's up with your face? Did you eat dinner?

249
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,890
Drink this first.

250
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,400
You look like someone who came back after being lost in a desert for a week. Your face is dry.

251
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,620
What are you doing? Oh, my arm hurts.

252
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,650
I made some stew; I'll heat it up for you. Wait a bit.

253
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,130
Noona.

254
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,750
Why?

255
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,490
I'm sorry, Noona.

256
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,480
For what?

257
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,930
Moon Ho, you can cry.

258
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,880
You can cry in front of me.

259
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,900
I'll make sure no one sees.

260
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,700
It's okay.

261
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,650
No.

262
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,880
It's not okay, Noona.

263
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,990
That's why it's okay.

264
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,650
Look at him. It seems he's really sad.

265
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:41,340
I don't know what it is, but everything's going to get better.

266
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,160
Trust me.

267
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,400
Moon Ho.

268
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,500
Tell me.

269
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,500
What is it?

270
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,410
The Elder ordered it.

271
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,820
What exactly was that order?

272
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,060
That order...

273
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,430
what were you supposed to do after finding that child?

274
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,680
So that I wouldn't know.

275
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,490
What did you do?!

276
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,570
That...

277
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,430
This is Healer Headquarters! This is Healer Headquarters!

278
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:03,420
I'm letting you know the time you have before you hand over the real killer of Go Seong Cheol to the police.

279
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,980
Also, if you don't complete the mission,

280
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,990
then I'll tell the broadcast stations
which will air "the video file of the issue".

281
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,540
- Secretary Oh.
- During prime news time of the three major public broadcasting stations,

282
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,640
-Yes.
-I need to meet the Elder. Make an appointment.
- ... and on "Today's Weather Cast" time,

283
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,160
- I will.
- ... and the entertainment show programs with the highest viewer ratings on all TV stations including cable channels...

284
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:27,200
Also ... will many people be angry if it's sent out in the middle of a drama?

285
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,660
For now, I'm planning on broadcasting it
on those channels.

286
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:34,150
We are also preparing an exciting preview broadcast to raise viewer ratings.

287
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,590
I'm expecting a lot of viewers.

288
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,890
One, two, three, four. Two, two, three, four. ♪I..I only know of love.♪

289
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,660
Dae Yong, child.

290
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,660
- Oh, yes Boss?
- What are you doing?

291
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,180
I'm undercover right now.

292
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,710
What undercover?

293
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,780
Undercover while looking over
Chae Yeong Sin's house all night.

294
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,010
Where's Healer?

295
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,150
Why don't you ask him that personally?

296
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:08,710
He's not someone who'll tell me even if I ask,

297
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,450
and I won't understand even if he tells me.

298
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,850
But who is going to pay me for working overtime?

299
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,890
Hello?

300
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,090
Boss? My overtime wages...

301
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,290
Healer, you punk, why did you disconnect again?

302
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,740
Didn't I tell you to never turn off the connection wherever you are and whatever you're doing, even if you're taking a dump?

303
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,590
It's me.

304
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,090
Jeong Chi Beom?

305
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,710
Why are you there? That's Jeong Hoo's house.

306
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,010
This was my house before.

307
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,700
Was that a house?

308
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,490
It was an abandoned warehouse, and
the one who made it a home was Jeong Hoo.

309
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,280
So, is Jeong Hoo there?

310
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,760
No.

311
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,860
What a petty guy he is, putting all those locks
and securing means on the door...

312
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,190
While trying to break in, the sun already set.

313
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,520
So, why are you there
when Jeong Hoo never lets anyone in?

314
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,620
I don't even bother that place.

315
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,010
-Detective Jo.
-What?

316
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,220
I have something to request.

317
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,880
I don't take any requests from anyone.

318
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,120
I take assignments. How much is it?

319
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,610
Kim Moon Sik's brother, Moon Ho,
you said you planted a program in his phone, right?

320
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,190
I did. So what?

321
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,460
Try to dig through his mail. I have something to check.

322
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,770
So, what is that?

323
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,390
You said Kim Moon Ho asked for a DNA test, right?

324
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,360
He did.

325
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,820
And that was a daughter?

326
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,760
Yeah, a woman in her 20's.

327
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,620
On top of that she was an orphan?

328
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,490
Yeah, a child who became an orphan after 1992.

329
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,800
Then, the child Kim Moon Ho is looking for is only her.

330
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,880
Myeong Hee and Gil Han's daughter, Oh Ji An.

331
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:34,980
♬ It's a dream that is like a lie, the memories of meeting you.♬

332
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,850
♬ I'll still wait for you here.♬

333
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:47,860
♬ I feel nervous so I can't move♬

334
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:55,580
♬ when you look at me. ♬

335
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:02,440
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

336
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,680
♬ when I have so much ♬

337
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,470
♬ to tell you ♬

338
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:16,180
♬ The moment when you turned away,
why does it feel so remote to me?♬

339
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:22,050
♬ Why are my tears gushing out?♬

340
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:28,970
♬ I love you, there's only you ♬

341
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:35,440
♬ There's no one else besides you ♬

342
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,730
♬ Although I can't go to you, hug you
or cry by myself, it's okay♬

343
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,830
♬ I'll always look at you ♬

344
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:51,170
Hello is this... Sorry, I think I got the wrong number.

345
00:28:51,170 --> 00:29:00,540
♬ The one I'm longing enough
to make my heart bruised♬

346
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,530
Hello?

347
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:29,030
Ha, I got it. I'm good at numbers, you know.
I knew I memorized your phone number.

348
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,880
Aren't I awesome?

349
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,970
What happened to your cell phone?
(in informal speech)

350
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:43,670
I lost it, so I'm testing how many phone numbers I remember.

351
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,300
So, how many do you remember?

352
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,320
Oh, you're about... the 19th person.

353
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,350
Aigoo, it's an honor to be in your top 20.

354
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,340
You know I called you recently. I remembered that.

355
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,270
But, were you sleeping? What's with your voice?

356
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,720
Do you know what time it is?

357
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,940
It's past the time a good child would be in bed.

358
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,140
Oh, sorry. I woke you.

359
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,690
Then, keep sleeping.

360
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,220
Well ... anyway, I'm awake now.

361
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,870
Do you have anything to say?
(with honorifics)

362
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,880
Bastard.

363
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,370
That... that's a cur-curse word.

364
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,320
Just lower it, lower.

365
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,120
Lower what?

366
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,550
Lower your speech. I'm giving you permission. I always get confused.

367
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,390
Good.
(back to informal speech)

368
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,970
Even so, keep the word Sunbae in there.

369
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,540
There's something called order in this world.
Order is a beautiful thing.

370
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,170
Sunbae, since I get to lower my speech now, I'll listen to whatever you have to say all night.

371
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,410
Listen to what?

372
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:15,700
Didn't you call because you needed someone to talk to?

373
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,840
Wow, you're quick on the uptake. You're great.

374
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,940
Are you outside? Isn't it cold right now?

375
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,980
It's cold.

376
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,920
I lost my cell phone, so it's even colder.

377
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:36,820
It's not like a cell phone is a hot pack.

378
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,280
It's a hot pack for me. My mom's phone.

379
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,850
After my mom passed away, my heart's hot pack.

380
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:55,980
It...It was your mother's. No wonder.

381
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,640
I wondered why you carried around
such an antique thing.

382
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,160
On a cold day like this, when I'm feeling cold,

383
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,680
if I put my hands in my pocket and hold onto that,

384
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:17,380
then it feels warm. seriously.

385
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,000
If a phone heats up when it isn't being used,

386
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,310
that means it's about time to be disposed of.

387
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:43,760
How can you become a reporter when you don't have a sense of romance or imagination?

388
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,350
Why don't you go in when it's cold?

389
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:58,340
If I go in like this, my dad

390
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,200
will ask me about 175 questions, and I don't have the energy to answer those.

391
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,670
Are you sick somewhere?

392
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:13,620
But, that's actually an excuse.

393
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,610
There's someone I'm waiting for.

394
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,690
Waiting?

395
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,560
I thought I would be able to meet him if I waited.

396
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:34,450
I thought he would suddenly appear behind me.

397
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:39,180
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

398
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,500
But, he's not coming.

399
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,000
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

400
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,590
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

401
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:54,390
That person definitely has something to say to me.
♬ Together you and I ♬

402
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,380
♬ Such a rush of emotions ♬

403
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:59,910
It's not right to not say anything like this.
♬ There's no way we can push it away ♬

404
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,080
♬ There's no way we can push it away ♬

405
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm...
♬ 'Cause they'll never tear our love apart. ♬

406
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,120
ready to listen.
♬ Our bond will never break ♬

407
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,780
♬ My heart's aflame and it's burning  ♬

408
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,860
I also have something to say.
♬ in your name ♬

409
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,780
He's not coming.
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

410
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,050
I don't think he'll come.
♬ My love will always grow ♬

411
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,170
♬ And I won't let go ♬

412
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,420
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

413
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,160
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

414
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,190
♬ My eternal love ♬

415
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,640
Results: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Client A (Female) and Client B (Female) are biologically-related.

416
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,870
This can't happen.

417
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,710
What is this dog poop like situation?

418
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,570
What are you saying?

419
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,720
Hey, Jeong Chi Beom.

420
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,820
What?

421
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,990
You said Jeong Hoo's father caused an accident, right?

422
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,530
Yeah.

423
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,150
You said he killed a friend?

424
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,750
That's what people said.

425
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:21,390
That friend he killed, according to your story,
is Chae Yeong Sin's biological father.

426
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,880
Jeong Hoo, that punk, after his mother left him,

427
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,070
used to think of women like gums stuck on the street.

428
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,410
You said he started to look at a woman
for the first time, right?

429
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,930
But, that's that child?

430
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,970
Yeah.

431
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,250
Hyungnim, Yeong Sin is coming!

432
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:29,820
-Stop it.
-Hyungnim, Yeong Sin.

433
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,660
Dad.

434
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,300
You brat, do you know what time it is? Why can't I contact you?

435
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,860
Dad, that's a bit of a long story, so should we take this inside?

436
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,850
Let's go inside first and talk.

437
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,020
Do you know how many times the company called?

438
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,910
Also, you brat, don't you think about the people who worry about you at home?

439
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,450
Can't you see that her face turned blue because it's freezing?

440
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,630
Ah, it's cold. I'm going to freeze to death.

441
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,930
-Freeze to death? Where are you going in?
-Yeong Sin is freezing to death.

442
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,400
- She's going home, where else?
- Hey.

443
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,310
Explain all the details of what happened first.

444
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,060
Is this a courtroom? What explanation?

445
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,790
Yeong Sin, hurry up and go in, quickly.

446
00:37:06,790 --> 00:37:09,810
-Thank you, Ahjussi.
-Quickly, go in.

447
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:15,510
You ordered me to sleep, but if it's not my room and my bed, I can't sleep.

448
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:18,700
So, in order to follow your order I'm going home.

449
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,740
Don't worry.
End of report. This was Chae Yeong Sin.

450
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,390
Detective Yoon Dong Won

451
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,050
Ah, seriously.

452
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,020
Yes? This is Yoon Dong Won.

453
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,230
I'm sorry to call you this late. This is Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

454
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,910
What? Well... why would a reporter call me... Kim Moon Ho?

455
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,510
Can you talk?

456
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,510
Oh, wow. It's his voice. Oh, yes.

457
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,380
Oh, it's an honor. Next time, if I get to meet you, can I get an autograph...

458
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:17,130
Among my juniors, there is a reporter named Chae Yeong Sin. She talked about you, Detective Yoon.

459
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,190
Perhaps you remember?

460
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,230
Chae Yeong Sin... oh, Someday.

461
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:26,060
Yes, of course I remember.
I met her at Hwang Jae Gook's house.

462
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,050
I'm planning on sending you a video file
of what was found at Hwang Jae Gook's home.

463
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:32,250
A video?

464
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,500
It's a video of Hwang Jae Gook forcing the actresses in his company to give sexual favors.

465
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,620
It's what we are also investigating.

466
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:46,660
Oh, yes. Oh, but... it seems you have a misunderstanding.

467
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,560
My department is The Cyber Team.

468
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,030
So, my job is to take care of the cyber world.

469
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,590
Sexual assault is under a different department.

470
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,500
The men in the video are men with considerable power.

471
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,960
If it goes wrong, I'm afraid our investigation
would have obstacles even from the beginning.

472
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:14,260
Oh. But, I'm also a loner in my field so I have no power.

473
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:20,190
I got that video file from a night errand boy named Healer.

474
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,350
Did you just say Healer?

475
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,110
I heard you were chasing him for a long time.

476
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,590
Yes, for a long time.

477
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,070
I currently know who Healer is next to.

478
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,230
Who is it?

479
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:40,570
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin. He recently got
an assignment to protect Chae Yeong Sin.

480
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:45,220
But, it seems the opposite side will soon
hire Healer for their side.

481
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,470
Because one guy, who was hired by them,
recently got attacked by Healer.

482
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,620
By "them", you mean Hwang Jae Gook's side?

483
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,790
There must be more people
behind Hwang Jae Gook.

484
00:39:54,790 --> 00:40:01,250
So, the one you want to catch,
is it Hwang Jae Gook or Healer?

485
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,550
Of course, Hwang Jae Gook and the ones behind him.

486
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,890
If you start to investigate, I want you to share the information.

487
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,110
And?

488
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:15,310
I also want detectives to be around Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

489
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:19,680
Don't you want to catch Healer?

490
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,480
Ah, this old fogey.

491
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,320
Come out. Aren't you going to come out?!

492
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:31,000
Hey, you old fogey. I know you're still here.

493
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:47,990
I have something to say, you old fogey.

494
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,210
Come out while I'm asking nicely.

495
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,550
You're going to be half dead if I catch you hiding.

496
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,760
I have something to ask you, so please come out!

497
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,910
You are a teacher. Since you're a teacher,

498
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,740
I!

499
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,050
I...

500
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,530
have something to ask you.

501
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,100
It's because I really don't know.

502
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,740
What can I do?

503
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,260
What should I do, Teacher?

504
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,110
Please.

505
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,320
Teach me.

506
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:11,960
Oh.

507
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,510
Hello.

508
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:22,380
About yesterday, I'm sorry I just left like that.

509
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,830
I wrote you a post it.

510
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:26,370
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

511
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,060
I can finally breathe since I saw your face.

512
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:34,120
What?

513
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,670
I ordered someone to search,

514
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:48,600
- but they couldn't find anything like a cell phone in that elevator.
- Oh.

515
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,930
Because of me...thank you.

516
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:57,280
Here, take this. It's a new cell phone.

517
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,480
Oh, it's okay. I can take care of this...

518
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,070
It's the company's equipment, so be careful using it.

519
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,380
I'll use it well.

520
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,520
I thought about it all night. What I should do with you?

521
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,730
From now on, I'll be more careful from now on.

522
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,510
I think there is also some limit
to protect you by your side...

523
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,870
So...first,

524
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,270
if you tell me why someone is trying to hurt me I'll take care...

525
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,980
I thought of two solutions.

526
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,830
First is to send you far away.

527
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:35,660
If I should send you overseas to study, maybe in a countryside in Europe?

528
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,520
No...why would you say a dialogue that only comes out in dramas

529
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,420
like that so sincerely?

530
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,440
Your pranks are pretty old.

531
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,980
I thought you would respond like that.

532
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,670
Then, second.

533
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:55,610
-Should I make you really famous?
-What?

534
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:59,060
If you become famous and a lot people get to know you,

535
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,260
then they won't be able to do
something like an elevator accident.

536
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:05,010
Since it won't be easy to hide it.

537
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,900
Your original dream was to be that. To become a famous reporter.

538
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,720
No...how did you? Oh, background check.

539
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Of course, if you become famous, you'll be in more danger.

540
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,180
I'm not sure, so you make the call.

541
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,720
If you're too scared just run before it's too late. I'll help you.

542
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,090
When are you going to tell me that reason?

543
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,980
The reason why I'm in danger.

544
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,740
Because you're next to me.

545
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,960
Will you first just believe that?

546
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,020
You said a famous reporter, right?

547
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,460
Yeah.

548
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,550
I want to do it.

549
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:56,470
There's nothing you lost, and you didn't even see a thief.

550
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:58,050
So,

551
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:01,660
I don't know what you heard and came,

552
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,640
but you saw the guys who guard my house while you were coming in, right?

553
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,240
Impenetrable security guards!

554
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,540
What kind of a thief would break in...

555
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,720
and would they come in?

556
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,510
This place seems like a frame was here.

557
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,560
Where's the picture that was here?

558
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,590
I sold it. Are you satisfied?

559
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:30,240
Oh, you sold it. Then pass on the thief story. Next story...

560
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,810
These girls in the video...

561
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,540
They're from your company, right?

562
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:42,650
This one is the least provocative, though.

563
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,410
But, I briefly looked over it but oh...wow...

564
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,010
I couldn't even watch all of it.

565
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:54,340
Aigoo. What is this? These girls...

566
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,480
What are they doing?

567
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,520
Exactly! What they were doing...

568
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,880
Let's find out together.

569
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,320
For that, it seems you'll need to
come out to the police station tomorrow.

570
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:13,190
Especially, about those gentlemen
of various backgrounds who appeared in this video.

571
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,780
I have a lot to ask.

572
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,820
This is good for hangover, try it, please.

573
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,930
Elder, that girl...

574
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,190
I did wrong.

575
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,660
I should have gotten your permission first.

576
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,510
For touching that child by myself,

577
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:38,460
I did wrong.

578
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,680
Since you said that first,

579
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,830
I have nothing to say.

580
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,030
-But...
-But, you know, right?

581
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:51,280
Why I had to do that

582
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,090
to a young girl.

583
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:55,890
Are you worried about Moon Ho?

584
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:58,010
Reporter Kim Moon Ho,

585
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:02,040
for the last 10 years, he's been following me.

586
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,850
Even Sam Han Industry and Soosung Company,

587
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,270
that we had worked on recently.

588
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,570
Whatever we just touched,

589
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,960
Kim Moon Ho followed without fail.

590
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,660
Even so,

591
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,890
it's only a few times he fooled around with words in a live broadcast.

592
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:25,580
A mere reporter can't do anything in Korea.
Why are you so concerned?

593
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,750
So,

594
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,950
I was planning on bringing him to our side,

595
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:33,590
but he quit broadcasting.

596
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,970
He started his own newspaper company.

597
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,500
You can't even call that place a newspaper company.

598
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,350
That LA video file

599
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:44,250
that we acquired last time.

600
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,170
Kim Moon Ho also

601
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,810
tried to intercept that, right?

602
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,180
If that went over to Kim Moon Ho's hands,

603
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,490
then what do you think would've happened?

604
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:58,020
It was something I took care of, so

605
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,090
there probably would've been no mistake.

606
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:02,630
I know.

607
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,830
Around me, there's no one better than you. You're the best.

608
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:10,250
But,

609
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:14,520
why do you think I made Kim Ui Chan

610
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,740
the mayoral candidate instead of you?

611
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,800
Elder, I...

612
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,850
That's because of your weakness.

613
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,990
You have two big weaknesses.

614
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,930
Your wife and your brother.

615
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:35,430
On top of that, you can't put a girl as your third weakness.

616
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:38,560
I know that as well, my weaknesses.

617
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,990
So, I haven't expected anything

618
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,910
other than the things you gave me.

619
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,300
But, Elder,

620
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,090
my weakness

621
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,050
is fatal injury.

622
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:55,540
Once I get hurt, it's impossible for me to recover.

623
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,520
So, I die.

624
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,490
Elder,

625
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:04,180
you don't need a dead soldier, do you?

626
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:14,360
I'll take care of my problems myself.

627
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:18,890
I'll do the handling and even the method,

628
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,180
I'll decide it.

629
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,280
Earnestly,

630
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,290
I ask you.

631
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:46,620
Hello?! Can you put the Elder on the phone?

632
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,070
Who is it?

633
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:56,930
Ah, my name is Hwang Jae Gook.

634
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:01,720
I know this is the phone number
of where the Elder is,

635
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,190
so put him on the phone while I'm asking nicely.

636
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,450
How did you know this phone number?

637
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,010
So!

638
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,820
I'm someone with power to the point of knowing this number,

639
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,410
and I have a problem.

640
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,870
If I get arrested, then

641
00:52:17,870 --> 00:52:19,930
I won't die alone.

642
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,160
I am the type to tattle easily.

643
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,030
So, I'm going to spill the beans everywhere!

644
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,650
Then, even I won't know what names I'll spill.

645
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,450
But, out of those names,

646
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,170
there are a lot of people on Elder's side.

647
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:35,180
Do you understand what I'm saying?

648
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:40,590
So, before it's too late,
I want you to put Elder on the phone!

649
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:46,640
I understand. I'll tell him that.

650
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,160
If you wait, a response will come.

651
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:08,610
That guy from LA who brought the video here and died...
His name was?

652
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,840
It's Go Seong Cheol.

653
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:16,940
You said you needed his killer, right?

654
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:22,000
Okay, okay. Attention.

655
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,240
Today at 4 pm, Kim Ui Chan will hold a press conference to officially announce his Seoul city mayoral candidacy.

656
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,510
At the same time, Someday will do its first internet broadcast.

657
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,960
We'll include the press conference in the broadcast,

658
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,420
but the things that we've been working on will also be included.

659
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,210
Yes?

660
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:43,840
Isn't Kim Ui Chan's case too hard for the first time? How about going for a soft one first?

661
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,890
Like a warm-up? Something like a practice run?

662
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,160
What's the reason we are starting with Kim Ui Chan...

663
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,600
In order to do business.

664
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,350
Business?

665
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,530
Not because of our duty as the media, but for business?

666
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:02,050
Because there is no use for an unknown reporter's duty as the press.

667
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,180
If it's at least the level of Kim Ui Chan, who could become the next mayor of Seoul and the future president of Korea,

668
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,600
it would be enough to consider it a business, wouldn't it?

669
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:11,160
If it's about this much, then I need to play my role as a spy.

670
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:15,510
Do it. Instead do it on the way to the scene since we don't have time.

671
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,000
Jong Soo, your role is to grab a seat, however you can,
at the press conference.

672
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,100
The best seat where we can relay from the scene.

673
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:25,200
Oh! No, no!

674
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,720
Our broadcasting will have a terrible video quality,

675
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,660
full of mistakes, because you're all beginners
who haven't done any practice either.

676
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,710
Check the contact!
Pull out all lines and connect them again.

677
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:39,140
We don't even have an outside broadcasting van
which will cut the film, but still let's try it

678
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:43,570
because we would never know what is a hole
and what is a wall, unless we try it.

679
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,240
We're now in an outdoor market with cold wind,

680
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,390
not in a warm gym,

681
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:52,650
and learning martial arts by actual battle.

682
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:56,030
Oh, I was late looking for this...

683
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,470
The camera arrived. They just left together.

684
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,510
Oh, oh.

685
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,720
Here. Let's go.

686
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,130
W-w-where are we going?

687
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:11,640
-To become famous?
-What?

688
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:32,760
Hey, the people around Chae Yeong Sin. Do a background check on them.

689
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,420
If they're her coworkers,
there should be personnel records on them.

690
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,830
Yes, I got it. Current address and experience, something like that?

691
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:44,860
Don't forget their physique and photos either.

692
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
What are you saying?

693
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,130
Hey, what is it again?

694
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:50,540
There's a problem.

695
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,710
So, what problem?

696
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,810
Talk, we're all together.

697
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,050
We can't go in.

698
00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:02,050
What do you mean? Where can't you go in?

699
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,410
Only those reporters on the list can go in.

700
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,680
The other reporters or broadcasting stations
that are not on the list

701
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,020
can neither ask any questions,
nor enter the press conference hall.

702
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,570
Someday or Monday, with this name,
we can't even dream of going in.

703
00:56:15,570 --> 00:56:17,320
What should I do?

704
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,330
What the... In the Republic of Korea, where the freedom of the press is still alive, what kind of discrimination is that?

705
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,970
Put the one responsible on the phone. Put him on the phone.

706
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,170
These people...

707
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,170
They're saying they're only taking questions they want and answering what they want.

708
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:36,650
So, he's trying to completely get rid of the chance of being asked about Joo Yeon Hee's case.

709
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,290
Jong Soo, turn around the camera.
Back pan, back pan...

710
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:49,480
There. Zoom in.

711
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,020
Engagement Party

712
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:59,190
The son of Kim Se Gwang, GK's CEO, is having
an engagement party at the next room.

713
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:00,870
Do you know someone from there?

714
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,690
It won't be easy for them to stop
the guests for that party.

715
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,570
What?

716
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:17,310
Ah! My phone.

717
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,430
A new one.

718
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:22,700
He bought her something looking like him...

719
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,770
But how do I answer it?

720
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,060
You don't even know how to use it.

721
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:29,700
Hello?

722
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,890
Sunbae!

723
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,010
Ah, this is my first call with my new phone.

724
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,910
Oh, it's a smart phone, so I was a bit late...

725
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,120
What?

726
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,140
Camouflage penetration?

727
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,740
Us?

728
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,920
Where do you want us to go first?

729
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,780
So, the concept is a dignified and elegant outfit,

730
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:55,090
which will allow them to enter anywhere
and nobody will reject them?

731
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,190
Ah, okay, okay.

732
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,200
Oh, it seems it's those two.

733
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,750
Oh, please hang up. I'm in a hurry.

734
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,990
Welcome.

735
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,380
Reporter Kim Moon Ho sent you guys, right?

736
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:14,960
Yes. He told us to stop by here first...

737
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,860
Come here.

738
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,580
I think it'll be better for me to wait outside.

739
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,700
Stay here.

740
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,260
Should we start?

741
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:31,370
- Excuse me.
- No, no...

742
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,440
Where are you measuring?

743
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,380
Hey, he said it's camouflage penetration.

744
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,490
This is also an expertise of mine.

745
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:47,930
A reporter should disguise himself/herself
in a second if needed.

746
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:52,300
I also do some disguise.
I'm saying I always did it by myself.

747
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,630
So, I... Oh, ah you scared me.

748
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:59,650
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

749
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:00,950
Bong Sook.

750
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:03,100
Don't talk to me right now.

751
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,990
I'm not in the mood to talk.

752
00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:06,540
Why? Did you not sleep well?

753
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,120
I didn't.

754
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,890
Why? Oh, because I woke you up yesterday night.

755
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,930
Because I was thinking.

756
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,880
Aigoo, our Bong Sook. You know how to think.

757
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:25,480
I did... quite a lot of thinking, unusually.

758
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,250
What did you think about?

759
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:34,170
Should I say I was looking for an excuse?

760
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,940
What excuse?

761
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:47,700
Oh...an excuse to meet again.

762
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:50,830
Meet again? Who?

763
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:57,900
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

764
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,930
♬ But I only have eyes for you and I'm home ♬

765
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:05,250
♬ When you hold me tight ♬

766
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:18,710
Wow, you're really perfect.

767
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,900
Lady.

768
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,350
Beautiful!

769
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,670
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

770
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,860
If you're ready should we go, Sunbae?

771
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,590
Alright, let's go.

772
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:09,590
♬ Together you and I ♬

773
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:14,260
♬ Oh my love ♬

774
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:18,030
♬ I'm all yours ♬

775
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:22,680
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

776
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,070
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

777
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:32,150
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

778
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:37,450
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

779
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:41,320
♬ Even through the sands of time ♬

780
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,390
♬ My love will always grow ♬

781
01:01:45,390 --> 01:01:48,260
Healer Preview
♬ And I won't let go ♬

782
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:51,600
What you have to do is to grab a chance to ask a question, no matter what it takes.

783
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,030
They're warning us properly.

784
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:57,320
"Don't touch this child."

785
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,380
I'm Chae Yeong Sin.

786
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:02,460
Will you meet me?

787
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:04,540
