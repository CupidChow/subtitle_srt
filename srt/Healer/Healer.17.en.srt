00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,380
Episode 17

2
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,030
We just happened to pass by here.

3
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,220
But when we saw the police cars coming, we looked, wondering what happened.

4
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,010
Oh, I see.

5
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,270
Did you see anything, lady? You were running ahead.

6
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,700
She is in a shock since it's her first time looking at this kind of a crime scene.

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,260
She normally handles entertainment.

8
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,310
Chae Yeong Sin.

9
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,040
Chae Yeong Sin.

10
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,390
Let's leave for now.

11
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,930
The man on the ground must have died at the scene.

12
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,040
There must have been other people.

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,080
Let's go for now. Let's not stay here any longer.

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,300
There were other people, but I didn't see them.

15
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,860
What are you thinking of?

16
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,570
It's cold.

17
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,770
Chae Yeong Sin.

18
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,470
Ji An! Ji An!

19
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,190
Are you alright? Huh?

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,960
You're back?

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,900
Is he dead? Are you certain?

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,540
He must have died instantly at the scene.

23
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:13,640
So, in the end, you didn't hear anything before Park Dong Cheol died?

24
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,890
Is it true that there really is a tape recording of your father's testimony?

25
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,120
That's what he said. That there is one.

26
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,410
That jerk. If he was going to die anyway, he should have told us before dying.

27
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,530
But... he did say something weird while he was dying.

28
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,610
What?

29
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,100
3... 9... 1...

30
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,010
What?

31
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:45,680
3... 9... 1...

32
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,930
What?!

33
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,900
3, 9, 1.

34
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,810
Numbers? 391?

35
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,460
I don't know.

36
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,170
Is that all?

37
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,890
Yes, that's all.

38
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:07,040
And...She came...

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,250
She saw me...

40
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,990
Good bye.

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,650
Hyungnim, I'll let my guys go and catch that jerk, Bong Sook.

42
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,610
Let me have a talk with him, and you can talk with Yeong Sin.

43
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,720
Hey, she said she will tell me later.
She said she will tell me when it's the right time.

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,830
Later when? After polar bears become extinct?

45
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,950
Ah, seriously! When it comes to children,

46
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:56,250
the more you peck on them, the more they close up their mouths. You are clueless since you never had children.

47
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,510
Hello.

48
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,890
Hyungnim, he looks exactly like the dude that Yeong Sin used to drool over and watch on TV.

49
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,940
Oh, wel...welcome.

50
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,290
What brings you all the way here?

51
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,250
This is my father.

52
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,180
This is my Sunbae, the CEO of Someday.

53
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,800
Hello, I'm Kim Moon Ho.

54
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,820
Oh, I'm Yeong Sin's father.

55
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,510
- You haven't told him yet?
- No, not yet.

56
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,450
Can't we do it now? So I can greet him properly.

57
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:45,830
Huh? When you say you will greet properly, are you perhaps referring to that greeting (as a boyfriend)?

58
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,180
- Dad...
- Wait, hold on a minute.

59
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,480
Let me think this through. So there is Bong Sook, and when he is trying to properly greet me...

60
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,850
I...found my biological mother.

61
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,730
She is alive and is very sick.

62
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:13,590
That's why I can't reveal myself yet as her daughter.

63
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,110
This Sunbae found me.

64
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,900
I've been close to Yeong Sin's biological parents
since I was little.

65
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,480
I even saw Yeong Sin on the day she was born.

66
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,420
My biological father passed away. A long time ago.

67
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:38,590
And my name is Oh Ji An, Dad.

68
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:47,380
It hasn't been that long since I found out.
I know I have to tell you, Dad...

69
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,390
Well... I didn't know where to start...

70
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:54,170
So...

71
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,920
I am sorry, Dad, for just telling you.

72
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,000
3, 9, 1. 391.

73
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,670
Park Dong Cheol lived in a student studio and there was no such room number.

74
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,850
How about a Post Office Box or a locker room?

75
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,510
Just with 391, do we search through every single PO box and locker room in Korea?

76
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,610
Hey! Hello?!

77
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,220
Huh?

78
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,020
You keep fading out from time to time. Is it a bad connection?

79
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,830
I am?

80
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,760
Are you thinking of Chae Yeong Sin?

81
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,030
Why? Are you afraid she is doubting you?

82
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,630
Then all you have to do is to tell her.  This and that happened, and that's what happened.

83
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,690
Call her. Just you two cozily.

84
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,490
Then, I will be (gone!)

85
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
Seo Jeong Hoo

86
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,820
Oh, what's up?

87
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,200
Hey, Park Bong Soo!

88
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,970
Jeong Hoo.

89
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,660
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

90
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,500
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

91
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,620
Seo Jeong Hoo
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

92
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,540
That person
♬ When you see me ♬

93
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,210
I suppose it would be better to hide the name Seo Jeong Hoo.

94
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,740
And... what else should I hide for you?

95
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,100
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

96
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,320
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

97
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,230
What are you doing?
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

98
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,190
Waiting for a phone call.
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

99
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,900
Chae Yeong Sin.
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

100
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,690
You should call one more time, at least.
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

101
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,190
Go ahead and ask. Anything at all.
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

102
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,830
Jeong Hoo.
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

103
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,070
I'll answer everything.
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

104
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,230
Are you okay?
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

105
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,570
It's not you, right?
♬ Even if I can't touch you ♬

106
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,730
Who are you?
♬ Even if I can't hug you ♬

107
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,450
If you don't ask, I can't answer.
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

108
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,230
♬ I will always be looking. ♬

109
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:42,360
♬ It's you. ♬

110
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,220
You want to die?

111
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,750
Oh Tae Won was released this morning.

112
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,040
The evidence was not enough.

113
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,520
Because of the risk of flight,
we could push to get a warrant, but

114
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,750
those people who guarantee him are in such high positions.

115
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,610
The charges were disposed of as having insufficient evidence.

116
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,070
Did that detective, who was arrested as a possible suspect, confess anything?

117
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:47,240
Up to now Park Ki Jeong has been asserting his right to remain silent.

118
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,480
I don't think it will be easy.

119
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,820
He is someone who knows how this side operates so well.

120
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,060
Hey ... along that line,

121
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,730
could you lend us a little more help?

122
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,620
The person who entered Park Ki Jeong's house this time,

123
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,700
collected all the evidence for us,

124
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,730
and handed them over as well as Park Ki Jeong, all wrapped prettily.

125
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,860
Can you introduce him to us now?

126
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,440
Aren't you ashamed of what you just said?

127
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,690
Anyway, for the record, I don't quite understand what you are talking about, Detective Yoon.

128
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,480
There was a murder last night.

129
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,860
At Holy Mother Cathedral.

130
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,480
I just received the case file.

131
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,510
Reporter Kim Moon Ho is listed in there as a witness.

132
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,710
It was just as a passerby rather than a witness.

133
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,820
There wasn't anything I witnessed.

134
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,940
But this case is strange.

135
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,690
There are very many witnesses.

136
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,070
The victim who got killed yesterday is Park Dong Cheol.

137
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,810
Right before the incident, they said there was someone who was looking for him.

138
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:02,610
A man in his twenties, wearing glasses, who jammed a cap on ...

139
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,120
He even has fantastic martial arts prowess.

140
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,860
Well, without being asked,

141
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,860
there are a lot of people who informed and testified all on their own.

142
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,320
Have you possibly formed any assumption?

143
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,690
Wow, they have already turned everything inside out.

144
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,940
That means, they are also searching hard for the tape recording.

145
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,190
Do you think they might have gotten it first?

146
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,820
Ajumma, twenty years is a tremendously long period of years, isn't it?

147
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,610
It's long.

148
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,070
And during that long period of time, would he have continually carried that tape, which might be sought after by someone at any time.

149
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,370
As I see it, this ajussi seems to have led an itinerant life.

150
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,210
As for me, the tape is not in this room.

151
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,770
I bet 500 won (50 cents).

152
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,730
I'll bet 5000 won ($5) that he lied to begin with.

153
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,690
That the tape exists; one million won ($1000).

154
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,270
Have you figured something out?

155
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,650
It's really strange.

156
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,650
The tape recording is my father's testimony to the police.

157
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:25,580
Then, the content is obvious. "I killed someone,"

158
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,760
or "No. I didn't kill anyone."

159
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,730
So then?

160
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,670
Then, what's the big deal?

161
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,860
What is so important about what someone, who died twenty some years ago, said before he died?

162
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,350
See, take a look at these.

163
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,730
They went so far as to kill someone, and what for?

164
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,440
You say it's soju, right?

165
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,820
What is?

166
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,360
The thing to give to the dead.

167
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,270
You... didn't go there to look for the tape, did you?

168
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,520
Because of me, that man became like this.

169
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,110
Remove the cap and...

170
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,480
It's removed.

171
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,980
Sprinkle a little.

172
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,490
I've sprinkled.

173
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,820
Drink a little.

174
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,320
I drank.

175
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,020
And if you need to say something, say it.

176
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,580
I did.

177
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,360
You should have asked what 391 is...

178
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,860
All the roads are blocked because he ended up dying.

179
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,060
- If the roads are blocked...
- Don't do it.

180
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,130
I need to climb over. Whether that's a wall or a fence.

181
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,770
That's how I can get to a safe.

182
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,750
I said don't do it!

183
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,290
Oh, hey! Hey!

184
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,290
Two guys seem to be tailing me on foot. A car is trailing as well.

185
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,690
How should I do this?

186
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,980
After grabbing one of them, should I ask, "who are you?"

187
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:47,700
Or should I just let them tag along? Huh?

188
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,940
Ajumma?

189
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,070
Ajumma, are you eating something? Why aren't you answering?

190
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,900
Jeong Hoo, you know...

191
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,260
What is it?

192
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,320
For now, could you take a deep breath?

193
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
Breathe in and out.

194
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,170
For what?

195
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,070
Oh Tae Won has been released.

196
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,110
Insufficient evidence. He is cleared.

197
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,940
And on Chae Yeong Sin's cellphone

198
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,900
I planted a tracking device.

199
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,070
Someone whom I don't know seems to be using it.

200
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,940
I'm not finished yet.

201
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,420
The direction Chae Yeong Sin is headed towards seems to be Kim Moon Sik's house.

202
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,650
What?

203
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,230
And at that house now ... Oh Tae Won is there now.

204
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,520
Aish, seriously!

205
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,400
Is it Reporter Chae Yeong Sin?

206
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,420
Hello.

207
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,410
Are those flowers my flowers?

208
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,600
Ah...

209
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,350
Thank you.

210
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,500
You're welcome.

211
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,980
You're really pretty.

212
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,930
Same to you, you're more beautiful in person.

213
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,260
I'm your fan, Reporter Chae.

214
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,130
Is it because I saw you on a broadcast?

215
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,580
Why do I feel so familiar with you?

216
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,490
Ah, I'm sorry!

217
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,820
Miss Chae Yeong Sin.

218
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,500
Things have been hard on me lately...

219
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,760
Gee, seriously, what's wrong with me? This is embarrassing.

220
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,410
I'm sorry.

221
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,610
I usually cry so easily...

222
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm like that too.

223
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,680
Really?

224
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,630
Ah, this is embarrassing...

225
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,670
This is Oh Tae Won.

226
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,030
I have something to report to you directly, Elder.

227
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,560
According to Sunbae Moon Ho, there were 5 people who did the pirate broadcast.

228
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,560
One of those five was Gi Yeong Jae,
whom we featured in our broadcast.

229
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,150
Please come over here.

230
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,160
These were those five people, and this was Yeong Jae.

231
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,460
I saw this picture.

232
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,160
Candidate Kim Moon Sik showed it to me.

233
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,300
When?

234
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,350
Recently.

235
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,550
This is you, and next to you is Candidate Kim.

236
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:37,330
And here was my husband, Oh Gil Han.

237
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,110
I heard he passed away.

238
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,710
Yes, in 1992.

239
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,400
Can I ask you... about that?

240
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:06,420
By chance, if we talked about that, will you... be in pain?

241
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,580
Sunbae Moon Ho was very worried...

242
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,480
If I get sick, just press this.

243
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,450
The nurse is just in the next room.

244
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,100
Then...

245
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,870
Ask me.

246
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,860
From what I've heard, two of those five friends died in 1992.

247
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:45,950
Do you perhaps know what happened?

248
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,330
20 years have passed, and finally someone is asking me.

249
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:55,930
About what happened on that day.

250
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:05,680
Looking at it, Chae Yeong Sin seems to know about her relationship with Choi Myeong Hee.

251
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,800
I don't know when or how she'll say the truth.

252
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,480
If Kim Moon Sik's wife gets to know the truth,

253
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,290
she will leave, no matter what.

254
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,130
If that happens, our Kim Moon Sik will fall into ruins.

255
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,650
If we change our Mayoral candidate again,

256
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,290
it would look ridiculous, wouldn't it?

257
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,650
What should I do?

258
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,310
If it is to protect CEO Kim Moon Sik...

259
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,220
Hello, Elder.

260
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:03,040
You're the one who orders this Mr. Oh in front of me or Ahjusshi Kim Moon Sik to do bad things,

261
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,750
aren't you?

262
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,840
El...der...

263
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,680
I have something to ask you right now.

264
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,470
Where could I go to meet you?

265
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,650
This phone needs to be gone.

266
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,980
What kind of call manners is this? Geez.

267
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,870
Since I don't feel good now, I'm confiscating this phone.

268
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,030
Ahjusshi,

269
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,710
you know me, right?

270
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,290
You picked me up last time.

271
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,670
Do you remember my Teacher too?

272
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,880
He's called Gi Yeong Jae,

273
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,050
and he worked as Healer.

274
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,190
Ahjusshi, you gave him poison to kill my Teacher, didn't you?

275
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,890
You know my mom too, right?

276
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:12,430
Not too long ago, you gave her a scare again.

277
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,060
There's a lot more that I don't know about, huh?

278
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:18,230
If I let you live, you're just going to be like this.

279
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,900
You're going to kill someone,

280
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,460
hurt someone,

281
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,290
and scare someone.

282
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,290
If you get arrested, you won't be in for too long,

283
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,300
and you're just going to be out again, right?

284
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,970
That's why, if I

285
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:44,070
kill you, I'm really doing a truly good deed, right?

286
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,570
Our story... would you be able to cover it?

287
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,710
If you say "our"... the story about the five friends?

288
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,810
On that day in 1992,

289
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,210
I'll tell you everything I know about what happened on that day.

290
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,790
Okay.

291
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:16,530
If it's possible, please air our story.

292
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,480
If Sunbae Moon Ho only gives his permission,
that wouldn't be hard.

293
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,500
But it will be dangerous.

294
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,770
The people who killed us that day are still alive.

295
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,150
Us...?

296
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,730
My husband, Oh Gil Han, a friend, Seo Joon Seok,

297
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:41,910
my daughter, Oh Ji An.
And also myself.

298
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,280
Ahjumma, thank you.

299
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,610
For what, among those many things I've done for you?

300
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,570
For stopping me from killing this bastard.

301
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,600
I would've become a murderer
after killing this kind of scum.

302
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,870
But, will you look at this?

303
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,540
How is it? Does it look like you?

304
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,440
These guys are really working their hardest to drive you to a corner.

305
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,150
Just like what hunters would do to a rabbit.

306
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,660
Ahjumma,

307
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,260
my father's ashes also rest in a charnel house. But

308
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,540
each urn seems to have a number. So,

309
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,720
just like a house address.

310
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,420
On that day, I was in our house with my 5-year-old daughter.

311
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,500
We were waiting for my husband, who went out to cover some news.

312
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,010
Then, a call came. It was Moon Sik.

313
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,570
Hello?

314
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,570
He told me to just run, because those people were coming.

315
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,330
Ji An, put your arms out.

316
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,930
Ji An, let's go.

317
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,060
- Where are we going?
- We have to go.

318
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,640
Where are we going?

319
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,580
Where are we going? Where?

320
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,390
Where are we going?

321
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,760
She's my daugher, Ji An.

322
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,340
Yes.

323
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,270
She's pretty, right?

324
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,630
Mom is pretty, too.

325
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,340
Those people refer to themselves as farmers.

326
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,350
Farmers, as in those who do farming?

327
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,380
They think they are cultivating this country.

328
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,450
They plant barley and corn,

329
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,760
and they also pick out the weeds that disrupt their 'farming'.

330
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,270
And when the time comes, they harvest the crops.

331
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,240
They believe that they are cultivating this country like that.

332
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,510
Where are we going? Mom, Mom, where are we going?

333
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,310
Hey, they're there! Stop right there!

334
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:10,040
Stop! Stop right there!

335
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,610
Where are we going, Mom?

336
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,980
Ji An, look at me. Listen to what I'm going to say.

337
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,770
-You're looking at me, right?
- Yes.

338
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,950
From now on, you must not make any sound.

339
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,060
I will come back to get you, so don't make any sound.

340
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,120
Don't talk, okay? Please.

341
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,360
Please, Ji An. Ssh. Ssh. Ssh.

342
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,390
Stop right there! Stop right there!

343
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,590
Stop!

344
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,060
My real mom... No, my real mother...

345
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,010
I don't know how to address her,
but anyway, she's sick.

346
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:21,980
She's sleeping now.

347
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,560
Yes.

348
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,410
Before she got sick, I heard a lot of things.

349
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,090
She confirmed that I wasn't abandoned, but she had lost me.

350
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:37,400
Right. I thought so.

351
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:43,660
She must have been involved in a car accident when she was fleeing after she hid me.

352
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:47,390
A few days after, when she opened her eyes, she was in the hospital.

353
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,860
She couldn't move, so she couldn't come to find me.

354
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:04,100
The last words my real mother said to me,

355
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,600
to not say anything.

356
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,530
That's probably why I didn't talk when I was young.

357
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,370
I listen well, right?

358
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,370
I thought I was abandoned.

359
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,530
She said you're not.

360
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,440
I must have been scared.

361
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,950
If I didn't smile prettily, if I would ask something they didn't like,

362
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,820
I was scared they might grow tired of me...

363
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:45,300
That they would want to abandon me...

364
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,140
I am not like that.

365
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,260
Then... can I ask?

366
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,000
Of course.

367
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,580
Jeong Hoo.

368
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,240
Yes.

369
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,300
Have you killed anyone?

370
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,200
♬ If people just staring makes your heart sting ♬

371
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,640
No.
♬ If people just staring makes your heart sting ♬

372
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,400
I knew it.
♬ If people just staring makes your heart sting ♬

373
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,080
♬ If you close your eyes, they will disappear.♬

374
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,790
♬If you get scared and unable to move a single step away, ♬

375
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,830
But, I have something to tell you.
♬ I will be hovering close by like this, my love. ♬

376
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,680
What is it?
♬ I will be hovering close by like this, my love. ♬

377
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,210
I've become a murder suspect.
♬ I will be hovering close by like this, my love. ♬

378
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,130
- Because of what happened yesterday?
- Yes.

379
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,220
There's already a composite sketch out.
♬  You don't even have to look. ♬

380
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:46,730
- Is it similar?
- Not at all, not one bit similar.
♬  I'll be standing here. ♬

381
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:49,700
Then what do you do now? Run away?
♬ Anytime  ♬

382
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,320
I realized running away isn't the solution.
♬ You can be held in my arms. ♬

383
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,620
Then what are you going to do?
♬ You can be held in my arms. ♬

384
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,710
First, I have to find my father's tape.
♬  I want to hold you tightly to my chest ♬

385
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,590
I'll help you.
♬I My love. ♬

386
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,090
I'll find the person who framed me.
♬ My love whom I can't let go of ♬

387
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,310
I'll help you on that too.
♬ I'll take away ♬

388
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,230
♬ I'll take away ♬

389
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:11,260
Your father... I have to meet him...
♬  all of your sad tears. ♬

390
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,810
That is, hmm...
♬  Because the only person in this world ♬

391
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,300
That's the most difficult, though.
♬who makes me smile is you. ♬

392
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:27,400
♬ Don't cry anymore. I will protect you.♬

393
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:55,790
Do you know how many people have gone missing in our country for the past 6 years?

394
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,210
They say there are 30,000 people.

395
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:05,450
Also, if 5 years have passed after being reported missing, they are excluded as subjects of investigation.

396
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,750
In actuality, they become handled as deaths.

397
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:25,830
If someone famous like Reporter Kim Moon Ho goes missing, you think it would be a big issue, right?

398
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,560
No.

399
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:35,950
It won't even last two days. People can't remember for a long time something which doesn't concern them.

400
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,380
Moon Ho is my younger brother.

401
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,140
I will persuade him.

402
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,370
I have no intention to change our Seoul mayoral candidate again.

403
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,040
It doesn't look good.

404
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,220
I understand.

405
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,830
Our next plan is starting just now.

406
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,020
We have to carry it without problem.

407
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,070
At such a time, if something from 20 years ago
grabs us by the ankle, then...

408
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,970
There will be no such thing as that, Elder. I will do it.

409
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,140
Jeong Hoo came by?

410
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,610
Chae Yeong Sin also came.

411
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:39,640
Madame still doesn't know who Chae Yeong Sin is.

412
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:45,450
But, she talked with Chae Yeong Sin for a while, but I don't know what they've talked about.

413
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,390
It must have been difficult for my wife.

414
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,920
That fragile person ordered a bug,

415
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,410
and called Moon Ho behind my back.

416
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,740
Thinking that she has probably worried all night long...

417
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,390
Are you ... going to just leave everything as it is?

418
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,030
I mean, what your wife is doing?

419
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:09,510
It's okay, she will come back to me soon.

420
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:13,870
She's just excited for a moment
because of a new game.

421
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,810
I just hope she takes care of her health.

422
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,480
Your guess was right.

423
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,580
The section number in the charnel house where your father, Seo Joon Seok, was placed is 3, 9, 1, 391.

424
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,840
Then, it means the tape recording of
Hyung Joon Seok's testimony is hidden there.

425
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,400
Well, we have to go there and find it first.

426
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,710
Are those flunkeys still following you guys?

427
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,850
They are.

428
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:53,380
Chae Yeong Sin, why don't you step out at this point?
You will be a burden for Jeong Hoo if you go with him.

429
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,660
Not exactly, though.

430
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,090
Ajumma, as expected, (you're the best)!

431
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,780
Cleaning up Chae Yeong Sin's cell phone
is now roughly done.

432
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,040
What shall we do with those guys following us?
First, we should find out who they are.

433
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,730
I guess it has really been a long time
since you were wanted.

434
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,300
You're so relaxed with years of experience.

435
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,450
What are you going to do
if those guys call the police right now?

436
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,530
Ah... right. Chae Yeong Sin.

437
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,520
If it looks like I would get arrested by the police,
you must pretend you don't know me, no matter what.

438
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,320
If something goes wrong,
you can become the accomplice.

439
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,580
I got it.

440
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:55,800
Chae Yeong Sin, are you good at running?

441
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,040
17 seconds for 100 meters.
Obviously, it was when I was in high school.

442
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:07,070
By any chance, if we get in a fight,
what did I tell you to do?

443
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,220
I will close my eyes and wait,
then Jeong Hoo will take care of it.

444
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,820
That's right, that's right.
And if possible, hide in a corner.

445
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,800
Because it's easier to defend yourself in a dead end than in a wide open place.

446
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,690
If possible, at a corner. Yup!

447
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,900
Wait. Don't meet their eyes.

448
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,430
It's okay for you to follow us,
but it would be better to have some space between us,

449
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,510
so that we can do our work properly.

450
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,790
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yeah?

451
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:00,040
Run!

452
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,200
Which direction?

453
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,660
To the direction you were heading, keep going!

454
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,830
Picture, and picture.
Oh, watch out your foot! Be careful!

455
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:22,430
Picture, picture. Ah, pretty!
(Watch out) your legs, legs!

456
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:37,120
Oh, it's the dongsaeng he knows, hello!

457
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,860
- Seatbelt.
- Okay.

458
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,110
I said it's okay to just run over them!

459
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,790
But still, there are too many, not just one or two.

460
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,160
These are totally new faces.

461
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,980
To know who they are and where they belong to,
I think it will take a bit of time.

462
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,800
Secure the CCTVs around there.
I think he's heading to somewhere specific.

463
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,840
Yes, Sir.

464
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,570
- Hey, hey, who is she?
- She must be his girlfriend. One vote for her being his girlfriend.

465
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,940
One more vote (from me) for his girlfriend.

466
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,420
I asked you who she is!

467
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,740
Chief of ABS' Special News Report Department,
Kang Min Jae.

468
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:45,820
Wow, then she's my rival, who is exactly
at the parallell point from me.

469
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:56,170
Totally obvious. She's his girlfriend.
Don't even need to guess or think.

470
00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:00,220
Would you like some coffee?
Shall I bring some?

471
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,510
I'm in charge of the talk show with Kim Moon Sik.

472
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,360
I heard you're preparing a countering program for that.

473
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,520
That's true.

474
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,350
You're going talk about Omega Holdings
during that, aren't you?

475
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:13,950
Because that is the key point,
Kim Moon Sik's source of money.

476
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,580
You know better than anybody else
that no one can touch Omega Holdings.

477
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,190
I couldn't when I was in that broadcasting station.

478
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:23,040
Your program won't be aired anyway.

479
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,570
We've been preparing for that too. No matter what the jamming is,

480
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:30,510
we're going to broadcast even the jamming live too.

481
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:35,490
The more you guys interrupt, the better promotion we will have. Sounds good, doesn't it?

482
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,100
What I told you before,
that was wrong.

483
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:44,670
Did I tell you that you only fight
to the point where you won't get hurt?

484
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,110
Moon Ho, that's a good thing.

485
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:52,000
In that way, you can fight for a long time.

486
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,410
Let's go slowly. Slowly and for a long time.

487
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:05,300
These days, I'm having fun.
When I open my eyes in the morning,

488
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:12,140
in the past, I was like,
"Ah, should I endure another day today?"

489
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,570
But these days, when I wake up,
I think, "Good,

490
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:20,490
what shall I do today?
What are those kids doing today?"

491
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,170
How about you?

492
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,500
Those people... They are always above us.

493
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,930
You know how they can do that? We're still living
according to common sense, but they are not.

494
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,650
You can't win.

495
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,380
But... If we give up because we can't win,

496
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:48,090
that's so embarrassing in front of those kids.
I don't like that.

497
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,910
I'm sure. I think that car is the one.
And this one is suspicious too. It has been following us.

498
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,190
It's not passing by us but keeping this much distance from us. Totally suspicious, that one.

499
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:11,570
Ah, suspicious...

500
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,810
What is it?

501
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:17,570
Nothing, ma'am.

502
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,880
From there, keep going straight.
You will arrive at the charnel house in about 10 minutes.

503
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,050
What's the situation there?

504
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:56,840
How may I help you?

505
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,020
Totally obvious. She's his girlfriend.

506
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,500
Complicated, complicated....

507
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,250
Don't look back.

508
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,450
About 8, 9 years ago,

509
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:23,470
I came here with my teacher.

510
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:26,510
Back then, what Teacher said was,

511
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:32,670
"Anyway your father isn't here."

512
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:36,300
"We don't know where he really is."

513
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:43,600
"But still, you should know the direction
where you will bow to (your father),

514
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,610
so let's say this is the place
where you pay your respects to your father."

515
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,920
I'm just saying.

516
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,610
I found it.

517
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,400
It's my father.

518
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,650
Father, this is Chae Yeong Sin.

519
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:29,870
You must know her as Oh Ji An.

520
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,980
Hello.

521
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,360
Miss! Miss! Miss!

522
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:01,320
Alright, we'll do the third Someday Broadcast.

523
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,400
What? Aren't we going to do it when the talk show with Candidate Kim Moon Sik is aired?

524
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,650
A new item just came in, and I've confirmed it.

525
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,770
This info is something that needs to get out immediately,

526
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:13,230
so before we get any interruption, we need to do it now.

527
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,660
Right now?

528
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,960
Right now? A broadcast?

529
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,820
Then, what about the information I gathered?

530
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,790
Use any method possible to promote this broadcast.

531
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:24,270
The main title of Someday's third broadcast:

532
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:28,370
A puppeteer who controls Kim Moon Sik.

533
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:32,360
We are revealing that person.

534
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,220
There's a video and interview clip
that I have already prepared,

535
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:39,390
so just get a little more
and we'll air the broadcast once we're ready.

536
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:44,820
What's important is how many people will watch our third live broadcast. What do you think?

537
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,540
Well, honestly speaking, this "War between brothers, Kim Moon Sik and Kim Moon Ho" is very popular, so I don't think it'll be hard.

538
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,070
And, SNS power-users are always standing by,
am I right?

539
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,730
How long should we make the air time?

540
00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:00,840
I don't know how far we'll be able to go.

541
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:50,320
Will you be okay?

542
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,570
There won't be a problem.

543
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,110
Now let's give him our goodbyes and leave.

544
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,940
Surround them and herd them to the outside
where there is no CCTV.

545
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,380
I'm the person who just called a while ago.

546
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,480
Those people are just leaving.

547
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,230
They went to where the entrance is.

548
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:38,860
Those guys are gangsters,

549
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,810
and I heard them clearly say that they needed to kidnap that girl.

550
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,720
Oh, do we know each other...

551
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,630
or do you have something to say?

552
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:04,070
The thing you just picked up.

553
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:07,400
Oh, if we give it to you, can we leave?

554
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,610
It's not that.

555
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:11,580
It's not that either...

556
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,570
- Yeong Sin.
- Yes?

557
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,230
Close your eyes.

558
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:22,080
Run.

559
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,470
Hey!

560
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,060
Yeong Sin, throw it.

561
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:41,150
Another lonely death has occurred.

562
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:46,940
Mr. Park Dong Cheol. He used to be
a policeman with a great sense of duty.

563
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:54,220
But, one day in 1992, he heard
a murder suspect's testimony.

564
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,370
Do you remember our Someday News'
second broadcast lead, Gi Yeong Jae?

565
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,020
Seo Joon Seok, who was at the police station's investigation room on that day in 1992,

566
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:06,110
was a member of the same pirate broadcasting team.

567
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:13,190
He also died while getting investigated,
just like Gi Yeong Jae, at a police station.

568
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:32,780
Aish.

569
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,180
Hand it over, the tape.

570
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:38,620
I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you, so let's use words.

571
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,550
Stand up. Move aside!

572
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:01,650
Ah blood! Blood!

573
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:04,900
Wait, wait!

574
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,670
Let me meet the Elder.

575
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:12,520
If you do I'll give you the tape and

576
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:16,230
the LA video recording.

577
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:20,300
Give him a call; then a response will come.

578
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,580
Also tell him this.

579
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,070
Healer wants to join sides with him.

580
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,270
I know that the Elder wants to meet me.

581
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:34,670
But, you really hit me hard.

582
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,890
Ah, it hurts so much.

583
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:41,250
The newspapers back then put
only a brief news article about that death.

584
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,770
They said Seo Joon Sook's death was a suicide,

585
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:48,000
that he killed a friend and committed suicide out of guilt.

586
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,940
The cause of death for these two friends were strangely similar despite the time gap of 22 years.

587
00:56:53,940 --> 00:56:59,660
A death by poison. One was suicide,
and the other one was a murder.

588
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:06,980
But, this time, Park Dong Cheol, the policeman back then, who met with our Someday's reporter said something else.

589
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,540
The testimony that we received

590
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:12,980
and the testimony that was in the file were different.

591
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:17,560
One side of it was completely made up.

592
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,330
So, what did we do?

593
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,920
We reported it to the audit team.

594
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,820
-Then what do you think happened to us?
-I heard you were kicked out.

595
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,570
Park Dong Cheol, who got kicked out
of the police station for being a whistle blower,

596
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,330
has kept a cassette tape with him for the last 22 years.

597
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:05,610
It was the very tape with Seo Joon Seok's testimony.

598
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:09,320
We suspect Park Dong Cheol got murdered

599
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,250
by the people who tried to get rid of the tape.

600
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:17,370
Because the tape with the testimony from 22 years ago, that he gave Someday before he died,

601
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:21,860
has an incredible story about them.

602
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,480
Ah, he lives in a nice place.

603
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:52,480
Who exactly are "they" who are referred to here?

604
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,690
He's coming.

605
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:31,690
Our Someday's reporter went to some place
to ask who "they" are.

606
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:36,480
People usually call him "Elder".

607
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,770
Hello.

608
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,840
♬ Oh my love ♬

609
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,700
♬ I'm all yours ♬

610
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,270
♬ And there will never be another one ♬

611
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:20,830
♬ 'Cause I'm eternally yours ♬

612
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,940
♬ My heart's aflame ♬

613
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:28,900
♬ And it's burning in your name ♬

614
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:32,400
Where have I seen this guy? I'm sure I've seen him.

615
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,470
I listened to your father's testimony tape.

616
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,980
Jeong Hoo, I think this is enough. Just come back.

617
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:41,360
Let's go according to plan, alright? Let's go until the end.

618
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,190
Child, who are you?

619
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,370
In the future, if you're going to kill people,

620
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:50,020
it would be nice if you would think about their son or daughter.

621
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:52,520
Turn right at the next intersection.

622
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,910
Is it hard to live just like everyone else?

623
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,770
Would it be hard for me?
