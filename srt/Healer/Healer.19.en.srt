00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,950
Episode 19

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,630
Go, and make sure to bring Sunbae back.

3
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,820
Are you sure Kim Moon Ho is kidnapped?

4
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,010
Why did he go back there then?

5
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,750
Tracking and tailing in just 3 minutes.

6
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,870
Mr. Seo Jeong Hoo with an undercover job as Park Bong Soo.

7
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,430
Code name Healer, right?

8
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,530
And you are?

9
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,600
We have a job for Healer.

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,980
The reward will be whatever you ask.

11
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,620
I don't want to.

12
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,420
So, what do you want me to do?

13
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,610
Of all the tips that had come into Someday, find the one that came from Russia, and bring it.

14
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,170
You seem to be making a mistake here.

15
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:24,310
The man you're holding there knows about such things better than I do.

16
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,060
I don't know anything about that.

17
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,810
The time starts now.

18
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,830
20 seconds have passed.

19
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:53,260
Excuse me.

20
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,950
What are we waiting for now?

21
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,990
Are you married? Do you have any children...

22
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:05,430
No.

23
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,430
Oh ... So you're not married.

24
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:17,520
Ah, it's hot. Would you like something to drink? The two of you...

25
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,360
What is this?

26
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,920
Ajumma, can you get in this one?

27
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,730
This guy collects all the tips and organizes them.

28
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,090
I don't think it would be in any of the computers there.

29
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,640
How do you know?

30
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,330
- They just had a tax audit, right?
- Yes.

31
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:01,640
You said they copied all the hard drives there.

32
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,500
Then they've already looked through them.

33
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,800
Yet they didn't find it there, which is why they asked you. So ...

34
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,960
WARNING

35
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Signal Located.

36
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,270
Chae Yeong Sin's pendant just got activated.

37
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,810
- Where?
- Kim Moon Ho's house.

38
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:20,520
I told her to wait there.

39
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,210
Maybe she turned it on by accident.

40
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Wait a minute.

41
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,250
Yes, you called the wrong number.

42
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,810
This is Someday News. Are you giving us a report?

43
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,450
Chae Yeong Sin and Russia.

44
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,910
Ajumma, what does Russian sound like?

45
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:58,550
(Slightly altered pronunciations of Korean curse words in imitated Russian accent)

46
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,240
- Need more?
- Wait.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,870
We need to record the reports we receive. Is that fine with you?

48
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,030
Is it Someday News?

49
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,950
Yes, you called the wrong number.

50
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,270
(Russian in background)

51
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,810
Is it Someday News?
(Russian in background)

52
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,940
(Russian in background)

53
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,430
Shall we start?

54
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,300
Sure.

55
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,110
Recording started. I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin of Someday.

56
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,900
May I ask the name of the provider of this tip?

57
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,420
I'm calling from Russia right now...

58
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,340
Is this what you want?

59
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,170
Good job. As you completed your mission within 5 minutes,

60
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,380
you pass.

61
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,420
What, are you playing with me?

62
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,870
Here's your second mission.

63
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,530
It's really simple.

64
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,950
You just have to read what you just received while looking into the camera.

65
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Seriously...

66
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:52,120
Just what am I doing with this crazy bastard?

67
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,770
Boss, I can't do this anymore. You're on your own.

68
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,420
Shall we proceed?

69
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:01,650
Um, may I ask what they are?

70
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,550
Are you ready?

71
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,050
I sent Dae Yong and others. They'll get there soon.

72
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,490
Just buy some more time.

73
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,350
I'll give you 10 seconds.

74
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,790
Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock.

75
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:42,570
Let's start then. But get rid of that thing by Chae Yeong Sin. It really bothers me.

76
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,820
My name is Seo Jeong Hoo.

77
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,280
Just a moment. Put that cell phone down.

78
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,430
So that it won't show on the screen.

79
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,350
Good.

80
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,840
Let's go again then.

81
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,930
My name is Seo Jeong Hoo.

82
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,730
On January 27, the murder of Park Dong Cheol that happened

83
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,680
behind the Holy Mother Cathedral

84
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,100
was my doing.

85
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,060
Because Park Dong Cheol would not pay up his gambling debts.

86
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,210
and as we struggled, I grabbed a nearby pipe and hit his head.

87
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:48,500
I, Seo Jeong Hoo, committed murder.

88
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,350
I confess.

89
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,600
Good job.

90
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,140
Then, clean up over there.

91
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,270
Be a good sport and let me see it to the end.

92
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,930
I'm sorry for all the intrusion.

93
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,480
Now are you happy?

94
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,140
So, so just what is all this about?

95
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,670
Just tell me already.

96
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,390
We'll switch the channel.

97
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,930
Good job. You're now mine, youngster,

98
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,230
and you'll do my bidding.

99
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,270
In return, I'll guarantee

100
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:12,070
the happiness and safety of your loved ones.

101
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,140
Then, what we just recorded

102
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,310
will never see the light of day.

103
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,100
All you have to do is close your eyes once and open them back up.

104
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,430
It's really simple.

105
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,020
Are you awake? Everyone's waiting.

106
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,770
Have a seat, go on.

107
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,890
Oh, he's finally here! Reporter Kim!

108
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,100
Man, Reporter Kim!

109
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,390
You're working really hard these days.
What was it called?

110
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,020
- Sunday News!
- Someday! There's a huge difference, you know?

111
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,770
Sunday is such an antique!
(Editor's note : "Sunday Seoul" was a famous Korean tabloid magazine (1968~1991).)

112
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,230
We're waiting for a late night snack.

113
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,810
Today's menu is Buddha's Temptation.

114
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,180
It's really good. The smell itself

115
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,520
makes the Buddhist monks jump over walls to eat it, according to legend.

116
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,810
Is this all your doing?

117
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,350
It's you guys that made things too dangerous.

118
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,850
I had to rack my brain to figure out a way to save you guys.

119
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,680
Well then, I guess this is a celebration of our President Kim Moon Sik

120
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,920
becoming the mayor and Reporter Kim Moon Ho

121
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,680
becoming the president of Je Il Broadcast?

122
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,520
Man, this is making me nervous.

123
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,310
If he leads Je Il Broadcast
with the skills he honed at Someday...

124
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,930
We need new blood in the field of news media, you know.

125
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,480
Everybody's so old, after all.

126
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,130
Let's admit it!

127
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,620
Let's toast to the new mayor of Seoul and the new president! Cheers!

128
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,330
Cheers!

129
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,640
Smile. Even if it's only for Jeong Hoo's sake.

130
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,140
When we got here, nobody was around. She was all by herself.

131
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,020
Were you scared?

132
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,270
Needless to say, totally scared.

133
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,980
If you had been hurt, I'd just...

134
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,390
You were more scared than I was.

135
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,710
Look at how pale you are.

136
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,810
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

137
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,890
I'm fine.

138
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,310
Did anybody touch you?

139
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,890
Push you or drag you or anything...

140
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,130
- No.
- No? Oh, good.

141
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,800
Dae Yong, you did well. Say thanks to the others, too.

142
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,020
♬ Today too, I will be hovering close by like this, my love. ♬

143
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:24,680
♬ You don't even have to look; I'll be standing here. ♬

144
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,480
♬ Anytime you can be held in my arms. ♬

145
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,100
Chae Yeong Sin.

146
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,730
What?

147
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:35,430
Looks like I won't be able to live like others for a while.

148
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,640
Why?

149
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,310
I was blackmailed today.

150
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,140
What blackmail?

151
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,640
I made a statement that I'm the murderer of Park Dong Cheol.

152
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,890
That old man called the Elder has a video recording of it.

153
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:57,880
His condition is that he won't hand it over to the police if I work for him.

154
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,230
That crazy old bastard...! Really ...

155
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,770
Never mind, it's ok.

156
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,520
Just what did they blackmail you with to make you say something like that?

157
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,770
It was me, right?

158
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,430
Back then, when that bastard was recording me...

159
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,430
It was that, right?

160
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,850
Seriously, even so, did you lose your mind?

161
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,680
You shouldn't have made that kind of a statement!

162
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,040
Murder... just what is that?

163
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,810
♬ The person who warmly holds my cold hands is you ♬

164
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,350
You're crazy. Seriously.

165
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,520
I'm not working for that old geezer ever. I can't do something like that.

166
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,670
Watch it if you do. I'll drag you out of it.

167
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,590
Alright.

168
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,560
That's why, until I take care of this,
I can't be by your side. I have to be on the run.

169
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,600
Let's do it together.

170
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,770
When I need help, I'll let you know.

171
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,980
- Do it with me by my side.
- If you're with me, you'll get caught for harboring a suspect.

172
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,730
Then... how will I see you?

173
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,560
I'm getting rid of my cell phone, so don't call. Don't you ever come near my house, either.

174
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,770
Also, if by any chance,

175
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,890
anyone asks about me...

176
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,230
How will I see you then?

177
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:34,810
♬ I love you. You will be at my side forever. ♬

178
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,830
Myeong Hee is sleeping.

179
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,020
You can say hi to her later.

180
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,330
I beg you. Let Jeong Hoo go.

181
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:34,890
Would you like a drink?

182
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,540
Is drinking with you enough or is there anything else you want me to do?

183
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,680
The Elder took in Jeong Hoo.

184
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,100
They'll take good care of him.

185
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,770
Jeong Hoo isn't capable of working for someone.

186
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,270
If you force him, he'll get hurt, so...

187
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,390
You exaggerate too much.

188
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:01,600
Jeong Hoo's future is all made now.

189
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,640
All the crimes he has committed so far will be nicely covered up,

190
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,310
and if he finds favor with the Elder,

191
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:15,560
he'll come to possess everything he couldn't
even dream of getting with his current CV.

192
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,920
Just like you?

193
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,810
If he becomes like me, he hit the jackpot.

194
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,560
By betraying friends

195
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,930
and bringing them to death, right?

196
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,350
You've listened to the recording of Joon Seok's statement, too.

197
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,850
I did not kill them.

198
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,430
You let them die in vain.

199
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,640
You even made

200
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,020
your brother lie.

201
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,350
Just cut it out now. Aren't you tired of it?

202
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,880
I still dream about it, you know?

203
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,840
Of that day, when I told the detectives,

204
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,980
"Hyung Gil Han often had fights with Hyung Joon Seok

205
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,970
"over money."

206
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,850
Go. I'm tired and I need to rest.

207
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,320
What about Ji An? What did you do to that little child?

208
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,510
She was alive, yet you said she was dead...

209
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,090
Name, Ahn Sang Hyeon. Age, 39.

210
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,180
It kept bothering me because I knew I had seen this face before.

211
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,750
Turns out I'd seen him during the last case I worked on as a detective.

212
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,350
Apparently, he is the leader of Je Il Newspaper's Special Investigation Team now,

213
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:37,020
and that investigation team is quite a fishy group of people.

214
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,660
The guys you took pictures of the other day are all working for him.

215
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,120
So the guys working for him are the ones who attacked us at the cathedral,

216
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,780
and one of them killed Park Dong Cheol, right?

217
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,550
This fellow seems to be working at Sang Soo's office every day these days.

218
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:59,440
Only 2, 3 guys are with him. I don't know where the rest of them are.

219
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,540
For the past month, at least once every other day he's been paying a visit there.

220
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:59,110
He either has a mistress hidden there, or the hiding place of thugs of his investigation team is there.

221
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,590
One of the two.

222
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,190
Well then, let's find out whether it is

223
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,880
that Ahn dude's mistress or the thugs who live here.

224
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,290
Jeong Hoo has started his fight already.

225
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:17,130
He'll find the real murderer on his own,

226
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,390
so that he can get away from the reach of that Elder or Ghost or whatever.

227
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:25,990
If they find out what he's doing, they won't be just sitting still.

228
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,480
Which is why we have to do it ASAP before they catch on.

229
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,250
Also, there is a message for you from Jeong Hoo, who got rid of his cell phone.

230
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,340
Boss, please give a ride
for Chae Yeong Sin's commute.

231
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,910
It won't take a lot of time. He said.

232
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,170
Let's end our phone conversation here, too.

233
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,120
Come in.

234
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,230
These are the interviews about the red lead that I organized.

235
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,950
I emailed you the files already.Then ...

236
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,330
Jeong Hoo is doing fine, I heard.

237
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,010
He's fighting hard, and he's in good health.

238
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:18,840
I see...

239
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,050
That's a relief anyway. Then...

240
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,330
Ah, by the way... have you made up your mind yet?

241
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,740
About that position at Je Il Broadcast...

242
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,890
Shall I do it? And quit being the CEO of Someday?

243
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,760
Well, though the title of CEO may be the same, you can't really compare the two. Je Il is so much bigger.

244
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,930
That's right.

245
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,010
It broadcasts nationally. The salary would be way higher, too.

246
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:52,870
Wouldn't you also get your own car with a personal chauffeur?

247
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,830
Actually, I am a little tempted, thinking of taking everybody at Someday there.

248
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,890
I could lift the ban on Chief Jang's wife's fried chicken business, too, right?

249
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:07,010
What do you think?

250
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,860
Question.

251
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,350
Sure.

252
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:18,370
Can you do the broadcasts
we're preparing even at Je Il?

253
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,620
The sequel to the reports that our fathers did in 1992.

254
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,820
It would be difficult.

255
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:27,450
Then, could you please do this first and then go?

256
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:29,800
I made a promise with Jeong Hoo.

257
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,390
That I'd do even his share of the reporting of what our fathers had researched.

258
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,860
- Also,
- Also?

259
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:45,040
once we get to broadcast this, that Elder, that crazy old man,

260
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,250
he might start to become afraid of us even just a little, right?

261
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,030
I want that person to start fearing us a little, you know?

262
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,970
Yeong Sin, after almost dying or being confined by them, aren't you scared of them?

263
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:00,770
I'm scared, of course.

264
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:05,780
But, you know, they're like zombies.

265
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,070
That's why we have to fight. If we sit still and not fight, they might bite us and we'd become zombies, too.

266
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,400
The Someday News this time won't be as interesting.

267
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,740
It's about something that happened such a long time ago, so just some interviews with no visual aids.

268
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,520
However, when the Elder sees this, it'll hurt him.

269
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,590
The theme of our next broadcast is this:

270
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,810
how has the Elder been making money all this time?

271
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,290
The first is the red lead case of 1992.

272
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,120
Reporter Kim Moon Ho seems to have decided to stay at Someday.

273
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,020
He's got neither flexibility nor strategy.

274
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,150
Seo Jeong Hoo is currently missing.

275
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:56,070
He must have chosen to run away.

276
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,360
What shall we tell Team Leader Ahn?

277
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,620
If we don't hear from Jeong Hoo for another day,

278
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,390
tell Ahn to send the recording of his statement to the police.

279
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,240
Alright.

280
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,760
The Elder was interested in someone for once.

281
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,730
What a shame.

282
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,350
Ah, I'm sorry about that.

283
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,490
Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

284
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,730
Getting their fingerprints isn't that hard.

285
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,280
But you said that the police don't have the suspect's fingerprints on record.

286
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,400
I know. The evidence should have their fingerprints. This worries me.

287
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,870
You saw it for sure, right? The guy that hit Park Dong Cheol with a pipe wasn't wearing gloves?

288
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,970
I'm telling you, he grabbed the pipe with his bare hands. You know I don't miss such things.

289
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,640
Yet you missed the face of the guy who hit him.

290
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,270
I was too busy watching Park Dong Cheol at the time.

291
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,960
- Send me the fingerprints you collected. I'll take care of them then.
-Yes.

292
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,410
By the way, where are you sleeping at night?

293
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,780
I heard you didn't go to the studio, either.

294
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,590
It just doesn't feel right these days.

295
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,010
When I'm by myself, I think too much.

296
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:12,860
I like it better around noisy people.

297
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,270
The number you called no longer exists.

298
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:42,720
Please check your number and call again.

299
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,980
♬ Who are you looking at? ♬

300
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,580
♬ What are you thinking of? ♬

301
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,370
♬ I often just watch you from your side ♬

302
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:14,120
♬ You probably don't know ♬

303
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,520
♬ I don't want to see your back ♬

304
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,390
♬ If I get you back ♬

305
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:31,520
♬ I want to hug you in my two arms ♬

306
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,870
♬ Don't go. I want to hold on to you. ♬

307
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,770
♬ Don’t know why ♬

308
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:45,660
♬  I don't know why my eyes only look for you ♬

309
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,380
♬ Why it hurts while looking at you ♬

310
00:31:51,380 --> 00:32:02,190
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy. I don't know. ♬

311
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,060
Wow, that looks good.

312
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,540
This is what makes me work out in the morning.

313
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,820
It makes the breakfast you make taste even better.

314
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,950
You always eat what I cook with such gusto.

315
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,120
Thank you.

316
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,790
For taking care of me for the past 20-some years,

317
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,530
for liking me so steadfastly,

318
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,000
I appreciate all that beyond words.

319
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,280
When I decided to marry you, I told you,

320
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,250
that I can't become your woman no matter what.

321
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,830
Yet you said that was ok,

322
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,740
that just being by your side was enough.

323
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,900
Thank you for saying that.

324
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,690
Back then,

325
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,330
I had nowhere in the world to go.

326
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,780
Thank you for making me a place to stay.

327
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,390
Myeong Hee, what is it?

328
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,970
Moon Ho will be here soon.

329
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,710
I'm going to stay at his place for a while.

330
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,410
Have I

331
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,290
done something wrong?

332
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:37,720
Tell me.

333
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,350
I have something to do now.

334
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,770
Tell me. I'll do it for you.

335
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,830
My daughter Ji An

336
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:51,720
seems to be alive. I need to find her.

337
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,110
I'll help you.

338
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,970
I'll do anything I can to find her, so ...

339
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,670
I

340
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,910
want to do it myself. I'm sorry.

341
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:09,770
I can't trust you.

342
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,620
No,

343
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,380
Myeong Hee, you trust me.

344
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,390
You, of all people, trust me.

345
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,900
Why did you tell me

346
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,870
that Ji An was dead when she's alive?

347
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,430
Because she had died.

348
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,880
Everybody said that she was dead.

349
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,860
Now I understand.

350
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,960
All this time,

351
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,780
I had tried really hard, you know?

352
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,400
Even so,

353
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:59,000
I couldn't love you.

354
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,190
Now I finally understand why.

355
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,340
I can explain it all.

356
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,060
Once you listen to my words,

357
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,460
you'll be able to understand, so...

358
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,380
I put all your things in the car, Noona.

359
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,020
Shall we leave after you finish breakfast?

360
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,860
No.

361
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,840
Let's go now.

362
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,200
Myeong Hee ...

363
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,730
I am leaving.

364
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,010
- Slow down, please!
- Chief, you have to read faster! Just one more page...

365
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,990
Seriously!

366
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,890
She's one of the five members of the Pirate Broadcast Team from 1980.

367
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,270
Let me present to you, Ms. Choi Myeong Hee!

368
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,910
This is the de facto leader of Someday, Chief Jang Byeong Se.

369
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,460
Yes, I'm Chief Jang Byeong Se.

370
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,390
This is our Ace Reporter Yeo.

371
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,740
Oh, hello!

372
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,760
- Lee Jong Soo...
- Hello, my name is Lee Jong Soo!

373
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,330
- Chan Yeong and Seon Jae...
- Hello!

374
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,900
Hello, I really wanted to meet you in person!

375
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,560
And our Yeong Sin.

376
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,590
Choi Myeong Hee! Choi Myeong Hee!

377
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,690
Choi Myeong Hee! Choi Myeong Hee! Choi Myeong Hee!

378
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,920
- You can talk into this.
- Thank you.

379
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,360
Have this. The coffee was just brewed.

380
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,350
We'd have just come to you if you'd called. How come you came all the way to this shabby place...

381
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:44,560
I begged him because I wanted to see this place. I'm a huge fan of Someday News, you know.

382
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,060
We don't have just regular fans. They're all huge fans.

383
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,990
Right? Right?

384
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,320
- Ah, Chan Yeong, Chan Yeong.
- Yes?

385
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,380
Isn't it a little too flat? Don't you think we need more lighting and an illumination plate?

386
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,500
What are you waiting for? Hurry!
Excuse us for a second.

387
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,900
Here, these are some of the questions we've decided on.

388
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,540
You can read them and let me know if we need to change anything.

389
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,150
- Is he not here?
- Pardon?

390
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,360
Your boyfriend. I thought he worked here, too?

391
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,420
Ah...

392
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,020
I can't see him these days.

393
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,430
Why not?

394
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,020
He's fighting against the Elder right now.

395
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,400
One of the farmers that appeared on the broadcast?

396
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,270
Yes, that crazy old man seems to like my boyfriend.

397
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,960
He keeps telling him to work for him. He's so dirty, he even blackmailed him.

398
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,400
So my man is really pissed off
and is fighting with him.

399
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,850
By fighting, you mean he's really using his fists and all?

400
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,400
Well, it's just that they're the ones who always start first.

401
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,160
Well then, we can't just take the beating as they start the fight.

402
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,350
If we don't fight back, they'd only keep on beating us even more.

403
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,350
That's what they do, so we need to invade the enemy territory first

404
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,150
and strike first, then retreat, strike again, then retreat again.
We have to keep doing it.

405
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,390
- What is this?
- This crazy fellow here just shows up and asks for our fingerprints.

406
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:20,640
Ah, it's just that doing it one by one takes too long and it just gets old, you know.

407
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,580
It's way past lunch time and I'm getting hungry, too.

408
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,530
So... one, two, three, four, five... I just want to do it all at once.

409
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,500
What rubbish is he saying?

410
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,650
Dang...

411
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,250
He didn't run away.

412
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:30,760
Seo Jeong Hoo collected the fingerprints of all our members.

413
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,900
In my own opinion,

414
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,490
he's too tough to be tamed.

415
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:39,630
I recommend quarantining him in prison.

416
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:45,150
Also, I think Healer's hacker partner has taken the bait.

417
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,960
This is a person in the shadows anyway,

418
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,130
I think it's safe to eliminate.

426

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,020

♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

432
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,690
Jeong Hoo, what are you doing?

433
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,090
Coffee. Who wants coffee?

434
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:33,070
Mom came to Someday and did an interview. She also shared snacks with us.

435
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:37,950
I need to introduce you to Mom. When can we do that?

436
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,240
Nah, I guess I need to introduce myself to her first.

437
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:22,240
Yeong Sin, I'm confused.

438
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,170
I mean, I can keep fighting no matter what.

439
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,610
When you keep fighting, you eventually learn

440
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:33,570
how to win.

441
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:36,870
But Yeong Sin,

442
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:43,140
I don't really know who I'm fighting with right now.

443
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,510
Hello, I am Kim Moon Ho from Someday News.

444
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:16,060
Two of the five friends who did the Pirate Broadcast in 1980,

445
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,410
Oh Gil Han and Seo Joon Seok,

446
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:24,740
and how the so-called 1992 Red Lead Case brought about their deaths is simple.

447
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,480
Somebody produced fake lead paint.

448
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:30,860
The paint was supposed to prevent steel frames from rusting,

449
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:34,830
but they made it so that the paint would speed up rusting.

450
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:41,360
And this varnish was first used on a bridge that was being constructed at the time.

451
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,440
I worked on applying the paint on Seodo Bridge in 1992.

452
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,220
You know that bridge, right? It collapsed even before it was open for public traffic.

453
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:54,840
The construction company that had worked on that bridge that collapsed before opening went bankrupt

454
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,770
and was merged with another construction company at a giveaway price.

455
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:02,780
The biggest shareholder of that other construction company was a company called Omega Venture Capital.

456
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:08,530
At the time, our reporters were investigating a company called Omega Venture Capital.

457
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:13,540
Fine businesses would go bankrupt after mysterious accidents or rumors,

458
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,920
and then they would always get acquired by a company related to Omega Venture Capital.

459
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,300
It's alright for a business or a capital firm to make money.

460
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,150
However, they shouldn't use people's lives to make money.

461
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,450
The Omega Venture Capital still exists today under the name, Omega Holdings.

462
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:41,350
We, Someday News, tried to contact them to interview their administration,

463
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,890
but we haven't heard from them.

464
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:49,330
Ah, we introduced the current CEO of Omega Holdings the other day.

465
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,430
He had refused to do an interview back then, too, even though our reporter had asked for one.

466
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,770
Would you please do an interview with Someday News sometime,

467
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,790
CEO Park Jeong Dae?

468
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,040
What is this?

469
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,680
Did I leave this open?

470
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,000
Just what is this?
Man, that startled me.

471
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,060
It's been a while, Yoon Dong Won.

472
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:37,800
J-J-Jo Min Ja Sunbae!

473
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:41,610
Do you remember this guy?

474
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,850
Um, Sunbae, why don't we meet in person?

475
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,480
I really miss you.

476
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,070
You're still not married, right?

477
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:55,140
What, you've been thinking about me a little after all?

478
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,710
You really need to get over me and find another woman.

479
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,210
So do you remember this guy?

480
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:08,480
Your brain capacity is still lacking, I see.

481
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,650
Do you at least remember our last case together?

482
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,330
In 2000, the Omega Holdings money laundering case.

483
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,350
The place that we had raided,

484
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:20,270
we had seen a young hacker there, remember?

485
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:23,800
A little kid that was a genius.

486
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,070
Ah, yes.

487
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:29,970
You see the envelope next to you there?

488
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,720
It's a collection of the fingerprints of the thugs working for him.

489
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,510
One of them killed a person with an iron pipe. Hit the back of the head.

490
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:49,370
The victim was Park Dong Cheol.

491
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,440
Park Dong Cheol's murder case already got a montage of the suspect though?

492
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:58,030
It's a frame. So you find the real murderer
with those fingerprints.

493
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:03,780
You have to ask me yourself in person for something like this.

494
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,870
- Yoon Dong Won.
- Yes?

495
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:11,190
If we had arrested them properly back in 2000,

496
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,690
we'd have saved at least 4 lives today.

497
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,420
Go Seong Cheol

498
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,440
Hwang Jae Gook

499
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,540
Gi Yeong Jae

500
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:26,790
Park Dong Cheol

501
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,930
If we had been just a little stronger as the police, I mean.

502
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:40,020
Is that why you left without even saying good bye?
Because you were upset that we were too powerless?

503
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:43,190
The police must have the murder weapon, the iron pipe in storage.

504
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:45,050
I want you to check the fingerprints on it.

505
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:46,280
But for the past ten years...

506
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,860
I'm working on restoring the blackbox data from the cars that were at the murder site.

507
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:52,490
So if I get anything useful, I'll send them to you.

508
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:57,060
Well, if you want to talk to me, I left a cell phone there.

509
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,770
Um, Sunbae, you have a partner called Healer, right? Sunbae, hey!

510
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,960
Jo Min Ja, you!

511
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,670
Dang...

512
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,030
Jo

513
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,070
Yoon Dong Won took the fingerprints, so why don't you wait a bit?

514
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:42,240
That's why I'm waiting right now.

515
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:47,780
What I would like to do the most is

516
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:52,170
to find that video recording of my confession and delete it completely.

517
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:54,860
To do that, I'll have to search this base first,

518
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,630
then, find all the ones that might have it on them, and search them thoroughly.

519
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,510
Don't tell me that you're thinking of just barging into the enemy base

520
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,950
full of their goons just to do that, you mutt fart!

521
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:13,020
That's why all I'm doing right now is glaring at them. Non-stop.

522
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,440
Recovery Complete

523
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,240
The card has been activated.

524
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,010
I'm tracking the IP to get the address, so get ready for take off.

525
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,080
Yes.

526
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,430
I guess something happened?

527
00:50:56,430 --> 00:51:00,100
How many can you dispatch?

528
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,960
Well, that depends on how much money you can deposit to our bank account...

529
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,340
Healer's Hacker partner is being tracked now.

530
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,030
Just get everybody that you can send out ready.

531
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:15,690
Partner? Ah, so Healer has a partner, after all.

532
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,430
I knew it!

533
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,990
He can't just do all that by himself!

534
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:26,570
Partner, minion, he must have at least a squad working for him.

535
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:28,010
What is he doing now?

536
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:30,070
Hey, except for the emergency team, everybody follow!

537
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,520
Yes.

538
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:37,660
Hurry, hurry!

539
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,810
Man, look at this, look at this.

540
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,950
Hunting is all about the adrenaline rush, you know.

541
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,780
They're emptying the base on their own. Ajumma, I'm going in.

542
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,050
Ajumma, I said I'm going in.

543
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,910
I got it.

544
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:40,320
Ajumma, I connected it.

545
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:45,770
There are a lot of computers here. It'll take some time to go through all of them.

546
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:48,250
This place is really shiny.

547
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:51,800
Is your place similar to this, too?

548
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,400
Excuse me.

549
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,300
So where is this place?

550
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:02,210
Everybody was rushing towards it.

551
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:09,210
If you don't tell me, I'll beat you up. It'll hurt.

552
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:12,580
Where is it?

553
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,340
Healer.

554
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:16,440
What?

555
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,580
Hacker Healer.

556
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:28,120
Ajumma, is your building number 23-1?

557
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,930
How did you know?

558
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,120
Hey.

559
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:44,170
This way, this way! Hurry up!

560
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,840
Ajumma.

561
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:31,210
Hey, this way! Hurry up!

562
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:34,460
Ajumma, Ajumma!

563
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:53,620
What?

564
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,960
It's you, Ajumma?

565
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,560
You poop dog!

566
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:01,050
You actually go around in that outfit?

567
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,300
Ajumma!

568
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,780
If you look into my face again like that, I'll pull all your hair...

569
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:31,140
Ah yes, yes, yes. I got it. So petty...

570
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:42,230
Where do you live? I'll give you a ride.

571
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,240
I left all the blackbox cards you had brought in there.

572
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,200
I took everything else, but that...

573
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,410
Ajumma.

574
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,750
I'm saying I'm sorry.

575
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,430
Now I finally get it.

576
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,810
- What?
- What I'm supposed to fight against.

577
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,690
What kind of nonsense is that?

578
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:03,530
It was really boring to pettily go after the fingerprints of the minions.

579
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,980
Which is why I'm asking,

580
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:09,560
don't you want to do something fun with me?

581
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,310
You know I don't do anything unless there's money in it.

582
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,120
Money... is not in it, I think.

583
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,730
- Then forget it.
- But this is really going to be great fun!

584
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:22,390
You know how hard it is to find something fun for people like you and me.

585
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:27,250
Excuse me, I'm Healer.

586
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:30,110
You should trust me.

[Healer Interview Questions]

596
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:05,570
It was about finding a woman.

597
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,400
I have something to tell you. I'll tell you tonight.

598
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,570
Do you remember Go Seong Cheol? This is a copy of the video he had brought.

599
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:16,310
After securing it, you just need to kill them.

600
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,630
Kill?

601
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,150
This is really dangerous. We should reconsider.

602
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,870
Is that a habit of yours? To only think.

603
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:25,440
If this isn't stopped, you're over.
