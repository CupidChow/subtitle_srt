00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,050
Episode 15

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,850
Is someone there?

3
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,080
Bong Soo!

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,460
Bong Soo.

5
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,030
Is it a little warmer now?

6
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,370
You come to my house and sleep there whenever you want!

7
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:21,590
I'm just staying for one day. This is unfair. You can't do this. I'm not going.

8
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,610
Why don't you have any fear?

9
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,470
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,710
Don't you know who I am?

11
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:36,810
I'm hiding so much from you, but...

12
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,120
You don't even have the slightest idea, do you?

13
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't care.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,870
Are you an idiot?

15
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,470
Don't make me leave. If you do,

16
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,580
you'll cry for the rest of your life.

17
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,400
I...

18
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,680
could get you hurt.

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,230
No. You won't hurt me. Never.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,410
Don't make me leave.

21
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,560
Don't do that.

22
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:05,490
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie. ♬

23
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:12,330
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

24
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,470
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

25
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:24,880
♬ When you look at me, ♬

26
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,810
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

27
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,820
♬ When there are so many words I want to say ♬

28
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:46,640
♬ The moment you turn around,
why are you so distant toward me? ♬

29
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,420
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

30
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:59,380
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

31
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,850
♬ You know there's no one else but you. ♬

32
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,200
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you,
even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

33
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:23,850
♬ I will always be looking. It's you. ♬

34
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:32,920
♬ Meeting you was fate. ♬

35
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,870
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine. ♬

36
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:46,670
♬ As I can't go back to the time before loving you ♬

37
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,570
♬ I am returning to you ♬

38
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:59,530
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

39
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,890
♬ You know there's no one else but you. ♬

40
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:13,180
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you,
even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

41
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:20,090
♬ I will always be looking ♬

42
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,690
♬ It's you ♬

43
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,050
♬ Love, it isn't just a dream ♬

44
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,000
I thought it was a dream.
I usually don't dream,

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,350
so (I wondered) why this dream was so long.

46
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:13,610
♬ Oh love is the sweetest thing. I smile at every being ♬

47
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,920
♬ With a skip in my heart ♬

48
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,430
♬ The moon, the sky, the stars can shine all night long tonight ♬

49
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:27,710
So I keep confirming over and over,
"Is this real?"

50
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,430
"Is it not, perhaps?"

51
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,870
Even while doing so, I'm thinking again,
"Even if this is real ... will it be okay?"

52
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,840
♬ When you hold me tight. Oh oh oh oh oh. ♬

53
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:01,290
♬ Dazzling at first sight. Challenging now everything we thought we knew was right. ♬

54
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,530
Seriously.

55
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:10,800
♬ Oh love, it is our destiny. We're caught up in the daze  ♬

56
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,040
- It's really cold.
♬ Of only you and me ♬

57
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,100
I'm not the slightest bit cold.

58
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,240
Oh, I said I'll give you a ride!

59
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,670
Just try going out before you eat all the soup, rice, and side dishes which I gave you.

60
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,150
Do you know I will still be angry if you have too much left over? Huh?

61
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:30,480
Yes. I get the idea.

62
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,810
I'll be going.

63
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,670
Ah, jeez.

64
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,590
Just one more stop ...

65
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,400
Aren't you listening to what I'm saying?

66
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Cut me some slack, please.

67
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,480
- Just one stop?
- Uh huh.

68
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,810
Okay.

69
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,970
Bye!

70
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,180
Eat.

71
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,500
But Ajumma, I'm really confused about
what's real and what's fake.

72
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,680
My work normally requires me to become fake. That way I can do my work.

73
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
My face is hidden, and my identity is disguised.

74
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,650
When I go out in the world and meet the people there,
I'm always phony.

75
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:23,190
But when I meet her,
I should meet her as the real me, right?

76
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,360
But then... Real me?

77
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,350
What is that? Is there such a thing?

78
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,650
Since when have you been thinking so deeply?

79
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,560
I know, huh?

80
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,090
I'm telling you for the forty-ninth time, don't think.

81
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,640
If you think, you always cause trouble, you know?

82
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,860
Ajumma.

83
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,850
Reset your watch.

84
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,900
Thank you.

85
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,000
Also look at the battery. Check it.

86
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,640
I'm going out.

87
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,230
Where are you going?

88
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,540
I'm going to find the real me.

89
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:10,530
The kid is gradually losing it.
It's not like I can just format him again.

90
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,100
It's definitely past time to replace him.

91
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,890
Punk!

92
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,760
I was worried about you.

93
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,480
Chae Yeong Sin was waiting for you a lot too. Have you contacted her?

94
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,570
She came to find me.

95
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:04,830
You didn't tell her, did you?

96
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,070
Who you are?

97
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,920
I've never told her, but she figured it out.

98
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,040
How much does she know?

99
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,940
I'm thinking about how much I should tell her.

100
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,760
But she hasn't asked me.

101
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,140
She hasn't asked me why I live this way, why I was injured,

102
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,770
not even my real name.

103
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,500
You like Ji An, don't you?

104
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,640
That's probably why you couldn't tell her

105
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,590
who she is, who her father is, and about your father.

106
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,550
I told you I'm thinking about it.

107
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,770
Then will you understand me too?

108
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,120
It's because I like Myeong Hee and Ji An.

109
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,530
That's why I haven't been able to tell them.

110
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:00,880
That's as far as the exchanging of pleasantries is going.
Let's talk business from now on.

111
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,890
Okay.

112
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,940
- I want revenge for Teacher ...
- Okay.

113
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,120
and I want to clear my father's name
so that everyone knows the truth

114
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,820
instead of just saying among ourselves
that it's probably not true.

115
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,270
Of course, we should. And?

116
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,090
I want to know

117
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:24,700
when it's okay to tell Chae Yeong Sin
that her birth mother is alive.

118
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,520
Don't you think it's when
it won't put her or Myeong Hee in danger?

119
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,890
When is that?

120
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,740
That's related to the first two you talked about.

121
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,300
Didn't you say you wanted to find the way
to draw out all of them from the underlings

122
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,790
to the ones behind it and screw them up?

123
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,940
- I did.
- Have you found a way?

124
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,330
I thought about it, but I only know of one way.

125
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,530
The method your father and Chae Yeong Sin's father used.

126
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,970
The method I've only imitated my whole life.

127
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,330
Do you want to properly use that method with me?

128
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,650
The method my father used?

129
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,970
- Yes.
- What are the chances of success?

130
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,750
If Healer works with me fifty-fity.

131
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,660
What you asked earlier, you're right. I like Chae Yeong Sin.

132
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,030
Just so you know.

133
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:49,610
Kim Moon Sik started working for the Elder in 1992
after the incident.

134
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:53,780
After working for him for a few years,
the Elder gave him Secretary Oh

135
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,180
when he became independent.
He has several names and identities.

136
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,430
One of those is a lawyer.

137
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,410
Their relationship is interesting.

138
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,280
You can think of Kim Moon Sik and Secretary Oh
as the head and tail of a coin.

139
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,110
He was a very special friend to me.

140
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,310
I want everything to be the best for him.

141
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,510
He will be taken in the finest funeral procession to the best charnel house that could be arranged.

142
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,580
Secretary Oh does all the dirty work,

143
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:32,090
and Kim Moon Sik lives as a gentleman
with nothing to be embarrassed of.

144
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,420
Sometimes,

145
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,860
I think Kim Moon Sik really believes
there's nothing he's done wrong.

146
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,340
It's like he really doesn't remember.

147
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,930
So I was fooled many times, too.

148
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,800
Was this the only photo?

149
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,280
We barely got that from the police station.

150
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,960
I know Teacher isn't in here,
but it still makes me feel bad...

151
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,810
Even though they're only ashes,

152
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,880
but still I don't want to give these to him.

153
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,880
I'm kind of busy lately, so later, when I have lots of time,

154
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,740
I'll scatter your ashes somewhere nice.

155
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,930
South Pacific? Deal?

156
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,040
This is the script which will be used in this week's
ABS' spotlight conversation with Kim Moon Sik.

157
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,150
I got it. I did. I put my life on the line.

158
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,500
We're going to focus on the seven items that have been marked.

159
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,470
It does seem similar to what we've prepared, but...

160
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,870
Now, about the rating level,
how far should we go for ...?

161
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,670
But why are you worried about the rating level? Who is going to censor it?

162
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,950
That's true.

163
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,020
Because censorship is more deeply ingrained in me than ...

164
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,370
- Jong Soo.
- Yes.

165
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,390
- Did you give them your spy report?
- Yes.

166
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,760
That we will be countering
during Kim Moon Sik's interview?

167
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,890
I reported that we were preparing something huge.

168
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,380
Did you scare them properly?

169
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,980
Yes.

170
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,670
Kim Moon Sik has a cyber team working for him. They'll probably try to do something.

171
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,180
We'll have to prepare properly.

172
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Yes, of course, you will say it's due tomorrow.

173
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:25,140
Then, I will try to say, there is absolutely no way I can do it by tomorrow. But you won't even try to listen to me...

174
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,970
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- Yes.

175
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,770
You agreed to meet Detective Yoon Dong Won today, right?

176
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,570
Yes, 2 PM. I'll meet him and start work on this story right afterwards.

177
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,600
- No, no, keep covering that story. That's going to be our special highlight.
-What?

178
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,020
For that story, I've brought in a freelancer.

179
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,350
He will need some help today. Can you help him out?

180
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,390
What kind of help?

181
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,670
Ask him yourself.

182
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,850
Oh, and Park Bong Soo has taken a leave of absence.

183
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,130
A leave of absence? For how long?

184
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,860
He has personal reasons.

185
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,760
Alright, since the shorter the meeting the better,
we'll end here.

186
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,540
Chae Yeong Sin, come with me. I'll decide on a direction for the story.

187
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,370
Okay.

188
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,300
If he's taking a leave of absence, is that paid or not?

189
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,880
Paid or unpaid, this is a really important distinction.

190
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,390
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin?

191
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,230
My name is Seo Jeong Hoo.

192
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm the freelancer who needs your help today, Reporter Chae.

193
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,390
All I have to do today is

194
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,690
to accompany you to the police station and get in there discretely.

195
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,190
What did you say your name is?

196
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:39,290
Seo Jeong Hoo. I was born December 1987.

197
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,450
Is there anything else you want to know?

198
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,660
Seo Jeong Hoo?

199
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,390
Mr. Seo Jeong Hoo?

200
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,410
Or...just Jeong Hoo?

201
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm sorry.

202
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,170
Have I introduced myself too late?

203
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:05,240
We finally meet.

204
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,830
Yeah.

205
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,280
Nice to meet you.

206
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,230
- But...
- Yeah?

207
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:15,010
Let me hit you a few times.

208
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,320
Ah, don't you hit too hard?
♬ Do you believe in the power♬

209
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,730
♬ Of everlasting love ♬

210
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,770
Alright.
♬ Of everlasting love.♬

211
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:32,440
♬ We can make it if we stay together. Our love is just enough. ♬

212
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,050
♬ Oh my love ♬

213
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,590
But, can you just go in like this?
When it's the police station?

214
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,110
Don't you have to disguise yourself? Wear a hat, mask your face, something like that.

215
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:47,590
I'll figure out the disguise depending on the situation. And I will scrounge whatever equipment I need on-site. This is my m.o. (modus operandi).

216
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,470
And this is a new special product from our boss.

217
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,820
Here. Like this.

218
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,440
Ok, say anything.

219
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,900
Say anything?

220
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,690
Again.

221
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,720
But, then Park Bong Soo will not appear anymore?

222
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,430
Is its volume too low...?

223
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,880
I miss Park Bong Soo!

224
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,190
Hey, this is very sensitive! So it's not necessary
to hold it closely to talk to it.

225
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,860
No that's not it, just forget that this is here.

226
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,450
If you get overly conscious of this, it will be more suspicious, so forget that it's here.

227
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,770
I'll figure it out on site and grasp the situation well. Okay?

228
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,550
Bong Soo. Bong Soo, Bong Soo...

229
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,860
What...

230
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,200
She's good..

231
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,300
Fulfilling it's responsibility to the public - Korea's New Police

232
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,580
Please wait one moment.

233
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Yes, on the first floor. Yes. Yes, understood.

234
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,800
Can I see your ID?

235
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,240
ID card

236
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,610
Please go up to the third floor to find the cyber team.

237
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,700
Work hard.

238
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,360
Next please.

239
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,440
Don't think about anything else.

240
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
What other thoughts for example?

241
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,300
Just do your work. As a reporter.

242
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,510
I'll do my best.

243
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,550
Perhaps, if something dangerous happens...

244
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,950
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

245
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,820
I am currently inside a South Korean police station. There are policemen spread all around us.

246
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,550
What dangerous situation could happen here?

247
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,380
Good. Indeed very good.

248
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,150
Did you finish it all? Should we work a bit now?

249
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,290
Where?

250
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,860
4th floor on the left.
There's a server room at the end.

251
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,290
Sorry to have you come all the way here. That way.

252
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,090
We are in a kind of emergency right now,
so we can't leave the office at the moment.

253
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,700
I'm sorry for doing this when you're so busy.

254
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,650
But is the cyber team here?

255
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,940
Why, does it look too ordinary?

256
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,270
- No.
- Would you like something to drink?

257
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:42,410
No, you are busy> Let's finish this quickly.

258
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,700
Okay. What did we want to talk...
ah, the information exchange!

259
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,580
You will give me the information
about Hwang Jae Gook's death, ...

260
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,910
And you will give me the information about Healer.

261
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,340
That's right.

262
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,440
We'll reset everything exactly at 3:15 PM.
Please get ready.

263
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,050
Get ready! Wait one moment

264
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,370
Why, did something happen?

265
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:13,870
We are currently isolating our server network. Sorry.

266
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:17,490
What does that mean? Server network isolation?

267
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,850
Yoon Dong Won! You have no flexibility whatsoever
to even wipe up crap, you SOB!

268
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,620
Looks like this time he found the backdoor, and he's gone nuts for sure.

269
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:34,340
This means that from now you can't use the police network from outside the police station anymore. Does that make sense?

270
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,850
There are criminals going crazy everywhere,

271
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,660
but each police officer has to crawl back to the office every time he has to look up a record!?

272
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,860
Seriously, this guy, are those words or a fart?

273
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:51,400
Ajumma, get yourself together. We are on this side now, not on the police's side.

274
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,650
So what should we do now? Even going to the computer server room and planting a new one doesn't work anymore?

275
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,900
First, get into any computer inside there.

276
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,330
Let's try to make one of the internal computers our own before they reset them.

277
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,030
Up to where did we talk?

278
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,300
- Ah, talking... Hwang Jae Gook, Healer.
- Yeah.

279
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,950
But last time it seemed like you barely knew Healer at all?

280
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,360
Ah, you believed that? Really...

281
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,140
Hey.

282
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,040
Why?
"The page cannot be displayed."

283
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,600
They've blocked external network connections on every computer within the police station.

284
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,610
That means nobody will be let in before the reset.

285
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,870
So? This doesn't work. What next?

286
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:29,720
Still... one should be able to connect to the external network.

287
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,370
If there's one, it should be Yoon Dong Won's computer.

288
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,320
I can't go there. Yoon Dong Won and Yeong Sin are in there right now.

289
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,820
We have four minutes left until the reset. If we can't go in before then, it's the end. Lost completely.

290
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,620
So, you know who Healer is?

291
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:58,190
Honestly, I've met Healer.

292
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,270
When?

293
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:07,080
The past two months, I've met him three times.

294
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,140
How did you meet him? Can you tell me your impression and his clothing?

295
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,280
That...

296
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,710
- That man right now!
- Who?

297
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,650
The man that just passed by the door!

298
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,340
Somebody passed by?

299
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,300
There! That man!

300
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,530
But... Hey! Reporter Chae!
Hey, you, come out.

301
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,550
Where? Where is he?

302
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,380
There, he's going out! It's that guy! Hey,

303
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,440
I don't see anyone...

304
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,710
3:14 PM

305
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,450
http://www.202.212.22...

306
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,610
Okay! Connected! Now it's mine.

307
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,450
Cyber Crime Investigation Squad

308
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,450
- Reporter Chae.
- That's strange, where did he go?

309
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,310
- Hey, look at me.
- Huh?

310
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,510
What are you doing right now?

311
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,820
Ah, I thought it's that person.

312
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,640
That person?

313
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,820
Ah, there was a guy that I had a crush on. I thought it was him.

314
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,270
Crush.

315
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,350
That's strange, where did he go? He was here. He was right here.

316
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,650
Hey miss. Do you know what you committed right now?

317
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,130
- I know, right?
- Obstruction of official duties, information theft accomplice, and also...

318
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:13,180
How did I find such a boyfriend, really.

319
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,150
Hello?

320
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:18,430
This... was so fun!

321
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,850
What? Really, boy... boyfriend.

322
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,580
Ah, jeez.

323
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,270
Ah, boyfriend.

324
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,560
We received the immigration report on the name Seo Jeong Hoo.

325
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:49,210
According the report, he departed from Moscow
on the 6th of this month, but...

326
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:51,540
But?

327
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,970
Can you look at this? Our spy at the police sent it.

328
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:01,260
He began working at Someday Daily before that day.

329
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,450
Before he returned from Russia.

330
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,650
Someone skilled enough to change immigration records.

331
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,570
Then we can call him the main figure in this photo.

332
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,560
Healer.

333
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,750
Healer...

334
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:28,470
Seo Jeong Hoo began working at Someday Daily with the name Park Bong Soo.

335
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:34,500
And Moon Ho took over Someday ...
Ji An was there too, wasn't she?

336
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,870
What's her name now? Chae...

337
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,640
Yeong Sin?

338
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:48,830
These are your wife's call reports that Double S Guards sent.

339
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,460
Hello? I'm Reporter Chae Yeong Sin from Someday Daily.

340
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,620
May I speak to Madame Choi Myeong Hee?

341
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,790
I'm Choi Myeong Hee.

342
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,530
Where is Seo Jeong Hoo now?

343
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,370
He's taken a leave of absence from Someday Daily, and we're in the process of finding him.

344
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,690
- And Ji An?
- She's still in the same place.

345
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,980
During the day she's at Someday, and at night she's at Chae Chi Soo's house.

346
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,930
Jeong Hoo grew up without his parents, didn't he?

347
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,340
And Ji An grew up in a place ex-convicts often visit.

348
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,020
Yes.

349
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,540
Then they probably never learned the appropriate way to adjust to society.

350
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,880
Are you going to teach them?

351
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,480
I'll have to.

352
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,720
That's my duty.

353
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,460
Corporal Park Ki Jeong. It's been two years since he started working for Yoon Dong Won.

354
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,090
I'll put the address in your car's GPS.

355
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:24,490
Yeong Sin is still at the police station.

356
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,590
She must think that Korea's police stations are the safest places in the world.

357
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,660
- Healer?
- You know too, Ajumma.

358
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,240
Teacher was killed there.

359
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,370
Listen.

360
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,040
It can't be helped.

361
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,300
I'll have to go back and get her myself.

362
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,600
Get ahold of yourself!

363
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,890
Everything is going according to the plan, so please!

364
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,560
Really!

365
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,640
I should just go to the South Pacific...

366
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,920
So, those three times, you never saw his face?

367
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,990
One time,

368
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,090
I chased him when he was running away with my bag.

369
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,470
- You chased after him? Healer?
- That's right.

370
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:13,610
I was caught right away.

371
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:17,590
He was holding me like this from behind, so what could a weakling like me do?

372
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:21,080
I was just shivering.

373
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,190
I was so shocked then that I had bad dreams that night.

374
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,210
You're doing well.

375
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,600
Drag it out a little longer. We're almost done.

376
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,090
For the second time, I was covering my eyes like this.

377
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,720
I got the video then.

378
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,570
You know, right? The Hwang Jae Gook video. Like this.

379
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:46,540
Covered like this. That's the second time.

380
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,600
Sender Number Suppressed

Odong Apartment Complex-101, #304

382
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,030
Odong Apartment Complex-101, #304

383
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,980
Sorry for intruding.

384
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,940
There's a family photo.

385
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,690
Family?

386
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,290
A wife, one daughter, and one son.

387
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:29,660
It says they're currently in Canada. So he's a goose father (his family is overseas, while he works in Korea) then?

388
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,080
You hack this computer.

389
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,570
For someone who works in the cyber team he's very analog.

390
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:38,770
I see a number of bank books
under other names...

391
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,600
And these are the account numbers.

392
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,420
What is this?

393
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:00,620
It looks like a medicine bottle. But it doesn't seem like cold medicine.

394
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,450
Reporter Kim Moon Ho

395
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,770
Yes, this is Yoon Dong Won.

396
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,730
It's Kim Moon Ho.

397
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,420
From what I know you're with one of my reporters right now.

398
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,940
Yes, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin is here.

399
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:04,300
The conversation has been so good
that I haven't noticed time passing.

400
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,010
If it's about the Healer, I probably know more about him.

401
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:15,030
I was thinking of calling you in as a witness or going to talk to you myself.

402
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,010
You told me that the person who claimed he was the Healer was like family to you.

403
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,080
In the mortuary.

404
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:24,890
So I want to catch the person who killed the hyung
who was like family.

405
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,020
I'm following the story with the help of some informants.

406
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,720
Do you need that information?

407
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,150
Are those informants legitimate people?

408
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,490
I don't know.

409
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,430
We were taught that we must always
protect the identity of informants.

410
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,610
What I've just sent you, he's your hoobae, isn't he? Corporal Park Ki Jeong.

411
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:56,310
This is his borrowed name bank account. Isn't it interesting?

412
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,100
- Have you found Park Ki Jeong?
- Someone saw him leave an hour ago.

413
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,770
He's been transferring over $5,000 a month to his family in Canada.

414
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:09,470
That would be difficult with a policeman's pay, right?

415
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,630
Hurry! Hurry up, hurry up!

416
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:14,580
We will give you all the information we have received.

417
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,600
- But one thing.
- Oh god.

418
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,390
Please allow us to cover the process until the killer is arrested.

419
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,730
That's all.

420
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,120
I know it will be difficult.

421
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,850
Someone was killed inside the police station.

422
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,850
But the person responsible is a detective
from that police station.

423
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:40,030
Of course you want to hide it. But if we put it on the news?

424
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:42,260
It might not just end with a written apology.

425
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,790
So, are you going to hide it, Detective Yoon Dong Won?

426
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:51,110
- Have you tried calling him?
- His phone is off. We can't track his location.

427
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
What did you say Park Ki Jeong's home address is?

428
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,140
It's Odong Apartment in Jangeui-dong.

429
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,850
I wasn't planning on doing this.

430
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,020
What?

431
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,040
Living alone without a wife or kids.

432
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,510
This is a police station in the Seoul jurisdiction.

433
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,430
The investigators who have been looking into the situation seem to have obtained new information.

434
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:43,140
We are covering the story together with the investigation squad.

435
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,090
Hello?

436
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,040
Please tell me slowly and clearly.

437
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,580
Wait, Detective Park.

438
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,350
What phone are you using right now?

439
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,790
Hello? Hello? Secretary Oh ...?

440
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:16,040
I've never understood why someone who's running away packs his possessions.

441
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,160
But everyone does it. Isn't it interesting?

442
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,520
The reporters can wait here. You two guard the entry.

443
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,150
Yes!

444
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,210
Where could this place be, that the police team raided it?

445
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,300
It's probably where the suspect is, right?

446
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,010
Ah, yes.

447
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:54,860
May I ask you what clues you followed?

448
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,700
What is this?

449
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,820
Isn't this another arrow here?

450
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,420
Team leader, over here.

451
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,990
Lady, do you have some time to spare?

452
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,290
Can you please not teach him lines like this? Please?

453
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,570
They're really no good.

454
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,810
I think we're about done. Why don't we go?

455
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,690
What?

456
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:46,720
They left without me again.

457
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,810
There was a young man who was a college student in 1980.

458
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:02,360
He did pirate broadcasts with his friends.

459
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,200
Now, today's talk, what we ramble and you must listen to, is

460
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,790
the merger of all media companies,
conducted by our dear President Jeon Doo Hwan.

461
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,840
Approximately 1,000 journalists have been fired
from their positions in the past two months.

462
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,000
That pirate broadcast continued for about a year.

463
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:28,200
They reported facts that were not being covered by newspapers or broadcasts through a shortwave radio.

464
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,570
And audience members who could receive that broadcast

465
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,280
secretly recorded the broadcast on cassette tapes and shared it with many more people.

466
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,260
That pirate broadcast ended with the arrest of Gi Yeong Jae.

467
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:44,430
And Gi Yeong Jae was imprisoned for 11 years

468
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:48,610
for having talked about facts that the government

[CCTV on the day of kidnapping]
- Years later, a police officer met him
after getting a report on kidnapping.

470
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,190
Yes, I started to investigate him as a witness.

471
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:02,200
But his story started getting a bit more complicated.

472
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,850
The back door deals that he had with higher-ups.
Well, something like that...

473
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:10,070
So he was about to tell me everything about that kind of thing.

474
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,320
This is a police station in the Seoul jurisdiction.

475
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,550
On the 13th of this month,
at this police station,

476
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,530
there was a suspicious death.

477
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,700
It was a lonely death which was not even mentioned
in one line of the ordinary newspaper.

478
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,170
[Video footage of arresting the culprit]
- Gi Yeong Jae was murdered
in the middle of his testimony.

479
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:29,190
The suspect the police have arrested

480
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:35,190
is Mr. Park who was working at that police station.

481
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:37,790
[Exhibit 1]
Among the evidence found in Mr. Park's house

482
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,630
was the toxic substance
that was used to kill Gi Yeong Jae.

483
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:45,340
And for the past two years Mr. Park,

484
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:48,160
using illegal and borrowed name accounts,

485
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,620
received 10 to 20 million won ($10k - $20k)
of payment monthly.

486
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,490
Why did someone give so much money to a current policeman?

487
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,270
Mr. Park called a certain place right before he got arrested.

488
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:04,050
This is the call.

489
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,490
- Hello?
- Hello.

490
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,570
Secretary Oh, I'm Park Ki Jeong-, there's a problem.

491
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,410
Someone's gone through my house. My hard drive has been taken too.

492
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,120
I think someone's found out. Please help me.

493
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,320
Please explain in calm and organized way what's happened.

494
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,210
I have to run right now, so help, please!

495
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,860
Wait, Detective Park,

496
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,410
what phone are you using to call me?

497
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,040
This is footage of the Secretary Oh from the call meeting Mr. Park.

498
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:40,240
I happen to know Secretary Oh quite well personally.

499
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,330
He has been working as a secretary for over 20 years

500
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:48,050
under candidate Kim Moon Sik, who has declared
his candidacy as a Mayor of Seoul.

501
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,520
We were able to obtain footage of

502
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,040
Candidate Kim Moon Sik and Secretary Oh entering the building

503
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,780
at the time of Gi Yeong Jae's kidnapping.

504
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:04,670
The police have taken these items of evidence
and are currently investigating...

505
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,630
We are planning on following this investigation to the end and broadcasting it.

506
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,990
- Were you watching?
- Yeong Jae has died.

507
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,940
You knew?

508
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:28,170
Are you all right?

509
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:33,990
I wasn't able to tell you because I thought if you knew you'd be surprised. So...

510
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,650
I want to be alone.

511
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:47,030
- Myeong Hee.
- I'm begging you.

512
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:21,320
In this world, there are too many people

513
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,030
whose names do not appear even in one line of a newspaper, no matter how unjustly they have been killed.

514
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:30,100
We will not be able to listen to all these people's stories,

515
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,980
but we wanted to listen to the story
of at least one of these people.

516
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,670
We

517
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:46,700
remember you.

518
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:53,080
We did this broadcast today to let you know that.

519
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:59,200
Thank you, everyone, for being with us today.

520
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:22,000
That person. You said he was your teacher, right?

521
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,030
Yeah.

522
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:29,160
Was he a friend of your late father?

523
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,670
Yeah.

524
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,670
Was he a good guy?

525
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,080
No.

526
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,390
He was a perverted geezer.

527
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:46,710
But still you liked him.

528
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,660
Yeah.

529
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,630
Jeong Hoo, there are a lot
of good people on your side.

530
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,050
- Me?
- Yeah.

Mr. Candidate Kim Moon Sik!

553
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:19,900
I watched the broadcast well.

554
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,640
Thank you. I couldn't show you properly yet.

555
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,550
Shall I say we are just starting now?

556
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,200
"We?"

557
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:33,690
Candidate Kim, there's probably no "we" to you.

558
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,100
Looks like you're still young.

559
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,960
Over here, the word "we"

560
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,690
is a word for mutual survival.

561
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,600
That's why even when one is betrayed or suffers humiliation,

562
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,620
we'll still stick well together.

563
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,070
We are very sturdy.

564
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:56,760
What keeps your side sticking together?

565
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,220
Cause (justification)?

566
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,910
I just got a call.

567
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,910
Candidate Kim's secretary, Oh Tae Won,
arrived at the police station.

568
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:15,800
If this friend starts to open his mouth, it'll be never-ending.

569
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,380
- Will that be ok?
- It'll be ok.

570
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,230
I plan to bail him out again.

571
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,670
Will that be okay for you?

572
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,680
Well, I lack in sleep, but I'm still healthy.

573
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,080
Do those kids believe in you?

574
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,910
With this shallow justification that you have,

575
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,050
do you think you can keep those kids,

576
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,950
as you continue to say "we," "we."

577
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,950
Just don't mess with the kids.

578
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,050
Even for you, Hyung, who has hit the rock bottom.

579
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,520
Didn't you mess with them first?

580
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,510
Looks like they grew up well.

581
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,810
Why do you stir up kids who are living well?

582
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,910
Do you still have nightmares?

583
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:06,420
It's enough if it's just you.

584
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,790
Do you have to do that to the kids as well?

585
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,430
Mr. Kim Moon Sik?

586
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,500
You guys are always going to be like that:

587
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,990
Dividing this side and that side, making enemies.

588
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:20,250
Can I consider this phone call
to be a declaration of war?

589
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:29,120
I thought I had received a declaration of war earlier.

590
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,660
It wasn't? Huh?

591
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,730
No?

592
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:22,880
This is Chae Yeong Sin.

593
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,980
The person you have called is on the phone.
You will be transferred to voice mail.

594

This is Choi Myeong Hee. Do you remember me?

595
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,620
Of course. Hello.

596
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:34,730
Do you have time? I want to meet.

597
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,810
Of course. I have a lot of time.

598
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,990
When should I come?

599
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,570
Ah, to your house?

600
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,510
No, not at all, I can find it.

601
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:52,230
To be honest, you didn't contact me, so I had given up about 80%.

602
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:53,720
Thank you.

603
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:56,230
Then, I'll see you later.

604
00:57:05,290 --> 00:57:09,060
Chae Yeong Sin?

605
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:12,020
- Yes, that's me.
- This way, please.

606
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,160
Do you remember who I am?

607
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,040
Ah, yes. Hello.

608
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,970
My wife called you, didn't she?

609
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,630
Yes, just now.

610
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:31,210
Let's go. We'll give you a ride.

611
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:34,700
Oh, you don't have to do that.

612
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,000
Get in.

613
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,310
Yes. Then, thank you.

614
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,160
You don't drive?

615
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:54,960
Well yes, I don't have a lot of things I'm afraid of,

616
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,130
but strangely I am scared to drive.

617
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:03,520
No matter how I think, it seems
I must have a trauma from my childhood.

618
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,810
Occasionally, I even have a vivid dream of cars racing down a pitch black road.

619
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,900
I'll start the car.

620
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,630
Go slowly.

00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:20,860

♬ I don't know ♬

627
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:06,300
♬ Why are you attempting to turn away ♬

Healer Preview

00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,000
1992, Sokcho police station.

630
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,570
Seo Joon Seok. Do you remember him?

631
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:16,990
It seems like my brother Moon Ho and the Healer Seo Jeong Hoo joined hands.

632
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,020
That guy knows you're Healer.

633
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,460
He says you're dangerous and a bad guy.

634
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:24,170
Why are you doing something for them?

635
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:26,350
Their fathers were my friends.
[...Healer's / Seo Jeong Hoo's teacher.
...murdered Oh Gil Han, a friend!]

636
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:29,620
Did he say my father killed someone?

637
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:32,760
Chae Yeong Sin, your birth mother is alive.

638
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:35,410
You know Jeong Hoo? He might be in danger.

639
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:37,400
I'll give you money, so hand the tape over!

640
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,260
That way Ahjussi can live!

641
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:50,270
♬ I don’t want to let you go ♬

642
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:54,300
♬ Like dreaming with my eyes open ♬

643
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:00,120
♬ Even if you are near, you seem far away ♬

644
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:05,240
♬ Please stay by my side, ♬

645
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:10,740
♬ If I am able to say those words because I'm afraid you're leaving. ♬

646
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:19,300
♬ Do me right. There aren't many things I want. ♬

647
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:25,100
♬ If it were within your heart ♬

648
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:32,310
♬ If I could see you, that would be it. ♬

649
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:38,170
♬ I don’t want to let you go. ♬

650
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:43,700
♬ I don’t want to let you go. ♬
