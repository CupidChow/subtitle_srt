Episode 13

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,360
Oh my god. Daddy!

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,200
But Healer, this is definitely a trap.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,400
I heard that you met the Chairman's wife recently.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,220
What did you talk about?

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,460
Might it have been your son ...
His name is Seo Jeon Hoo, isn't it?

7
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,730
Did he ask you to find out something
from the Chairman's wife?

8
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,460
It's been more than ten years that I haven't seen him,

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,000
and he hasn't contacted me once in that time.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,650
He said he was going to study abroad, but I don't know where he went,

11
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:37,310
and as you know, I left my young son to remarry.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,360
What right do I have to wait for him to contact me?

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,010
It's probably been a long time since Jeong Hoo forgot about me as well.

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,370
I suppose you have an appointment. With whom?

15
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,670
A friend.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,810
I came to see a friend as well. I'll wait with you.

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,550
I'm going to the restroom...

18
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,280
Alright, please go.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,800
Don't come Jeong Hoo. You can't come.

20
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,980
I think your mom went towards Secretary Oh's car.

21
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,130
The two signals are getting closer.

22
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,780
Oh no, it looks like the door is locked.

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,370
Hey Healer. Long time no see.

24
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm really happy to see you.

25
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,860
Won't you show me your face?

26
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,660
Oh no, I've been caught.

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,080
Hello?

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,170
Is this Chae Yeong Sin?

29
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,570
Yes, it's me.

30
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,770
You know, Park Bong Soo, right?

31
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,250
He should be somewhere in that building.

32
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,470
Our call was disconnected,
but I think he's been injured.

33
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,200
- Bong Sook!
- Can you look for him?

34
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,710
Yeah, I sent the license plate number, so track it!

35
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,810
The fact that they're leaving like this means they've captured their target.

36
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,690
I want to know who that is.

37
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,160
Have you not found Park Bong Soo yet?

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,490
Apparently those gangsters took someone. You said Bong Soo was injured, right?

39
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:27,380
There's blood on the ground, so they must have him now ...

40
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,560
No. That's not so. So calm down.

41
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,500
How do you know?

42
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,910
His location isn't changing.

43
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,220
So look for him there in places where he could hide.

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,730
Who are you? How do you know that?

45
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,870
There isn't enough time for me to tell you that right now.

46
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,750
I like high places.

47
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,910
I can see other people, but they can't see me.

48
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,010
Bong Soo!

49
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:01,890
Hello? There's someone unconscious here.

50
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:07,370
He's bleeding heavily. This is the rooftop of Seongmin Mall.

51
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,510
He's too cold.

52
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,800
Please, come quickly.

53
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,800
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

54
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,240
We suspect hypothermia.

55
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,500
The wound on his arm isn't serious, but he's unconscious.

56
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,650
Blood pressure 80/50, 35.5 degrees Celsius.

57
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,830
Let's change this. Bring the heat lamp and warm up some hot packs.

58
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,850
I don't smell any alcohol on him. Did he have some sort of medication? Why is he unconscious?

59
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,150
No, I don't think so.

60
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,450
We'll start suturing the wound right away.

61
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,720
Yes, I understand.

62
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
Is the bleeding okay?
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

63
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,220
He's very muscular, so the wound isn't deep.
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

64
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,090
♬ when there are so many words I want to say? ♬

65
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,910
Yes, Detective Yoon.

66
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,320
No, I didn't wait long.
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

67
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,150
We had something come up too.
♬ Why are you so distant toward me? ♬

68
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:58,140
Oh, then please contact me when it's convenient for you. I'll be waiting.
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over?

69
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,840
Alright.

70
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,690
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

71
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:13,180
Unstored number.
The number you have called does not exist.
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you

72
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,050
Please check the number.
♬ Even if I can't touch you ♬

73
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,790
♬ Even if I can't hug you ♬

74
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,510
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

75
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,030
♬ I will always be looking ♬

76
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,860
Why don't you wake up now, Park Bong Soo?
♬ It's you. ♬

77
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,190
I have a lot of things I want to ask you.

78
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,260
Why were you like that in that cold place?

79
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,080
You were bleeding and unconscious.

80
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,660
Do you know how startled I was?

81
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,180
And who is that woman who called me earlier?

82
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,580
I tried calling back and apparently the number doesn't exist.

83
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,490
Bong Sook! Wake up!

84
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,840
Bong Sook, wake up! Hmm?

85
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,520
Are you awake?

86
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,090
Chae Yeong Sin...

87
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,090
Did you just call my name?

88
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,720
Chae Yeong Sin.

89
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,610
Did he have some sort of medication?

90
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,310
Wait...

91
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,040
♬ It's a beautiful feeling ♬

92
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,620
♬ What we've got deep inside ♬

93
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,200
♬ We've got a flame that will last forever ♬

94
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,710
How many?

95
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,880
Two...two pills.

96
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:53,070
♬ Such a rush of emotions ♬

97
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,590
♬ There's no way we can push it away ♬

98
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,860
♬ 'Cause they'll never  ♬

99
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:07,600
♬  tear our love apart. Our bond will never break ♬

100
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:17,350
♬ Do you believe in the power of everlasting love? ♬

101

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,190
Kim Byeong Sun

103
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,640
♬ Our love is just enough ♬

104
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:35,800
♬ Promise me this forever. We'll always stay this way. ♬

105
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:44,570
♬ We can start at the end of time and do it all again ♬

106
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:54,810
♬ Oh my love, I'm all yours. And there will never be ♬

107
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,450
That person should definitely have something to say to me.

108
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,910
He shouldn't be saying nothing like this.

109
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,520
I'm

110
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,740
prepared to listen.

111
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:15,420
♬ Even through the sands of time  ♬

112
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
Can't it be me?

113
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,330
If you want,

114
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,660
I can live the way you want me to.

115
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,540
For a long time, staying carefully...

116
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,530
by your side like this.

117
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:40,180
♬ No matter if you're near or far, our bond will never break ♬

118
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:50,390
♬ Promise me this forever. We'll always stay this way ♬

119
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:59,140
♬ We can start at the end of time and do it all again ♬

120
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:07,540
♬ Oh my love, I'm all yours ♬

121
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:20,110
♬ And there will never be another one 'cause I'm eternally yours, my eternal love. ♬

122
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,370
Are you done sleeping?

123
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,120
The doctor said you were sleeping.

124
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,520
Yeah I slept a ton.

125
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,470
Are you feeling better?

126
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,340
Yeah, thanks to you.

127
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,040
I heard you brought me here.

128
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,150
Did this person say that? That I brought you here?

129
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,990
Oh...that is...

130
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,130
I'm Chae Yeong Sin. I'm Park Bong Soo's sunbae in the company.

131
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,600
Oh, this is just someone I know.

132
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,820
Hello.

133
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,310
Oh, that's right. Here's the car key.

134
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,290
I'll pay the hospital bill and bring the car to the front.

135
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,540
Oh, Sunbae, I had some sleeping pills because I was having trouble falling asleep,

136
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:35,420
but they must have kicked in a little late. So...

137
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,810
Oh, and this...

138
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,530
I fell down because I was...sleepy.

139
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,680
Are you going now?

140
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,140
Yeah.

141
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,360
With that someone you know?

142
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
Yeah.

143
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,570
How'd she

144
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,050
know that you were here?

145
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,520
You were sleeping the whole time.

146
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,900
Ah, ah that's right.

147
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,860
Someone called me earlier.

148
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,160
I think she was your mother.

149
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,170
Your call was disconnected, so she was really worried.

150
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,520
I should have called back,

151
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,020
but I was distracted and forgot to.

152
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,020
Your mom must have checked all the hospitals near here, right?

153
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,290
Probably.

154
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,560
Go, she's probably waiting.

155
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,910
You were startled, weren't you?

156
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,420
Because of me.

157
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,530
I was startled.

158
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,630
Sorry.

159
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,880
Bong Soo!

160
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,070
You're coming to work tomorrow, right?

161
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,640
You're coming, right?

162
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,310
"Ajumma"
- Your mother is safely at home right now.

163
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,560
I hacked the CCTV in front of that house,
and I'm monitoring it.

164
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,920
What about teacher?

165
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,880
Sang Soo and his gang took him.

166
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,320
Why'd he do that?

167
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,020
Well, I don't think he's dead yet,
so let's keep a watch on that side.

168
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,020
Keep a watch on them?

169
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,740
Are you really feeling okay?

170
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,220
That drug can even knock out elephants.

171
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,370
If you give the wrong amount you can kill someone.

172
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,290
Those ignorant guys...

173
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,570
So where are we going now?

174
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,920
Dae Yong, let's let him rest for now.

175
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
- Go to Kim Moon Sik's house.
- Why there?

176
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,190
He bothered my mom,

177
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,850
and he bothered Chae Yeong Sin.

178
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,950
So? What are you going to do?

179
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:08,050
I have to keep him from doing it.

180
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,220
Are you going to go beat him up?
Like Hwang Jae Gook?

181
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,990
I'm going to kill him.

182
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,680
Crazy punk.

183
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,290
Dae Yong, you're near Gwanghwamun, right?

184
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,020
- Go to the apartment there.
- Stop the car, and you get out.

185
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,890
Get out. Are you not going to get out?

186
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,210
Give me the key!

187
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,610
You idiot, come to your senses!

188
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,330
What? Kill who?

189
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,080
So, first you go and kill one person

190
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,580
and clear your father's name,

191
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,190
and if someone else is a nuisance, you kill another person.

192
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,750
Try doing that.

193
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,840
Are you not going to meet her again?

194
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,170
Are you okay with not seeing Chae Yeong Sin again?

195
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,850
I don't think this is something that will be over if you kill Kim Moon Sik.

196
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:43,080
Let's assume that he bothered your mom because of you.

197
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,610
But shouldn't you figure out why he tried to kill Chae Yeong Sin first?

198
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,350
I can go ask Kim Moon Sik.

199
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,960
He'll probably respond if I beat him until he dies.

200
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,550
Chae Yeong Sin's mom is there too.

201
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,790
Your girl's mom is there. In that house.

202
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,810
Damn it!

203
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,040
Hyungnim, Yeong Sin came.

204
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,370
What time is right now?

205
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,580
But she's a little strange.

206
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,180
- What?
- I can't smell alcohol on her, but her eyes are out of focus.

207
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,730
Did something happen?

208
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,780
Yeong Sin.

209
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:01,930
Sorry. I'll clean it up later.

210
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,720
Hyungnim.

211
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,740
Yeong Sin is crying.

212
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,620
What is it? What's wrong?

213
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,360
Dad.

214
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,240
Yeah.

215
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,570
This bad bastard

216
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,780
deceived me until now.

217
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,180
Who is it exactly?

218
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:51,080
The words that he said in front of me were all lies.

219
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,200
I didn't know that, and

220
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,440
I trusted him and told him everything.

221
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,080
Just talk?

222
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,540
This really bad bastard

223
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,640
from the start to the end made me into a fool.

224
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,520
- But Dad...
- Yeah?

225
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,250
I couldn't say anything.

226
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,460
If I said something...

227
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,920
if I said I knew...

228
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,980
I was scared he would just leave.

229
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,400
I couldn't say anything because I thought I wouldn't be able to see him again.

230
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,040
If I can't see him again, that won't do.

231
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,180
That doesn't work for me.

232
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,600
What should I do?

233
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,740
First, there are two guys that Yeong Sin likes by herself.

234
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,160
Why are you saying stuff that doesn't make sense?

235
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,440
Why would our Yeong Sin like someone by herself,
unless it's the opposite.

236
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,470
It's not what I said, but it's what Yeong Sin said with her own mouth.

237
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:25,000
Ah, enough... move.

238
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,860
But, from my thoughts, those two guys are no problem.

239
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,380
Then?

240
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,460
You know that guy who keeps coming
to our cafe saying he's a hoobae?

241
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,800
- Bong Sook?
- It's him.

242
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,220
So what about him?

243
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,300
You know our Yeong Sin isn't someone to go around and just talk about herself, right?

244
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,460
Well, of course...

245
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,650
Actually when you look at it, our Yeong Sin
usually doesn't have many friends.

246
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,660
I never saw her bring anyone home either.

247
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,860
That's because ex-cons swarm around the house every day ...

248
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,170
Anyway, Yeong Sin says everything to that guy.

249
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,920
-Bong Sook?
-I saw it with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears.

250
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,950
The secrets that she doesn't tell us,
she tells them all to that idiot boy.

251
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,260
So, it's him.

252
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,840
Yes?

253
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,780
Drink this tea at least.

254
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:50,400
I won't tell you to eat dinner. You get indigestion
if you eat when you cry.

255
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,920
I won't cry anymore.

256
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,880
Drink it and sleep.

257
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,100
Dad...

258
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,660
Yes?

259
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,100
Why was it me? It's weird.

260
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:12,280
Actually, it's hard for someone to like me.

261
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,960
That was weird?

262
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,960
At the orphanage, there were a lot of kids
who were younger and prettier than me,

263
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,870
and who listened well.

264
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,220
You said I couldn't talk and didn't listen well either.

265
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,500
You think it's only that?

266
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:35,720
When I tried to wash you, you bit me,

267
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,600
and when you huddled under the floor of the storage room, you wouldn't come out for a whole day.

268
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,140
Also, you were so grubby, the smell was...

269
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,450
Then why did you take me?

270
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,220
I didn't take you.

271
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,400
You did.

272
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,260
I just waited.

273
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,740
I waited, and you came.

274
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,580
-I did?
-You came next to me.

275
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,600
And you took my hand first.

276
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,740
That's why you came with me to my house.

277
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,990
You...

278
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,330
just waited?

279
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,260
Of course. Actually,

280
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,580
I could have waited longer,

281
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,750
but you came to me faster than I thought.

282
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,780
Yeong Sin, you naturally have no patience.

283
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,760
Daughter...

284
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,800
Don't cry. It'll make me sad.

285
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,380
I'm almost done crying.

286
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,380
You've come? Coming to this shabby place ...

287
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,180
At first, we tried to keep him
in the basement storage area.

288
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,880
But, he didn't like that location, so he created a ruckus.

289
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,980
That's why we brought him here...

290
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,340
- Did you say this guy is Healer?
-There's no doubt.

291
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:49,140
But, he kept insisting you were his close friend.

292
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,900
That's why I sent you his picture just in case.

293
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,040
Can everyone leave the room?

294
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,220
Oh, that's dangerous.

295
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,040
It's true that he's a close friend, so it's okay.

296
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,620
Alright.

297
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,460
Everyone get out.

298
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,430
It's been a while.

299
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,490
What should I do? I don't want to shake hands with you.

300
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:33,310
Did you tell those people that you're Healer?

301
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,710
Ah, it was so sweet taking your money from you.

302
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,910
Was it also you who hid in my house the last time?

303
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,890
Why don't you consider to keep hiring me?

304
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,270
For a friend, (I can give you) a 10% discount.

305
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,580
It's not you.

306
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,010
Is Myeong Hee still sleeping?

307
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:58,100
How many hours does she sleep a day lately?

308
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,540
-Yeong Jae.
-You were alive, Kim Moon Sik.

309
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:23,340
You ... When did you get out (of prison)?

310
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,060
Hey. I'm sorry.

311
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,460
We haven't visited you (in prison) once, have we?

312
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,260
How's Myeong Hee?

313
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,340
She's sleeping.

314
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,000
It seems she sleeps more than twenty hours per day.

315
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,440
Both her husband and her daughter died. She probably doesn't want to wake up.

316
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,730
But she's settled down a lot now.

317
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,020
-From the recent check up...
-It's been a long time since I got out of prison.

318
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,040
Two months? Maybe more?

319
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,220
Why haven't you called me all this time?

320
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,820
Because I was so suspicious of you.

321
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,520
Moon Sik, think about it.

322
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,110
One day, three bears went out on a hike.

323
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,800
But then, two out of the three are dead and one survived.

324
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:16,040
But, that one bear that survived suddenly got rid of his junkyard...

325
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,380
Said to be some weird newspaper's... what?
Head of Planning?

326
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,360
He became something like that.

327
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,440
Don't think things by yourself.

328
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,620
You were in prison, so you wouldn't know how much the world changed.

329
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,430
Listen to my story first.

330
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,550
How can a bear become the department head for planning?

331
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:38,560
It's a really weird story, right?

332
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,790
Shouldn't the bear live in the forest?

333
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,010
Joon Seok's son came looking for me saying he wants to know about his father.

334
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,540
If the child asks, the adult should respond.

335
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,460
The kids won't be able to understand.

336
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,820
What we sacrificed to make the world we have now.

337
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,920
The word sacrifice is sacrificing itself.

338
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:16,080
Yeong Jae, this world's peace
that we've been protecting...

339
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,350
I can't forgive anyone who breaks this.

340
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,510
We call those people subversives.

341
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:34,250
Why are you living your whole life as a subversive?

342
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,550
Because we are bears.

343
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,780
Did you join hands with my brother, Moon Ho?

344
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,320
Is that why you want to suddenly dig up what happened 20 years ago?

345
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,830
It was also you guys who told Joon Seok's son about his dad.

346
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,870
If two papa bears died,

347
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,530
then two mama bears and two baby bears are left.

348
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,660
That child made Myeong Hee get hurt.

349
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,940
Usually there needs to be three bears in order for the song to work.

350
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:07,550
♬ Three bears live in one house

351
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:12,740
♬ Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear

352
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,660
I'm very angry.

353
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,670
Don't make me angry.

354
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,920
Moon Sik, can I ask you something?

355
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,630
-Tell me.
-Was Gil Han and Joon Seok the end?

356
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:37,390
There are more people you've killed, right?

357
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,630
But, don't think about touching the two baby bears.

358
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,160
I'm going to protect them.

359
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:53,510
Because I'm their papa bears' friend.

360
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,290
What are you doing here?

361
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,200
Oh, yes.

362
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,540
We're undercover right now.

363
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,080
Oh, work hard.

364
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,420
We came here after getting a report.

365
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,470
What report?

366
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,220
We got a call that someone was kidnapped in this building.

367
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,610
Okay!

368
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,460
The detectives are here right now.

369
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,490
If your identity gets found out it'll be a headache, so please go out the back. Hurry.

370
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,120
See you again, Yeong Jae.

371
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,450
I'll think about it, okay?

372
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,510
This way.

373
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,940
♬ Three bears live in one house

374
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,520
♬ Papa Bear, Mama Bear, Baby Bear

375
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,810
♬ Papa Bear is fat

376
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,900
♬ Mama Bear is thin

377
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,120
♬ Baby Bear is so cute

378
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,510
♬ Shrug, shrug. He's doing good.

379
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,630
Don't you need a search warrant?

380
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,290
Oh, it's not necessary since it's an emergency situation.

381
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,600
There's someone you kidnapped
from the parking lot of Seongmin Mall, right?

382
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,350
If you don't like the word, "kidnapped", how about "forced accompanying?" You've done something like that, right?

383
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,280
What are you saying?

384
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,460
Excuse me, Detective.

385
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,740
Please save me.

386
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,840
Mom, someone is watching right now.

387
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,410
Mom, can you act? Can you try being the mom who is seeing her son for the first time in 10 years?

388
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,350
I just need to act all happy, right?

389
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,790
That's easy. Of course it's easy.

390
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,980
We should order one more thing. What do you like?

391
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,040
I can't talk for long.

392
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,860
Okay.

393
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,760
But are you okay?

394
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,510
Aigoo, how did you know my size?

395
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,890
Look at this.

396
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,620
Oh, I said I wouldn't see you if you cried.

397
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:34,940
I'm not crying. What about me?

398
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm sorry. I haven't told you my phone number,

399
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,430
and I only call when I want to see you.

400
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,120
I even told you to not ask anything about me.

401
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,840
It's okay.

402
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,890
That's the only thing I was able to do for you.

403
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,420
But, I don't think we'll be able to do that for the time being either.

404
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,700
That way you'll be safe although you won't understand.

405
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,320
I understand. I know.

406
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,900
Today I just came to see your face for the last time.

407
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,260
Okay.

408
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,750
So, don't ask me anything about my phone number.

409
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,950
I know.

410
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,960
You live well with your new husband and son.

411
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,980
It's also comfortable for me if you forget me.

412
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,370
Since you abandoned me, I also found my own way of living,

413
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:41,270
-so let's end this here.
-Jeong Hoo, I'm sorry.

414
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,810
There won't be a time where we'll be seeing each other coincidentally.

415
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,420
Since I'll be going abroad once I finish work here.

416
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,490
There won't be a reason to come back to this country.

417
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,890
The end.

418
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:59,440
With this goodbye, it's the end
for my obligation to you as your son too.

419
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,540
Don't cry.

420
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,840
Then stay healthy.

421
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,890
I found you.

422
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,850
Jeong Hoo.

423
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,560
You still remember my name.

424
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,890
Why are you dressed so lightly?

425
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,290
Aren't you cold?

426
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,770
Don't make my mom cry.

427
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,820
Gi Chan! Gi Chan! Stop!

428
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,700
Don't do that to your hyung

429
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,760
Is he your son?

430
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,950
You live together with him?

431
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,900
You live with him,

432
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,050
but why can't I?

433
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,070
I'm sorry, Jeong Hoo.

434
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,780
Please!

435
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:58,030
Don't cry.

436
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,920
What am I supposed to say if you're crying like that?

437
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,450
It's my fault.

438
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,750
What?

439
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:14,000
Your mother was never going
to meet a guy like me.

440
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,290
But I couldn't live without your mother,
so I forced her...

441
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,210
What are you saying?

442
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,970
Your mother always talked about you. It's true.

443
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:28,170
Whenever she talked, she cried and cried again. But...

444
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,830
It's my fault.

445
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,850
Ajussi.

446
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,610
Does she always cry like that?

447
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,220
She cries well.

448
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,420
Don't let her cry because it's annoying.

449
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,200
I'll do that.

450
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,160
I'm sorry.

451
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,320
Give me the jacket.

452
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,900
It's cold. Give me the jacket.

453
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,800
If it was this much they'll keep their hands off.

454
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,600
Anyway, the reason why they touched your mother
was to just check if you were Healer or not.

455
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,700
Kim Moon Sik, my brother isn't that low of a person.

456
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:09,300
Oh, since he's not that low, he used my mom as bait and tried to kill Chae Yeong Sin.

457
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,840
Do you want a cup of coffee?

458
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,230
Why did Kim Moon Sik try to kill Chae Yeong Sin?

459
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:24,260
I came all the way here to ask you that,
so just answer that question, please.

460
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:26,650
It's not my brother. There's a person called Elder.

461
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,340
Wow. What's that now?

462
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,630
The person we'll have to fight against from now on.

463
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:35,230
We? Who's "we"?

464
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:38,440
You and me. Maybe Yeong Sin too.

465
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,480
You can keep the blabbering to yourself,
so please just explain who the Elder is.

466
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,420
I only know that people call him the Elder.
I know neither his name nor his face.

467
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,500
Then what exactly do you know,
Reporter Kim Moon Ho?

468
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,590
I know where and how we should fight.

469
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:59,590
From somewhere and somehow, don't tell me that method

470
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,690
is what a dude who is bad
persistently does causing a stir in broadcasting?

471
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:07,390
- Correct.
-Then what happens?

472
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,480
Don't you think he won't be able to do any more bad things?

473
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,620
It's not my concern whether they do more bad things or not.
This is my method.

474
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,250
First, find out who that Elder is.

475
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:26,310
Then, second, find out if he has any of my dad's police records.

476
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,770
People who are hiding something like to keep records of other people.

477
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,000
There's a 50% chance. And last, third,

478
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,090
make it so that he won't be able to bother Chae Yeong Sin again.

479
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,250
That won't be any use. Even if you kill him
another Elder will rise up.

480
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,320
We'll think about that then.

481
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,040
They're here a bit early.

482
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,270
-Who is?
-The woman I like.

483
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,580
Can you go open the door?

484
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,210
Ah, seriously.

485
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,640
Sunbae...

486
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,750
Hoobae...

487
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,170
So, why are you here...I mean... why are you at your company CEO's house?

488
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:35,340
Really, humanely, Sunday needs to be enjoyed as Sunday...

489
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,460
Oh, the camera man is also here. Why did I have to be here?

490
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,370
Sunbae, we're here.

491
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,840
Thank you for agreeing to the interview.

492
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:59,320
No problem. I was also surprised
Chae Yeong Sin is on the right track for the investigation.

493
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,930
How did you think of interviewing me first?

494
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,120
Because you're the easiest one.

495
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,670
Easy?

496
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,200
It's a joke.

497
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,540
Sunbae, hello.

498
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,850
Yeah, you're here too.

499
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:15,080
Ha, ha.

500
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:22,150
Here, take a nap after taking your medicine.

501
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,730
Why?

502
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:28,150
I don't want to eat it. I'm going to stay awake.

503
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,930
Doctor Jo said to rest.

504
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,710
Why do you keep trying to make me sleep?

505
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,040
You're sick.

506
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,000
It's okay even if I'm sick. I want to think a bit.

507
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:47,120
Think about what?

508
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,420
It's been such a long time since I thought about something.
What should I start with?

509
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,800
For example, my hospital bills?

510
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,820
What hospital bill?

511
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,930
22 years ago, after the accident,
I had been at the hospital for over a year.

512
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:08,080
I also had multiple surgeries,
and my hospital room was always for a VIP.

513
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,900
What about that?

514
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,130
Where did you get that money from then?

515
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,650
I already told you. I sold the junkyard.

516
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:24,100
How much you sold your junkyard for and
how much my hospital bill was.

517
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,570
I'm doing math. Addition and subtraction.
The very basic one.

518
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:34,700
You seem very stressed after meeting Joon Seok's son.

519
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:37,280
So, here...

520
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,440
I said I'm in the middle of doing math.

521
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:58,010
From what we investigated, Kim Moon Sik had
owned a small junkyard until 1992.

522
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,350
That was all of his assets.

523
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:01,460
It was.

524
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,790
Then, in the spring of 1992, he sold the junkyard.

525
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,780
That summer, he was specially appointed as the head of planning at Je Il Newspaper.

526
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:15,020
Then his position just grew higher. It probably took him about 5 years to become Je Il Newspaper's CEO.

527
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,680
It doesn't really make any sense.

528
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,140
He was someone who wasn't hired through open recruitment but through a special appointment.

529
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:23,730
Is it possible to be a CEO in 5 years?

530
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:28,400
I was also shocked. Back then, a lot of guests
visited our house frequently, almost everyday,

531
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,920
but as I recall, there were a lot more people
other than newspaper people.

532
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,270
What do you mean by other people?

533
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,660
The ones I remember most clearly were the people from Omega Venture Capital, which was an investment company.

534
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,980
Omega Venture Capital, you say?

535
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,120
Back then, Je Il Newspaper was at the verge of bankrupcy.
This company bought all those shares.

536
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,960
Right after that, Kim Moon Sik, my brother,
became the CEO.

537
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,900
Interesting, isn't it?

538
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,880
Do you know I haven't been able to sleep for thirty six hours?

539
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,680
I have to hack into the Immigration Bureau
to make entry documents for you.

540
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,140
Aish, why is it Russia of all places?

541
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,870
I need to be able to read this. Also,

542
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,060
I need to keep eyes on Kim Moon Sik's place
and Sang Soo's underlings.

543
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,980
So, Teacher is at the police station? What is this? Did he get arrested?

544
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,140
Don't worry. Don't you know him?

545
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,370
He'll crawl out with his own feet by tomorrow at the latest.

546
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,950
Teacher was in prison for over 10 years.

547
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,910
He can't get arrested again.

548
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:17,280
What should I do? Should I go and drag him out?

549
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,380
Be quiet! Stop distracting me!

550
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,130
Wait, Ajumma... Ajumma.

551
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,180
She likes it.

552
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,030
This is the information about Je Il Newspaper's
financial status I've been collecting.

553
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,190
And these are the materials related to Sam Han Industry.
You will find some similarities between those two.

554
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,970
I'll try to organize it.

555
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,300
You can do it by tonight, right?

556
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,410
-Tonight...
-Of course, there's no problem.

557
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:00,160
Excuse me, I have some business to do tonight...

558
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,230
Jong Soo.

559
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,390
You also follow them. There's no time.

560
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,890
Then, Reporter Chae, at the company?

561
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:10,680
It'll be cold at the company at night. Let's just go to my house.

562
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:14,150
Oh that's great. Then will you also give us dinner?

563
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,920
- Are you good at doing the dishes?
- I did mess duty when I was in the army.

564
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,160
That's great. I can cook, but I'm weak on doing the dishes.

565
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,500
Oh, these are my coworkers. This is my dad and my ajussi.

566
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,730
Hello, I'm Lee Jong Soo. It may be a little rude, but please take care of me.

567
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,140
Oh, yes, yes.

568
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,120
We have something to work on through the night. Can we use your office?

569
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,490
Oh, of course. Use it. Use it.

570
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:52,350
Aigoo, it's our first time meeting, so I should have bought a cake...

571
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,510
We have enough cakes at our place.

572
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,120
But, the cafe is really pretty.

573
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:02,000
The atmosphere is really...

574
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,600
Ah, yeah.

575
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,990
Alright, we don't have much time, let's go.

576
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,800
Ah, wait. You're here again.

577
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:20,460
-Yes.
-Your name was Bong Sook...No, Bong Soo, right?

578
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,540
-Yes.
-Bong Soo.

579
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:31,210
Wait, are you saying it's one of those two? The one who made Yeong Sin cry?

580
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,670
I thought it was Bong Sook just a while ago, but...

581
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,640
Looking at it now...

582
00:50:37,810 --> 00:50:40,000
-What?
-I don't know.

583
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,220
Who is it?

584
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,310
It's not just one or two companies that received a helping hand from Omega Venture Capital.

585
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,980
-Let me see.
-Look here.

586
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:56,240
In 1997, it's Dae Il Machinery, then in 1999, Eastern Science.

587
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,160
Right here.

588
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,850
There are lots of connections to Je Il Newspaper.

589
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,770
East or west?

590
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,480
-What?
-Which side.

591
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,900
East.

592
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,890
All right then.

593
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,840
- For 1 minute we just stand and talk.
-Jeez.

594
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,510
What was west?

595
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:04,210
To hug each other for 10 seconds.

596
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:06,810
Hug me. I want to switch.

597
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:11,500
That's good. You laughed.

598
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,900
Why?

599
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,010
I thought you were mad since you wouldn't look at me once.

600
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,020
It's not that I'm mad. I'm holding it in.

601
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,500
-Holding it in?
-Yeah.

602
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,570
Wanting to hold the hand,

603
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:35,490
to hug,

604
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,760
to talk all night long,

605
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,980
and even to kiss.

606
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,930
♬ With memories of meeting you, a dream like a lie ♬

607
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:53,620
I want to do it with that person, but I'm holding it in.
♬ I will still be waiting here for you ♬

608
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:57,340
I'm also angry while trying to hold it in.

609
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:01,630
♬ Because I'm trembling, I can't move ♬

610
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,390
What?

611
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:09,680
♬ When you see me ♬

612
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:15,990
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

613
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:17,880
That guy still isn't coming.

614
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,410
♬ when there are so many words I want to say. ♬

615
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:25,550
There must be a reason.
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

616
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,030
I know.

617
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:31,060
I also think so.
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

618
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,350
You think so?
♬ Why are you so distant toward me ♬

619
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:37,660
Yeah. Even so, he's still a bad guy, isn't he?
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

620
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,060
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

621
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:45,120
I know, right?

622
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:50,760
I'm going to wait. I'm going to wait,
♬ There isn't even anyone else but you ♬

623
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,610
but I'm still angry. A lot.
♬ Even if I can't touch you ♬

624
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:58,130
♬ Even if I can't hug you,
Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

625
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:04,960
♬ I will always be looking. ♬

626
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,570
♬ It's you. ♬

627
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:18,500
♬ I love you. Come back to me. ♬

628
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,810
♬ There isn't anyone else but you. ♬

629
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:28,470
♬ Even if I can't have you. Even if I can't say anything ♬

630
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,320
♬ I love you like this. ♬

631
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:39,070
♬ I will always be looking. ♬

632
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,070
♬  It's you. ♬

633
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:49,890
Je Il Newspaper's Kim Moon Sik's success story...

634
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:25,060
Have you eaten?

635
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,780
Eat a lot.

636
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,980
This restaurant's radish kimchi is really good.

637
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:42,620
Real Name: Gi Yeong Jae. Sentenced to 11 years and 2 months for violating the National Security Law.

638
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:45,550
Released February of 1993.

639
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,280
Your current address is Hyeonnam-myeon.

640
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,210
Hyeonnam-myeon? Where is that?

641
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:55,560
- Yangyang County, Gangwon Province.
- Oh. Gangwon Province is good.

642
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,880
Perhaps...

643
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,730
do you know the name Jo Min Ja?

644
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,020
It seems like it's a girl's name.

645
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,480
You can't forget her since she visited you five times while you were in prison.

646
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,870
Jo Min Ja, she was a detective of Cyber Team
back then and my immediate sunbae.

647
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,730
I really liked that person.

648
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:29,180
You liked her.

649
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:34,340
Her hacking skills were legendary.

650
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,260
I learned a lot.

651
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:42,380
But, yesterday at the parking lot I felt something I missed.

652
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:47,990
It was the root key I've learned after being hit at the back of my head numerous times.

653
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,010
It was that pattern.

654
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,970
Detective,

655
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:12,880
I think I'll have to

656
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,410
turn myself in.

657
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,790
- Turn yourself in?
- I am,

658
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,500
in fact,

659
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,600
Healer.

660
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,930
- What?
- It's weird.

661
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:31,860
What is?

662
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:36,010
About an hour ago Kim Moon Sik's psycho
met with someone.

663
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:39,490
- And?
- That guy looked familiar.

664
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,030
For an hour it was bothering me.

665
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,290
Come on, cut to the chase, so what?

666
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:47,060
It was Yoon Dong Won's underling.

667
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,110
Aish.

668
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,150
I started working as the Healer a year after I was released.

669
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:59,540
The name Healer is from the magazine
that I had made with my college friends.

670
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,930
It's cool. Healer.

671
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,070
I'm sure you worked with a hacker as your partner.

672
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:11,160
I did, but I don't know that person's face.

673
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,270
I also don't know the name. It's how we do things.

674
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:20,930
-What's the first assignment you did?
-Can't we just start with the recent ones?

675
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,190
I don't have much time left.

676
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:43,610
What's the most recent assignment you did?

677
00:58:43,610 --> 00:58:48,040
You know Je Il Newspaper's CEO Kim Moon Sik, right?

678
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:50,920
He asked me.

679
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,860
Do you know Go Seong Cheol? He's from L.A.

680
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:59,200
- You know Hwang Jae Gook, right?
- I do.

681
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,120
I went through that house's safe.

682
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,220
It wasn't suicide, right?

683
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,980
Hwang Jae Gook...

684
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:13,360
Look here. Gi Yeong Jae.

685
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:18,140
I told you. I don't have much time left.

686
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:29,670
Gi Yeong Jae! Gi Yeong Jae!

687
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,940
Hey!

688
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:36,770
♬ You're the person who made me have a dream again ♬

689
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:43,990
♬ The person who filled my empty mind again ♬

690
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:51,170
♬ Because of you,
because of you, ♬

691
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,530
♬ Today I love you silently again ♬

692
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:00,400
Do you remember someone named Gi Yeong Jae?

693
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,900
Now, I'll do it on my own.

694
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,750
You want to meet Kim Moon Sik?

695
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:08,200
I want to meet his wife.

696
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,980
Tell me what I should do!

697
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,500
For the past 20 years it was hard for me since I couldn't do anything.

698
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,450
Others say you are brave,

699
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:21,530
but you always fight up to the point where you won't get hurt.

700
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,330
Is that person okay?

701
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,100
Where is he? Please.
