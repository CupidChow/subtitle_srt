1
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
My dream... is to not dream.

2
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,280
From that day on and even now
I'm having that dream.

3
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,180
When I haven't had that dream for a few months,
when I start to think I finally forgot about it,

4
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,760
it comes back to me without fail.

5
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,970
I've committed a sin.

6
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,990
A strong wind was blowing on the rooftop of the 25-story building.
Episode 3

7
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,140
She was standing on the edge like this, and her body was...

8
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,700
Her eyes had already lost their focus.

9
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,960
She could have fallen in an instant, but then, I...

10
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,510
Wait. Talk to me. There's something you want to say, right?

11
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,570
I'll listen to everything.

12
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,400
At first it was like she didn't hear what I said.

13
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,340
But I didn't give up and continued.

14
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,830
I thought, what should I say so that this woman would listen to me?

15
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,090
In my head, my brain was being operated fully with steam coming out of it, throwing out all sorts of words.

16
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,600
At that moment, that woman was listening to my words.

17
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,330
- What did you tell her?
- Huh?

18
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,590
I don't remember what I said. I was just spitting random words.

19
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,400
But some of them must have worked.

20
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,270
You know who I am,
the Queen of Eloquence and Persuasion.

21
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,210
Hey. But, until when will that lady stay here?

22
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:28,830
It's just a bit awkward to send her right away.
She lives alone too.

23
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,090
Do you feel uneasy (that she might try suicide again)?

24
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,060
I am uneasy.

25
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:38,540
So we should look after her for the time being then.

26
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,130
We'll have to look after her.

27
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:43,600
- Who?
- I have to go to work. I'm an office worker.

28
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,560
Then, me?

29
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,700
Well, seems like that.

30
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,940
With people who have once made up their minds like this, you don't know when they will try it again.

31
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,930
Depression is a disease.
It's not easily healed.

32
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,820
So that's why we...

33
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,570
Hey, is it... is it salty or bland?

34
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,440
Oh, you should have breakfast.

35
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,700
Le- Let's have breakfast.

36
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,030
Don't you have someone to be with?

37
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,030
Friends or relatives?

38
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,890
I don't have anyone.

39
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,760
Don't you have to go back home? Maybe grab some clothes or makeup?

40
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,870
Those guys will be waiting there.

41
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,870
Those guys...

42
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,430
If it's something worrisome like that,
don't you have to talk to the police?

43
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,410
I have a request.

44
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,530
I don't have anything else other than this.

45
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,000
Please let me stay here for a while.

46
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,690
Staying here...

47
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,660
Well, about sleep, you can use Yeong Sin's room.

48
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,570
Since I'm the one preparing the meals, it's just going to be one more mouth to feed, so it's alright, but...

49
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,320
I don't have much money left in my bank account, but I'll give it all to you.

50
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,830
- Well, Agasshi...
- Ahjusshi, you are a lawyer, right?

51
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,300
Please take my case.

52
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,760
What is this shitty thing?

53
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,400
(We) got caught again.

54
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,110
My father being nosy and me being unable to refuse other people's requests ...

55
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,450
Ah, why is my family living like this...?

56
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,110
He knows the fact that I cannot share my room with anyone

57
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:11,300
and cannot sleep with anyone in a room. And that's why I couldn't go to any summer camp either, but he still..! Seriously!

58
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,300
My room.

59
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,000
My bed.

60
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:47,410
[Dong Bang Shin Ki's 'Hug']
♬ Even for a day, I want to become the bed in your room.
Oh Baby♬

61
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:55,680
♬ I want to put you to sleep while snuggling you in my arms more warmly ♬

62
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:04,720
♬ Your little tosses and turns, and your faint whispers ♬

63
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,320
♬ I'll win over even the monsters in your dreams♬

64
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,800
♬ How much you love me,  ♬

65
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,210
♬ I am so curious. ♬

66
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,490
♬ Inside your little drawer, ♬

67
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:33,310
♬ I am so curious if you love me ♬

68
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,520
♬ Inside your little drawer, ♬

69
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:42,540
♬ I want to be your diary ♬

70
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,420
My phone.

71
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,870
Clean up your room! You're going to share it with a guest!

72
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,330
Oh jeez, I'm going to take care of it.

73
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,340
Did I forget anything?

74
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,940
Jeez.

75
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,790
Sunbae, why are you only here now?

76
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,860
Chief has been looking for you. The mood there is serious. Please hurry.

77
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,630
Please!

78
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,810
"Without Soosung Company, the economy
of the Republic of Korea won't run at all."

79
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,410
This is what Choi Kang Hoon, Minister of Strategy and Finance, recently said during the meeting of his ministry.

80
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,420
However, as for Soosung Company, all those suspicions about lobbying the high ranking officials...

81
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,770
What's wrong with your face? Did a woman hold you up all night?

82
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,100
Take it easy. If anyone sees this, they'll think you're my wife.

83
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,720
... not a single suspicion could be properly...

84
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,330
You won't be able to get away
with just one written apology this time.

85
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,520
I got it. I got it. Just give me any (reprimand),
I will accept whatever, suspension or pay-cut.

86
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,660
Your brother came.

87
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,410
What?

88
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,490
He's in the president's office right now.

89
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,990
Why?

90
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,890
It's your brother. Why would you ask me?

91
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,750
There's a thing called a limit.

92
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,960
- What?
- No matter how much pull you have in the background that you don't have anything to fear, there's still a thing called a limit.

93
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,720
Among many suspicions about Soosung Company,
the illegal inheritance issue is on the rise recently.

94
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,740
We also investigated the illegal inheritance of the Soosung Company's owner's family,

95
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,530
but we couldn't air it during our regular news time.

96
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:33,300
"Still needs more investigation" was the reason given
for why the story was rejected,

97
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,420
but I guess the real reason was that ABS couldn't overlook the fact

98
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,890
that there are dozens of advertisements for Soosung Company which ABS airs everyday.

99
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,390
Just one minute, Reporter Kim Moon Ho...

100
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,260
Recently many high-ranking managers of TV stations have been hired by Soosung Company,

101
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,090
so we should think about that...

102
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,230
What's wrong with you? Are you going through puberty at that age?

103
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:01,540
Can't be, at my age...

104
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:04,010
Do you have any grudge against me?

105
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,930
Do you want to chase me out of this station that much?

106
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,030
Does it bother you that I became Chief first
despite entering the company at the same time?

107
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,090
- Min Jae.
- I'm your Chief.

108
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,100
Ah, Chief, then why did you block me from airing the news I've been investigating for more than 3 months? (in honorifics)

109
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,950
You can't go on this program anymore.

110
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,760
No, I like that program. It's a live broadcast.

111
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,010
I have to personally check your stories.

112
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,200
Before your stories get into the editing room, it will go through me first.

113
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,570
No way, if you openly favor me like that,
other people will...

114
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:39,420
Although I want to fire you right now, ...

115
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,680
That's unfair dismissal. I will sue you and the president.

116
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:50,440
Stop it. I know we can't dare to touch you,

117
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,770
the only younger brother of that megamedia company Je Il Newspaper's owner.

118
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,960
This place might be a playground to you, but to me, it's the place I've pursued for my whole life.

119
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,650
Stop messing around.

120
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,740
Okay, I'm sorry.

121
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,640
- But you...
- What about me?

122
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,280
Is the place you've pursued for your whole life something like this?

123
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,920
Sitting there and censoring (the news)
while trying to read the minds of high-ups?

124
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,300
Does saying it that way make you feel that you're something?

125
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,260
Or maybe not.

126
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,770
What's weird?

127
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,910
It's weird. A media mogul goes to a broadcast station to meet its president who lives on a monthly salary.

128
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,680
There are many other places like hostess bars, luxury restaurants or those secret VIP clubs, you know.

129
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,430
I've made an appointment at that secret VIP club.

130
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,010
Make time tomorrow night. All media's influential people will be there.

131
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,870
Hyung, we're in different leagues.
What's wrong with you?

132
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,160
Come to my league.
It's time for you to do so.

133
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,650
I already told your president.

134
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,310
I need Reporter Kim Moon Ho.

135
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,130
That I'm going to bring you over to my newspaper.

136
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,600
What's this? Are you going to start a clan system or whatnot?

137
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,840
I'm not even your son. By chance, you're not going to make me your successor or anything like that, right?

138
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,900
That's too much like 80's style.

139
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,560
You're my kid.

140
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,230
Why are you being so tacky, seriously...

141
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,010
Myeong Hee and I don't have any children.

142
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,260
You're a son to us.

143
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,300
- Hyung.
- What?

144
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,240
I'm not your kid.

145
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm not Myeong Hee's kid either.

146
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,990
- Moon Ho.
- Just leave me alone...

147
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,480
If you mess with me, I'll rebel.

148
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,650
Kid.

149
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,910
Don't make me rebel.

150
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,390
Yes.

151
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,670
Lee Joon Bin and Oh Seon Jeong seem to be together inside the apartment right now.

152
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,320
Reporter Lee went to meet the guard
of this apartment. What shall I do?

153
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,000
Should we wait for them to come out or ask people around first?

154
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,840
Caller: Mr. Chief

155
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,020
Yes?

156
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,660
Did you see it? You saw it, didn't you? Huh? Did you see it? She saw it!

157
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,110
If you saw, or you didn't, why didn't you call! Why?

158
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:23,590
W-w-what (did you say)? "I'm doing a stakeout all night, so I have no time to write any other news"? Ah, seriously...

159
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:29,920
You punk, Daily Patch released the article an hour ago. Every reporter in the country has gone there already!

160
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,410
Where has our Reporter Chae on stakeout been,
and what have you been doing?

161
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,180
Why won't you answer, Chae Yeong Sin?

162
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:47,350
I'm in an elevator, so I can't hear you well, zzzz....
Chief, I'll have to call you back, zzzz...

163
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,140
- Hurry! Hurry!
-Yes, yes. I understand.

164
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,470
What? Oh Seon Jeong isn't there?

165
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,710
They don't even order any delivery either.

166
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,050
Oh, Reporter Chae! You're late.

167
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:11,430
How can you survive in this field if you're always one step behind?

168
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,030
Ah, seriously...

169
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,220
Ahjumma.

170
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,200
Why did you turn off your tracker?

171
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
I had some thinking to do.

172
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,900
I told you not to think about it. Where are you right now?

173
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,430
In front of the house of the woman who has my picture.

174
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,400
Have you gone out of your mind? I told you to go under the radar.

175
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,820
Just stay in your house, I said!

176
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,900
How could she have my picture?

177
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,420
Why is that YOUR picture? It's the picture of your clothes and hat.

178
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,240
See, there was some guy requesting DNA specimens for a paternity test.

179
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,610
So, we gave him the specimen.

180
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,410
You cut her nail and gave it to him.

181
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,140
And what was the next request?

182
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,730
He wanted me to find out everything about her,
so I had to follow her 24/7.

183
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,570
In other words, in the place where this woman is,

184
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,810
I would be there.
Something like that. But then,

185
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,640
you said I became a wanted suspect for murder.
Hold on for a second.

186
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,800
Is this girl a lure to catch me?

187
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,480
When you're that smart,
why are you still staying near that girl?

188
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,220
Someone is framing you for Go Seong Cheol's murder.
That's why, you...

189
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,830
Are you listening?

190
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,380
Yes. What?

191
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:58,300
That 'someone' didn't just leave our e-mail address after killing Go Seong Cheol.

192
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,900
That guy knew the address of the love hotel
that you hid Go Seong Cheol in.

193
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,070
Who paid the bill at that hotel?

194
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:08,850
I did with cash. You said
you would reimburse the expense.

195
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,990
How about the receipt?

196
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,340
Of course I got rid of it. I ripped it to pieces and threw it in different trash cans.

197
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,510
But, that receipt turned up inside Go Seong Cheol's pocket.

198
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:24,880
Wow. Whoever did this is great. So?

199
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
They must have tracked you from the CCTV of a nearby motel.

200
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,950
I know a detective who works so fast like this.

201
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:40,330
The guy beside victim Go Seong Cheol goes by the code name Healer.

202
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,120
Our cyber team was able to find some other pictures of him.

203
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,890
Most of them are like this. The CCTV captures were of poor quality.

204
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,250
His hat, his hoodie, his sunglasses, they all hide his face.

205
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,310
Even the people he approached couldn't account for his face either.

206
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,850
Even for his age, he could be from his 20s to his 40s.

207
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,020
Then, is this guy something like a "fixer"?

208
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,220
A "fixer" who will take care of anything without any question as long as he's paid for that, something like that?

209
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,030
Well, his crimes had been limited to the violation of the Communications Security Law, trespassing or theft so far,

210
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,530
but the targets of those crimes cover a very wide range.

211
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,390
Not only big corporations,
but also the servers of national institutions...

212
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,310
Wait a sec.

213
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,900
The autopsy result for Go Seong Cheol came out.

214
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:43,370
It says the cause of death is
the dyspnoea and neural paralysis caused by poison.

215
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,870
- So it wasn't a suicide?
- Now that's confirmed.

216
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,470
"Traumatic cerebral hemorrhage and fracture of cervical spine which were considered as an evidence of death from fall

217
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:56,870
are now speculated to have occurred after his death..."

218
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,830
So, we surmise that someone gave the poison
to Go Seong Cheol first to murder him,

219
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:13,260
and later threw away his body from the moving train.

220
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,400
Through the drug test, poison
compounded with aconitine was found.

221
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:25,780
With just a tiny bit of this poison, a person's
lung gets paralyzed quickly and that causes death.

222
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,600
Then, this means Healer is even doing murder by contract.

223
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,190
Isn't that the attribute of a criminal?

224
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,300
If one doesn't get caught,
he/she repeats that,

225
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:41,600
and while repeating that, the nature
of their crimes become harsher and meaner.

226
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,130
So, we should hurry and arrest him.

227
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,640
The autopsy result came out.

228
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,170
- Cause of death : dyspnoea and neural paralysis by poison
- Small amount of Aconitine is found from the blood of the victim

229
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,010
-It says someone used poison to kill him.
-So then, who did that?

230
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:07,990
The guy knew that Go Seong Cheol and I stayed in that hotel,

231
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:11,760
so he could make a receipt of that hotel later.

232
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,720
And, the guy who could put that receipt
in Go Seong Cheol's pocket.

233
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,300
So, who is that guy?

234
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,440
- You, Ajumma.
- Come on!

235
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,140
Or, the client who requested that case.

236
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,030
Wait, wait... Be quiet for a moment,
I need to sort out my thoughts.

237
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,160
Please tell them like this.

238
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,440
If they are from Je Il Newspaper, sending me to the United States would...

239
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,230
would not be too hard for them.

240
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,590
He definitely said Je Il Newspaper.
The problem is who is it from there.

241
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,370
He wanted to leave the country today.

242
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,860
He said he would get caught if he uses his own identity and goes through the airport.

243
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,790
That's why... Yes.

244
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,490
Yes.

245
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,550
They say they will prepare a new passport.
Getting a plane ticket would be dangerous,

246
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,990
so they would prepare a boat for you in Busan.

247
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,940
That's why you would have to go to Busan. Would that be alright with you?

248
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,750
He has agreed. How would he get the passport?

249
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,270
To Busan, KTX 313

250
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,910
Something bothered me.
Should I have followed him to Busan?

251
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,450
I did ponder on it for about half a second.

252
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,600
That's not right. Go Seong Cheol is always B,

253
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,030
and we receive money from A.

254
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,970
We always only do what A tells us to do.

255
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,080
We receive items as per orders, and deliver it to them. That's the end of the story.

256
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,530
But, that A is tying me down right now.

257
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,020
Moreover, as a murderer who uses poison.

258
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,330
But why use a poison if you kill someone? So bothersome.

259
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:45,230
I'm ordering you as your boss.
Leave that place right now.

260
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:49,570
Leave, and then what? Live my whole life on the run, becoming a murderer?

261
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,980
What are you going to do then?

262
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,840
I have to catch him. The real killer.

263
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,380
I can't trust the police.

264
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,850
I will catch him and toss him over to the police.

265
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,170
Is it this guy?

266
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,590
What? Who?

267
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,630
Hey, Healer.

268
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,890
I wanted to know.

269
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:21,210
Who would throw so much money to confirm a blood relationship through DNA testing?

270
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:24,020
Is it really a client without any ulterior motive,

271
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,010
or someone who is using a lure to catch me?

272
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,880
Track this car.

273
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,930
Find out about this guy as well.

274
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,680
But I think I saw this face somewhere.

275
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,700
Oh? This is Kim Moon Ho.

276
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,730
You don't know Kim Moon Ho?

277
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,290
Kim Moon Ho? Who is he?

278
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,050
He's a reporter, a star reporter.

279
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,850
Don't you even watch the news--
Right, you don't.

280
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,840
But, what's with this one?

281
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,250
What?

282
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:54,930
It came up on the search. He's the younger brother of the President of Je Il Newspaper.

283
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,770
Then, what can we conclude?

284
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,480
Okay, time to stop using our brains.
Next.

285
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,920
I have to just face it.

286
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,450
Face? Face what? Hey, hey, Healer!

287
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,840
COFFEE BAY & Chae Chi Soo's Legal Office

288
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,330
Her name is Ji An.

289
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,370
Ji An, Uncle Moon Ho is here.

290
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,190
When are you going to grow up and call him Uncle?

291
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,060
Ji An is pretty, isn't she?

292
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,320
Yes, she's pretty.

293
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,890
Noona's daughter has grown up beautifully.

294
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,380
Something's fishy.
Something's fishy. Something's fishy.

295
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,820
What?

296
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,660
Ahjusshi, I feel like something is pulling
the back of my head lately.

297
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,590
Someone seems to be following me around.

298
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,720
Who? A man?
Is it a man?

299
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,750
Is it? Is it really a man?

300
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:24,360
Ah this guy, should have just said if he likes me.
Why couldn't he say it?

301
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,220
Does he think his feelings will go away if he just holds them in?

302
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,250
How would you know? How do you know that feeling?

303
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,720
You need to experience it to know it.

304
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,170
Ahjusshi, I'm a veteran reporter for celebrity news.
How would I not know about it?

305
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,410
Is entertainment (yeon-ye) the same as dating (yeon-ae)?

306
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,090
- They are both in the same category all bundled toge-
-Yeong Sin.

307
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,570
They are all the same.

308
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:27,430
There is a speed bump ahead.

309
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,980
He's up to the crossroad. It seems he's going toward the subway station.

310
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,120
10 o'clock direction.

311
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,070
I'm sorry.

312
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,120
Where now?

313
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,250
I arrived at exit no.3 of the subway station.
Where are you--?

314
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,300
- But I could just give you a ride.
- One.

315
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,250
But my Benny is a bit sensitive at throttle grips...

316
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:50,590
- Two.
- That's why, you should take it easy.

317
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,770
I'm going.

318
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,490
After hearing her out, this is the situation in general.

319
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,600
Here. President Hwang,
running a construction company.

320
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,680
He acts as the middle man, a broker who introduces girls.

321
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,270
- And...
- Wait. I am a reporter.

322
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,300
On top of that, a reporter who blew a case that she's been working on with great effort while acting like a good person.

323
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:05,090
I can just go ahead and write about what I hear from here, so please be careful about what you say.

324
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,300
Would you be able to write news?

325
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,060
- Huh?
- I'm asking if you can write
an article after listening to this story.

326
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,370
Ah, that... I'm an entertainment news reporter,
not a local news one, so...

327
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,310
So I can't just write... about anything.

328
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,420
- Hey, she's a celebrity, this lady here.
- Huh?

329
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:30,920
I am an actress.

330
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,950
I did a few movies and dramas.

331
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,830
I just played minor roles, so you might not remember me.

332
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:40,310
Ah, I see.

333
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,770
Listen up.

334
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,870
Here, this person called, President Hwang,

335
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,460
gathered young and powerless actresses like her

336
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,940
and connected them to powerful and wealthy people,
and then made them to perform sexual favors.

337
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,260
News about performing sexual favors
is too common these days, so...

338
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,550
At first, he would drug them to force them to do it,

339
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,630
and then he would threaten them to keep doing it.

340
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:17,340
Threatening them that he would release some videos, something like that. Would you be able to write it?

341
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:20,610
But for this kind of case, wouldn't it be better to report it to the police?

342
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:26,330
I did. ... I went to the police and pressed charges.

343
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,560
- So then?
- They said there was no evidence

344
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,730
that I was forced into doing it.

345
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,290
What are they on about? Of course, you'd go to the police to ask them to find evidence.

346
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,070
Why ask the victim to bring them evidence?

347
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,710
Second that.

348
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,020
And the boss also told me this.

349
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:49,080
That someone like me would be easily
taken care of as a missing person,

350
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:54,210
but I was only kept alive because
that person (sponsor) keeps looking for me.

351
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,810
And so I must be nice to that person, and do as I am told.

352
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:03,140
Before that person gets bored with me,
I cannot even die...

353
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,860
That is the problem.
Here.

354
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,660
This man. A member of the supreme council
of the Justice Democratic Party at the moment.

355
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,100
Number one candidate for the position of Seoul City Mayor.

356
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,900
Assemblyman Kim Ui Chan? Oh god...

357
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,120
A bit strong, huh?

358
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:36,870
Father, we (Some Day Daily) are an online celebrity news site on the lowest level among all B-rated news sites. This is...

359
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,520
I am going to file charges again on her behalf.

360
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,920
This guy, President Hwang, is for quasi-rape,

361
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,760
and for a specific purpose,

362
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,300
if he forced her to perform sexual favors,
that's breach of trust and bribery.

363
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,040
And the man who got that favor...

364
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,320
this man should get charged for taking a bribe.

365
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,780
Although she filed a suit,
the police didn't even bother investigating.

366
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,530
By persistently saying to bring them evidence, they are just trying to bury it. So what can I do...?

367
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,000
That's why we need a news article.

368
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,680
I'm saying that they will only pay attention to this case if it blows up in the media.

369
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,340
These days, netizens (internet citizens) are the scariest.

370
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:34,120
A supreme member of the Justice Democratic Party...
It's even a ruling party, Father, he's a bit too strong...

371
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:40,040
Hey, Daughter, you said
your dream is not to be called Gi-regi.
(a compound word from "Gija (reporter)" and "Ssregi (trash)")

372
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,270
You said you wanted to become like Oriana Fallaci?

373
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:48,940
Ah... Falla... Fallaci...

374
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,260
Why are you here this late? Did something happen?

375
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,460
It took me an hour and forty minutes.

376
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,150
What?

377
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:27,710
It only took an hour and forty minutes
to get from there to here.

378
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,220
What are you talking about at this time of the night?

379
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,490
You did not drink and drive, right?

380
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,250
You're acting strange. What is it?

381
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,330
Let's go in, Noona. It might rain. It feels dismal.

382
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,560
It wouldn't be easy.

383
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,730
I know this well after growing up watching my father's line of work.

384
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,930
This one is really not that easy.

385
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,750
They could bring out all the skeletons in your closet.

386
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:12,140
You might even have to fold your dreams of becoming an actress.

387
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,640
I know.

388
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:20,070
This whole pressing of charge and the trial process will be very dirty.

389
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:23,780
You could even be treated as a gold digger.

390
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,710
It's alright.

391
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,240
You're brave.

392
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,150
It was wrong of me

393
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,660
to go up the rooftop that day

394
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,880
and die alone.

395
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,330
Of course you thought wrong. That's why-

396
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:41,010
It's a shame if I die alone.

397
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,740
That's right-

398
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,730
Huh?

399
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,010
When there are bastards who really needs to die.

400
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:53,020
It's true. There are people who needs to be gone from the face of the earth.

401
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,030
Those people must be gone,

402
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,550
so that the world would become a better place.

403
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,540
Among them,

404
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,690
I will go and take a few of them with me.

405
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,020
I am not going down by myself.

406
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,990
That's why

407
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:14,480
if you are afraid, please quit now.

408
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,620
From helping me.

409
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:26,230
You were quite cool just now. I felt the thrill.

410
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,130
I . . .

411
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:34,580
Of course believe in those things.

412
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:38,780
Human connections and fate, those things.

413
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,610
If those didn't exist, then why are there words for it then? Isn't it?

414
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,400
Even if I want to run away, it's already too late.

415
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:56,740
Since we've met like this, our connection has been formed, and our fate has started.

416
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,640
Ajumma.

417
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,890
What?

418
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,700
What is it?

419
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,230
I . . .

420
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:43,780
from the moment I was born until now,

421
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,190
I was just living just because.

422
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,810
What are you saying?

423
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,820
There was nothing that interests me, but I must live since I was already born.

424
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,880
Living was like that for me.

425
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,070
Just, everyday...

426
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,880
seems like homework.

427
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,590
Why are you like this?

428
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:04,690
What's wrong? Turn your camera on.

429
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,040
But...

430
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,820
right now, I...

431
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,740
something is just

432
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,760
starting to feel interesting.

433
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,260
My heart

434
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,300
is really...

435
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,320
It tickles.

436
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,650
It's the first for me.

437
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,810
I'm the President of Double S Guards, Bae Sang Soo.

438
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,030
Mr. Bae Sang Soo?

439
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:01,400
Ah! Yes!

440
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,100
My master wants your whole team.

441
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,270
That's why you met our Double S Guard,

442
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:11,320
which is the incomparable intelligence team in Korea.

443
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,680
Here is Double S, the initials of my name.

444
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,340
Sang Soo, S and S.
Double S.

445
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,490
As far as I know, you've been hired
by many big corporations so far.

446
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,660
We sometimes do unofficial work
for the government as well.

447
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:30,400
Have you ever met any owners of those companies?

448
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:38,120
We usually contact the actual working group, so...

449
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,120
My owner is inside this car.

450
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,730
Owner?

451
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,780
Will you get on this car, and meet him personally?

452
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,840
It would be an honor for me.

453
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:03,570
In that case, the person inside the car becomes your owner.

454
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,200
Oh, what the heck...

455
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,950
That word "master" is quite uncomfortable, though.

456
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,870
Then I will change my choice of words to fit the times.

457
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,430
He wants to acquire your company.

458
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:22,420
Ah, this is quite...

459
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,160
There's a lot of people who want my company.

460
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,760
There was just one company, Daewon Group,
and the offered price was 2.2 billion won.
(about USD 2.2 million)

461
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:35,000
We'll give you double.

462
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,400
The one will be deposited in your personal bank account by tomorrow morning.

463
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,890
Double S will be ran as it is.

464
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:49,350
Nothing will change on the exterior.

465
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:55,720
But only you, the owner of this company,
will belong to my master.

466
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,760
By "belong to",

467
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,680
What that does mean?

468
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,810
You're selling your soul.

469
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,780
My soul...?

470
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,710
Would you like to meet my owner?

471
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,760
You said the money will be deposited tomorrow morning, right?

472
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,310
I am giving you my greetings.

473
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,780
Aigoo, excuse my impertinence.

474
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,260
Chief! Good morning!

475
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,540
It was my mistake about the Lee Joon Bin-Oh Seon Jeong case.

476
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,090
I have no excuse for it. Please kill me.

477
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:35,740
- Chae Yeong Sin.
- But!

478
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:40,160
Until when are we going to secretly follow celebrities around to catch their secret love?

479
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,040
We are Some Day. That's why...

480
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,450
I brought you an exclusive.

481
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,300
A high-level scoop that could shake up the country's political, business, and entertainment circles altogether.

482
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,010
Please keep quiet for a second.

483
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,590
I was not playing around all this time.

484
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,360
It's all because of this big story...

485
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,670
That mouth. Won't you shut it?

486
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:59,470
Will do. But once you read this--

487
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,950
- Greet him. Say your greetings.
- If you read it--

488
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:04,450
- Hey, you there. Yes, you.
- Yes?

489
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,830
What's your name again?

490
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,180
Ah, my name.
M-m-my n-n-name is Park Bong Soo. P-P-Park Bong Soo.

491
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,830
Park Bong Soo. Bong Soo.

492
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,900
Who?

493
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,430
Your junior you've been longing for. Are you happy?

494
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,080
What's going on? I thought the company has no money.

495
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,450
You're even stingy in giving bonuses, let alone our monthly pay.

496
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:27,120
With our financial situation, how could we get a rookie...

497
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,170
$3000.

498
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,390
He came in with an advertisement worth $3000 a month for a whole year.

499
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:39,460
He's different from someone who can't even come up with a proper article.

500
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,000
$3000? For a year?

501
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,880
This guy...

502
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,160
Just do it comfortably. I'm your sunbae from now on,

503
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,750
-just call me sunbae with respect.
- Yes.

504
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,710
-That would work.
Alright, Chief, read this one.

505
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:10,220
You're trying to wiggle out of it, aren't you? Pulling some tricks after losing an exclusive. I can see right through you!

506
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,020
Just read it just once! You'll know it at once!

507
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:16,220
I feel like if I read this, I'd just stew out of anger.

508
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:19,860
It won't be like that. If you read this,
your eyes would get bigger and...

509
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,750
Go, go, go!

510
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:25,120
- This is our kitchen. First time here, right?
- Yes.

511
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:33,350
In our office, from the Chief down to the newest reporter, everyone makes and gets their own coffee. Don't overdo it and get coffee for someone else.

512
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:39,790
And now, inside our fridge, you can see many foods with a name attached to each.

513
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,670
- I see...
- Something like this, "Don't touch, this is Seon Jae's,"

514
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:46,000
you must never touch.

515
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,410
Never touch them.

516
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:52,140
This was packed nicely.

517
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,240
Here, our hope, Reporter Yeo!
("yeo" also means "woman/female" in Korean.)

518
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,100
His name is "Yeo", but as you can see,
he's a male reporter.

519
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,910
As someone who writes most of our articles,

520
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:08,860
he's a multi-player taking care of not only articles
but also design, marketing, accounting, etc.

521
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:14,400
Without this sunbae, Some Day would have to close its doors tomorrow.

522
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,860
Here is Reporter Noh Seon Jae.

523
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,430
Nice to meet you.

524
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:21,920
Ah, yes. Nice meeting you.

525
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,090
But, do you know?

526
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:25,810
Huh? What?

527
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:28,800
That you are handsome.

528
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,800
Ah, I think... I know...

529
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,810
Alright, enough.
Here is...

530
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,770
I'm Park Chan Yeong.

531
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:42,250
- So you are Reporter Park Chan Yeong.
- Sunbae.

532
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:45,620
This yappy bastard, are you really going to be this way?

533
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,080
What did I do?!

534
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:51,050
Just because I am out of the office for a few days,

535
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:55,890
you put out an article without editing
even one word from a press release? Hey!

536
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,680
That's not true, I did edit a few words.

537
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:01,980
You did? Edited what?
Is that why there were three typos per article?

538
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,460
What was it? Without a royal doctor ("Eo-eui")?
(without "Eo-Yi" means "in amazement")

539
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:09,320
Why is a royal doctor mentioned
in celebrity news? Huh? You idiot!

540
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,470
- What's this?
- Huh?

541
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,290
What?

542
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,270
What's that in your ear?

543
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:26,810
Ah, this one...
This one is, uhh... a hearing aid.

544
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,190
A hearing aid?

545
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:35,090
Yes, people who can't hear well usually wear this.

546
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:42,360
In my case, I still hear well without it, and if I wear it, I don't hear well...

547
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,780
Park Bong Soo.

548
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,680
Yes, I can hear you.

549
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,580
Cheer up.

550
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,530
Thank you. I will wo-work hard.

551
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,760
A member of the supreme council of the Justice Democratic Party...

552
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:15,170
It's even a ruling party, Father, he's a bit too strong...

553
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:21,110
Hey, Daughter, you said
your dream is not to be called Gi-regi.

554
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,720
You said you want to become Oriana Fallaci.

555
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,790
Hyung.

556
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:41,780
Hyung!

557
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,950
You're not coming in?

558
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,690
Choi Myeong Hee

559
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,640
I thought you couldn't come, but you're here.

560
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,390
Moon Ho kept insisting to come.

561
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,700
Of course Moon Ho has to come. He's an uncle.

562
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:14,770
Do you have it?

563
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,810
I only have you.

564
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:24,980
Honey, you've worked hard.

565
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,240
Thank you.

566
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,720
I love you.

567
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:32,940
Aigoo. Moon Sik bought them, but you're the one giving it to me?

568
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:35,610
Do you think I would have time to buy flowers?

569
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,230
I thought I was going to go crazy just being outside of the delivery room.

570
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,770
Hearing your screams from the inside,

571
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:45,010
I almost went inside and caused a ruckus.

572
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,770
(mouthing) Thank you.

573
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,710
Her name is Ji An. She's pretty, right?

574
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,200
What's your name again?

575
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,020
I'm Park Bong Soo. Park Bong Soo.

576
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,250
- Park Bong Soo.
- Yes.

577
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,180
- Bong Soo.
- Yes.

578
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:42,470
Your name is quite... hmm... affectionate.
("Bong Soo" is quite an old-fashioned name.)

579
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,390
But, have we ever met before?

580
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,780
Ah, that would be impossible...

581
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,310
It's my first time seeing you.

582
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:06,020
- Right?
- Yes.

583
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:08,740
Of course, right?

584
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:13,880
This sunbae of yours has some innate qualities natural for reporters. Born-to-be-a-reporter.

585
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,610
First is this wonderful verbal skills.

586
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,870
And second is memory.

587
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:23,740
There is no way I would forget people I already have met.

588
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,150
Ah, yes, Sunbae-nim.

589
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,820
Ah, without the -nim.

590
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:37,420
Reporters don't use that. Sunbae-nim? No, no, just...

591
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,980
Sunbae.

592
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,610
That's right.

593
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,550
Alright, I will treat you to lunch. Let's go.

594
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:01,920
As I see you, I can tell it right away.

595
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,380
You were an outcast while you were in school, weren't you?

596
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:05,630
And in your army service, you were a wack job, right?

597
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:09,590
Since you're that slow,
I doubt that you had any proper job interviews.

598
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:14,010
So your parents must have thrown a lot of money to put you in this kind of place.

599
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:19,780
Come here. I will take care of you. My heart hurts for you, really.

600
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:29,750
Parents can't control all situations for their children. . .

601
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,010
My dream... is to not dream.

602
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:54,550
After that day, I kept on dreaming that dream.

603
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,460
When I haven't had that dream for a few months,
when I start to think I finally forgot about it,

604
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:02,910
it comes back to me without fail.

605
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,640
I've committed a sin.

606
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:28,910
My sin is... silence.

607
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,970
(The sun is) strong. It's already winter.

608
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:08,060
Moon Ho, Ji An likes you, it seems.

609
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,430
Give her a kiss.

610
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:18,510
Do it. Today is the first day after Ji An is born.

611
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:22,480
They say a kiss a baby receives on her first day will be remembered forever.

612
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:28,300
♬ Who are you looking at? ♬

613
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:33,510
♬ What are you thinking of? ♬

614
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:38,240
♬ I often just watch you from your side ♬

615
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:45,040
♬ You probably don't know ♬

616
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:53,720
♬ Don't know why my eyes only look for you ♬

617
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:59,490
♬ Why it hurts while looking at you ♬

618
01:01:59,490 --> 01:02:06,710
♬ Why my heart beats like crazy ♬

619
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:13,740
♬ I don't wanna let you go ♬

620
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:17,870
♬ Like dreaming with my eyes open ♬

621
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:23,570
♬ You're so near, but you seem far away ♬

622
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:29,400
♬ Please stay by my side,
if I am able to say those words ♬

623
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,880
How is it? Do I look like Park Bong Soo the reporter, now?

624
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,070
Bong Soo...

625
01:02:34,070 --> 01:02:37,560
That girl, Chae Yeong Sin, is definitely bait.

626
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,730
Let's cause trouble. What only a human can do.

627
01:02:40,730 --> 01:02:42,180
Reporter Chae Yeong Sin.

628
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,950
I am a fan.

629
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:45,960
Can I talk about it?

630
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,350
About Ji An?

631
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,330
This will be buried in a day anyway.

632
01:02:49,330 --> 01:02:51,040
Who wrote that article?

633
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,260
I can't sleep if I'm sharing a room with someone.

634
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:57,620
One fish has definitely taken the bait.
