1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,910
This is Choi Myeong Hee. Do you remember me?

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:05,800
Of course. Hello!

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,960
Do you have time? I want to meet.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,040
Of course. I have a lot of time.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,680
When should I come?

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,030
Oh, to your house? No, not at all, I can find it.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,510
To be honest, you didn't contact me, so I had given up about 80%.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:26,910
Thank you.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,780
Then, I'll see you later.

10
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,490
Chae Yeong Sin?

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,330
Yes, that's me.
- This way, please.

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,230
Do you remember who I am?

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,220
Yes, hello.

14
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,180
My wife called you, didn't she?

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,700
Yes, just now.

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,370
Let's go. We'll give you a ride.

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,290
Oh, you don't have to do that.

18
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,270
Get in.

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,050
Then...thank you.

20
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,310
You don't drive?

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,050
I don't have a lot of things I'm afraid of

22
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:32,300
but strangely, I am scared to drive.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,720
No matter how I think, it seems
I must have a trauma from my childhood.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,320
Occasionally, I even have a vivid dream

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,150
of cars racing down a pitch black road.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,340
I'll start the car.

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,770
Oh, let's go slowly.

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,450
We don't want our Reporter Chae getting scared.

29
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,280
Ah...

30
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,060
We're not open yet.

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,560
Is Mr. Kim Yong Hoon here?

32
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,420
Sokcho Police Station Chief Investigator Kim Yong Hoon.

33
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,940
Ahjussi, you were the chief investigator

34
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,750
at Sokcho station in 1992, weren't you?

35
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,180
He just sits there all day long like that.
He doesn't talk with people.

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,930
Do you remember being a detective?

37
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,740
Ahjusshi!

38
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,850
When you were a detective at Sokcho station, you received

39
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,890
testimony from Seo Joon Seok, right?

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,080
Do you remember?

41
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,430
Can you not remember?

42
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,130
Sokcho Police Station in 1992. Seo Joon Seok.

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,280
Seo...

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,810
Joon Seok?

45
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,390
Yes, Seo Joon Seok. Do you remember?

46
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,040
Seo Joon Seok.

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,980
Because of that jerk, we lost our jobs.

48
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,210
You lost your job?

49
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,650
Because of Seo Joon Seok, I lost my position.

50
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,520
He is saying he left his position as a police officer.

51
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,720
If it's 1992, then that's correct.

52
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,730
That's when they all got fired.

53
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,890
Do you remember that time? It happened in 1992.

54
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:08,360
When Dad got kicked out, the entire family was about to be homeless. So yes, I remember.

55
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:14,130
Your father just said, "we."

56
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,570
Are you saying that more people got fired?

57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,790
It's Park Dong Cheol. The person who also got fired because of my father.

58
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,420
So he remembers that name?

59
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,450
Since you know the name, you can find him, right?

60
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,810
Am I a vending machine?
Does something come out as soon you insert a coin?

61
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,800
I heard Chae Yeong Sin even knows
the face of "that vending machine".

62
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,470
Wow, even though I've worked with you for 8 years, all I know is that ridiculous picture of a praying mantis or something.

63
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,750
When I heard it, I felt my tears bursting out, Ajumma.

64
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,400
Aigoo, good morning!

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,990
- You are early.
-Oh, yeah...

66
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,970
Chae Yeong Sin just called. She's going to an interview with Choi Myeong Hee.

67
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:00,940
So it's the wife of Candidate Kim Moon Sik, whom you feel uncomfortable saying is your brother.

68
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,880
It's your sister-in-law... so there is no way
you wouldn't know her name then.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,930
Yeah ... Then, yeah ...

70
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,700
"Anonymous Lady"
(Editor's note : Moon Ho saved
Jo Min Ja's number under this name.)

71
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,160
This is Kim Moon Ho.

72
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,960
I always track where Chae Yeong Sin's cell phone is.

73
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,820
She just arrived somewhere that I don't really like.

74
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,380
I was thinking of calling that punk, Healer.

75
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,000
But he has shown his face in too many places.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,270
If I tell him this, he will go crazy and rush over there.

77
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,770
Then, it would be troublesome.

78
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,950
When I look at our Reporter Chae,

79
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,760
you are just born with it, eh?

80
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,250
Ah, well, I'm just...

81
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,960
Your last report made a deep impression on me.

82
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,670
To tell you the truth, you completely out-shined my brother.

83
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,410
The thing is,

84
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,570
I have an appointment with your wife, and it's getting late...

85
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,640
Uh, Madam.

86
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,340
Don't worry. I've already sent her a message.

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,070
You don't need to contact her.

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,040
Since you are a busy person, let's cut to the chase.

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,550
Yes.

90
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,290
First, I would like you to postpone

91
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,190
meeting my wife, Choi Myeong Hee.

92
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,710
May I ask the reason...

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,810
I heard there is a dangerous person around you.

94
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,720
Pardon?

95
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,070
Do you know Seo Jeong Hoo?

96
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,760
- Who?
- Ah.

97
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,810
You must not know.

98
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,020
Then I guess only Moon Ho knows.

99
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,060
If you gave me a bit more of a hint...

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,970
These are people I was close with in college.

101
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,080
This is me. This is my wife Myeong Hee.

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,690
And this friend Seo Joon Seok is Seo Jeong Hoo's father.

103
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,800
He is the 1st generation Healer, Yeong Jae.

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,910
This person died recently.

105
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,020
I met Yeong Jae before he died.

106
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,950
He made Joon Seok's son, Jeong Hoo, Healer.

107
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,480
He said something like that.

108
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:05,670
Do you know night errand job by any chance?

109
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,680
I know it roughly.

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,760
If you pay them, they will do all sorts of dirty jobs.

111
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,520
At least, the first generation Healer,
Yeong Jae, had a standard.

112
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:26,570
But this guy, Jeong Hoo, started crossing the line.

113
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,400
When you say, "crossing the line"...

114
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,340
Is Team Leader Ahn here?

115
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,100
He is on standby.

116
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,000
Let him come in.

117
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,480
There's someone I want to introduce you to.

118
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,770
Let me ask you something first.

119
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,020
Okay.

120
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,790
I...don't know what I'm doing here right now.

121
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,120
It looks like my brother Moon Ho and Healer Seo Jeong Hoo are working together.

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,280
He is willing to do any type of illegal act, in order to oppose me.

123
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,720
He is like a son to me.

124
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,140
According to our investigation, you are very close to my brother.

125
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,580
Before Moon Ho and Seo Jeong Hoo commit an even greater crime, please help me.

126
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,860
Hmm.

127
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,680
This is Team Leader Ahn,
from Je Il Newspaper's Special Investigation Unit.

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,510
Please greet him.

129
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,100
Please give our Reporter Chae a briefing.

130
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,410
She needs to understand, so she can be on our side.

131
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,540
Here.

132
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,550
I've been mostly investigating Healer for the past month.

133
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,410
According to our CEO, you will be of great help to our investigation.

134
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,100
I will?

135
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,580
Here she is, Reporter Chae Yeong Sin in question.

136
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,400
In question? Hmph!

137
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,730
During this time, we have found out quite a lot.

138
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,130
For example,

139
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,970
Healer transferred a video to you

140
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,780
which he had removed from Hwang Jae Gook's safe.

141
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,500
Something like that.

142
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,440
It's been a long time.

143
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,180
Did you come looking for Ji An?

144
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,440
If you're going to mess with someone, mess with me.
Why are you being so petty?

145
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,060
I am planning on making

146
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,510
both Ji An and Jeong Hoo live well.

147
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,460
I'll groom Ji An into becoming a good reporter, and

148
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:00,440
I'll make Jeong Hoo turn himself in and assign a good lawyer to him.

149
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,640
After having him serve as light a sentence as possible,
I will have to make him return to society.

150
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,540
Why?

151
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,850
Why are you doing anything for them?

152
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,350
I...

153
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,960
am a friend of those kids' fathers.

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,810
There isn't a lot you can do for those kids.

155
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,800
At best, an Internet broadcast reporter ...

156
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,380
If not...

157
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,450
continue petty larceny?

158
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,930
Are you the friend of the kids' fathers?

159
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,220
Healer received an assignment, made contact with Go Seong Cheol,

160
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,760
and completed the hand over of the item.

161
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,460
The next day Go Seong Cheol was found dead.

162
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,010
The police want Healer as a suspect.

163
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,270
Healer also stole the video from Hwang Jae Gook's safe.

164
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,860
Two days later, Hwang Jae Gook was found dead.

165
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,100
The case was closed as a suicide.

166
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Within the police department, a strong protest was lodged.

167
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,800
The case is homicide.

168
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,690
Healer is the murder suspect. That was the comment attached to the protest.

169
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,760
Seo Joon Seok, the father
of Seo Jeong Hoo, the second Healer.

170
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,230
He was also a murderer. In 1992, here.

171
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,710
He killed his friend, Oh Gil Han.

172
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,960
Do you have any questions?

173
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,550
Who is this?

174
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,240
Excuse me.

175
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,520
You did say we should call if someone is searching for Seo Joon Seok?

176
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,740
That's why I called.

177
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,040
Yes, we also gave him Park Dong Cheol's name.

178
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,200
But, when will you give me the money?

179
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Should I give you my account number?

180
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,770
The Jangan-dong bait was taken.

181
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,100
I came to get you.

182
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,070
- What?
- Chairman Kim Moon Sik...

183
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,910
thinks Seo Jeong Hoo is Healer.

184
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,360
He also thinks you and Healer are on the same side.

185
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,030
We are on the same side. He and I.

186
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,390
Chairman Kim Moon Sik...

187
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,110
is someone who is in a very high position.

188
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,310
But,

189
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,970
that kind of person came to my house to escort me.

190
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,250
And,

191
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,440
he tells me all those things.

192
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,940
You are also in a high position. You are our CEO.

193
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:00,110
But,

194
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:05,440
you come all the way here to take me during work hours.

195
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,750
Why?

196
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,030
When I first met Healer... No.

197
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,070
The day I first met Jeong Hoo,

198
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,780
he took my finger nails.

199
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,590
That...

200
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,650
he said you assigned him to do that. Why?

201
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,240
- I was going to tell you some day.
- When?

202
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,370
It seems it's the right time now, right?

203
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,260
I never imagined I'd tell you this at an underground parking lot like this.

204
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,220
Chae Yeong Sin.

205
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,750
Your birth mom is alive.

206
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,340
Jeez.

207
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,630
The person you know as my sister-in-law,

208
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,680
the one you were going to meet today, but couldn't;

209
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,610
Choi Myeong Hee is your mom, and your name is

210
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,080
Oh Ji An.

211
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,250
What is that? Seriously.

212
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,930
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you earlier.

213
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,890
I had a reason... No,

214
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,310
I...

215
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,430
I was scared...

216
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,390
I kept postponing.

217
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,210
Ji An, are you alright?

218
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,800
What is he saying?

219
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,500
You should... say something that I can comprehend.

220
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,070
I found it, but...

221
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,330
The store is giving me a bad feeling.

222
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,680
It doesn't feel good to me, either.

223
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,920
You found a police officer who left the job 22 years ago,

224
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,320
and the answer came within just a few hours.

225
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,150
That can't be right.

226
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,390
I totally have a bad vibe.

227
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,350
But what else can we do? We have no other choice.

228
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,800
We will just have turn the trap into a road.

229
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,730
What is it?

230
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,630
I came because I heard Park Dong Cheol is here.

231
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:06,190
- Who?
- Park Dong Cheol.

232
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,880
Didn't you hear me?

233
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,700
Park Dong Cheol!

234
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,060
Aren't you going to give me an answer?

235
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,320
Whether he is here now, or you don't know.

236
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,640
Try waiting.

237
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,750
How long do I need to wait?

238
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,180
I really hate waiting.

239
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,910
Park Dong Cheol.

240
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,110
You know him, don't you?

241
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,360
- Please enjoy.
- Yes.

242
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:05,150
- We're told to wait.
- Wait for what? We should take care of him and start tonight's business.

243
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,350
You're looking for Park Dong Cheol, right?

244
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:17,090
Isn't the Park Dong Cheol whom I'm looking for older?

245
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,170
- Let's go, we'll take you.
- That's a lie.

246
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,910
Go while I'm talking nicely.

247
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,510
Chae Yeong Sin

248
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,700
I have to answer this now. Hold on.

249
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,760
- Oh, finally you called!
- Ah, I have to teach him some manners ...

250
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,580
Couldn't you see? I called your house three times today.

251
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,200
I met with Kim Moon Sik this morning.

252
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,440
What? Why did you meet that bastard? Why?

253
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,790
He knows you are Healer.

254
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,780
Don't move.

255
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,440
Is someone with you?

256
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,640
No. I'm cleaning.
So, after you met him, (what happened)?

257
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,170
They said you are dangerous and are pretty bad.

258
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,390
But didn't Kim Moon Ho tell you anything
about not meeting him?

259
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,220
Kim Moon Ho told me he was sorry.

260
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,990
He said for not telling me

261
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,360
while knowing my birth mother is alive ...

262
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,420
Chae Yeong Sin.

263
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,040
I'll call you again later.

264
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,830
I'm in a bit of a rush right now, so will you just tell me?

265
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,990
Park Dong Cheol. You know him, don't you?

266
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,030
Ajumma, you were right that it was a trap.
But it wasn't the Double S guys. There were new faces.

267
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:15,290
Since I stuck a tracker on their car,
you take care of (identify) them yourself, please.

268
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:21,240
It's clearly him. Because the Elder ordered that you must bring him, don't make any mistake.

269
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,130
Quickly move to the next point.

270
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,580
Park Bong Soo

271
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,870
In 1992, she was in a major traffic accident.

272
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:55,190
Her current condition is as it was then, which you saw in the article.

273
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,140
Your mother's hospital records. The doctor's notes are also there.

274
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,600
While she absolutely needs to rest, ...

275
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,860
status epilepticus, brain damage, depression ...

276
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,530
I don't know what this means.

277
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,880
When stress is increased, she has convulsions.

278
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,120
If the convulsions continue,
oxygen depletion extends to the brain, and

279
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,940
then ... a brain hemorrhage may reoccur.

280
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,790
If it's a serious incident ... brain death may occur.

281
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,560
Your mother has gotten much better,
but whenever we talk about you, Ji An,

282
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,620
it's beyond our control.
Your death anniversary and your birthday,

283
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,030
it seems she only lives
for those two days of the year.

284
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,990
Don't you have any memory? Because you were separated when you were five ...

285
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,600
The highway is the sole memory I have of my childhood.

286
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,450
Highway?

287
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:11,040
I was standing at the side of the highway at night.

288
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,670
That's as far as it goes.

289
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,200
There is no memory of anything earlier.

290
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,760
So, is this everything?

291
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,940
Some pictures, some doctor's notes?

292
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,780
Please understand me.

293
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:32,110
In order to spare your mother, I couldn't tell you.

294
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,800
I understand ... it was easier to do that.

295
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,360
There is my birth mother, but

296
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,840
if you tell her I am her daughter,

297
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,150
then she will die, right?

298
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:51,760
- That's right.
- But, why didn't you tell me?

299
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,100
Just... all I needed to do is to pretend that I didn't know.

300
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:09,970
You're not answering your phone?
Choi Myeong Hee

301
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,070
- Why did she abandon me?
- She lost you.

302
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,910
- Why didn't she look for me?
- She thought you were dead,
because she was told you died, Ji An.

303
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,950
- There are lots of things I have to tell you...
- Does Jeong Hoo know about my birth mom?

304
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,590
I forced him not to tell you. I told him to wait.

305
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,440
Seo Jeong Hoo isn't on my side.

306
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,420
Would you listen to my story first?

307
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,780
Forget it. I'll find out myself now.

308
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,670
Ji An.

309
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,760
Just let me find out, if there is anything there is to find.

310
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,390
Because you can't believe me ...

311
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,570
Yes, I'm sorry.

312
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,640
And, I'm Chae Yeong Sin.

313
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,450
Whether it's Ji Eun or Ji Yeon, I don't know crap.

314
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,590
Ji An.

315
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:19,330
An alley ... entering an alley ...

316
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,910
Seo Joon Seok, the father of Seo Jeong Hoo, the second Healer...
Head of Household: Oh Gil Han (removed from register)

317
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:06,860
He also was a murderer.

318
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,010
In 1992, here, he killed his friend Oh Gil Han.

319
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,940
How can you say that you suddenly can't, when it's only going to take an hour?

320
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,360
Ah! If you say you can't, all of a sudden,
what am I supposed to do? Everyone is waiting here!

321
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,730
- Sunbae!
- This isn't it! This isn't it!

322
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,990
When you write an interview, you should take
its "extract" only and edit it "deliciously"!

323
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,920
Hey, have you got "diarrhea"? Why are you wetting your pants?
Cut everything out at the front.

324
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,820
- Everything in front of this?
- Should I cut you out instead? (meaning "fire")

325
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,430
- I'll cut it out!
- How are you going to do it now? I can't do that.

326
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,930
- What is this, what?
- Why are people rude like that, why, this, this ...

327
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,330
It's Someday. Reporter Chae Yeong Shin went home early today.

328
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:01,070
At the moment when the entire company is burning with sparks all over the place because everyone is overloaded with work,

329
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,690
she quietly slipped away.

330
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:07,050
It appears she's broken-hearted properly.
Have a good day.

331
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:25,460
Obviously, they're going to emphasize Kim Moon Sik's clean image, so ... this bit ...

332
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,580
Yes.

333
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:31,090
in the part about political funding ...

334
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,460
Should we investigate a bit more?

335
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,360
- I need to answer.
- Oh, yes.
- Let's talk later ...

336
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,310
Oh, Noona.

337
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm sorry if I'm calling when you're busy. Should I call later?

338
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,880
What's the matter? I'm sorry I don't phone you more often.

339
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,260
When were you going to tell me
that you become the boss?

340
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,810
Jeez, I'm sorry. My nagging is spewing out first.

341
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,910
I'm calling because I have a request.

342
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,680
At your company, there is a reporter
named Chae Yeong Sin, right?

343
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,030
Do you remember all your employees' names?

344
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,720
There are only a few employees here. I know her.

345
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,050
She was supposed to interview me, but I can't get hold of her after she stated that she couldn't come.

346
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,030
Was it decided not to interview me?

347
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,920
I'm not sure.

348
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,440
Is it not right to ask you, the boss,
to find out about these things?

349
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,120
Noona, I thought you didn't like being interviewed.

350
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,260
That's what I'm saying.

351
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,990
I shouldn't have accepted it
(the interview request), I suppose?

352
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:40,360
It keeps bothering me.

353
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,710
- Noona.
- Yeah?

354
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,120
Chae Yeong Sin...

355
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:53,040
She's personally having a hard time.
So, if I tell her to go meet you,

356
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:56,170
That would be a cruel thing for her.

357
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,750
Look at you. Cruel?

358
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,090
You know, the broadcasters use too strong vocabularies nowadays.

359
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,990
Is that so?

360
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,140
Goodbye.

361
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,370
- Bong Sook!
- Is Yeong Sin upstairs?

362
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,830
Yeong...Sin...

363
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,420
Come out and talk with me.

364
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,780
- We need to talk.
- Let me see Chae Yeong Sin first.

365
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,780
Chae Yeong Sin.

366
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,820
Are you in there?

367
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,190
Can I come in?

368
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,300
I was so worried about you...

369
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,780
That you wouldn't be able to breathe.

370
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,050
Chae Yeong Sin.

371
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,290
Are you mad at me? About your birth mother...

372
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,470
that I didn't tell you?

373
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,990
Just get mad at me. I am sorry.

374
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,130
You didn't do anything wrong.

375
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,140
It's not that.

376
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,030
If that's not it,

377
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,130
why aren't you ... looking at me?

378
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,330
So, Kim Moon Ho finally had the courage to tell you.

379
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,040
Did you curse him out?

380
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,750
I just listened.

381
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:03,500
Okay. Good job. I'll beat him up for you.

382
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,640
But Kim Moon Ho isn't such a bad person.

383
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,920
I beat him up so much, and he took it all,
without ducking a single punch.

384
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,760
Your birth mom...

385
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,150
- Did you hear that she is sick?
- I did.

386
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,030
I met your birth mom.

387
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,980
So... It was very...

388
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,560
good. Right.

389
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,530
Were you alright meeting her?

390
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,550
What?

391
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,970
Nothing.

392
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,630
(Archived Family Relation Register)

393
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,350
Was this it?

394
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,800
Was it the story about my father and your father?

395
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,370
What story?

396
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,310
The story about my father...

397
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,130
killing your father.

398
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,350
You knew.

399
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,750
I knew.

400
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,740
I knew, but I couldn't tell you,

401
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,070
because I was afraid you'd be like this.

402
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,320
This has nothing to do with us.

403
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,670
If it has nothing to do with us,

404
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,900
why can't you look at me or hug me?

405
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:28,100
My father is not a murderer but is a suspect.
It's possible that he isn't.

406
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,370
That's why I've been looking for the evidence that he isn't.

407
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,320
And once I found it, I was going to tell you.

408
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,580
Right. I'll do that.

409
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:55,550
Park Bong Soo. We need to talk.

410
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,890
Listen to me before you go!

411
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:04,010
Please find it and come.

412
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,530
Okay.

413
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Even if you don't find it, come.

414
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,600
All right.

415
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,120
I'll look for it, too.

416
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,850
Okay.

417
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:25,460
You have to come even if you can't find it.

418
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,390
I'll find it and come back.

419
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:35,510
You're not a bad person.

420
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,190
I know that too.

421
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:48,130
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

422
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:54,230
♬ When there are so many words I want to say ♬

423
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,300
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

424
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,930
♬ Why are you so distant toward me? ♬

425
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:07,740
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

426
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:14,610
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

427
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:21,190
♬ There isn't anyone else but you ♬

428
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,740
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you ♬

429
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,470
♬ Even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

430
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:35,320
♬ I will always be looking ♬

431
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,390
♬ It's you ♬

432
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,650
We've planted a tracking device on Park Dong Cheol.
No sign of target yet.

433
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,790
The woman at the bar definitely told him the address, right?

434
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,710
Then just wait.

435
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:14,110
We laid down several layers of traps.
He should fall into one of them.

436
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,950
Mr. Park is going in. He left the street.

437
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:29,720
Presumed target in sight. I will get close to him.

438
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,860
Target confirmed.

439
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,100
Everyone, move. Target location is Park Dong Cheol.

440
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,880
You just have to keep the target alive.

441
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,830
As soon as he is found, use any means possible.

442
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,950
Four o'clock. Towards the pharmacy!

443
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,890
Over there!

444
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,160
They are such idiots!

445
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,620
I'm hungry. Damn.

446
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,560
I am the best...

447
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,360
I am the best...

448
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,120
I am the best...

449
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,600
Park Dong Cheol, right?

450
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,780
I came here because I have some things to ask you.

451
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,000
- Are you...
- Are you Seo Joon Seok's son?

452
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,920
Wow...

453
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,560
You surprise me.

454
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:05,130
They told me that Seo Joon Seok's son would come.

455
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,390
They told me to contact them when you come,
and they'd give me a million won ($1000).

456
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,590
I'm Seo Joon Seok's son, Seo Jeong Hoo.

457
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:24,270
But the people you mentioned...

458
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,590
Did you know?

459
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:38,610
My life is ruined because of your father.

460
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,770
I was once a policeman.

461
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,310
But look.

462
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,990
When you left, it seemed like you'd never see me again.

463
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:12,850
I'm not very good at being angry for long. I'm a little lacking in perseverance.

464
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,150
Did you come to meet me?

465
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,670
I asked around and heard that you were working through the night today.

466
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,070
Why?

467
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,170
I have something to ask you.

468
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,490
- What?
- Oh, there are a lot.

469
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:28,530
What do I ask first?

470
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:35,010
Oh, did I know you when I was young, Sunbae?

471
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,590
You did.

472
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,790
- Were we close?
- Very close.

473
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,530
It's been over twenty years. It was something I'd completely forgotten.

474
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,510
But they suddenly came to see me.

475
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:55,450
It must be because of you, Seo Joon Seok's son. It's because you've been poking around.

476
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,070
I know. I've been quite surprised too.

477
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:04,690
All I want is just a few pages of my father's affidavit,

478
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,350
but everyone is reacting so strongly. I wonder why?

479
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,350
A few pages of affidavit?

480
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:17,390
But no matter how hard I look for that affidavit, I can't find it.

481
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:22,490
So I thought about it. Let's find the person who wrote that affidavit.

482
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:24,630
It's you, isn't it, ahjusshi?

483
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,750
What?

484
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,310
Did I say something funny?

485
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:36,290
There's no use in looking for an affidavit. Because we made a fake one

486
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:40,550
and forced your father to put his thumbprint on it.

487
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,310
Fake?

488
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,990
Then...even if I do find an affidavit,

489
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,790
it's fake?

490
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:58,870
The affidavit we received and the one that was reported were completely different.

491
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:02,770
One was completely made up.

492
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:08,470
So what did we do? We reported it to the audit team.

493
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,570
And then what happened to us?

494
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,190
I heard you were kicked out.

495
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:25,690
My wife ran away... and look at what I'm doing now.

496
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,910
In the day I hand out advertisements, and at night I drive bar waitresses around.

497
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:37,110
So all that is...

498
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,570
because of my father?

499
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:42,770
That's right.

500
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,950
All right.

501
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,750
All right. I'm really sorry, but...

502
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,730
But, you must have heard, right?

503
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:01,110
So, what did my father say?

504
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,690
Did he say he killed a person?

505
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,010
You...

506
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,210
You really don't know anything, do you?

507
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:15,490
Your mother and father and Jeong Hoo's father were all reporters at the same newspaper. They were very close.

508
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,710
Did Jeong Hoo and I know each other too?

509
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:22,250
You two cried every time you met.

510
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:24,630
- Did we fight?
- No.

511
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,850
Because you didn't want to separate.

512
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,650
He probably cried first.

513
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,630
It would be nice if I could remember.

514
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:38,590
Jeong Hoo is your oppa.

515
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:40,770
- By how much?
- One month.

516
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,330
Ah, really?

517
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,570
Wow.

518
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,430
And, your birthday...

519
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,030
It's tomorrow.

520
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:02,550
Noona will probably be preparing your birthday meal already. She'll be baking treats and making a cake.

521
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,970
Wow...so my birthday is during the winter.

522
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,310
I thought it was in March up till now.

523
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,230
Any more questions?

524
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,510
Sunbae...

525
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:24,150
Why is your relationship with your brother bad?

526
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,830
You're curious about that?

527
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:29,470
Your hyung said

528
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,030
that you and Jeong Hoo had joined hands

529
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,110
and were about to commit a crime.

530
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,090
Why did he say that?

531
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:46,490
Some strange people came to find me a few days ago.

532
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,250
The people who told me to contact them if someone came looking for Seo Joon Seok.

533
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:52,670
Yes, that 1 million won.

534
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:57,270
So I asked them. I told them

535
00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:02,790
that I have Seo Joon Seok's recorded statement

536
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,930
and asked if they were interested.

537
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,030
How much do you need?

538
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:13,270
They told me they'd give me a lottery ticket stand.

539
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:15,550
- The ones at bus stations.
- Four lottery ticket stands.

540
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,210
I continued to be a police officer out of a sense of duty.

541
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,370
- I was really a police officer.
- Never mind that.

542
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:24,910
Tell me. How much do you need?

543
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,890
If I've lived my entire life like this because of your father, I should be able to benefit because of him now.

544
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,990
Ahjusshi!

545
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:36,730
I don't think you understand the situation right now, Ahjusshi, but those people aren't people you can mess around with.

546
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,390
I'm not messing around. This is my last chance.

547
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:43,190
I knew a day like this would come. So,

548
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:48,190
I kept that tape for twenty two years.

549
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,610
And now look. I've already got two people.

550
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:57,990
Give me a price. Then I'll talk to them again...

551
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:02,910
I saw someone completely like you once before

552
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,240
and that ahjusshi made a deal with Kim Moon Sik. Do you know what happened to him?

553
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,750
He died the next day. He was poisoned
and fell off a moving train.

554
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:16,230
So, Ajusshi, I'll give you the money, so give me the tape.

555
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,810
That's how you can live.

556
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:22,950
This is Ahn from the Investigation Team.
The target has just turned on his cellphone.

557
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,370
- We have begun tracking the location. 
- Is Park Dong Cheol alone or with someone else?

558
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:32,110
We're still checking. We're circling in right now.

559
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,610
Use all the people you have available.

560
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,090
If he's the Healer as I suspect, he'll be quite skilled.

561
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:44,970
But, you need to decide on your priorities
in the worst case scenario.

562
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,010
Is obtaining Seo Joon Seok's recorded statement first,

563
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:51,590
or is it getting rid of Seo Jeong Hoo?

564
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:55,610
The Elder will be very angry if he learns that there is a tape like this.

565
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:58,460
We have to make sure something like that
can't come out to the world.

566
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:07,780
- I'll give you a ride home.
- It's okay. There's still time to catch the bus.

567
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:11,230
Why don't you accept even once?

568
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,780
Is my car that scary?

569
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,350
Oh, Noona.

570
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:31,350
You know Jeong Hoo, right? Joon Seok's Son. Seo Jeong Hoo.

571
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:36,900
I think he's in danger. What should we do?

572
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,790
Call Jeong Hoo. Noona, did you hear the location?

573
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,640
Did he not say where?

574
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,190
Chae Yeong Sin

575
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,750
I knew you'd call before tonight was over.

576
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:20,440
She said she heard Kim Moon Sik on the phone. People are going to where you are. They must be going to catch you.

577
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,910
Hurry and run away, Jeong Hoo.

578
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:31,130
Kim Moon Ho, at your current speed you should arrive in 12-13 minutes.

579
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:36,670
Park the car by the back door of the church. I'll send the police at an appropriate time.

580
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,680
Are they using this to track my location and come here?

581
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:52,530
I told you everything. This is my last chance.

582
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,040
It couldn't be helped.

583
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,970
The target's signal has been turned off.
I think he's caught on.

584
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:06,440
You said they were at the cathedral, right?
How much time until they arrive?

585
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:10,910
The most important thing is this.

586
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,880
The tape with my father's testimony.

587
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,240
Is that real? Or is that fake too?

588
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:23,220
I have it. I've kept it for over twenty years.

589
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,050
And the condition for this deal was that you turn over the tape and me?

590
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:30,450
In exchange for what? A store to sell lottery tickets?

591
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:34,120
They said they'd give a job. A security company.

592
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,120
Let's go. Let's leave this place first.

593
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,440
Think of it as repaying your father's debt and let me off.

594
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,780
Look here! Those people are not going to let you live.

595
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,770
They said they'd also provide great benefits, including insurance coverage.

596
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:56,100
Okay, fine. Then tell me this one thing.

597
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,300
My father...

598
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,660
He didn't kill someone, did he?

599
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:08,860
I have to know this. You're the only person who can tell me this.

600
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:12,560
So, please tell me, Ahjusshi!

601
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,900
I'll tell you everything later. When those people come.

602
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:36,400
Hey!

603
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:21,120
Ahjusshi! Ahjusshi, come to your senses. Ahjusshi!

604
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:29,780
Ahjusshi! You said you'd tell me everything! My father...

605
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,640
My father...

606
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,330
No. Ahjusshi, you can't.

607
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:46,040
Ahjusshi!

608
00:57:53,810 --> 00:58:00,650
♬ Why can't I say anything ♬

609
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:06,710
♬ When there are so many words I want to say  ♬

610
00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:10,770
♬ The moment you turn around ♬

611
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,290
♬ Why are you so distant toward me? ♬

612
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:20,260
♬ Why is a burst of tears spilling over? ♬

613
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:27,130
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

614
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:29,640
Healer
♬ There isn't anyone else ♬

615
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:33,770
♬ But you ♬

616
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:40,990
♬ Even if I can't touch you, even if I can't hug you,
even if I cry alone, it's okay. ♬

617
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:47,830
♬ I will always be looking ♬

618
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:52,070
♬ It's you ♬

619
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,560
♬ Meeting you was fate. ♬

620
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:06,590
♬ Before I knew it, the fate became mine. ♬

621
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:14,360
♬ As I can't go back to the time before loving you ♬

622
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:20,290
♬ I am returning to you ♬

623
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:27,100
♬ I love you. There's only you. ♬

624
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,000
♬ There isn't anyone else but you ♬
