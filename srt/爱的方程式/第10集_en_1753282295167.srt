1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
Slowly

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
She is a flower that has no fragrance

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Will it bloom?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Tipatia

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is popular

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
All are fake

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Melted with sadness

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Tipatia

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you love

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Love is complicated

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Xiao Qian.

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Tan Yan Sheng.

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
The director asked me to tell you

19
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
that two student tour groups are arriving soon.

20
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,200
One is a high school student tour group

21
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,000
and the other is a primary school student tour group.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
They are all in charge of receiving you.

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,800
You should prepare.

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Okay, I got it.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Primary school student tour group?

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,600
My god, I'm most afraid of fierce kids.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Han, please.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,600
Don't let me go and annoy them.

29
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Hurry up.

30
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
How about I be in charge of the primary school students?

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,800
But you have to be in charge of the student parents.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,600
I forgot what you said.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
What should I do?

34
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,080
Uncle.

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,880
I did it.

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,800
No.

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Jian joining.

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,880
Theя 小学生 餐馆HPD small school tour group is coming soon.

39
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,080
And can you take the money?

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Pass it to me.

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,960
Great. Thank you.

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,680
Isabella Fleming

43
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,200
Right.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,720
You told me earlier thatployment is easy.

45
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,240
Hello.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,720
I'm maintainer of the Kindergarten Collection.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Today, I'll welcome all of you.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,200
Hi.

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm Teacher Yan.

51
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,320
Today,

52
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,480
we only have two teachers,

53
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,160
How are you?

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,120
Thank you.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,120
Kids, get off the bus.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,680
Come on.

57
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,240
Hold on tight.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,760
Hold on tight.

59
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,720
Move forward, dear.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,440
Hold on tight.

61
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,240
Come down.

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
Be careful.

63
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,280
These kids look cute and obedient.

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,640
They don't look like

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,080
the fierce kids they mentioned.

66
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,920
They must be the red-eyed boys.

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,320
No, no.

68
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,240
You can't run.

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:49,800
Go back.

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,560
Go back.

71
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,160
Wait.

72
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,440
You'll fall down.

73
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,280
Don't hit me.

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,520
Baby.

75
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,360
Teacher Xiao.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,560
Don't fight.

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,720
I'll give you a good meal.

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,280
Okay.

79
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,000
Here.

80
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,480
You can't pee here.

81
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,120
Okay.

82
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,120
Teacher Yu, hurry up.

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,160
Go to the front.

84
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,880
Coming.

85
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
No, no.

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,560
It's dirty, baby.

87
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,200
Get up.

88
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,360
Don't touch it.

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
Be careful.

90
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,760
Kids, we're on the same team.

91
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,640
Teacher Chen.

92
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Please count the people.

93
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,440
Okay.

94
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
See if everyone is here.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,720
Twenty.

96
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,120
Teacher Lin, Pan Yu Jiang is missing.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,800
What?

98
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,800
Did you see Pan Yu Jiang?

99
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
No.

100
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,560
No.

101
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,040
Really?

102
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,080
Then I'll go find him.

103
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
I'll go find him.

104
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,800
You take care of the kids here.

105
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,400
Okay.

106
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,400
Go to the center.

107
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,920
Yes.

108
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Turn around.

109
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Pan Yu Jiang.

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Pan Yu Jiang.

111
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Pan Yu Jiang.

112
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Pan Yu Jiang.

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Pan Yu Jiang.

114
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
Pan Yu Jiang.

115
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Pan Yu Jiang.

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Sister, are you looking for me?

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,760
Baby.

118
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,760
Baby, why are you here alone?

119
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,320
Come back with me.

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm here, aunt.

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,280
What are you doing here?

122
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Taking pictures.

123
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,720
Why are you taking pictures of them?

124
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Sister, don't you think they're cute?

125
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,520
They're so small.

126
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,760
They can play the role of ten times bigger than them.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,160
But they're also very poor.

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,200
They were accidentally stepped on by a person.

129
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,160
It's quite pitiful.

130
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,880
I heard that you're busy today.

131
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,240
We're here to help you.

132
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,640
You're here at the right time.

133
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Come on.

134
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Send a message to Chun Dan.

135
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Send a message.

136
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,040
Take the parents of the students to visit.

137
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,560
Can you come with me?

138
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
There are so many parents.

139
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't be busy.

140
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Shizi, you can accompany Nong Tong.

141
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
No problem.

142
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Ou Zi, Yuan Sen.

143
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,760
I'll leave this to you.

144
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
I'll go take a look at the list.

145
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Okay.

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
I'll go with you.

147
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Okay.

148
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
I'll go with you.

149
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I'll go with you.

150
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
I'll go with you.

151
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Okay, Chen Dan.

152
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Okay.

153
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Chen Dan.

154
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Come on, baby. Come here.

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880
Sit here and wait for me.

156
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Don't go anywhere.

157
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,440
Didn't you go to take Xiaoxiao Sheng?

158
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:01,960
Yes.

159
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,360
A little girl ran away.

160
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,560
Find her back.

161
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Let's go back.

162
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Okay.

163
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Help!

164
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,760
Help! Help!

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Help!

166
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Han Yunxiang, are you okay?

167
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
Mr. Yuan, I'm fine.

168
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
But he's got something to do.

169
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,360
It's good that you're fine.

170
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,960
You scared me to death.

171
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Don't run around anymore.

172
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Got it?

173
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,360
What's wrong with him?

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
Why did he stop halfway just now?

175
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,360
He almost drowned in the swimming pool last time.

176
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
It's simple.

177
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Thank you for just now.

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Are your feet okay?

179
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm fine.

180
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I'll take him back first.

181
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Let's go.

182
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,360
What's wrong with your feet?

183
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,360
I twisted them when I was in the water.

184
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll take you to the infirmary.

185
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
No need.

186
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
You can touch me.

187
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I asked you to help me.

188
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,360
No matter what happens,

189
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
I'll be responsible for you.

190
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Does it hurt here?

191
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
No.

192
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
It's just a little bit.

193
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
It's just a little bit.

194
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Does it hurt here?

195
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,360
Here?

196
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Does it hurt?

197
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,360
It hurts.

198
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I got it.

199
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,360
How's his feet?

200
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Don't put it on the ground for a week.

201
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
So long?

202
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
If you don't take good care of him,

203
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,360
you won't get well even if you try hard.

204
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll take care of it for you.

205
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Be patient.

206
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,360
It's okay.

207
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
You...

208
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Don't worry.

209
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I just said I'll take care of it.

210
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Then no one will be there.

211
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Get in the car.

212
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
I'm leaving.

213
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
I'm leaving.

214
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,360
Be careful.

215
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,360
The gentle sunshine spreads the clouds.

216
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The world is buried in the mist.

217
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Suddenly the sky is clear.

218
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,360
Ke'ai, you're back.

219
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Look at this.

220
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Simple.

221
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Why are you here?

222
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Someone asked me to give this to you.

223
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
I'll take it.

224
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Who?

225
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,360
He didn't want me to tell you.

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,360
So the gossip on the Internet is real?

227
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
You're good.

228
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
You can't hide it.

229
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

230
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Bye.

231
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Bye.

232
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
Thank you.

233
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
You're welcome.

234
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
I'll go first.

235
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Do you like the dishes?

236
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
You gave it to me.

237
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I made it for you strictly according to the nutritional standards.

238
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
But it's too light.

239
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,360
It's because you have a heavy taste.

240
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
It's because you follow my diet strictly.

241
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
So you can recover faster.

242
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
But...

243
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Or you want to delay recovery time on purpose.

244
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
So you can get close to me.

245
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
What's wrong?

246
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,360
You fell down?

247
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
No.

248
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
The lid fell off.

249
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Turn on the video for me.

250
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
No need.

251
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Do you want me to ask you to see it?

252
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Then don't come.

253
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Turn on the video.

254
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
I'm really fine.

255
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
What are you wearing?

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
So childish.

257
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
How childish?

258
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I stole it from you.

259
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You look like each other.

260
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
You're so silly.

261
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
You're so childish.

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
You're silly again.

263
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
If you're here to ruin my video, I'll hang up.

264
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Why is your girl's dorm so messy?

265
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Yue Teng Teng is taking a shower.

266
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
This is the clothes he wants to change.

267
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
He likes clean clothes.

268
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Who are you talking to?

269
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Why do you throw it at me?

270
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
See for yourself.

271
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Jian Dan, you're so annoying.

272
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,360
Yue Teng Teng, you bullied Jian Dan again.

273
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
He's bullying me.

274
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Impossible.

275
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
Jian Dan, what's wrong with your foot?

276
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
It's okay.

277
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
It's not serious. It'll be fine in a week.

278
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
You scared me.

279
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,360
I remember you went to help Han Yisheng this morning.

280
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
This is a reward.

281
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,360
He must be responsible for it.

282
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

283
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
Who's talking?

284
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Jian Dan.

285
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Han Yisheng is here.

286
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
Where are you going?

287
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
He's not here.

288
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
I'm going to kiss him.

289
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,360
Actually, you don't have to pick me up.

290
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Get in the car.

291
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Good morning.

292
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Jian Dan.

293
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Are you feeling better?

294
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,360
I made you a pig's trotter for lunch.

295
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
It's good.

296
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
Be careful.

297
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Your nutritious lunch is already on the table.

298
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
Old Han's nutritious lunch?

299
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,360
It's noon. It's still red at midnight.

300
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360
Chou.

301
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
It seems that the water in our pool hasn't changed for a long time.

302
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
How about you...

303
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

304
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
I'm leaving.

305
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,360
The president is here.

306
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
The president is here.

307
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
President, your foot is injured.

308
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Why are you still here?

309
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Yes.

310
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I should rest.

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,360
You have just trained for the rock climbing.

312
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
I'm worried about your safety.

313
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
During your injury,

314
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I will be in charge of the training for the rock climbing.

315
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Rock climbing? You're going to teach me rock climbing?

316
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Really?

317
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
Welcome.

318
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Welcome.

319
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Welcome.

320
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Welcome.

321
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
You guys are so good.

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I've been looking forward to returning the president.

323
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,360
No.

324
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
What?

325
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Let's go.

326
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
The first step.

327
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
The legs are higher.

328
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,360
One minute.

329
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,360
Ready.

330
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
The first step.

331
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
The legs are higher.

332
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,360
One minute.

333
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
The legs are higher.

334
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Speed up.

335
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Faster.

336
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Speed up.

337
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Faster.

338
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Faster.

339
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,360
Faster.

340
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
The next step.

341
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,360
Don't be too fast.

342
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Speed up.

343
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Speed up.

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
The legs are slower.

345
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,360
Be careful of the water.

346
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Time.

347
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,360
Time.

348
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
Mr.

349
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Did you see Da Sheng?

350
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Da Sheng is helping the training members of the team.

351
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Faster.

352
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Faster.

353
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Water.

354
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
You can't stop.

355
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Your legs are too weak.

356
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Too weak.

357
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
If you are a member of the swimming club,

358
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
you can still swim a few hundred meters.

359
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Their foundation is weak.

360
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
They should learn from it.

361
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,360
How about we practice again next time?

362
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Dismiss.

363
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
So fast.

364
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
What kind of training?

365
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
What kind of training?

366
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,360
So hard.

367
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Where are you going?

368
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I'm not going anywhere.

369
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I'll go with you.

370
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
It's inconvenient.

371
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,360
It's just the toilet.

372
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
What's inconvenient?

373
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Let's go.

374
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Let's go.

375
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
Why is Han Yan Sheng

376
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,360
at the door of the women's toilet?

377
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
Who is he waiting for?

378
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I don't know.

379
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
Let's go.

380
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,360
Why are you still here?

381
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I said I would be responsible until the end.

382
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Do you think I'm just talking about passing the time?

383
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
What are you doing here?

384
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Let's go.

385
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,080
Wen Tong, why are you here?

386
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,800
You're back

387
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,040
My computer was changed

388
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,600
I need to use your power supply

389
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,160
Okay, I'll leave later

390
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,320
Liang

391
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,240
It's broken

392
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,040
What's wrong?

393
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
It's flat

394
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,880
What should we do?

395
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,680
It seems that we need to find someone to fix it

396
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,520
Do you know who can fix it?

397
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,680
I know a master at the digital square

398
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,640
He can fix it

399
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,120
But

400
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,600
If you're busy,

401
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,080
you should do your work first

402
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,480
I'll figure it out

403
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,400
I can't submit half of the paper tomorrow morning

404
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,040
I'll lose my marks

405
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,520
Mr. Shi is on duty all day

406
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,240
I can ask him for help

407
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,920
We'll learn two major psychological theories

408
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,880
The representatives are

409
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,840
Freud and Sikina

410
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
These two theories

411
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,960
are psychological analysis and behavioralism

412
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,480
These theories are widely used

413
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,520
They can attract people's attention

414
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
I'm busy

415
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,320
I can't pick you up

416
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,120
Can you do it yourself?

417
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,320
I didn't expect that

418
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,080
the computer would be fixed for so long

419
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm glad you're with me

420
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,920
As long as the motherboard is not broken

421
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,880
I can get it later

422
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
What do you want to eat?

423
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:29,920
That one

424
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,960
OK

425
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,120
You go first

426
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,160
I'll buy it

427
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,120
OK

428
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,320
These two

429
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:16,960
Come on

430
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,520
Grandma

431
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,440
Janda, how're you?

432
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,080
I have good news for you

433
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
I've They've already passed the review

434
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,560
It'll be published almost right away

435
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,760
That's great

436
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
I'm proud of you.

437
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm happy, too.

438
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,200
What's that sound?

439
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,000
Nothing. It's my control.

440
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,480
You're hurt.

441
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,040
Let me see. What's wrong?

442
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,040
It's nothing.

443
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,760
I just sprained my ankle.

444
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,440
I'll be able to take off the bandage tomorrow.

445
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
Let me see.

446
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,600
I can move freely now.

447
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,320
You're always like this.

448
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,920
You're always worried about the show.

449
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,840
Why are you so careless?

450
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,000
I was going to

451
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,480
go to the city with the director next weekend.

452
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,760
But I'll go tomorrow.

453
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,480
No, Grandma. I'm fine.

454
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,760
Why did you suddenly go to the city?

455
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
Is there something wrong?

456
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,280
What could be wrong?

457
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,040
I just want to see you.

458
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,400
I miss you.

459
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,080
Since you're here to see me,

460
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,680
you should go to the city with the director next weekend.

461
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,080
I can rest assured.

462
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
All right.

463
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Take care of yourself.

464
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,240
Be good.

465
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,600
I won't bother you.

466
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,880
Don't worry, Grandma.

467
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,080
I hope so, Grandma.

468
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,080
I'll pick you up at the dormitory at eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

469
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,440
I'll come home today at nine.

470
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,560
Just leave me.

471
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,160
You've been busy for a long time.

472
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Hurry up.

473
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,120
Or you'll be late.

474
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,320
My legs are fine.

475
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,720
I don't need to use the crutches anymore.

476
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,320
I don't need to take care of you anymore.

477
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,360
How is it?

478
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,080
It doesn't hurt anymore, right?

479
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,480
Let me see.

480
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,720
You're recovering well.

481
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,720
No need to use the crutches.

482
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,640
Don't be careless.

483
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,920
Don't do any exercise.

484
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,080
Thank you, teacher.

485
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,960
Han Yisheng is really...

486
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,640
He said he would be responsible for everything.

487
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,240
But he didn't come at the last minute.

488
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,080
He has his own business.

489
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,960
I don't want to bother him.

490
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,800
It's annoying.

491
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,520
It's the mid-term exam.

492
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,760
I counted my scores this morning.

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,680
Guess what?

494
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,640
I got a big chest cramp.

495
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,160
I'm going to get a cramp.

496
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
It's simple.

497
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,520
Help me.

498
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
Help me.

499
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,800
Help me.

500
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,760
Let me go to the library with you.

501
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,680
Really?

502
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,800
Great.

503
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,360
I'm an angel.

504
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,120
Let me kiss you.

505
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,720
Let me kiss you.

506
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,520
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,720
Let me put on your shoes.

508
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,520
Give me the bag.

509
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:30,760
Let's go.

510
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,440
One, two, three.

511
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,360
inch

512
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,920
Hold on to it.

513
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
Hello.

514
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,040
You've finished??

515
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,400
a huge number of singing?

516
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Come to the library

517
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,960
tomorrow to sign the espresso…"

518
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,720
I'll be right there.

519
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,740
Hello.

520
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,760
I'm here to get a dresses.

521
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,840
Classmates, this is the book you asked for.

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,800
ando

523
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,240
Thanks.

524
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,280
You're welcome.

525
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,720
grateful

526
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,320
open

527
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,320
She grows up slowly

528
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,500
She is a flower that has fallen into the

529
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,500
scent of the moon

530
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Will she be afraid?

531
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,500
She has also asked herself

532
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Zipadia

533
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
The most popular one

534
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,500
She is like a statue

535
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
She will melt like a statue

536
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Zipadia

537
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,680
The one you love

538
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,680
Love is complicated

539
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,680
With a smile to answer

540
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,680
I made an appointment last time

541
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Sorry, can you meet me again?

542
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Why does this phone look so familiar?

543
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,680
Easy

544
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,680
Sorry

545
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,680
It's okay

546
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I didn't mean it

547
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,680
It's okay

548
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm meeting you

549
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Who is this?

550
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
Your friend

551
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
The friend who left you last time

552
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Call him

553
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,680
I can't call him

554
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I see

555
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,680
I didn't mean it

556
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,680
You can leave your number to him

557
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,680
Let him call you

558
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,680
I don't want to do it

559
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,680
Who let you play games and study hard?

560
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,680
Han, do you have any other ideas?

561
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,680
I will give you an idea

562
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,680
How about this?

563
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
I will go to the library tomorrow

564
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,680
To borrow some research

565
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,680
After school

566
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
I will prepare for the test with you

567
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Han, your idea is more reliable than Buddha's

568
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Okay, I will give you an idea

569
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,860
I will call An Tong tomorrow

570
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,860
Okay

571
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,860
I have drawn the main point

572
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,040
You can pass the test

573
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Han, are you sure we are in the same class?

574
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Why do I feel like I know these questions

575
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,040
But I don't know them

576
