How could it be? Then...

16
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:53,440
Why didn't I get the message?

17
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,511
Forget it. It's not important.

18
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,177
Thank you for guiding me on my paper.

19
00:02:04,588 --> 00:02:05,640
I'll be there on time.

20
00:02:06,737 --> 00:02:07,280
All right.

21
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:36,840
Take a break.

22
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:37,980
I brought your favorite pasta

23
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:38,760
from the cafeteria.

24
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not hungry yet.

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
Leave it there. I'll eat it later.

26
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,720
(Monkey)
Shi, the plan worked.

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Han took the bait.

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
What plan is that?

29
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:58,320
Nothing. It's just that Jian Dan
is working on her paper,

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,777
and Monkey wanted to help her.

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,760
What's that got to do with Sheng?

32
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll continue with my practice.

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,960
It's on me. Drink it.

34
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,080
All the files are on this.

35
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:41,120
Topic selection rationale
is on the first page.

36
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:43,280
I included a few classic examples.

37
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
It's on page four.

38
00:03:44,688 --> 00:03:46,980
The topic selection rationale
of my first published paper

39
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:48,040
is on page ten.

40
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Take a look.

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,000
You remember everything?

42
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:53,840
I wrote that myself.
Is it hard to remember?

43
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:57,360
But it's unlikely you would
remember everything so specifically.

44
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:00,640
Let me quiz you.

45
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,320
Which page has
the literature search methods?

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,840
Page 23.

47
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,080
What about the formatting guidelines?

48
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:18,440
Page 46.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
And keyword searching?

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
Page 52.

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,800
And...

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,640
From now on,
keep quiet and listen to me.

53
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,480
Is the seat taken?

54
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,520
No.

55
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
What are you looking at?

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,280
It's the photo

57
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,680
of my super handsome idol!

58
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:09,390
Look. Handsome, right?

59
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,245
Uh...

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,800
Too many photos were taken
from the other day.

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,520
I'm picking one

62
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,880
for the club yearbook.

63
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,800
No... No rush.

64
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,640
Here's your Luosifen.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,360
I usually only eat one bowl.

66
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,688
I'm very hungry today,

67
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:34,360
so I ordered two.

68
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,240
But you know,

69
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,800
I...

70
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,560
I...

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,200
This is a side dish.
There aren't many noodles.

72
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,240
Here's all your order.

73
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,680
It's for Jian Dan.

74
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,240
Not for me, really.

75
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,360
Excuse me, a bowl of Luosifen, please.

76
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,120
Sure.

77
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,280
That's everything.
Anything else you don't get?

78
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,080
Do you know

79
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:23,720
what your next step is?

80
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:27,360
Why aren't you answering?

81
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
You told me to keep quiet.

82
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,320
You've never listened this well before.

83
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,177
Respecting your teacher is a virtue.

84
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,120
All right. That's exactly one hour.

85
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,666
That's all for today.

86
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
You can go.

87
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,360
I'll go through the notes again.

88
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,520
Okay.

89
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm done. Take your time.

90
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:33,000
I need to rush back
to bring Luosifen to Jian Dan,

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,520
or she'll be hungry later.

92
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,920
If I had known,

93
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,000
I would've read my fortune
before heading out.

94
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,451
Prince Luo Shui probably thinks

95
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm a foodie.

96
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,080
I was eating like a horse there.

97
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh no, I forgot to pay.

98
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:57,520
I paid for you.

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you.

100
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,320
What's your WeChat?

101
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,120
WeChat?

102
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,311
Transfer me the money.

109
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,720
What's wrong with this paragraph?

110
00:10:09,177 --> 00:10:10,560
What about that?

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
You can make it more precise.

112
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,560
Come here.

113
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:18,960
Like this.

114
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
This is better.

115
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,080
Do it this way. Right?

116
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,080
Continue.

117
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,640
Get off your phone.

118

Be serious.

119

Am I disturbing you?

120
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,800
Put it in your bag.

121
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:41,400
You're distracting me.

122
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,000
All right.
You can submit your paper now.

123
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm submitting it now.

124
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Right. I'm going to the restroom.

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,040

126
00:11:48,422 --> 00:11:49,760
You bought a new phone, Jian Dan?

127
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,640
This is the latest model.
It's hard to get.

128
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,480
Lucky you.

129
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,120
Well, about the phone...

130
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,560
Why did you transfer money to me?

131
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,440
I earned that from my part-time job.

132
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,111
I'm paying you back a bit first.

133
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,360

once I've saved enough.

Have you figured something out yet?

137
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,640
You've drawn so many times.
Can it still be accurate?

138
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,360
I haven't worked it out yet,

139
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,880
so I'm still trying to figure it out.

140
00:13:17,466 --> 00:13:18,560
What does this card mean?

141
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,720
It represents setbacks.

142
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,742
But if you don't give up,

143
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,480
you'll get a good outcome.

144
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,920
But Prince Luo Shui

145
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,600
hasn't posted any photos yet.

146
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,720

Isn't that good?

150
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,155
Don't worry too much.
I'm going to the library.

This...

176
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,000
I had a tailor make this fur collar.

177
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,480
When I picked it up today,

178
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,400
someone from the factory
almost scrapped it,

179
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:21,120
thinking it was defective.

has gone out of town.

until the day after tomorrow.

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,440
Even if someone else tried,

187
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:40,720
there wouldn't be enough time.

188
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,520
It would take at least half a day

189
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,600
to fix.

190
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I don't think

191
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,200
I'll make it to the competition.

192
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,120
Let me try.

193
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,040
You?

194
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,520
I've learned sewing before

195
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,960
and often visit fabric markets.

196
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
I may not be as skilled

197
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,840
as the tailor,

198
00:16:59,222 --> 00:17:00,960
but let's try anything we can.

199
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:03,329
You know how to sew?

200
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,280
I joined the cosplay club

201
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,400
in high school.

202
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
We didn't have much of a budget,

203
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,200
so sometimes

204
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,840
we had to sew our costumes.

205
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,320
I should still remember a little.

206
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:15,702
That's great.

207
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,577
What time do you need it
by tomorrow morning?

208
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,600
Before 10 AM.

209
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,000
(What?)

210
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,711
(I still have to go to
the fabric market)

211
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,600
(and do the sewing.)

212
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,040
(That's too little time.)

213
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,960
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

214
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,120
What are you looking at, Yuan Sen?

215
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:48,080
Nothing.

216
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,711
I remember you know someone
from a publishing house.

217
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,244
Can you find a book for me?

218
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:52,920
What book?

219
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,320
Theory of Numbers.

220
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,000
Published by Posts & Telecom Press.
2002 edition.

221
00:17:58,382 --> 00:17:59,440
I'll check for you.

222
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,320
All right.

223
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,280
(Yuan Sen: How's it going?)

224
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,000
(Mi Fen: The stitching is
a little complicated.)

225
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,960
(It might take a while.)

226
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:41,360
(Yuan Sen: It's okay if it can't be fixed.)

227
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,720
(Mi Fen: I'll do my best.
Don't worry about me.)

228
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,360
(You've got a shoot tomorrow.)

229
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,080
(Rest up early and good luck.)

230
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
(Apartment Building No. 15)

231
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,960
Yuan Sen.

232
00:19:55,502 --> 00:19:56,005
Mi Fen.

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,840
Here you go. It's fixed.

234
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:08,880
What's wrong?

235
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,800
Nothing.

236
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,800
I skipped breakfast,
so I'm feeling lightheaded.

237
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
You should go for your shoot.

238
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,630
I'll be waiting for your good news.

239
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:16,640
Come on.

240
00:20:17,068 --> 00:20:18,000
Go.

241
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:19,720
Go.

242
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,040
I'll wait for your good news.

243
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,760
Prince Luo Shui won first place!

244
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,160
He's amazing!

245
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
Can you keep it down?

246
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,457
(Most Popular Ranking: Luo Shui)

247
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,688
(Mi Fen: Congrats for winning four years
in a row, Prince Luo Shui.)

248
00:21:53,777 --> 00:21:56,111
(Yuan Sen: I couldn't have done it
without your help.)

249
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:57,040
(As a thank-you,)

250
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,920
(you get to make one request.)

251
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:02,120
One request?

252
00:22:03,817 --> 00:22:05,560
I'll have to think carefully.

253
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,520
Yuan Sen, you're back.

254
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,440
Any news on the book?

255
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,240
The publisher said

256
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,777
the edition is out of print,

257
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,360
but they do have other versions.

258
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,600
Other editions don't work.

259
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
If the goddess mentioned that book,

260
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,800
she must have it.

261
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,908
Why don't you borrow hers?

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,240
What goddess?

263
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,268
She's just

264
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,040
a math enthusiast like me.

265
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,400
Don't you want to know

266
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,160
who your goddess really is

267
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,222
and what she looks like?

268
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,680
Yeah. Even I'm curious about

269
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:40,680
who this mysterious Hypatia

270
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,520
really is.

271
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:41,240
(I couldn't find the book. Can I borrow yours?
Let's meet by the bookshelf at 7 PM tonight.)

272
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,260
(Okay.)

273
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,740
(Mathematician and Martyr, Hypatia)

274
00:24:03,634 --> 00:24:04,320
Jian Dan.

275
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,640
Jian Dan.

276
00:24:07,755 --> 00:24:08,640
Where are you going?

277
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:09,840
I'm meeting my pen pal.

278
00:24:10,874 --> 00:24:12,880
You top students are insane.

279
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,840
Even your friendships require a high IQ.

280
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,000
I'd rather be an ordinary person

281
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,440
and just sell my figurines.

282
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
Why are you suddenly selling them?

283
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,080
Do you need money?

284
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,680
Two-thirds of my allowance this month

285
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,480
went toward the costumes.

286
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,520
My purse is empty now,

287
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,360
so I have to sell my figurines.

288
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,320
You've done so much

289
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,674
for your idol,

290
00:24:34,711 --> 00:24:35,822
all that money and effort.

291
00:24:36,066 --> 00:24:36,800
Let me tell you,

292
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
cosplay is worth it.

293
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:45,840
Hello?

294
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,160
Hello? Are you selling the figurines?

295
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:49,240
Yes, right.

296
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,480
Which one are you interested in?

297
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,000
Everything you put online.

298
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:54,280
That's great.

299
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:55,720
What's your address?

300
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:58,777
I'll wait for you
at the pizza place downtown.

301
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,034
Downtown?

302
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm in the suburbs. How about I...

303
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,960
He hung up so quickly.

304
00:25:08,051 --> 00:25:09,760
And his voice was strange.

305
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,240
Want me to go with you?

306
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,800
It's fine. I can handle this on my own.

307
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,080
What if he...

308
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,680
Nothing's going to happen.

309
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
It's a public place.

310
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
What could he do to me?

311
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,440
I'm off.

312
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,240
Call me if anything happens.

313
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:28,888
Something's already happening.

314
00:25:28,955 --> 00:25:30,800
Jian Dan, my phone is dead.

315
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,320
You can use mine.

316
00:25:34,588 --> 00:25:36,440
I'll be in the library this afternoon.

317
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:37,400
I don't need it.

318
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,400
Go ahead.

319
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,400
Bye.

320
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:42,088
What's your phone passcode?

321
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,760
No passcode.

322
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,560
Oh my.

323
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,640
Why don't you have a passcode?

324
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,240
What if someone leaks your info?

325
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,920
Please come again.

326
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,840
Han, why are you still here?

327
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:05,644
There's still half an hour before seven.

328
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:06,444
No rush.

329
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:08,111
Where are you going?

330
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,320
He's meeting his Hypatia.

331
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,000
What Hypatia?

332
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,560
Han has a math pen pal.

333
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,355
They're meeting at the library tonight.

334
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:17,888
After chatting for so long,

335
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:19,933
he's finally going to
find out this mystery.

336
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,320
Order, please.

337
00:26:25,114 --> 00:26:26,240
Sheng's math skills

338
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,920
are top-tier at our school.

339
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,133
Any girl who's on the same wavelength
as him

340
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:31,311
must be top-notch too.

341
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,160
Maybe she's from the math department.

342
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,160
I've seen almost all the girls
in our department.

343
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,920
Most of them are introverted,

344
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,400
wear thick glasses,

345
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,800
and are pretty dull.

346
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,280
Han, listen to me.

347
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,680
Don't get your hopes up too high.

348
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm meeting a pen pal,

349
00:26:49,228 --> 00:26:50,600
not going on a blind date.

350
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,120
A guy meeting a girl from online
is basically a blind date.

351
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,400
Who knows? The moment you meet,

352
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,444
you two may fall in love at first sight,
and the goddess becomes your girlfriend.

353
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,080
Knock it off.

354
00:27:02,445 --> 00:27:04,440
I'm really looking forward to it.

355
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,400
Sheng, after you meet your pen pal,

356
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:09,120
remember to introduce her to us.

357
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:09,960
Sure.

358
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,760
You guys carry on. I'm off.

359
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:15,733
I thought we were teaming up
for a game later.

360
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,320
Yuan Sen!

361
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,920
Heartless guy.

362
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,680
Yuan Sen.

363
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,000
Mi Fen.

364
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:43,688
What a coincidence.

365
00:27:43,845 --> 00:27:44,920
Yeah, what a coincidence.

366
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,040
Where are you going?

367
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:48,400
I'm meeting someone from online
downtown.

368
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,120
Someone online?

369
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,400
Guy or girl?

370
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,760
A guy.

371
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,760
A guy meeting a girl from online
is basically a blind date.

372
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,079
Who knows? The moment you meet,

373
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,755
you two might fall in love
at first sight.

374
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,200
I'll go with you.

375
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,960
It's not safe to walk alone at night.

376
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,798
Why? Is it inconvenient for you?

377
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
No. Totally convenient.

378
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,733
Very convenient.

379
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,000
Let's go.

380
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,240
Hello?

381
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
Yes, I'm Lucky Koi Girl.

382
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
I'm right here waiting.

383
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:35,560
I'm wearing a light yellow outfit.

384
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,080
Okay. Sure. Bye.

385
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:44,266
I'm not sure what flavor you'd like,

386
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,320
so I bought one of each.

387
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,160
I'll take the pink one.

388
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,560
Thank you.

389
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,120
This one is for you, too.

390
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,080
You're not eating?

391
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,000
I don't eat sweets.

392
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,680
What's wrong? You look nervous.

393
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,955
It's my first time
meeting someone from online.

394
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:28,240
It feels weird.

395
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,400
Aren't I the one meeting someone
from online?

396
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:42,520
Are you Lucky Koi Girl?

397
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,480
Red Dead?

398
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,400
I am.

399
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,880
Well.

400
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:52,560
Was the traffic terrible?

401
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,760
Not at all.

402
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,280
Do you want some ice cream?

403
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,200
No thanks.

404
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,400
I brought all the figurines here.

405
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,360
You know?

406
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
I keep them in perfect condition.

407
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,640
- Take a look.
- Careful.

408
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:14,960
Come.

409
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,720
Let me tell you this.

410
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:23,800
Take a look at them.

411
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,040
- Not bad, right?
- Mi Fen.

412
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,640
So you're here to sell figurines?

413
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,360
Yeah. What else?

414
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:38,920
Nothing.

415
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:45,680
Well.

416
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,600
Transfer me the money via WeChat later.

417
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,840
We'll get going.

418
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:49,680
All right.

419
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,666
Let's go, Yuan Sen.

420
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,680
Bye.

421
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:57,511
Don't forget to transfer the money.

422
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,800
It's almost time. I should go.

423
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,720
Good luck.

424
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:07,960
Shi,

425
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:10,040
how did Sheng and his pen pal meet?

426
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:12,720
I know.
