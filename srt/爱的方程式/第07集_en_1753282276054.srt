1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a breeze blowing through her curly hair and sweet face

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This love is a difficult one to untie, so express it with sincerity

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Grow up slowly, she is a flower that blooms

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Will it bloom? She has also asked herself

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Zipadilla, the one who is popular

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Only the sound will melt the sadness

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Zipadilla, the one who is beautiful

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I love her, and I smile back

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Love by Hypnotic

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Episode 22

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Look at it yourself.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No way.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then...

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why didn't I receive the news?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Forget it. It's not important.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you for giving me the guidance.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I will be on time.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Okay.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Zipadilla

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Take a break.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I packed your favorite pasta from the canteen.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But I'm not hungry right now.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Leave it here. I'll eat it with me.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Zipadilla

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Zipadilla, the plan is successful.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The child is on the hook.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What plan?

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Nothing.

29
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just want to write a simple essay.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The monkey wants to help him.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What does that have to do with the uncle?

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll continue to practice.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Zipadilla

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll treat you.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're welcome.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The essay is in this.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The idea of the essay is in the first page.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I also wrote some classic selection cases.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In the fourth page.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the first selection idea I published.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In the tenth page.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Take a look first.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You remember all of them?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you write it yourself?

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is it hard to remember?

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I remember them all.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's not that possible.

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then I'll test you.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How many pages are there in the search for the text?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Twenty-three pages.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
How about the writing format of the essay?

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Forty-six pages.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What about the search for the keywords?

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Fifty-two pages.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
From now on,

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
be quiet.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Listen to me.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is there anyone here?

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you looking at?

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Of course, it's my super invincible photo of a handsome idol.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Look, isn't it handsome?

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That...

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's...

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's...

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That day, the photo of the club was taken too much.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm choosing...

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a photo as a memorial to our club.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hello, your snail rice noodles.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I usually eat one bowl.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was very hungry today, so I ordered two bowls.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But let me tell you, I...

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I...

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I...

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is all side dishes.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Nothing special.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hello, your snail rice noodles are here.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I packed them for you.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I didn't eat them.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Boss, one bowl of snail rice noodles.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Okay.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's all.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is there anything else you don't understand?

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What should I do next?

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you know?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why don't you talk?

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Didn't you just say no to me?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I've never seen you so obedient.

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm just trying to make things better.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, it's just an hour.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's all for today.

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Then you go ahead.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll take a closer look at the notes.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm full.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Take your time.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I have to go back to the dorm and give the snail rice noodles to Jiannan.

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Otherwise, she'll be hungry again.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I knew it.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I should have counted the money before I went out.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I think I must feel like I'm a foodie now.

117
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll eat here.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm paying you.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I paid for you.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's your WeChat number?

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My WeChat.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Transfer.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000

I'm sorry.

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000

I'm sorry.

194
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Have you finished your paper?

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Today is the last day.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I've finished.

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll check it later.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You...

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What's wrong with this pair?

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What's wrong with this pair?

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This pair...

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's more simple.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Like this.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's much better.

221
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Like this?

222
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Go on.

223
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't play with your phone.

224
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Be serious.

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've disturbed you.

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Put your phone in your bag.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a distraction.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'll put it in.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll put it in.

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Okay.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Thank you.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You changed your phone?

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is the latest model.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's hard to get.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're so lucky.

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
About the phone...

241
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why did you transfer my money?

242
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I made a tip.

243
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll give you some first.

244
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll give you the rest when I'm done.

245
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
As you like.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Fen.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You've studied it all night.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Do you understand it?

249
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You've counted it so many times.

250
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Do you understand it?

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I just don't understand it.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm still studying it.

253
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What does this card mean?

254
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This card represents a setback.

255
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But if you don't give up,

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you'll get a good result.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But the fall of the water

258
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
hasn't been uploaded yet.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm so anxious.

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Tomorrow is the last deadline of the course.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A setback, but a good result.

262
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A good result.

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's still good.

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Don't worry.

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll go to the library.

266
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You're talking like you didn't say anything.

267
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're so annoying.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This love is hard to untie.

269
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I use my whole body to express it.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's strong.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a flower that blooms.

272
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Will you be afraid?

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It has also asked itself.

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The one who is passionate.

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's strong.

276
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's a flower that blooms.

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Will you be afraid?

278
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It has also asked itself.

279
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The one who is passionate.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It has also asked itself.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Will you be afraid?

282
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It has also asked itself.

283
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The one who is passionate.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It has also asked itself.

285
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I didn't find the book you wanted.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Goodbye.

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Mi Fen.

288
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yuan Sen.

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Tomorrow is the last deadline.

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'll go to the library.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll go to the library.

292
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll go to the library.

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll go to the library.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll go to the library.

295
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll go to the library.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Tomorrow is the last deadline for the COS comparison.

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why haven't you uploaded your work yet?

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Look.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
How could this be?

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This...

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I asked someone to make these woolen collar.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
When I took it today,

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I found that it was destroyed by the factory's master

304
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
as a silk.

305
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And the old master I repaired also went to another place.

306
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He went to another place.

307
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If he comes back,

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
it will be the day after tomorrow.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then can't we change a master first?

310
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
His sewing technique is special.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There is only one old master in the whole store.

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And even if we change someone else,

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
it's too late.

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It takes at least half a day to repair it.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm afraid I can't catch up with the second comparison.

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let me try.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You?

318
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I used to learn sewing.

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I also often go to the clothing selection market.

320
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Although the technique can't be compared with that old master,

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm satisfied with it.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can sew?

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I joined the COS company in high school.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
At that time, there was no money.

325
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The COS costumes were sometimes sewn by myself.

326
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I should remember a little bit.

327
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Great.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
When do you want it tomorrow morning?

329
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Before ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

330
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Ten o'clock?

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have to go to the shopping market and sew.

332
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How can I afford it?

333
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't worry.

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Leave it to me.

335
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Lian San, what are you looking at?

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you looking at?

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I remember you know the people from the publishing house.

338
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Can you help me find a book?

339
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What book?

340
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's in the book.

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The publisher of the People's Post Office.

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The 2002 edition.

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll help you ask.

344
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay.

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How is it?

346
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is the progress going well?

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The sewing is a little complicated.

348
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The progress may be a little slow.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It doesn't matter if it's not repaired well.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll do my best.

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Don't worry about me.

352
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You still have a shoot tomorrow.

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Rest early.

354
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You have to work hard.

355
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

357
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

358
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

359
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

364
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

365
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

366
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

367
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

371
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

373
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

376
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

377
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll go to the shopping market.

378
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Here you are.

379
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yansi.

380
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yifen.

381
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's okay.

382
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's done.

383
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What's wrong?

384
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's okay.

385
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,960
I haven't had breakfast. I have a low blood sugar.

386
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,160
Hurry up and go take a photo.

387
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,240
I'll wait for your good news.

388
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,600
Let's go.

389
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,800
Hurry up and go.

390
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,680
Let's go.

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,960
I'll wait for your good news.

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll wait for your good news.

393
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,560
I...

394
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,180
I got the top place

395
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,560
in the浪时金香.

396
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,360
I'm so good!

397
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,440
Wait just a second!

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,880
I技, First-사 tillthink,

399
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,020
General,

400
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,160
do you think

401
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,740
this'Show to effect the

402
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:41,340
Imperial Coronaj and Imperial's

403
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,940
power?

404
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,200
I can't remove it!

405
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,620
Back.

406
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,700
L tastier if I let you go,

407
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,200
Any news about the book?

408
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
The book seller said

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
the book is gone.

410
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,160
But they have other versions.

411
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,440
Other versions are useless.

412
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,560
Since Goddess mentioned this book,

413
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,480
it means she must have it.

414
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,600
Why didn't you tell her?

415
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
What Goddess?

416
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,760
She's the sound of the tree.

417
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,160
You don't want to know

418
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,920
who your Goddess is

419
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,760
and what she looks like?

420
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah. I'm curious too.

421
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,400
Your Goddess of the Sepadia

422
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
might be Juzang Chang'an.

423
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,720
Refine him life after death.

424
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,640
I love you.

425
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Hayi.

426
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,320
Listen,

427
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,280
move!

428
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,200
Oh my god!

429
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
Didn't I say recently

430
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,560
to docompliments fit together?

431
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,200
Of course.

432
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,200
You guys are so perverted.

433
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,160
You even know how to make friends.

434
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,280
I'd rather be an ordinary person

435
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,880
and sell my wristband.

436
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,120
Why are you selling your wristband?

437
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,320
You're short of money?

438
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,720
I spent two-thirds of my monthly living expenses

439
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,680
on the cosplayer.

440
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Now I have no money left.

441
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,640
I can only sell my belongings.

442
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,720
You're doing this for your idol.

443
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,040
You're making money and making money.

444
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,040
You're so hard-working.

445
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,240
Let me tell you.

446
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,360
Cosplay.

447
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,880
What are you up to?

448
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,880
Hello.

449
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:41,840
Hello.

450
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,840
Where are you?

451
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,840
Right.

452
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,520
Excuse me?

453
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,480
We'll take everything you ask.

454
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,520
You're so weird.

455
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,240
You're so weird when you talk.

456
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,720
How about I go with you?

457
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
It's okay.

458
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,280
I can do it by myself.

459
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,320
What if he...

460
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,840
It's okay.

461
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
What if?

462
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,280
It's a public occasion.

463
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
He can't do anything to me.

464
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:04,960
I'm leaving.

465
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,680
Call me if you need anything.

466
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,120
I need something.

467
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,280
Qiannan, my phone is out of battery.

468
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,680
Then use my phone first.

469
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Anyway, I've been in the library all afternoon.

470
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,720
I can't use my phone.

471
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,640
Bye.

472
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,600
Bye.

473
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,080
The password.

474
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,080
No password.

475
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,720
You're so weird.

476
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,880
When did you not use your phone's password?

477
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,600
What if it's leaked?

478
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,000
Welcome to the next class.

479
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,120
Han, why are you still here?

480
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,920
It's half an hour before the deadline.

481
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,680
I can't make it.

482
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Where are you going?

483
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,600
I'm going to meet his goddess, Cipadía.

484
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
What goddess?

485
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,920
Han has a math friend.

486
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,600
We're meeting at the library tonight.

487
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,240
We've been talking for so long.

488
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,960
Finally, we're going to meet the goddess.

489
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,720
Hello, please open the page.

490
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,280
Da Sheng's math is the best in Haida.

491
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,200
The girl who can communicate with him

492
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
must be Jian.

493
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,560
Maybe she's a girl from the math department.

494
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,160
I've seen almost all the girls from the math department.

495
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,040
Basically, they're all

496
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,320
the kind of girls with thick eyes.

497
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
They're also boring.

498
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
Han, I advise you

499
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,880
not to have too much hope.

500
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm going to see Bi You, not a blind date.

501
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,160
Now, the opposite sex is equal to a blind date.

502
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,520
It means that when two people meet,

503
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
they fall in love at first sight.

504
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,200
The goddess becomes a girlfriend.

505
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,320
I'm going to kiss you.

506
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,440
That's really exciting.

507
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
Da Sheng, I'll see your Bi You later.

508
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
Remember to introduce us.

509
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,200
Okay.

510
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,960
You guys talk. I'm leaving.

511
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,480
It's not good to be in the dark together.

512
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,440
Yuan Cai.

513
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,040
You're so cold.

514
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,240
Yuan San.

515
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,440
Mi Fen.

516
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,120
What a coincidence.

517
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,640
Yes, what a coincidence.

518
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,680
Where are you going?

519
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm going to the city center to meet a netizen.

520
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,640
Meet a netizen?

521
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,960
A man or a woman?

522
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,480
Is it possible?

523
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,360
Now, the opposite sex is equal to a blind date.

524
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,560
It means that when two people meet,

525
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,840
they fall in love at first sight.

526
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,760
I'll go with you.

527
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,240
I'll go with you.

528
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,960
It's not safe to walk alone at night.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,600
What?

530
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,760
You don't feel comfortable?

531
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes.

532
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,680
Very comfortable.

533
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,360
Very comfortable.

534
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's go.

535
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,360
Hello.

536
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Yes, I'm a manager girl.

537
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I'm waiting for you here.

538
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm wearing a light yellow dress.

539
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:16,960
Okay.

540
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,120
Okay, bye.

541
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,920
I don't know what flavor you like.

542
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,360
So I bought one more.

543
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,120
I'll take this one.

544
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,520
Thank you.

545
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,040
This one is for you.

546
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,960
You don't want it?

547
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,920
I don't eat sweets.

548
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,040
Wait.

549
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,720
Please don't leave.

550
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
You strong okay?

551
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,320
Wait a minute.

552
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,160
It's a file of you that you gave me.

553
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,000
What's wrong with you?

554
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,840
I'm not used to it.

555
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,680
I'm the one who has the past friends.

556
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,920
Are you a girl from Jinli?

557
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
I'm a girl from the desert.

558
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,960
Yes.

559
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,760
Here, have some fish.

560
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,000
How's the road? Is it bumpy?

561
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,200
It's okay.

562
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,840
Do you want some pancakes?

563
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,680
No, thanks.

564
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,880
I'll go with you.

565
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
I brought the manual.

566
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,400
I'll tell you what.

567
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,600
I usually keep these things

568
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,040
in good condition.
