It's nothing.

No, I'm fine.

48
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,680
Your cheeks are flushed.

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,560
Don't tell me you're drunk.

50
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,088
We haven't even started.

51
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,840
The AC is on too strong.

52
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,520
It's kind of hot.

53
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,400
Here.

54
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,977
Cheers.

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,080
I saw Yuan Sen's post just now.

56
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,360
He's out on a date with Mi Fen.

57
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm full.

58
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,680
Yuan Sen rarely used to post anything.

59
00:06:08,711 --> 00:06:10,160
But ever since he started dating,

60
00:06:10,942 --> 00:06:12,560
he keeps showing off couple pics.

61
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,742
(Yuan Sen)

62
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:17,080
(So this one doesn't have a caption,
just the photo?)

63
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:20,200
(Maybe he just asked out of curiosity.)

64
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
That's you in the photo, right?
And Shi,

65
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,040
Yuan Sen, and Monkey.

66
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
Who's this guy?

67
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
He looks familiar.

68
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,440
He was my best friend.

69
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,600
Nan Yuan.

70
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,800
You never mentioned him before.

71
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,840
He passed away.

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,400
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,640
I'm the one who should say sorry.

74
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,480
At the New Year's party,

75
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,760
I didn't mean to snap at you.

76
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,960
It was because of the video you made.

77
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,920
It just hit me really hard.

78
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
Now I remember.

79
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,320
I saw Nan Yuan in that video.

80
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,511
So that's why you got so emotional.

81
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
Was it because of him?

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,720
Nan Yuan and I grew up together.

83
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:44,560
But he died because of me.

84
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,555
He drowned.

85
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,680
After that day,

86
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,920
I stopped going into the water.

87
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,480
Sheng,

88
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,680
the waves are too strong today.

89
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not safe to dive.

90
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,760
Maybe come back another time.

91
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,520
We're already here.
Let's enjoy it a bit.

92
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,520
You really want to dive today?

93
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,520
Then, I'll go with you.

94
00:08:13,822 --> 00:08:14,200
Let's go.

95
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:15,680
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,640
(That day, the sea was rough,)

97
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,800
(but I insisted on diving.)

98
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,133
(So Nan Yuan and Entong
had no choice but to come along.)

99
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,240
(Just like always,
we kept diving deeper and deeper.)

100
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,280
(The deeper we went,
the prettier it got.)

101
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,360
(Once we reached the bottom,
we split up)

102
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,520
(to explore the scenery.)

103
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,080
(But for some reason,)

104
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,320
(something still went wrong.)

105
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,320
(Nan Yuan realized)

106
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,000
(his tank had no more air.)

107
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,880
(His buoyancy vest also failed.)

108
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
(He struggled hard in the water.)

109
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,240
(I saw him,)

110
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,466
(and swam over as fast as I could.)

111
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,280
(I wanted to give him my regulator.)

112
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,080
(But I realized)

113
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,480
(my tank had failed too.)

114
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,320
(All I could do was grab him)

115
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,640
(and swim toward the surface.)

116
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,360
(I wanted to save him.)

117
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,520
(But I started
running out of oxygen too.)

118
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,360
(I started to lose consciousness.)

119
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,000
(Later, Entong gave me
her spare regulator.)

120
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,640
(That helped me regain consciousness.)

121
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
(I wanted to save Nan Yuan.)

122
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,920
(But my whole body felt limp.)

123
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,080
(I could only watch helplessly)

124
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,280
(as his body kept sinking.)

125
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
(He drifted away.)

126
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
(Until I couldn't see him anymore.)

127
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,520
(There was nothing
I could do to stop it.)

128
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,080
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,000
I didn't know any of that.

130
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:55,868
I get it.

131
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
You didn't mean it.

132
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:00,457
It's not your fault.

133
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,080
(That's odd.)

134
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,160
(That's not how Entong told it.)

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Are you sure Jian Dan lives here?

136
00:12:15,622 --> 00:12:17,360
Yeah, why? Is something wrong?

137
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:19,960
This is Han's aunt's place.

138
00:12:21,468 --> 00:12:23,045
Jian Dan never mentioned that.

139
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,080
I'll go open the door.

140
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Oh no.

141
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,360
It's Mi Fen and Yuan Sen!

142
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,920
Hurry, find somewhere to hide!

143
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,280
Why do I need to hide?

144
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,311
If Mi Fen sees you,
she'll get the wrong idea.

145
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Wrong idea about what?

146
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:03,240
Come on!

147
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,577
Hide in the kitchen!

148
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Jian Dan!

149
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,520
Open up! It's me, Mi Fen!

150
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,600
Jian Dan!

151
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,520
Why should I hide?

152
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

153
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
No, wait.

154
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,288
Once they're here,
we won't be able to explain.

155
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,600
I'm not hiding.

156
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,280
Come on!

157
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,800
How do you have a key?

158
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,840
I used to hang out here with Han a lot.

159
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,977
It's the spare key.
We always kept it here.

160
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,160
Jian Dan!

161
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,960
It's not what it looks like.

162
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,925
I usually live here alone.

163
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:54,977
Last night...

164
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:56,960
Last night was an exception.

165
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,920
Just a one-off.

166
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,640
So you two did spend the night together?

167
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,800
No, no, no!

168
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,280
We just had too much to drink!

169
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,000
Nothing...

170
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,640
Nothing happened at all...

171
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,000
So you did get drunk and act out?

172
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,920
Nothing happened after we drank!

173
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:19,320
Han, what exactly happened last night?

174
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
What you saw

175
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
is what happened.

176
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,520
Stop making stuff up.

177
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,160
Mi Fen, did you two eat yet?

178
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,000
No? I'll cook.

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,355
I'll make something for you.

180
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,260
(Mi Fen)

181
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,520
(Why would Jian Dan be with Sheng?)

182
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,885
(Isn't this Jiang Zhishan's place?)

183
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,280
Hi, Sir. Change of plans.

184
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,755
Take me back to the repair shop.

185
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,400
Got it.

186
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,360
Sure. Thanks.

187
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,360
Jian Dan!

188
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:38,640
Entong?

189
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,720
Why are you here?

190
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,080
I just wanted to check on you.

191
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:44,880
How's it going?

192
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
Are you settling in okay
at the repair shop?

193
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,800
I actually moved out.

194
00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm staying at
Han Yansheng's aunt's place now.

195
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,040
Sheng really thought this through.

196
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,017
Entong, about Nan Yuan...

197
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:02,280
Han Yansheng told me everything.

198
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,400
I didn't mean

199
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,880
to keep it from you.

200
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,333
It's just that what happened to Nan Yuan

201
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,120
left a huge scar on me.

202
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,400
He wasn't just Sheng's friend.

203
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,800
He was mine too.

204
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,120
After that incident,

205
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,240
I decided to go on exchange.

206
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,428
I thought, after all this time,

207
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,640
Sheng would've already moved on.

208
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,088
But clearly, I was wrong.

209
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,560
Jian Dan!

210
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,691
Come give me a hand. Hurry!

211
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,040
I'll go help out, okay?

212
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,400
Sure, go ahead.

213
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
Hello, President Li.

214
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,440
We're very interested

215
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,640
in your last proposal.

216
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
We'll head to Qingzhou soon.

217
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,120
Sounds good.

218
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm telling you,

219
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,194
Gu Entong did that on purpose.

220
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,640
Don't let her fool you.

221
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,200
But she really seemed heartbroken.

222
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:18,280
What's there to be heartbroken about?

223
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
If she was upset,

224
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
would she have given you
the wrong info on purpose?

225
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:23,360
Would you have prepped those goggles

226
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,244
and the video
for Han Yansheng at the party?

227
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,520
She knew about
what happened to Nan Yuan,

228
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,200
but she still told you that?

229
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,520
Seriously,

230
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,960
what kind of person does that?

231
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,760
Okay, I'll stop now.

232
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,440
Someone's coming.

233
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,440
But I...

234
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,080
Why are you here so early today?

235
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,660
The Qingzhou Volunteer Association

236
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,190
invited the Ocean University volunteers

237
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:00,079
to an interaction event.

238
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,240
I'll be away all week.

239
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,640
Got it.

240
00:18:09,114 --> 00:18:10,360
Just wanted to let you know.

241
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,920
I have to go now.

242
00:18:14,074 --> 00:18:15,400
Take care, okay?

243
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:18,680
I bought you groceries.

244
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,360
That's a lot.

245
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,760
It'll take me forever
to finish all this.

246
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,960
Then take your time.

247
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,520
Go back inside.

248
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,920
You'll catch a cold.

249
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,280
Monkey.

250
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,880
I'm heading to Qingzhou today.

251
00:18:42,022 --> 00:18:43,155
I'll be away this week.

252
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
Help me keep an eye on Jian Dan.

253
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,480
I can keep an eye on her,

254
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,840
but...

255
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,440
She's staying at Jiang Zhishan's place.

256
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,680
I'm not going near that.

257
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:56,600
Come on, help me out.

258
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll get you that game skin you wanted.

259
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:01,720
For real?

260
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,040
I could just buy it myself.

261
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:07,720
Jiang Zhishan's house?

262
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,320
Yeah, no thanks.

263
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,680
Jian Dan is your friend.

264
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,600
Is she not worth the risk?

265
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,200
Alright, I'll think about it.

266
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,240
My aunt is overseas.

267
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,711
She won't be back anytime soon.

268
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:23,533
Why are you scared?

269
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,200
Fair enough.

270
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,120
Alright, I'll head over now.

271
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:33,280
Don't forget my game skin.

272
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,840
Dinner's ready!

273
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,360
Looks like I made too much rice.

274
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,480
Jian Dan?

275
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,480
Monkey?

276
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,800
What are you doing here?

277
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,680
Han was worried about you.

278
00:20:05,133 --> 00:20:06,244
He asked me to check in.

279
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,800
Well, food's ready. I'll dig in then.

280
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,000
Thanks, really.

281
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,800
I haven't eaten all day. I'm starving.

282
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,000
Han Yansheng already left?

283
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,880
He and Entong

284
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,600
are on their way to Qingzhou.

285
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,200
Entong went too?

286
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,760
After winter break,

287
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,400
they both volunteered at a nursing home.

288
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,360
I see.

289
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,440
But Han still cares about you.

290
00:20:46,137 --> 00:20:47,640
He knew you were working at the garage,

291
00:20:47,931 --> 00:20:49,622
so he got you a place at his

292
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:50,560
aunt's place.

293
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,440
Even before leaving, he told me

294
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,240
to check in on you.

295
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,360
He really cares.

296
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,280
How long has Han's aunt been gone?

297
00:21:03,771 --> 00:21:04,840
When's she coming back?

298
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,880
I hope she doesn't.

299
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Why not?

300
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,480
You have no idea.

301
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,160
Her temper is awful.

302
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,080
She was the terror of my childhood.

303
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,640
A living nightmare...

304
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,520
Hang on, I'll get you some water.

305
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
Slow down, will you?

306
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,560
No one is stealing your food.

307
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,120
Here you go.

308
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,800
Jian Dan.

309
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,120
Don't mention her name

310
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,480
ever again.

311
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,120
The moment you say her name,

312
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,777
my palms start sweating.

313
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,800
Every time I see her,

314
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
a chill runs down my spine.

315
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,080
Isn't that a bit mean to say
about a grown-up?

316
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Grown-up?

317
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,120
Who says she's a real grown-up?

318
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,720
Does Han Yansheng's aunt
have a daughter

319
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,920
around our age?

320
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,880
A daughter?

321
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,120
She can't even get married.

322
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,320
How would she have a daughter?

323
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,480
Take a look at this. Do you know her?

324
00:22:08,514 --> 00:22:09,120
Who?

325
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,040
A childhood nightmare,
and your worst memory ever.

326
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,422
Not to mention, an unmarried crone.

327
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,760
You're back?

328
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
If I hadn't come back,

329
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,311
how would I hear you badmouthing me?

330
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:36,288
It's not what it sounds like.

331
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,422
Who are you anyway?

332
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,088
She's Jian Dan.

333
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,844
She's a friend of mine and Han's too.

334
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,160
Did I ask you?

335
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,160
Jiang Zhishan, don't push it!

336
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
I was the one badmouthing you
behind your back,

337
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,760
not Jian Dan.

338
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,960
If you're mad, take it out on me.

339
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,120
You've got guts now, huh?
Talking back to me?

340
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:03,960
Don't forget,

341
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,240
I still have
that playing card of yours.

342
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,440
You...

343
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,840
That's despicable!

344
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't want to see your face.

345
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,360
Get out of here. Now.

346
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,000
You...

347
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,280
Jian Dan, I should head out.

348
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,160
Take care, okay?

349
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,120
Wait, wait! Don't go!

350
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,045
Hold on.

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,400
Who lives here?

352
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't you know I hate it

353
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,520
when people stay at my place
without asking me first?

354
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,560
It was Sheng
who let you stay here, right?

355
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,488
What's your relationship with him?

356
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,040
We're...

357
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Just regular friends.

358
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,640
Just regular friends?

359
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,600
I'm sorry.

360
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,920
I didn't know you didn't like
people staying here.

361
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,960
I'll pack up and leave right now.

362
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,520
Sheng.

363
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,400
It's about this exchange event.

364
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,088
I honestly didn't plan on saying yes.

365
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,640
But President Li was too enthusiastic.

366
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,800
I couldn't say no.

367
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,800
But now it means everyone

368
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,666
won't get to go home
for Chinese New Year.

369
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:40,133
You're not mad at me, are you?

370
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,320
President Li told me
about the event too.

371
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,155
You did the right thing.

372
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,640
If you feel the same way,

373
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,760
then I feel a lot better.

374
00:24:57,754 --> 00:24:58,200
Hello?

375
00:24:58,697 --> 00:24:59,640
Han?

376
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,280
I haven't been able to reach Jian Dan.

377
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,440
If you can get a hold of her,

378
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,920
tell her to come to the hospital now.

379
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,760
Her grandma fainted.
She's in the hospital.

380
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:06,760
Don't worry.

381
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm heading there now.

382
00:25:09,668 --> 00:25:11,000
Sir, please stop the car.

383
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,360
What is it, Sheng?

384
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,280
What happened?

385
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,933
Jian Dan's grandma is in the hospital.

386
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,120
I need to go see her.

387
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,177
But what about the exchange event?

388
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:20,520
You have experience
with volunteer work.

389
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,400
You can lead the team too.

390
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,680
Sir, Central Hospital.

391
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:37,817
As fast as you can.

392
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:46,600
Monkey, did you see Jian Dan

393
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,666
at my aunt's place today?

394
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,182
Jian Dan?

395
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,266
She's probably still
at Jiang Zhishan's place.

396
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,280
You know what?

397
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,720
Jiang Zhishan showed up
out of nowhere today.

398
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:56,800
She gave me the start.

399
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:57,920
You know...

400
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,800
Hello? Han?

401
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,320
Hello? Sheng?

402
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,400
Is Jian Dan there?

403
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,840
Let me talk to her.

404
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,400
She's not here.

405
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,480
Where did she go?

406
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,840
Why don't you care about your own aunt?

407
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,880
All you care about is her.

408
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,720
Sorry.

409
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,000
The number you dialed is powered off.

410
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,480
Please try again later.

411
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,040
(Is she mad)

412
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,844
(because Jian Dan is living
in her place?)

413
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,560
(Never mind.)

414
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,680
(The hospital first.)

415
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:04,120
Hey, Miss.

416
00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,160
Can I borrow your power bank?

417
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,422
My phone's out of battery.

418
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,280
Sure.

419
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,080
Thanks a lot.

420
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,060
(Han Yansheng: 1 notification)

421
00:27:20,688 --> 00:27:22,570
(Han Yansheng:
Grandma fainted and is in the hospital.)

422
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:24,244
(Come to the Central Hospital.)

423
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,440
My power bank...

424
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,400
Sorry!

425
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,360
Thank you!

426
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:40,680
(First-aid Center)

427
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,280
Is Grandma okay?

428
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,280
The doctor said

429
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,440
she got here just in time.

430
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,880
Her life's not in danger for now.

431
00:27:48,297 --> 00:27:49,377
Try not to worry too much.

432
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,440
How is my grandma?

433
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,133
The surgery went very well.

434
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,933
She must stay for observation.

435
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,640
If there's no complications,

436
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,600
she can go home soon.

437
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:29,760
Thank you, Sir.

438
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,640
Thanks.

439
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:48,377
Family members,
please pay the hospital bill.

440
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,680
I'll do it.

441
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,755
You stay with Grandma.

442
00:28:56,205 --> 00:28:57,142
No, it's fine.

443
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,760
Once Grandma wakes up,

444
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,320
she'll want to see you first.

445
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:06,691
Your boyfriend is really sweet.

446
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,400
He is not my boyfriend.

447
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:10,960
So, is he wooing you?

448
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,800
A handsome and thoughtful guy like that?

449
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,920
I'd say yes in a heartbeat.

450
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:24,748
All done.

451
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:32,980
(2000 yuan. Payment received.)

452
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,080
I just sent you the money on WeChat.

453
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,960
You sent too much.

454
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:41,920
The owner's back now.

455
00:29:42,088 --> 00:29:43,977
There's no need for cleaning anymore.

456
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,080
I'll return the extra to you first.

457
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,200
Did my aunt give you a hard time?

458
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:55,045
Jian Dan.

459
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,080
Grandma's awake.

460
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,400
Grandma!

461
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,040
Are you feeling okay?

462
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,240
I'll go get the doctor.

463
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm fine.

464
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,480
I made you worry, didn't I?

465
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,120
Han, you're here too.

466
00:30:17,697 --> 00:30:19,960
Grandma, are you okay?

467
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,400
It's all thanks to Han Yansheng.

468
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,040
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

469
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,120
known what to do.

470
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,200
I've troubled you again.

471
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:30,880
Not at all.

472
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,960
Rest well and get well.

473
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:36,360
I'll take a call.

474
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,280
Han is a good kid.

475
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,640
Today is Chinese New Year's Eve.

476
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,577
On Chinese New Year's Eve,

477
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,720
he is still here
at the hospital with us.

478
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,280
I feel sorry to trouble him.

479
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,360
I'll tell him to head home in a bit.

480
00:31:02,955 --> 00:31:04,711
I'll spend Chinese New Year's Eve
with you.

481
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,760
Every year,

482
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,640
we spent it in Shenmu Village.

483
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,320
We made a big feast,

484
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,640
with so many dishes.

485
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,733
Your favorites.

486
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,840
But this year,

487
00:31:24,244 --> 00:31:26,400
you're spending it at the hospital

488
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,040
with me.

489
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,240
Sorry, kid.

490
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,120
As long as I'm with you, Grandma,

491
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,280
it doesn't matter where we are.

492
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,440
Good girl.

493
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,200
But we won't get to watch
the fireworks this year.

494
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,840
That's okay. When I'm all better,

495
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,320
I'll buy you the best fireworks.

496
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,120
We'll ask Han to join us too.

497
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,720
Okay.

498
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
(Han Yansheng:
Come outside. I need to talk to you.)

499
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,360
Grandma's asleep.

500
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:47,880
What's up?

501
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,511
I want to take you somewhere.

502
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,440
It's late. Where are we going?

503
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:56,400
You'll see when we get there.

504
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,960

505
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,960

Go tidy it up, will you?

532
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:48,480
A new student
is moving in this semester.

533
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,720
What major, Auntie?

534
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Also a freshman like us?

535
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,120
Nope, fashion design.

536
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
She's one year above you.

537
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,274
She's an international student.

538
00:34:58,337 --> 00:34:59,920
So go ahead and clean up a bit.

539
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Make a good first impression.

540
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,680
Got it, Auntie. Bye!

Who was it?

543
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,240
The dorm lady from downstairs.

544
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,320
A student majoring in fashion design

545
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,280
is moving into our room.

546
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,960
She asked us to clean the bed.

547
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,640
But Jian Dan...

548
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,480
I've already made plans
to eat with Yuan Sen, so maybe...

549

Got it, I'll do it.

Didn't I ask Monkey
to help with my luggage?

553

Why did you show up?

554
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
You really don't know why?
