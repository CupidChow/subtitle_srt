Wake up.

189
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,440
It's 8 AM.

190
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,760
Wake up and study.

191
00:17:08,457 --> 00:17:09,560
Han,

192
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,617
can you not be so cruel?

193
00:17:11,674 --> 00:17:13,411
It's the weekend.

194
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,769
Once you fail your paper,

195
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,100
you'll know if it's me being cruel

196
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,440
or your grades.

197
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,640
Hello?

198
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,800
Hello, we're calling
from the climbing shoes store.

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,880
The pair you pre-ordered a few days ago
has arrived.

200
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,911
When would be a good time
for you to pick them up?

201
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:32,800
All right. I'll come now.

202
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,800
I need to go out.

203
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:38,800
You all get the day off today.

204
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,520
Hello.

205
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:47,822
Pick up an order.

206
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,120
You're Mr. Han, right?

207
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,560
Last time,

208
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,240
we didn't have size 36 in stock,

209
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:53,711
so we brought in a pair

210
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:54,760
from another store.

211
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,200
Here.

212
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,311
Please check the shoes.

213
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,040
It's perfect. Please wrap them up.

214
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:09,520
Sure.

215
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,560
One moment, please.

216
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,280
Here you go.

217
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,480
Thank you, young man.

218
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,040
No problem.

219
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,320
Young man,

220
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,880
how do I get to the girls' dorm?

221
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:56,560
My granddaughter studies at this school.

222
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
She's in the psychology department.

223
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,044
Have you contacted
your granddaughter yet?

224
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,133
This campus is big.

225
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,720
If no one guides you,

226
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,133
you could easily get lost.

227
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,280
No.

228
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,680
I want to give her a surprise.

229
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,240
All right, then. I'll go with you.

230
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,520
Thank you so much.

231
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,280
Let me carry that.

232
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,440
Thank you.

233
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,111
We'll go this way.

234
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:24,640
Ma'am,

235
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,440
we're almost there.

236
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:29,600
You bought new shoes?

237
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
It's a gift.

238
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:35,466
There's a superstition
if you're giving them to a girlfriend.

239
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,680
It's not good.

240
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
She'll walk away from you

241
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,720
and end up leaving for someone else.

242
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,577
They're not for a girlfriend.

243
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,640
Just a friend.

244
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
Giving shoes to just a friend?

245
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,920
I think you like her,

246
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,560
but you never tell.

247
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,440
Ma'am.

248
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,080
What's wrong?

249
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,840
Are you not feeling well?

250
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,908
I'm old.

251
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,200
Getting weak now.

252
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,720
It was only a few hours on the road,

253
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,240
and I'm...

254
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm feeling dizzy.

255
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,755
I'll help you over there
to rest for a while.

256
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,720
No need.

257
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,880
I haven't seen my granddaughter
in so long.

258
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm anxious to see her.

259
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,440
I'm fine.

260
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,880
Let's go. Quick.

261
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,360
All right.

262
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,940
(Director of Shenmu Village)

263
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,240
Director.

264
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,880
Jian Dan, your grandma
went to your campus.

265
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:58,320
Judging by the time,

266
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,533
she should arrive soon.

267
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:01,160
Grandma is coming?

268
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,155
Didn't she say she'd come next weekend?

269
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,311
Your grandma got worried

270
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,800
when she heard you hurt your foot,

271
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,240
so she came a week early.

272
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,148
Right, remind her

273
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,960
to meet me at the campus gate at 2 PM.

274
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,466
I'll drive her back.

275
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,782
All right, Director.

276
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,920
The subscriber you've dialed
is powered off.

277
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,560
Sorry.

278
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:26,200
Why is her phone powered off?

279
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,488
Did she forget to bring her phone?

280
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,622
(Apartment Building No. 15)
Young man,

281
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,988
kind and honest young people like you

282
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,840
are rare these days.

283
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,000
It's a shame
that you already have a girlfriend.

284
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:49,960
If you didn't,

285
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,400
I'd definitely introduce
my granddaughter to you.

286
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,840
My granddaughter is really pretty.

287
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,440
Round face.

288
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,840
Round lips.

289
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:02,555
And she's good at swimming.

290
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,120
She can swim faster than a fish.

291
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
All the villagers like her.

292
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,354
If you met her,

293
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:10,960
you'd like her, too.

294
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:12,960
By the way,

295
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,577
she told me

296
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,280
that when she started university,

297
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,040
she joined the Swimming Club here.

298
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,120
She said the president

299
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,400
took special care of her

300
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,640
and really liked her.

301
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,160
Swimming Club?

302
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Your granddaughter is...

303
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,280
Grandma!

304
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,480
Jian Dan?

305
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,600
How did you know her name?

306
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,080
Do you know each other?

307
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Ma'am,

308
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,720
I'm Han Yansheng,

309
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,800
the Swimming Club president
she mentioned, who looked after her.

310
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,251
Oh, it's you?

311
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,200
I told you.

312
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,320
I knew you'd like her

313
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,960
once you met her.

314
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,200
- There's a misunderstanding here.
- I miss you so much!

315
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,880
My sweetheart,

316
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,120
I miss you, too.

317
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,668
How's your foot?

318
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
It's recovered.

319
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,120
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

320
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,160
I only found out
when the village director called.

321
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,840
By the way, where's your phone?

322
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Why is it off?

323
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,880
I turned it off to save battery.

324
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,160
What are you doing here?

325
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,480
I got carsick.

326
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,600
It was Han

327
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,840
who carried my luggage, held my arm,

328
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,480
and brought me here.

329
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,754
Thank you for helping my grandma.

330
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:35,440
It was nothing.

331
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,240
Han,

332
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,480
I told you.

333
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:41,022
Once you've seen my granddaughter,

334
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,240
you'd like her.

335
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:43,880
Say,

336
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,440
don't you need to give those shoes
to your girlfriend?

337
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,280
Go ahead.

338
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,040
Don't let me hold you up.

339
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,960
You should go now.

340
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,400
Entong will like those shoes.

341
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,560
Who said they're for her?

342
00:23:58,777 --> 00:23:59,977
It's for you.

343
00:24:02,034 --> 00:24:02,445
For...

344
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,200
For me?

345
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,320
You bought them for Jian Dan.

346
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,640
I told you, Han.

347
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,720
Giving shoes to a girlfriend

348
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,920
means you want to
walk through life forever

349
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,080
with her.

350
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,720
That's very good!

351
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,680
That's not what you said just now.

352
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,880
I have plans.

353
00:24:28,577 --> 00:24:29,440
I should get going.

354
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,514
Grandma.

355
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,240
Wait here.

356
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,644
I'll go put your luggage upstairs,

357
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,990
and then take you to the cafeteria.

358
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Okay.

359
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,040
Grandma,

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
this is the cafeteria's specialty.

361
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,960
Tiger-skin peppers.

362
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,560
Try it.

363
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,760
Specialty?

364
00:24:54,644 --> 00:24:56,200
- It must be delicious.
- Jian Dan.

365
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,120
Mi Fen?

366
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,200
Grandma, this is my dormmate, Mi Fen.

367
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,840
Hello, ma'am.

368
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,582
This is my grandma.

369
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,760
Hello.

370
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,560
Jian Dan said

371
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,400
you're her best friend.

372
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,320
I know, right?

373
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,000
Come sit here. Let's eat together.

374
00:25:11,755 --> 00:25:13,530
You ordered spicy dishes
for your grandma.

375
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:14,560
Don't steal it.

376
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,440
Who's the one sitting next to Jian Dan?

377
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,680
That's her grandma.

378
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
Grandma?

379
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,880
We have to go say hi to her.

380
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:21,600
Come on.

381
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,920
- Ma'am.
- Hello, ma'am.

382
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,640
I'm Jian Dan's friend, Xiahou Ling.

383
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
You can call me Monkey.

384
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,120
Monkey?

385
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,440
Why Monkey?

386
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,377
You must be smart and lovable

387
00:25:33,422 --> 00:25:35,468
like the Monkey King.

388
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:38,948
Han, you're here too?

389
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,480
Sit down.

390
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,600
Let's eat together.

391
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,720
The more, the merrier.

392
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,240
Sure.

393
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,088
I'll sit over there.

394
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,880
Mi Fen,

395
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,782
was it you looking after Jian Dan

396
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,840
when she hurt her foot?

397
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,466
No. Not me. It was him.

398
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Jian Dan got hurt

399
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,400
during the Swimming Club's open day.

400
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,880
As president, it's my duty

401
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,120
to take care of her.

402
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,040
Yeah, right.

403
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,880
You put private matters
above your duty, though.

404
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:20,688
I didn't come to pick you up
on the last day

405
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,080
because you said no,

406
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,280
didn't you?

407
00:26:23,622 --> 00:26:24,933
I wasn't talking about that time.

408
00:26:24,955 --> 00:26:25,777
Which time, then?

409
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,733
You said you were busy,
but you actually went to a dessert shop.

410
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,444
That was because I was with Entong,
getting her laptop fixed.

411
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,160
I stopped by the dessert shop
while we were waiting.

412
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,760
How did you even know I went there?

413
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,760
Is that why

414
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,640
you told me not to pick you up?

415
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,720
No. Not at all.

416
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,160
Who you were with at the dessert shop

417
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,400
has nothing to do with me.

418
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,742
Mi Fen, what's going on between them?

419
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,320
I don't know.

420
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,165
They had beef
since the first day of school.

421
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,520
I know.

422
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,040
It all started with that campus forum.

423
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,600
- Don't you say it!
- Don't you say it!

424
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,531
Jian Dan,

425
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,560
let's take a photo.

426
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,840
You're rarely home.

427
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,640
I want a picture so I can look at you
when I miss you.

428
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:23,440
Okay.

429
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,080
I'll take it for you, okay?

430
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,840
I'll do it.

431
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,810
I'll handle the lighting.

432
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,000
Han, come here.

433
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,680
Let's take a photo together.

434
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,148
Sure.

435
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,022
All right.

436
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,560
Good, look here.

437
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:33,920
Come.

438
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,160
Good.

439
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:35,640
Look here.

440
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,320
Three, two, one.

441
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,040
Cheese.

442
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,320
Have you found your button?

443
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
The seminar room is locked now.

444
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,688
Probably can't get it back.

445
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,640
It's fine.

446
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,060
Sheng's first time
meeting someone's family?

447
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,370
(Monkey: It's Han's first time
meeting someone's family.)

448
00:28:09,377 --> 00:28:10,844
(Yuan Sen, Han Yansheng)

449
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,240
Monkey really likes joking.

450
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,800
Careful!

451
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:18,840
Thank you.

452
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,480
The cafeteria is pretty good.

453
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,200
Grandma, are you not feeling well?

454
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,240
I noticed

455
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,520
you coughed a lot just now.

456
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm fine.

457
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,800
It's just that the city air

458
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680
is not as fresh as it is
back in the village.

459
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm not used to it.

460
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,600
Grandma, let's head back
to the dorm and rest.

461
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,444
You've got a long ride
later this afternoon.

462
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,920
All right. Let's go.

463
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,320
We're leaving.

464
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,360
Thank you.

465
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,880
- Bye.
- Take care.

466
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,520
See you.

467
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,137
See you, ma'am. Take care.

468
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,920
Sure.

469
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,500
(Diagnosis: Chronic Heart Failure)

470
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,200
Grandma, please take care of yourself.

471
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,800
Call me anytime,
even if nothing happens.

472
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,480
You two should take care, too.

473
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,080
Eat well.

474
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,520
Don't be too thrifty.

475
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
Ma'am!

476
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,160
Ma'am.

477
00:29:35,182 --> 00:29:36,200
Monkey.

478
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Ma'am,

479
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,360
this is some food Han prepared for you.

480
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,240
Please take it.

481
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,360
Oh, I can't.

482
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,800
It's just a little something from us.

483
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,600
Please accept it.

484
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,600
You shouldn't have bought this.

485
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,320
Well...

486
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,160
May I speak with you in private?

487
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,120
Of course.

488
00:29:56,068 --> 00:29:56,800
Jian Dan.

489
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,680
Come.

490
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,520
Give the village director a call

491
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:01,177
and ask when the car will arrive.

492
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,840
Ma'am, you came here

493
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,555
not just to visit Jian Dan,

494
00:30:12,622 --> 00:30:14,333
you're also here to see a doctor, right?

495
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,268
How did you know?

496
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,280
I saw your test results.

497
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,537
Your illness...

498
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,320
Since you already know,

499
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,640
I won't hide it anymore.

500
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,360
Yes, I came

501
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,800
to see a doctor.

502
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,885
But you mustn't tell

503
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,400
Jian Dan.

504
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,680
She worries too much.

505
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,560
If she finds out I'm sick,

506
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,888
she won't be able to
focus on her studies.

507
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,440
Don't worry.

508
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
I won't tell her.

509
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,240
But you mustn't delay treatment.

510
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,977
Remember to take your medicine on time.

511
00:30:48,022 --> 00:30:49,600
Thank you, Han.

512
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,908
Han,

513
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,160
with someone like you
looking after Jian Dan,

514
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,360
I feel at ease.

515
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Thank you.

516
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,240
No trouble.

517
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,754
Grandma, the car is here.

518
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,840
Let's go, Grandma.

519
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,280
You're here.

520
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:21,680
Yeah.

521
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,640
Jian Dan.

522
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,440
Careful.

523
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,680
Safe trip.

524
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:27,720
Don't worry.

525
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,280
Take care of yourself.

526
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Bye, Grandma.

527
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,280
- We're leaving, Jian Dan.
- See you.

528
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:35,045
Bye.

529
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,800
Han,

530
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:39,560
Yuan Sen and I have class.

531
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,466
We're heading off.

532
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:42,720
I need to pick up a few things
from the store.

533
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,240
Bye.

534
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,720
Let's go.

535
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,640
Hold on.

536
00:31:47,933 --> 00:31:50,133
What were you talking
about when you pulled

537
00:31:50,444 --> 00:31:51,480
Grandma aside just now?

538
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,160
Secret.

539
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,880
Then I'm going to ask her myself later.

540
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,600
I was worried she might
get the wrong idea about us,

541
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
so I explained it to her.

542
00:32:03,977 --> 00:32:05,360
And what did she say?

543
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,960
She said...

544
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,600
What did she say?

545
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,800
She hopes I'll be her grandson-in-law

546
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,960
and keep an eye on you.

547
00:32:18,266 --> 00:32:19,222
I don't need that.

548
00:32:29,666 --> 00:32:32,160
(Facing the Future: I heard
Jian Dan's grandma came yesterday.)

549
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,160
(Han Yansheng had lunch with them.)

550
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,320
(Does this count as meeting the family?)

551
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:39,120
(Yu Sheng: Good thing
I ship Han Yansheng and Jian Dan.)

552
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,320
(Those who ship him with Gu Entong)

553
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,800
(must be heartbroken right now.)

554
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,320
(Typing: Looks like
Tong-Yan ship is on thin ice.)

555
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,480
(I'm on the Sheng-Dan ship from now on.)

556
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,400
(Gu Entong: Jian Dan,
I have something to ask you.)

557
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,640
(Can we meet?)

558
