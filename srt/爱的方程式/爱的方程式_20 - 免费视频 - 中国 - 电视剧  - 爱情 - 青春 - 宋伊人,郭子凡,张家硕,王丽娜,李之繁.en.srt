14
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay? I'm hanging up.

15
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:43,666
All right.

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,800
So, you don't have depression.

17
00:01:48,805 --> 00:01:49,760
It was all a lie.

18
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,920
Sheng, I can explain.

19
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,320
What is there to explain?

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,788
Since we were kids,

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,342
you've always found a way

22
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,355
to push away any girl
who got close to Sheng.

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,480
Jian Dan was no exception.

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,080
Sheng, you know what?

25
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,320
She was the one
who sent that video to Jian Dan.

26
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:15,080
Is that true?

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,720
I did it because I like you so much...

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,680
I...

29
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Entong, listen carefully.

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,880
The one I like is Jian Dan.

31
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,360
Then what about Nan Yuan?

32
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:39,600
Did you forget that too?

33
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,955
That was something
we experienced together.

34
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:43,817
I know you better than anyone else.

35
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,840
We are the perfect match, Sheng.

36
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Gu Entong.

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
You keep saying you love Han Yansheng,

38
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,977
yet you keep using what happened
to Nan Yuan to hurt him.

39
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,400
That's not love.

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,040
Also,

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,444
Han Yansheng is my boyfriend now.

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,400
If you try to hurt him again,

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,577
I'll make you regret it.

44
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,200
Let's go.

45
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,360
All right.
That's all for today's lecture.

46
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:29,080
Class dismissed.

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,760
Professor,

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,120
you mentioned

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,840
PTSD can be

50
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,131
treated through

51
00:03:40,171 --> 00:03:41,120
psychotherapy.

52
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,377
What exactly does that involve?

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,720
The causes of PTSD vary

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
between individuals,

55
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,360
so symptoms show up differently too.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It takes long-term observation

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,760
to determine
which treatment approach is suitable.

58
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,280
I will

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,880
recommend some books.

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,240
Read up when you can.

61
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:03,044
That would be great.
Thank you, Professor.

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,620
(Transforming Trauma)

63
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,000
Entong!

64
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,720
Shi?

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,680
I made you some coffee.

66
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:24,888
Take it with you for the road.

67
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,120
It means so much that I still have you

68
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,760
when I'm at my lowest.

69
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:44,360
Thank you.

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,240
Don't worry. This will pass.

71
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm off.

72
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,400
Entong.

73
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,688
I'll wait for you to come back.

74
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,160
Jian Dan.

75
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,920
You borrowed
so many books from the library.

76
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,360
Why'd you borrow even more?

77
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,931
You're a strong woman, Jian Dan.

78
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,760
Jian Dan, by the way,

79
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,217
Gu Entong took leave,

80
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,440
saying she was attending
some kind of music exchange.

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,400
If you ask me,

82
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,240
she's just too embarrassed

83
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,040
after her lies got exposed.

84
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,040
Gu Entong is so scheming.

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,560
We were so wrong about her.

86
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,040
Let's stop talking about her.

87
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,800
You two, do me a favor.

88
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,160
What is it?

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,960
Help me ask Monkey and Yuan Sen to come.

90
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,022
I have something to discuss
with everyone tomorrow.

91
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:28,244
Okay.

92
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Sure.

93
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,657
I called you all here

94
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,388
because I wanted to discuss ways

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,760
to help Han Yansheng with his trauma.

96
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,840
He wants to move forward too.

97
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,600
You're the psychology major.

98
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,733
We'll follow your lead.

99
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,866
According to the books,

100
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,440
helping the patient face
their psychological barrier head-on

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,960
is one approach.

102
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
You mean like

103
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,320
recreating the scene?

104
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,840
Not exactly.

105
00:07:58,933 --> 00:07:59,977
There's an order to things.

106
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,200
We take it step by step.

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,000
So how should we do it?

108
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,320
I have an idea.

109
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,279
I don't think this is a good idea.

110
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,990
The whole point is
to catch him off guard.

111
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,200
Why are you bringing me
to the girls' dorm?

112
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,828
Here they come.

113
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:26,320
Uh, um...

114
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,680
Wait here.

115
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,800
Jian Dan wants to talk to you,
but she can't come out.

116
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,222
Just wait here.

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Get some water. Go, go, go.

118
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:37,080
Jian Dan wants to see me, right?

119
00:08:37,444 --> 00:08:39,090
I can wait for her
at the front entrance.

120
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,480
You won't run into her there. Wait here.

121
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,640
Why wouldn't I run into her?
Everyone walks through it.

122
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,600
There's a back door!

123
00:08:49,297 --> 00:08:50,000
There is?

124
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,520
She never uses the back door.
I know...

125
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,266
Stop!

126
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,560
Han.

127
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,400
Just stay here and wait.

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,617
Jian Dan will be out soon.

129
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,600
- Hurry!
- Careful.

130
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Jiang Zhishan, get down here!

131
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,960
It's your fault
for standing so close to Sheng.

132
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,622
You threw the water
in the wrong direction!

133
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:39,377
Dry yourself off.

134
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:39,911
I'll do it.

135
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,320
Stop it, Jiang Zhishan!

136
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,720
Stop!

137
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,240
Enough. Stop fighting!

138
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:49,840
Well, that plan failed...

139
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,640
Well, it was rushed this time.

140
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,000
But I've got another one.
It will definitely work.

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm here.

142
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,640
Where are you?

143
00:10:28,268 --> 00:10:29,560
I'll be right there.

144
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,651
Don't move.

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,862
Stay where you are.

146
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,644
Are you sure this will work?

147
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,644
Of course.

148
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,480
I checked.

149
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,560
The fountain here

150
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,133
goes off at exactly noon every day.

151
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,514
We just need to get Han

152
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,266
to stand right in the middle of it.

153
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,411
(Girls like milk tea.)

154
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:06,091
(I should buy Jian Dan one.)

155
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,285
He's leaving!

156
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,120
Do something!

157
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,920
Go! Get out there!

158
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,777
Go!

159
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,880

with this lame idea, didn't he?

171
00:12:35,982 --> 00:12:37,320
How is this lame?

172
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,920
I was the best support!

173
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,170
Aren't you afraid of water?

174
00:12:43,314 --> 00:12:43,880
What happened?

175
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,040
I just can't swim in the ocean.

176
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:49,320
It's not like I can't shower.

177
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,060
How was that different from bathing?

178
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:52,780
Fair point.

179
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,970
One sprays from the top,

180
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:54,955
and one from the bottom.

181
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:58,600
Even if it didn't do much,

182
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:00,140
I appreciate the help.

183
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:01,940
As long as you're not mad.

184
00:13:02,377 --> 00:13:04,420
Then let's move on to the next plan.

185
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,100
- Come on.
- There's more?

186
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,700
I don't think Monkey's plan will work.

187
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:20,045
Should we go

188
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,500
with Plan B instead?

189
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,155
I think that's a good call.

190
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,045
What's unreliable about my plan?

191
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:27,325
We haven't even tried it yet.

192
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,980
I really doubt your brain

193
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,460
could come up with anything good.

194
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,866
Han will be here any second.

195
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:32,965
Already?

196
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,220
I'm not ready yet.

197
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,555
What are you doing?

198
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,500
Han! Han!

199
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,580
Han!

200
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,700
Help me!

201
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,780
Help!

202
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,640
Han!

203
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,060
(Water depth: 0.9m)
Save me, Han!

204
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm drowning!

205
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:54,780
Han!

206
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,651
Help!

207
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,060
Save me, Han!

208
00:13:58,114 --> 00:13:58,980
Han!

209
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,220
Han!

210
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,620
Save me!

211
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,622
You done with your act?

212
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,820
Heartless.

213
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,380
What if I really drowned?

214
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,540
If your brain's already waterlogged,

215
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,620
drowning's on you.

216
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,460
I...

217
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,020
Come on.

218
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,380
Let's go soak in the hot spring.

219
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,140
Jian Dan!

220
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,422
Where's your necklace?

221
00:14:57,462 --> 00:14:58,620
You were just wearing it.

222
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,000
I was!

223
00:15:01,062 --> 00:15:01,620
It's gone.

224
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,259
Did you drop it into the hot spring
when you were with Mi Fen?

225
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,355
This pool uses circulating water.
Let's find it quickly.

226
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,354
Then what are you waiting for?
Start looking!

227
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,940
Hurry!

228
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,020
Jian Dan!

229
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,900
Are you okay?

230
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,540
Leave this to me.

231
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,980
I'll find it.

232
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,540
There it is.

233
00:15:58,474 --> 00:15:59,100
Found it.

234
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,260
Here.

235
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:21,940
Don't lose it again.

236
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,340
I knew you could do it.

237
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:48,540
So how are you going to make up

238
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,020
for lying to me?

239
00:16:52,748 --> 00:16:54,580
It wasn't just my idea.

240
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,720
Check the water temperature.

241
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,300
- Not bad.
- Come on.

242
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,980
Which one would you like?

243
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:30,460
(Breath-Holding Challenge)

244
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,620
(Record-breaker gets a lobster!)

245
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,740
What is it now?

246
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,580
A breath-holding challenge.

247
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,180
The record at this restaurant

248
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,420
is 4 minutes and 3 seconds.

249
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,700
Monkey says you're good
at holding your breath.

250
00:17:47,262 --> 00:17:49,982
He said you could last up
to 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

251
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,020
Give it a shot.

252
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,540
Han,

253
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,620
you're our ticket
to a lobster dinner tonight.

254
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,500
Steamed or braised?

255
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,540
How about with garlic?

256
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,888
You even went into the hot spring.

257
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,244
This will be nothing for you.

258
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:01,780
Han,

259
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,888
you can do it.

260
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,540
Don't worry.

261
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,180
We're all going
to help you through this.

262
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:12,355
- You got this.
- You can do it.

263
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,780
- You got this.
- You can do it.

264
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:17,260
Boss,

265
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,760
I want to take the challenge.

266
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,540
Sure.

267
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,660
One, two, three, go!

268
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,940
Keep going, Han!

269
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,060
4 minutes and 1 second.

270
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
4 minutes and 2 seconds.

271
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,580
4 minutes and 3 seconds.

272
00:19:26,525 --> 00:19:27,380
You broke the record!

273
00:19:30,731 --> 00:19:31,737
He broke the record!

274
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,440
- Lobster! Lobster!
- Get up!

275
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:37,000
- Get the tissue.
- You're amazing!

276
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,260
Impressive, young man.

277
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,420
The lobster's over there.

278
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,380
Go pick one.

279
00:19:42,511 --> 00:19:43,860
I'll go! I'll pick the biggest one!

280
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Me too!

281
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,260
- We'll go get a table then.
- Let's go!

282
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,500
Let me get you cleaned up.

283
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,688
Lobster! Lobster!

284
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:53,580
This one!

285
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,140
Which one? This one!

286
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:00,220
Oh! My finger!

287
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,900
You can't even catch a lobster right.

288
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:03,060
Ouch!

289
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,860
Boss! Do something!

290
00:20:05,182 --> 00:20:05,737
Boss!

291
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:06,805
Don't move.

292
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,640
- All right.
- Move and it clamps tighter.

293
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:09,611
I'm not moving.

294
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:10,700
I'll figure something out.

295
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,160
Hurry!

296
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:12,702
Hurry up!

297
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,780
Shut up!

298
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,900
It's squeezing even harder!

299
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,380
Do something

300
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,580
to calm me down!

301
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,060
I... I like you!

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,355
Here.

303
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:34,700
Put your hand in the water.

304
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,380
Put your hand in the water!

305
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,340
All right.

306
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:46,933
Take this lobster with you.

307
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,620
Hey!

308
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,380
Don't ever say that again.

309
00:20:56,444 --> 00:20:58,022
That was scarier than the lobster.

310
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:01,644
Might as well let it crush your finger!

311
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,420
Han Yansheng
was in great condition today.

312
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:12,580
He was very cooperative.

313
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm confident

314
00:21:14,211 --> 00:21:16,300
I can help him get past
his mental block.

315
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
(Han Yansheng: Jian Dan, can you come)

316
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,540
(with me somewhere tonight?)

317
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:32,820
(Okay.)

318
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,540
So this is Nan Yuan's home?

319
00:21:47,177 --> 00:21:48,500
They moved here

320
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,260
after the accident.

321
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,340
I haven't seen his parents

322
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,667
since that happened.

323
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Mrs. Nan,

324
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,820
I came to visit you and Mr. Nan.

325
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,020
Han?

326
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,980
What brings you here?

327
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,660
Come in.

328
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,460
Come in.

329
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,340
Please don't mind

330
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,380
the mess.

331
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,860
Delivery.

332
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,380
Please accept it.

333
00:22:34,028 --> 00:22:34,820
Thank you.

334
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,340
They smell lovely.

335
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,220
Thank you, Han.

336
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,820
I didn't send that.

337
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,180
You didn't?

338
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,420
Then who did?

339
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,700
Maybe one of Yuan's other friends.

340
00:22:53,811 --> 00:22:54,820
Don't just stand there.

341
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,540
Come in and sit.

342
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,300
Yellow roses mean apology.

343
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:05,740
Han, aren't you going to introduce us?

344
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,580
Who is this?

345
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,580
Mrs. Nan,

346
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,220
this is Jian Dan.

347
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,820
She's my girlfriend.

348
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,020
Hello.

349
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,644
It's nice to meet you.

350
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,180
If Yuan were still around,

351
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,888
he might've brought
a girlfriend home too.

352
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,300
I'm sorry.

353
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,060
If I hadn't insisted on diving that day,

354
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,660
Nan Yuan would still be here.

355
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,900
Han,

356
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,660
we've never blamed you.

357
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,940
What happened to Yuan was an accident.

358
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,533
You didn't mean for it to happen.

359
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,980
Stop holding on to that guilt.

360
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,100
It's been

361
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,420
so long now.

362
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,100
His father and I have already moved on.

363
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,660
We're living a new life.

364
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,820
You should too.

365
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,140
Yuan was your best friend.

366
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,420
He wouldn't want to see you like this.

367
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,140
Han.

368
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,860
Mr. Nan.

369
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,260
It's been a while.

370
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,500
Glad you came today.

371
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,460
In a few days,

372
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,340
my wife and I are moving abroad.

373
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,580
We might not see each other again.

374
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,100
We're packing right now.

375
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,340
Mr. Nan,

376
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,020
you're moving?

377
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,620
We bought a house overseas.

378
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,660
We planned to move

379
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,177
after Yuan started college.

380
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:31,860
But things didn't go as expected...

381
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,100
There's nothing
tying us down here anymore.

382
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,780
So we're leaving now.

383
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,700
The movers are already downstairs.

384
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,540
Why don't you come help me meet them?

385
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:46,660
Mr. Nan. Mrs. Nan.

386
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,420
Leave the packing to me.

387
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,940
I'll help too.

388
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,660
Okay. Thank you.

389
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,900
Here.

390
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,580
I'll take that.

391
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,460
I can't believe this is still here.

392
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,060
What's the story behind it?

393
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,180
It's the birthday gift

394
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,260
I gave Nan Yuan.

395
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,740
He loved it.

396
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:34,820
Wore it all the time.

397
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,540
How did you and Nan Yuan meet?

398
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,940
We were childhood friends.

399
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,020
In high school,
we both joined the Swimming Club.

400
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,580
He had stamina and speed

401
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,380
that matched mine.

402
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,540
We trained together,

403
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,980
competed together,

404
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
and went to Ocean University's
summer swim camp together.

405
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,500
The city swim meet

406
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,660
is about to be held
at Ocean University.

407
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,700
Our school has two spots to fill.

408
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,666
An internal selection will happen
within the next week.

409
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,100
The top two scorers
will represent the school.

410
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,700
The selection is based

411
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,540
on well-rounded skills.

412
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,340
Each swimmer's times
in the 100-meter freestyle,

413
00:26:53,355 --> 00:26:54,977
butterfly, backstroke, and breaststroke

414
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,220
will be added together
to get a total score.

415
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,900
What's wrong, Sheng?

416
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,580
Butterfly is my weak stroke.

417
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,340
It's all right.

418
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:06,340
I'll train with you.

419
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,980
Way to go, Xu Anjin.

420
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,100
Second place.

421
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,180
What? The captain didn't make the cut?

422
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:40,700
He didn't?

423
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,600
How could that happen? He's usually...

424
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,749
(5th Jiangzhou Yinsha Cup
Swim Meet Selection Notice)

425
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,399
(First Place: Han Yansheng,
Second Place: Xu Anjin)

426
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,580
Nan Yuan,

427
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,060
don't be discouraged just because

428
00:27:52,155 --> 00:27:53,511
you didn't get selected this time.

429
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,540
There'll be other chances.

430
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,020
Focus on recovering.

431
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,020
A hip joint injury is no small matter.

432
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,874
I've already contacted

433
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,755
the best rehabilitation center for you.

434
00:28:03,777 --> 00:28:05,400
Just focus on getting better.

435
00:28:06,028 --> 00:28:07,300
(Nan Yuan got hurt?)

436
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,980
(Was it while training with me?)

437
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,300
Thanks, Coach.

438
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:12,980
But

439
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,740
please don't tell Sheng about my injury.

440
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,100
I want him to focus on the competition.

441
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,980
Sheng...

442
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,740
Sheng.

443
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,420
I'm not going.

444
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,340
I'll go with you to rehab instead.

445
00:28:30,897 --> 00:28:32,420
The list is final.

446
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:33,820
But you got hurt because of me.

447
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,420
That's why you have to compete.

448
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,860
Sheng,

449
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,300
remember our promise?

450
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,044
We said we'd win
the championship together.

451
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,260
Now that I'm out,

452
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,311
you have to bring that trophy back
for both of us.

453
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,780
Make the team proud.

454
00:28:59,645 --> 00:29:01,140
Sheng, you got this!

455
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:03,740
You can do it!

456
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,660
Go!

457
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,940
You did it, Sheng!

458
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,380
You're the champion, Sheng!

459
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,540
You're the champion!

460
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,060
Nan Yuan was my best partner

461
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,140
and my best friend.

462
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,140
I gave him this watch

463
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,940
on his 18th birthday.

464
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,620
I hoped our friendship would be eternal,

465
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,500
like time itself.

466
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,020
Is this a photo of you and Nan Yuan?

467
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,020
Where was it taken?

468
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,500
It was during a trip we took

469
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,580
to a small town in western France.

470
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,020
Behind us is a "Time Post Office."

471
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,420
People write down things
they want to say,

472
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,940
or wishes they hope will come true,

473
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,380
and send them to their future selves
through the post office.

474
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,660
Nan Yuan and I each wrote a postcard
and mailed it to ourselves

475
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,300
a year into the future.

476
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,540
Unfortunately, mine got lost

477
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:08,580
and I never received it.

478
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,340
I wonder

479
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,700
if Nan Yuan ever got his?

480
00:30:15,794 --> 00:30:17,220
I think I've seen

481
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,460
that postcard before.

482
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,700
Is this the one?

483
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,460
(I want to become
a water rescue volunteer.)

484
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,620
Yes, this is it.

485
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,700
Mrs. Nan,

486
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,660
I've made up my mind.

487
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,940
I'm going to take
the water rescue volunteer exam.

488
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,700
I'll fulfill Nan Yuan's dream for him.

489
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:48,897
That's great.

490
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,380
That's wonderful.

491
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,580
Thank you.

492
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,220
This is wonderful news!

493
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,020
Quick, check if we both passed.

494
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,060
I knew we'd make it!

495
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,620
You really want to do this, huh?

496
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,100
I want to help you

497
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,460
make Nan Yuan's wish come true.

498
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:18,860
Plus, I've looked into it.

499
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,740
The annual selection
for water rescue volunteers

500
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,531
is always held
at the Ocean University pool.

501
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,140
That gives us a real advantage.

502
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,540
Swimming's no problem.

503
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,420
For theory,

504
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,500
we just need
to memorize the test outline

505
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,220
and we should be fine.

506
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,860
The challenge is the practical exam.

507
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,620
They mainly test live rescue,
land-based extraction,

508
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,260
and CPR.

509
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,340
And CPR is the most important part.

510
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,220
I learned CPR back in high school.

511
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,340
It's not hard.

512
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,500
But I never learned it.

513
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,500
I'll teach you.

514
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:04,780
First,

515
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:07,180
get the drowning person
into the right position.

516
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,940
Check if they're conscious,

517
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:11,620
and then see if they're breathing.

518
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:14,100
If there's anything
stuck in their mouth,

519
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,300
clear it out

520
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,460
before starting chest compressions.

521
00:32:20,502 --> 00:32:21,980
Maybe

522
00:32:22,828 --> 00:32:25,260
you should be the drowning victim.

523
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Not like that.

524
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,300
One hand open,

525
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,980
and the other crossed on top.

526
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,380
Like this. That's it.

527
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:45,500
Like this, right?

528
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,740
Press down 30 times.

529
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,140
If the person's still unresponsive,

530
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,020
then you need
to give them rescue breaths.
