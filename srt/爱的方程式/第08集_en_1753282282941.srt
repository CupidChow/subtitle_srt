The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I love you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love you

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I love you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,540
эти

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,440
Got it

17
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
Hello

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,600
Can you come and get it?

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,720
My girlfriend?

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
I have something to do later.

21
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll wait for you for 20 minutes.

22
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,680
I have something to do now.

23
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,960
If you don't come,

24
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll take my phone away.

25
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,280
Okay.

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,440
Where is it?

27
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,160
Pizza restaurant in the city center.

28
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
It's on the street.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Hello.

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,040
I want to check a book

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
called Greek mathematician,

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,080
Seppadia.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,360
Can you help me find the location?

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,360
Okay, wait a minute.

35
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
I know this.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,120
Dasheng and his friend

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,720
met through a book.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,360
The name of this book is

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,520
Seppadia.

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,400
The book you want

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,600
is on the second row

43
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
of the second bookshelf on the east side of the first floor.

44
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Okay, thank you.

45
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,240
You're welcome.

46
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,440
Hello.

47
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,080
Hello.

48
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,800
Hello.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,600
Hello.

50
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,320
Hello.

51
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,960
Hello.

52
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,680
Hello.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,440
Hello.

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,400
Hello.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,040
Could it be

56
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,800
Dasheng and his friend were 지금ingers?

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,600
Hi, you're now new your boyfriend?

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,160
It's just a coincidence.

59
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm waiting for someone.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,120
Someone?

61
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
Who?

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,440
You're useless.

63
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,040
Senior,

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,000
do you need a book?

65
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I can help you find it.

66
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,080
No, thanks.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,120
I can find it myself.

68
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,160
I'll go over there and check.

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
I'll go over there and check.

70
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,120
Hello.

71
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,920
Why is my friend's phone with you?

72
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,720
Why isn't it the guy who was with that girl?

73
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,360
What guy?

74
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,360
The tall and handsome guy.

75
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
He looks like a good match.

76
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,000
He must be her boyfriend.

77
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,360
You must be mistaken.

78
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,560
He doesn't have a boyfriend.

79
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,480
It's not wrong.

80
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,440
Just by looking at their eyes,

81
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,960
I can tell that they like each other.

82
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,840
By the way,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,080
since you know that girl,

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
it's hard for you to give her this phone.

85
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,520
No password.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
This guy is quite generous.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,880
Rice, duck, and three stars.

88
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,080
Does he really have a boyfriend?

89
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Who is this duck?

90
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,000
Ye Dan.

91
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,400
You're just like her.

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,280
parents.

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,760
Gentler.

94
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,480
будто.

95
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
Let's continue the training meeting.

96
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,560
Excuse me,

97
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,360
I have a question.

98
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,920
Are you a math guy?

99
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,440
Yes.

100
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:45,840
I recommend

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
you read this book.

102
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,760
One of my friends

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,200
is a math guy.

104
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,840
He told me

105
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,880
the book was particularly helpful

106
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,600
in remembering math.

107
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
are all from here.

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,560
Really?

109
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,320
Of course.

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,920
If you don't look, you'll get a bump.

111
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,320
I must take a look.

112
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
Go back and have a look.

113
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,480
Thank you.

114
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,240
You're welcome.

115
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,720
Bye.

116
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,840
Bye.

117
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,680
Why are you selling your work?

118
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,160
Do you lack money?

119
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,040
No.

120
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,720
I want to save money to buy your new desk.

121
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,880
I'll give you a few sets of them tomorrow.

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,120
If you like them,

123
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,760
take them.

124
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,560
Really?

125
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,080
Yes.

126
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,680
Thank you.

127
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,600
Thank you.

128
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,320
Let's go. I'll send you back.

129
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
Please.

130
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

131
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
Thank you.

132
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,440
I'll go now.

133
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,360
Bye minus one.

134
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,800
Thank you for delivering me back.

135
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,720
Bye.

136
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,240
The...

137
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:22,680
I...

138
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,560
I...

139
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,560
Can I keep my promise now?

140
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:40,640
I hope I can be your friend.

141
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,960
When you need help,

142
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
you can be the first to think of me.

143
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,480
Okay?

144
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
It's okay.

145
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,680
If I can't be your friend,

146
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,640
I'll do my best to help you.

147
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm going upstairs.

148
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,880
Bye.

149
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,880
Okay.

150
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,880
You went on a date just now?

151
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,280
How did you know?

152
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,840
But it's not a date.

153
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,680
I just went to see...

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,840
How long have you known each other?

155
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,840
It's been a long time.

156
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,920
It's just the first time we met.

157
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,640
So you know nothing about this person?

158
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,440
It's not that I know nothing about him.

159
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,560
At least I know he's a good writer.

160
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm not a good writer.

161
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,640
I'm just a good friend.

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm just a good friend.

163
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,800
At least I know he's a good writer.

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,160
He's a good writer?

165
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,160
How many papers have you published?

166
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
How many competitions have you won?

167
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,680
Have you ever attended

168
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
an international math exchange?

169
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,680
He's a good writer.

170
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,040
There are so many good writers.

171
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,280
He can catch a lot of them.

172
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,000
I can share the fun of learning with him.

173
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,640
You won't understand even if I tell you.

174
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,280
You don't know the face of the person.

175
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,440
Be careful of being sold.

176
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,960
You'll be paid for it.

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm afraid you'll lose your mind.

178
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,640
You can't find the north.

179
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Take it.

180
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Don't lose it again.

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,800
Why is my phone in your...

182
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Didn't you say it had nothing to do with me?

183
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Jian Dan.

184
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
I missed you so much.

185
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Me too.

186
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,680
I missed you so much.

187
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
I missed you so much.

188
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
I missed you so much.

189
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,680
I missed you so much.

190
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I missed you so much.

191
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,680
I missed you so much.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I missed you so much.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I missed you so much.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,680
Did you have a good meal?

195
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
Did you take good care of yourself?

196
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Don't worry.

197
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,920
I had a meal on time.

198
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
That's good.

199
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Why didn't you answer my call

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and give me my phone number?

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,880
I'm trying to remind you

202
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
to set the password

203
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,640
in case you lose the information.

204
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Thank you.

205
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,840
Now you can tell me

206
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
the password of your phone.

207
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
The password is simple.

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
Three characters.

209
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,000
Explosion.

210
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,520
What kind of password is this?

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,440
You tricked me.

212
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,080
It's not your birthday.

213
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,840
Nor your school number.

214
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
What is this password?

215
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,960
What are you doing?

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Why is your phone with you?

217
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,880
I want to ask you.

218
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Why did you run to Han Yan Sheng's place?

219
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,520
He gave it to me.

220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Han Yan Sheng.

221
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
You gave it to me.

222
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
I didn't.

223
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
I gave it to you.

224
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
You didn't give it to me.

225
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
Han Yan Sheng.

226
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
I didn't see him tonight.

227
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Did you fly away with your phone?

228
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,560
What?

229
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
Where did he go?

230
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
Didn't you go to see your best friend?

231
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Don't mention it.

232
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,000
He didn't come

233
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
after waiting for an hour.

234
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,520
Maybe he came early.

235
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,160
He just didn't want to show up

236
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
when he saw you.

237
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,160
We're talking about us.

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,160
You're wiping your face.

239
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,480
You're everywhere.

240
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Don't listen to him.

241
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,800
He must have something to do.

242
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
He can't come.

243
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,800
But I left a contact information

244
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
on the paper before I left.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Even if he can't come,

246
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,320
he will contact me

247
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,160
when he sees me.

248
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
That's right.

249
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,440
But what does this have to do

250
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,120
with Han Yan Sheng?

251
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,280
I'm angry when you mention him.

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,800
He gave me back my phone.

253
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,400
But he set me a password.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,960
I haven't solved it yet.

255
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,480
You can just ask him directly.

256
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,440
I must have asked him.

257
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
He didn't tell me.

258
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,840
He just gave me a hint.

259
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,160
A bomb roll.

260
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,440
A bomb roll?

261
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Isn't that when you first came?

262
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,280
A bomb roll.

263
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
It's really fun.

264
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,440
Mom.

265
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,840
Untie it.

266
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,880
How do you solve this?

267
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,400
Do you remember

268
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,720
the time when Han Yan Sheng and I

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,400
got on the Haida Token together?

270
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,360
The swimming pool captain accidentally

271
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,440
made a water bomb roll

272
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
for the girl to make a doll for him.

273
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
So his password must be

274
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,640
the day when I got on the Token with him.

275
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,120
0901.

276
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay.

277
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,600
No.

278
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,520
But that thing

279
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,160
is not a good thing for him.

280
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,200
Why did he set the password

281
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
for that day?

282
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,840
I think he set the password

283
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,120
because I gave him a hint.

284
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
What hint?

285
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,560
Anyway, the password has been solved.

286
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,280
I can go to both houses.

287
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,960
What do you mean both houses?

288
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,640
You're so mysterious.

289
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,120
Double 11.

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,640
There are so many discounts.

291
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,760
You don't want to buy it?

292
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,720
Who would waste their time

293
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,800
sleeping and sleeping

294
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
because of this little money?

295
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,640
That's not a little money.

296
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,440
Didn't you read the news?

297
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Someone bought it for 1000 yuan.

298
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,320
He bought something for 1000 yuan.

299
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,480
But he spent only 70 yuan.

300
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,800
That's amazing.

301
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,640
But when I see

302
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,520
those five-star discounts,

303
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
my head hurts.

304
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,160
I don't want to

305
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,480
lose my face.

306
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,040
I made a form.

307
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,520
I signed the contract.

308
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,840
You can put in the products

309
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,920
you want to buy.

310
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,240
Then you can get

311
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
the most cost-effective way to buy.

312
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
That's amazing.

313
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,200
Come on.

314
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
For example, this one.

315
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
I'll take it off.

316
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,920
Did you meet Goddess?

317
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,520
Yes.

318
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,160
How is it?

319
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,440
Goddess or a man?

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,800
I went to the toilet for something.

321
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,960
I didn't see anyone.

322
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,760
What's the matter?

323
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,920
It's more important than Goddess.

324
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,920
Right.

325
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,840
Xia Nan lost her phone.

326
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,280
Someone picked it up.

327
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,560
I can't get in touch with her.

328
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,520
Let's go.

329
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
It seems that the order is more important than Goddess.

330
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,760
need

331
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,260
Monkey.

332
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,880
Did Jendo record

333
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,920
anything about her boyfriend?

334
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,680
Does Jendo have a boyfriend?

335
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,600
It's all because of the incident.

336
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
I wanted to apologize to her.

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,520
But she took the record away.

338
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,000
Did Goddess take it away?

339
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,400
I asked the library manager.

340
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,960
He said the man who took the record away

341
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,800
was a man.

342
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,800
What?

343
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,360
Goddess is a man?

344
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,760
He shouldn't have taken the record away.

345
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,640
Why are you so sure?

346
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,800
I just think so.

347
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,560
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,120
Attention, attention.

349
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,440
Today, I'm the one who gathered you all here.

350
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,280
Xia Houlin.

351
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,680
We have a special event for the Guanggui Festival.

352
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,920
Now,

353
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,400
take a card.

354
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,840
Write your wish on it.

355
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
It's not Guanggui.

356
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,800
You can't be a girl.

357
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,480
I want to wear a crown and go back.

358
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:02,920
Come on.

359
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,280
I don't remember that.

360
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,840
Hmm?

361
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,360
A simple score.

362
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,080
A simple score.

363
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,680
I didn't shoot it.

364
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,080
Now, we are organizing

365
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,640
a special event for the Guanggui Festival.

366
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,400
Do you want to play it?

367
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,240
How?

368
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Just like this.

369
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Write your wish on the card.

370
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,960
Put it in the box.

371
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,760
Then draw another one to make it come true.

372
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,600
It's good.

373
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,440
It's simple.

374
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,320
What are you eating?

375
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,280
I think it's the most fun.

376
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,560
Let's write one together.

377
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,920
Attention.

378
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,080
You must write

379
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,040
the wish that must come true today.

380
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,440
I'm telling you.

381
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,840
You can't participate in it alone.

382
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,080
Is it?

383
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,360
Then you write it.

384
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,560
It's simple.

385
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,720
What do you want to write?

386
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,560
Nothing.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
Then how about

388
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
you write for me and I write for you?

389
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
Then we exchange and throw it in.

390
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,120
Okay.

391
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,440
An Tong.

392
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,040
Have you drawn anyone's wish?

393
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,440
I haven't.

394
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,560
I want to wait until everyone

395
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,520
has finished writing it

396
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,360
and then draw it together.

397
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,920
What if I draw yours?

398
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,360
Monkey.

399
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
Has Sheng written it?

400
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,120
Not yet.

401
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
I'll go to him later.

402
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,560
Jian Dan, rice noodles.

403
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,120
Come here.

404
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,480
Have you finished?

405
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
Have you finished?

406
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,960
Have you finished?

407
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,360
Come on.

408
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,960
Sit down.

409
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,480
Hurry up.

410
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,360
Come on.

411
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,160
Put the cards in.

412
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,080
Okay.

413
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,360
Then

414
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,800
the most important part.

415
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,280
Draw the cards.

416
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Jian Dan, you're close.

417
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,000
You go first.

418
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,760
Okay.

419
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Monkey.

420
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,360
How much

421
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
does your game skin cost?

422
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,360
You got mine.

423
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,640
You're so lucky.

424
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm a lucky person.

425
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,080
If you got mine,

426
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,920
you'll be lucky for a whole year.

427
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,760
Can I draw one more?

428
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,320
No.

429
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,280
But you can exchange with others.

430
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,200
Unless there's a reason.

431
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:34,560
Jesse,

432
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,280
I'm sad.

433
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,200
Man's play will be phrase to throw cards on you.

434
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,720
Come on.

435
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,360
Jimmy,

436
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,480
please say something for me.

437
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,200
hay.

438
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,560
microwrapping.

439
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,080
Shifting the control.

440
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,960
Hey, you two cheated.

441
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,160
You're so shameless.

442
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,840
Didn't you say we could exchange?

443
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,240
Yes.

444
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm very curious.

445
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,840
Whose is it that you two are taking?

446
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,960
It's a secret.

447
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,640
You don't have to say it.

448
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,440
Monkey,

449
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,320
didn't you say you were going to find Dasheng?

450
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,720
I'll go now.

451
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
The class is about to start.

452
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,000
Help me take a seat first.

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
I'll go to the studio to get something.

454
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Okay.

455
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,840
I'll go first, then.

456
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,760
Bye, everyone.

457
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,200
Old Han.

458
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,560
Old Han.

459
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,320
It's up to you.

460
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,080
Write one.

461
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
I'm not interested.

462
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,360
The people from the Pan Yan Club have participated.

463
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
From the president to the member, none of them is bad.

464
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,160
As the president of the swimming club,

465
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
why can't you not participate in the club activities?

466
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,040
The simple ones have also participated.

467
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,600
Isn't it only single people who can participate?

468
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,200
The simple ones are also single.

469
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,640
You have a boyfriend, but you pretend to be single.

470
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
Hypocrite.

471
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,560
Write one.

472
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,680
Everyone is waiting for you.

473
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,080
I won't write it.

474
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,120
Okay.

475
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,560
You won't write it.

476
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,560
I'll help you write it.

477
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,480
Go ahead.

478
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,200
Then...

479
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,640
Solve this math problem.

480
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,640
Are you serious?

481
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,200
My biggest wish is to solve this problem as soon as possible.

482
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,400
Is there any problem?

483
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,080
Okay.

484
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,680
Just solve it.

485
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,480
Anyway, who can get your wish card?

486
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,840
Who?

487
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,560
Me.

488
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,320
You can draw one.

489
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,920
I don't have time to help others.

490
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

491
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,200
If you don't draw it today,

492
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
I'll just stay here and stay.

493
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,960
Open it and see who got it.

494
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,120
Who did you draw?

495
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,120
Me?

496
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
I haven't drawn it yet.

497
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,560
Then I'll draw one.

498
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
This is Ling Ling.

499
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,680
This is Ling Ling.

500
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,000
As long as it's not Ou Han, anyone can do it.

501
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,400
It's your turn.

502
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:13,880
No.

503
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,320
I can't.

504
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,280
No.

505
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
You are the organizer of the event.

506
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,760
You are cheating.

507
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,680
You are so ungrateful.

508
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,400
You should go back to solve the problem

509
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,200
and have a good time on your New Year's Eve.

510
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,720
Go ahead.

511
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:26,920
Go.

512
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,680
Old Han.

513
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,080
You pervert.

514
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,760
No one can get my wish card

515
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,040
and solve the math problem.

516
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,360
You deserve it.

517
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,160
You don't sound like a single dog.

518
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,320
Come and give my wish card back to me.

519
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,360
P舉我

520
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,240
Who hasn't drawn yet?

521
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,400
Let's begin.

522
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,240
How is it?

523
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
Did Dai Sheng write it down?

524
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
Yes.

525
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:56,920
Well...

526
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,560
En Tou,

527
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,920
do you really want my card?

528
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I'll give it to you.

529
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,920
Can I?

530
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,200
Of course.

531
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Congratulations.

532
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,240
Happy break-up.

533
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,440
No.

534
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,800
Don't, En Tou.

535
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,120
You haven't drawn yet.

536
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,600
Han,

537
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,840
do you know how much you've made me angry?

538
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,680
Qin Tai.

539
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Qin Tai.

540
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,040
Qin Tai,

541
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,880
let's change to a card.

542
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,080
Why?

543
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,120
The game skin is too expensive.

544
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,360
It's embarrassing to let you buy it.

545
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,600
Really?

546
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,840
Yes.

547
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,120
This is the experience of a math teacher.

548
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,680
Look.

549
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,480
You're a master.

550
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,520
You're a master.

551
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,440
I don't want to change.

552
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,640
Qin Tai.

553
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,480
Listen.

554
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,640
The game skin is too expensive.

555
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,640
Are you sure you don't want to change?

556
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,560
I'll make a wish for my friend.

557
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,600
I'll give it to you.

558
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,240
Qin Tai.

559
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,000
Just help me.

560
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,680
As the founder of the activity,

561
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,760
I'm not good at it.

562
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,040
I didn't help anyone make a wish.

563
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
How can I make it come true?

564
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,400
What about your wish?

565
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,480
Simple.

566
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,560
I've made it.

567
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,080
Thank you.

568
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,080
Yes.

569
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:51,880
Da Sheng.

570
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:52,960
Wait for me.

571
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,920
Whose wish did you make?

572
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,360
A girl I know.

573
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
A girl you know?

574
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,680
I guess

575
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,280
you can make it with one hand.

576
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,040
Am I that bad?

577
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,040
I'm not saying you're bad.

578
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,640
Your interest in math

579
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,600
is far more than that of a girl.

580
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,560
You can even make a wish

581
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,520
to solve a math problem.

582
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,600
I'm not saying you're bad.

583
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,520
Maths.

584
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,800
Only we

585
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,080
know you.

586
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,480
Who can stand you?

587
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,320
Maths is more interesting

588
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
than girls.

589
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
No matter how hard the math problem is,

590
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,320
there's always a right answer.

591
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,240
Girls

592
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,560
are not good at math.

593
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,800
Who are you talking about?

594
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,280
Nobody.

595
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,640
Wei Leng Tong.

596
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,440
Do you want someone

597
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,640
to help you make your wish come true?

598
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,240
Of course.

599
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,560
It's so troublesome.

600
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,640
Lin Da,

601
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
what wish did you make for me?

602
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,640
It's what you want.

603
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,560
What about you?

604
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,000
What else did you write?

605
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,120
It's what you want too.

606
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,080
Where are you going later?

607
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,840
The library.

608
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,680
But

609
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,240
you don't have to go with me.

610
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,320
Are you waiting for me?

611
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,200
I've made your wish come true.

612
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,600
Oh my god.

613
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
He actually made my wish come true.

614
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,680
I'm so happy.

615
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm so happy.

616
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,400
I'm so happy.

617
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,360
He actually made my wish come true.

618
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,560
But

619
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,760
what is my wish?

620
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,640
Forget it.

621
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,840
It's already come true.

622
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,640
Let's go.

623
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
Let's make your wish come true.

624
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,160
win

625
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,480
I suddenly want to die

626
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,480
The memory is too temporary

627
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,200
swells and so widenes

628
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Where should I start

629
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
To touch the heart

630
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Some look, some words

631
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I haven't missed it yet

632
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,200
My eyes are already red

633
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Like a poem

634
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Those young days

635
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,200
There is a meaning to the ordinary

636
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,200
In the gap of time

637
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Secretly

638
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Those broken pasts

639
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,200
The vague name is still good

640
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,200
We used to have each other

641
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Those young days

642
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
The heart is not needed to be lost

643
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,200
But one day the promise becomes a luxury

644
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Those broken pasts

645
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Love never changes

646
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Life is colored with paint

647
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,200
The heart is not needed to be lost

648
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,200
But one day the promise becomes a luxury
