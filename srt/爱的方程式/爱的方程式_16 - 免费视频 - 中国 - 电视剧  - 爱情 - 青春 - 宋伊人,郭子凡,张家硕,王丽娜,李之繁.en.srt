Fen, is that you?

15
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,920
Can you grab me a towel?

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurry up, Fen!

17
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:01,533
It's right there on the back
of the chair.

18
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,160
Come on, what's taking you so long?

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
If you don't give it to me now,
I'll be completely dried out!

20
00:02:28,817 --> 00:02:29,920
Thanks, Fen.

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,240
I wonder how Grandma is.

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,040
I've been a little worried about her.

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Before I left, she told me

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
to treat Han Yansheng better.

25
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,440
But how?

26
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,040
He already has everything.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Who says I have everything?

28
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:23,840
(Student Council Head:
Club evaluations will begin in a week.)

29
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,644
(All club presidents,
please be prepared.)

30
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Club evaluations?

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Han Yansheng!

32
00:03:43,311 --> 00:03:44,480
I was just about to ask you

33
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,960
about the club evaluation.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,600
The club evaluation rank

35
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,920
is based on the number
of awards they've won

36
00:03:52,088 --> 00:03:53,920
and the overall strength
of their members.

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
Higher-ranked clubs get more funding.

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,240
Lower-ranked ones get nothing.

39
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,644
If the club remains at the bottom
for too long,

40
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:02,920
it will be disbanded.

41
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,480
So what counts as a low-ranked club?

42
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,640
Newly founded, zero awards,
and average members.

43
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:14,240
Newly founded, zero awards,

44
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,000
and average members?

45
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,400
That's describing
the Rock Climbing Club.

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,280
President, why the long face?

47
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,320
Evaluation is coming up soon.

48
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,188
We don't have time to win anything,

49
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,171
and our members

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
are just average.

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,440
I doubt we'll get any funding

52
00:04:56,468 --> 00:04:58,280
this semester.

53
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,533
If only a rock climbing genius

54
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,360
could drop out of the sky right now.

55
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,111
Interesting notion.

56
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
But where do we find one?

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
Your enrollment is all good now.

58
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,640
Oh, joining a club can earn
you extra credit.

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
Think about it.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,920
Okay, Sir.

61
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,880
Where are you running off to?

62
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,040
Zhishan, what are you doing here?

63
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:47,120
Did I do something wrong?

64
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,760
I'll fix it! Just please spare me.

65
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:51,680
Who said I am here to see you?
Don't flatter yourself.

66
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,040
Wait, you are not?

67
00:05:56,288 --> 00:05:57,320
Then why are you here?

68
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm looking for the Rock Climbing Club.

69
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,120
Is it here?

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh, right! You know how to climb.

71
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,400
Are you thinking about joining?

72
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I'll see. I just want to take a look.

73
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,244
The Rock Climbing Club
is on the second floor.

74
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,760
Aren't you coming with me?

75
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,480
I have errands to run.
I'll leave you to it.

76
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:33,840
You can do this.

77
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,640
Stay safe!

78
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,120
Make sure your ropes are secure.

79
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,560
Are you okay?

80
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:51,000
Where is your club president?

81
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:54,520
Jiang Zhishan?

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,720
Ugh, you again?

83
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,120
I need to talk to your president.

84
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:02,217
I am the president.

85
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
Here's my résumé.

86
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,533
I want to join the Rock Climbing Club.

87
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,360
(Awards and Recognition)
First place, Youth Division,

88
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,280
International Climbing Competition.

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,080
U.S. Youth Climbing Championships,

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,440
Female Category, first place.

91
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,520
National Climbing Tournament,

92
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,080
Female Category, gold medal.

93
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,080
A gold medal?

94
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,840
A genius just dropped from the sky!

95
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,400
Your résumé is insane.

96
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,800
Welcome to the club!

97
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,360
Unreal!

98
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,960
We're saved!

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,680
This wall is ancient.

100
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,600
The ropes aren't secure.

101
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,880
The gears are falling apart.

102
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,440
This club

103
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,800
is seriously amateur.

104
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,280
- President.
- President.

105
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,182
Why did she leave?

106
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
If she joins,

107
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,466
our club might actually survive
the evaluation.

108
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:13,840
She's right, President.

109
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,760
I didn't know Han Yansheng's aunt

110
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,960
was such a skilled climber.

111
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,720
Since she went up to the club,

112
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,520
she must be considering it.

113
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,200
Why didn't you try harder
to recruit her?

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,500
I wanted to!

115
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
But she left too quickly,

116
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
so I didn't even know where to look.

117
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
You again?

118
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,400
Wait, you two know each other?

119
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,120
She's Han Yansheng's aunt.

120
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
What a coincidence.

121
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
More like bad luck.

122
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:56,720
Jiang Zhishan,

123
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,222
I'm asking you to reconsider joining
our Rock Climbing Club.

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,200
If you join us,

125
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:03,480
we'll have a better chance

126
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,440
at being ranked higher,

127
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,511
allowing us to finally secure
the funding we need.

128
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:07,977
All those problems you pointed out

129
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:08,888
can be fixed then.

130
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,200
Why should I help you?

131
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,320
You applied

132
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,440
because you love climbing.

133
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,840
We love climbing too.

134
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,520
So please, just give us a chance.

135
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:26,840
Fine.

136
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,400
Three days from now,
we'll have a match.

137
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:31,880
If you beat me,

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,400
I'll join your club.

139
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:40,200
Deal. It's a promise.

140
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,160
Entong...

141
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,622
Can you pass this letter

142
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,080
to Su Lishi?

143
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:57,800
No problem. Leave it to me.

144
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,320
Thank you, Entong. You're the best.

145
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,933
I... uh...

146
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,800
I'll be heading off now.

147
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Bye-bye.

148
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,600
You have never changed.

149
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,044
You're still as fake as ever.

150
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,600
Zhishan?

151
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,520
Long time no see.

152
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,022
Zhishan, you're back?
Do you want something to drink?

153
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:22,911
Cappuccino, thanks.

154
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,520
Shi,

155
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:36,240
someone left you a love letter.

156
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
Shi, you're really popular.

157
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,400
Are you jealous?

158
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,640
Me? Why would I be jealous?

159
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,960
No one sends me love letters,
and I enjoy the peace.

160
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,549
But speaking of which,

161
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,860
I heard you're challenging Jian Dan
to a rock climbing match?

162
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:53,800
Are you serious?

163
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,560
A pro versus an amateur?

164
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
That's bullying.

165
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,960
What? Are you here to defend her?

166
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:01,680
Of course not.

167
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,920
I just don't like how unfair it is.

168
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,320
Jian Dan has worked really hard

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,520
to start the climbing club.

170
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,680
If they place last
in this evaluation again,

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,520
the club might get shut down for good.

172
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,600
That's her problem.

173
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,080
It has nothing to do with me.

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,360
Zhishan has always been athletic
since we were kids.

175
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,080
It doesn't have
to be the climbing club, right?

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,822
The swimming club's pretty great too.

177
00:11:21,844 --> 00:11:24,320
The "girl" at the swimming club
is terrible.

178
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,288
Zhishan, you forgot your coffee.

179
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,200
What girl is she talking about?

180
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,200
Jeez, what are you trying to prove?

181
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:20,840
She has been climbing for years.

182
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,222
You just started a few months ago.

183
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,360
This is totally a pro crushing

184
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,622
an amateur.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,840
If you're scared and think you'll lose,

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,400
just admit defeat.

187
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
I'm not backing down.

188
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,577
Why aren't you heading over?

189
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:05,960
I wanted to check out the competition

190
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,040
to know her strength.

191
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,133
But it turns out,
there's not much to see.

192
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm winning for sure.

193
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,120
Why are you so set on beating Jian Dan?

194
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
Is it because she's staying
at your place?

195
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,840
That's on me.

196
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:20,680
I let her move in

197
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,200
without asking you.

198
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,440
But she had no idea.

199
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,400
If you're doing this

200
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,800
just to get back at her,

201
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,840
that's really unfair.

202
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
Let's not mix things up.

203
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
I joined the club

204
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,560
for the extra credit.

205
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,080
But I don't want to waste time

206
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,840
on an unprofessional club.

207
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,080
The climbing club
is currently lacking a lot.

208
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,040
But I believe

209
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,360
under Jian Dan's lead,

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,320
it could become

211
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,480
something really great.

212
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,120
You believe in her that much?

213
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,760
You know me.

214
00:13:54,228 --> 00:13:55,360
I have always been objective.

215
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,000
If she weren't capable,

216
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,320
I would never have lent her the venue.

217
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,320
Since the club started,

218
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,640
she has worked really hard.

219
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,160
So yes,

220
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,760
I believe in her.

221
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
I hope you'll give her a chance too.

222
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,600
If she can beat me,

223
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
I'll join the climbing club.

224
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,240
Here.

225
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,280
Thanks.

226
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,280
What are you doing here?

227
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,560
Come on.

228
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,400
Let's get something to eat.

229
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm not done training.

230
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,760
Just come already.

231
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,280
Didn't you say

232
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,120
you would treat me better?

233
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
When did I ever say that?

234
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,560
You've got ten minutes.

235
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,600
Hurry up and change.

236
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:04,120
I'll wait for you downstairs.

237
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
Didn't you say we're eating
at the cafeteria?

238
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,560
Why are we here?

239
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,111
I ordered delivery. It'll be here soon.

240
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,311
Have some fruit first.

241
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:26,840
Slow down.

242
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,760
Eat slowly and take a break.

243
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,720
You need to rest
so you'll have energy to train.

244
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,880
So you didn't bring me here to eat.

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,720
You just wanted me to rest?

246
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,088
It's not like
you're going to win anyway.

247
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,720
No need to push yourself so hard.

248
00:15:51,205 --> 00:15:52,720
What makes you so sure I won't win?

249
00:15:53,111 --> 00:15:53,880
Just wait and see.

250
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm going to get Jiang Zhishan
to join the climbing club.

251
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,480
Han received

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,160
a last-minute notice
from the student council.

253
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,560
It's a meeting
about the club evaluations.

254
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,440
But he told me to livestream
the match for him.

255
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,840
So you better do your best.

256
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,360
It's not like I asked him to.

257
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,760
Jian Dan.

258
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:15,480
How are you feeling?

259
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,400
I believe in you. You've got this.

260
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,520
Good luck, President!

261
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:25,640
- You got this!
- Do your best!

262
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,080
I hope you don't fall too far behind.

263
00:17:29,822 --> 00:17:31,160
We still don't know who will win.

264
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:31,960
That's right.

265
00:17:32,644 --> 00:17:33,720
Jian Dan, you can do this!

266
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,491
- Go! Go! Go!
- Jian Dan, you got this!

267
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:38,550
You can do this!

268
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,937
- Yeah! You can do this!
- You got this! You got this!

269
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,680
On your marks!

270
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,480
Ready!

271
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,440
Go!

272
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:29,000
- Go! Go! Go!
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

273
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Wow, a pro sure is on another level.

274
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,120
Jian Dan is not likely to win this.

275
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,160
Don't jinx this!

276
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,200
- Jian Dan, go!
- You can do this, Jian Dan!

277
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,897
Go! Go! Go!

278
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:03,217
You can do this!

279
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:07,691
You got this!

280
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:22,902
Go, Jian Dan! Go!

281
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,960
(Monkey: Han,)

282
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,280
(the match has started.)

283
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,760
(Jian Dan is falling behind.)

284
00:19:34,948 --> 00:19:39,780
- Go! Go! Go!
- Go! You can do this!

285
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,851
She's catching up!
Jian Dan is catching up!

286
00:19:46,911 --> 00:19:48,177
She's about to turn the tables!

287
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:50,000
- Go, Jian Dan!
- Go for it!

288
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,360
(She's almost caught up.)

289
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,520
Jian Dan, watch out!

290
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,451
You can do it!

291
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:10,520
Her foot was injured a few days ago.

292
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,960
Can she really handle this?

293
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,777
Jian Dan, be careful!

294
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,040
(Monkey: Jian Dan is injured.)

295
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,548
- Go! Go! Go!
- You can do this!

296
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,000
You can do this!

297
00:20:30,057 --> 00:20:31,554
Yeah! Go! Go! Go!

298
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,570
Foot hold on the right, President!

299
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,662
- Go!
- Go!

300
00:20:40,165 --> 00:20:42,668
- Go!
- Go!

301
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,022
Hang in there!

302
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:46,251
- You've got this, President!
- You can do it!

303
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:48,502
Go! President, go!

304
00:20:52,888 --> 00:20:54,355
- You can do this!
- Go! Go! Go!

305
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,600
It's a tie!

306
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,120
Jian Dan, you rock!

307
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,040
Since no one won,

308
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,485
that means the President wins!

309
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Great job, Jian Dan!

310
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,040
Are you okay?

311
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:40,800
I knew you could do it.

312
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
I didn't beat you, so I lost.

313
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:57,730
I'll join the Rock Climbing Club.

314
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,800
That's great.

315
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,320
With you on board,

316
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,955
our club's rating will definitely go up.

317
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,960
I hope you'll be more than a member.

318
00:22:06,937 --> 00:22:08,120
We need you as our coach

319
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,240
to teach us your climbing skills

320
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,800
and make us stronger.

321
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,480
That's such a cliché way to ask.

322
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,040
Training starts at 8 AM sharp!

323
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,280
I'm very strict!

324
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,600
Awesome!

325
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:42,280
- Jian Dan! Jian Dan! Jian Dan!
- Jian Dan! Jian Dan! Jian Dan!

326
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,520
You were amazing!

327
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,760
Jian Dan, have a drink.

328
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
How's your foot?

329
00:23:01,466 --> 00:23:03,400
Nothing serious.
I'll be fine with some ointment.

330
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,155
I'm taking you to the infirmary.

331
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
Put me down.

332
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,240
I can walk on my own.

333
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,240
I'm partly responsible
for her targeting you.

334
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't overthink it.

335
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,640
That was pretty romantic though.

336
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,520
Don't you think
they make a great couple?

337
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,840
Han really knows what he's doing.

338
00:23:35,066 --> 00:23:37,080
Jian Dan and Zhishan
had a climbing match today.

339
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,240
Why didn't you go and watch?

340
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:41,760
I was going to.

341
00:23:42,017 --> 00:23:43,040
However...

342
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
Jian Dan and Zhishan
are both my friends.

343
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,160
If I went, who would I cheer for?

344
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,160
So I figured I'd skip it.

345
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,480
Thank you.

346
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,360
Jian Dan and Zhishan actually tied.

347
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
That's the best outcome.

348
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,320
Really?

349
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,760
Let me see.

350
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,620
(Monkey: Good news!
Jian Dan and Jiang Zhishan tied.)

351
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:54,760
Do you even know how to apply this?

352
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,840
I'll just do it myself.

353
00:24:58,266 --> 00:25:00,133
Why are you so grumpy
when I'm helping you?

354
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:01,960
Have you forgotten
what Grandma told you?

355
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:05,400
What did she say exactly?

356
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,840
Didn't she tell you

357
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,560
to treat me nicer?

358
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,040
How did you know that?

359
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,688
I didn't tell anyone about that.

360
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,080
So...

361
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,040
You were the one who handed me

362
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,440
that towel?

363
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,360
You snuck into the girls' dorm?

364
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
I was helping my aunt move.

365
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:39,066
The dorm lady said it was fine.

366
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,520
Sit still.

367
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,240
Come on, run!

368
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,800
Don't fall behind!

369
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,000
Endurance training boosts stamina!

370
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,000
Move it!

371
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,280
This is too much. I'm done.

372
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,360
You barely ran a few laps,
and you're tired?

373
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,200
How are you supposed

374
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,560
to compete at this state?

375
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,688
How can you be a pro climber
with fitness like this?

376
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:22,760
Oh, I'm beat. I can't.

377
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm out too.

378
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,680
Let's wrap up for today.

379
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,760
Is the training done already?

380
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,942
President, you're just in time.

381
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:42,560
The Vice President's training plan

382
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,520
is totally unrealistic.

383
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,240
If we keep training like this,

384
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,160
I'm quitting.

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,851
Yeah, same here.

386
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:48,800
No one can take this.

387
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,200
- Yeah.
- It's too much.

388
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,000
Everyone, calm down.

389
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,688
One at a time.

390
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,800
The VP's training intensity
is just too much.

391
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,680
Normal people can't keep up.

392
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
President, listen.

393
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,320
We've been training

394
00:27:02,382 --> 00:27:03,960
for six hours straight today.

395
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,320
That's just too much.

396
00:27:05,485 --> 00:27:07,880
Yeah, we're exhausted.

397
00:27:07,902 --> 00:27:09,480
I understand where you're coming from.

398
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:13,200
But our VP has won tons
of climbing awards.

399
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,000
We've all seen how skilled she is.

400
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,520
So her training direction isn't wrong.

401
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,200
I'll also bring up your concerns

402
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,640
with her.

403
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
She might've overlooked

404
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,040
the differences in fitness levels.

405
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,280
We'll be making adjustments
to the training intensity.

406
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,080
But I also hope

407
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,720
you can try to understand her
and communicate with her more.

408
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,120
I believe

409
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,688
she wants the same thing we all do.

410
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,880
To improve our climbing club.

411
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,088
- Got it, President.
- Got it, President.

412
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
Did they really quit training?

413
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,040
Happy birthday to you!

414
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,560
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

415
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,160
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

416
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,760
- Happy birthday to you!
- Happy birthday to you!

417
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,760
Happy birthday, VP!

418
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,533
- Happy birthday, Vice President!
- Happy birthday, Vice President!

419
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,880
How did you know today's my birthday?

420
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,680
It was on your resume,

421
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,720
so I remembered.

422
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,920
Come on, make a wish.

423
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,720
That's so cheesy.

424
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,554
Vice President, this is my gift for you.

425
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,488
This one is from me.

426
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:50,920
VP,

427
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,160
this is from me.

428
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
VP, I got you this.

429
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,960
This is from me.

430
00:28:56,297 --> 00:28:57,520
I bought you this.

431
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,160
VP, this is from me.

432
00:28:59,348 --> 00:29:00,600
Happy birthday, VP.

433
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:03,160
Thank you.

434
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,680
Han!

435
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,200
Jiang Zhishan's birthday is today.

436
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:31,720
Did you get her something?

437
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,960
What was that?

438
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:34,960
No, it's not hers.

439
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:40,866
I have never seen anyone

440
00:29:40,911 --> 00:29:42,160
who writes a birthday gift list

441
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,560
and forces people

442
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,640
to buy based on that list.

443
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,760
You have no idea

444
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:47,760
how hard it is to book

445
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,200
that viral restaurant.

446
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,440
It took me a lot of effort

447
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:51,760
to get a spot.

448
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:01,680
What's going on upstairs?

449
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's check it out.

450
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Han, today's your lucky day!

451
00:30:14,274 --> 00:30:15,062
Monkey!

452
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:16,888
That's for not wishing me
a happy birthday!

453
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:17,844
Have some cake!

454
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,360
Jiang Zhishan!

455
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,760
Did the noise bother you?

456
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,000
What do you think?

457
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,360
Sorry about that.

458
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,485
Today is Zhishan's birthday.

459
00:30:31,555 --> 00:30:33,400
So we just wanted
to celebrate it with her.

460
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:34,600
Let me wipe it for you.

461
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,320
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

462
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,600
Got in your eye.

463
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,040
Happy birthday to me!

464
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,080
- Happy birthday!
- Come on!

465
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,640
Jian Dan, come on!
That's barely a sip.

466
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:01,880
Give me some face here.

467
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,914
I can't hold my liquor.

468
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,360
I'll only make a fool of myself.

469
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,760
Excuse me? It's my birthday!

470
00:31:08,942 --> 00:31:10,091
Everyone drinks!

471
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,080
That's enough!

472
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:11,880
That's way too much!

473
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,400
Let's have fun!

474
00:31:15,434 --> 00:31:17,514
The birthday girl will pour you
your drinks!

475
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:18,868
This is red wine, birthday girl.

476
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,177
- Okay, that's enough.
- You must finish your drinks!

477
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,120
- Okay, that's enough.
- Let's drink!

478
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,880
Come on.

479
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,560
A toast!

480
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,080
Cheers!

481
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,080
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

482
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,160
You better drink this.

483
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,360
- Drink it!
- Okay, okay.

484
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,480
Stop messing around.

485
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,200
Didn't you say
you can't hold your drinks?

486
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,320
I meant liquor.

487
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,920
I can still manage if it's red wine.

488
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:30,320
Finish this drink.

489
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,125
Listen to me, okay?

490
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:34,160
Okay, I'll listen.

491
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,440
Boss! Another bottle!

492
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,480
- No, no! That's enough!
- Boss!

493
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:41,720
Ignore her. She had too much.

494
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,977
I'm not drunk!

495
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,360
I need to go deal

496
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,400
with something.

497
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,160
Stay still.

498
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,200
Watch her.

499
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,120
I'll check on him.

500
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,160
- Boss!
- Be careful!

501
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,440
Boss, another bottle of wine!

502
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,080
You,

503
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,280
go left.

504
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,280
You,

505
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,160
go straight.

506
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,240
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

507
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,920
Sorry! Sorry about this!

508
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,169
I'll take him away right now!

509
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,720
Pedestrians, please use the crosswalk.

510
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,960
Don't block traffic.

511
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,680
You,

512
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,720
go straight.

513
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,440
There's a drunk driver over there!

514
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,640
Where?

515
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:29,800
Yes, Sir.

516
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,200
So you're the drunk driver?

517
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,688
Do you know what it feels like...

518
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,560
to cuddle a cat?
