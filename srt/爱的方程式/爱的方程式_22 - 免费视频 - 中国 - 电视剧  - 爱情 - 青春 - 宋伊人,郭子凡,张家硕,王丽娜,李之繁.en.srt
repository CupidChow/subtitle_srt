14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,400
Hello?

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,560
Where are you, Jiang Zhishan?

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,400
Hello?

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
I'm right behind you.

18
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,240
Jiang Zhishan.

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,080
Will you stay?

20
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,400
No way.

21
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,570
I've agreed to join
the rock climbing competition,

22
00:02:15,622 --> 00:02:16,933
so I can't go back on my word.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,080
Climbing competition?

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,720
That's right.

25
00:02:20,755 --> 00:02:23,080
I got invited to an international
rock climbing competition.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm going abroad to take part in it.

27
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Also,

28
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,000
that Jason you saw

29
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,280
is the coach I hired.

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,760
What's that in your hand?

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, it's nothing.

32
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:43,840
Seriously, it's nothing.

33
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
When did you take these?

34
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Well...

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,480
Sorry!

36
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:11,822
Can you take a few photos for me?

37
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,733
The sooner, the better.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Please...

39
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm ready. Let's do it.

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,200
Here we go.

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,520
I'll strike a few poses first.

42
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:32,644
Is that good enough?

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,440
Say something!

44
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,400
That's good enough.

45
00:03:38,142 --> 00:03:39,440
Come on, let's do it. Quick.

46
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:57,044
You're in charge
of these playing cards now.

47
00:03:57,444 --> 00:03:59,466
You've been in charge of me
for a while now anyway.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,628
How about this?

49
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,955
I'll entrust both the cards...

50
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,640
and myself to you.

51
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
You said it.

52
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,520
No backing out.

53
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,600
I won't.

54
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,280
Ever since Jiang left,

55
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:50,520
the dorm has felt so empty.

56
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:52,440
It's so boring now.

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,240
Jian Dan,

58
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:57,760
what are you watching?

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,080
"Good Will Hunting."

60
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a film about psychology.

61
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,400
You study in class

62
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:07,320
and after class.

63
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,200
Now you're even studying it before bed?

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,320
Give yourself a break.

65
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,360
The main character in this movie

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,040
has a lot in common with Han Yansheng.

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
I want to recommend it to him.

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,280
Perhaps it'll help him

69
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
rebuild his confidence.

70
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
Have faith in yourself. You can do it.

71
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm off.

72
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,640
Anything else?

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,160
Come watch it with me.

74
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
Then tell me what you think.

75
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,320
Alright, then.

76
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,844
It's just the two of us.
Let's just use the speaker.

77
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:49,933
(Research Progress on Exercise Therapy
for College Students with Depression)

78
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,210
Xiahou Ling, are you an idiot?

79
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm bleeding out over here,
and you're not even helping!

80
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,520
Coming, coming!

81
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,155
(Jian Dan: Han Yansheng.)

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,240
(I've found you this really good movie.)

83
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,355
(It suits you well.)

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,755
(Don't forget to watch it.)

85
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,760
Han. Entong's coming back tomorrow.

86
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,955
I'm going to pick her up.

87
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Got it.

88
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:53,511
Did you watch the movie
I recommended last night?

89
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,440
I was a bit tired last night.

90
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,840
I went to bed early.

91
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,800
I haven't had the chance to see it yet.

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,560
That's a really good movie.

93
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
You have to watch it.

94
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,640
Monkey, I got you a gift.

95
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,280
Thank you, Entong.

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,400
You'll definitely use it.

97
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:20,520
Really? Let me see.

98
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,600
How thoughtful of you!

99
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,844
- Of course!
- Entong is here?

100
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
She just got back today.
Shi went to pick her up.

101
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,080
I brought gifts for you all.

102
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,880
Just regular souvenirs.

103
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,360
I got one for everyone.

104
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Here, take it.

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,960
Thanks, Entong.

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,760
Shi.

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,880
This is for you.

108
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:00,405
I know you like coffee mugs.

109
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,866
So I got this especially for you.

110
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,840
You're going to love it.

111
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,000
If it's from you, I love it.

112
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,466
What's going on with you two?

113
00:08:08,794 --> 00:08:10,320
Are you dating behind my back?

114
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,533
Don't talk nonsense.

115
00:08:14,177 --> 00:08:15,666
I'm heading to the Rock Climbing Club.

116
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

117
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,880
I recommended the movie
named "Good Will Hunting"

118
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,120
to Han Yansheng.

119
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,920
The main character in it

120
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,222
also suffers from PTSD.

121
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:37,800
He was abandoned as a child

122
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,040
and went through a lot.

123
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
That's why he became arrogant
yet insecure deep down.

124
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
He thought his girlfriend
didn't love him.

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,800
That she wanted to leave him

126
00:08:47,844 --> 00:08:48,933
and break up with him.

127
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,691
In the end, a college professor

128
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,244
helped heal him.

129
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
Then he got back with his girlfriend

130
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,960
and started a new chapter in life.

131
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,880
I wanted to use this movie

132
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,920
to encourage Han Yansheng.

133
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,920
But he didn't even watch it.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,360
And he's been really down.

135
00:09:13,674 --> 00:09:16,880
Maybe I shouldn't push him anymore?

136
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Maybe I should just give up
trying to help him?

137
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:26,160
Jian Dan.

138
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,120
Have you seen Sheng?

139
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,490
I just went to the Swimming Club
to find him,

140
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,320
but he wasn't there.

141
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you know where he went?

142
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:36,920
I haven't seen him.

143
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,440
(Resignation Letter)
I was actually going to give him this.

144
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,088
I've been thinking it over
for a long time.

145
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:51,600
I've decided to step down
as Swimming Club's manager.

146
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,542
From now on, I want to spend more time

147
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,000
focusing on my major.

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,400
Jian Dan.

149
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:01,920
I've done a lot of wrong things
in the past,

150
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,108
causing quite a few misunderstandings

151
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,680
between you and Sheng.

152
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:07,754
So I think it's only right

153
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,320
to offer you a proper apology.

154
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:17,040
I hope you can forgive me.

156
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,920
Of course, it's okay if you don't.

157
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:24,760
Right now, the only thing I hope for

158
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,560
is that you'll help Sheng

159
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
move on from what happened
with Nan Yuan.

160
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,680
That way, I'll feel

161
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,108
a little less guilty.

162
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,560
Don't worry.

163
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,560
I will.

164
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:42,840
Well, I'll go look for him elsewhere.

165
00:10:44,982 --> 00:10:45,800
Bye.

166
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,040
Maybe...

167
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,600
I really should just let it go.

168
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,600
Whether he swims or not,

169
00:11:05,051 --> 00:11:05,960
I don't mind.

170
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,280
As long as he's happy,

171
00:11:09,355 --> 00:11:10,866
he can do whatever he wants.

172
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
Ladies, I'm back!

173
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,360
I missed you so much!

174
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,280
I brought each of you a gift.

175
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,640
Jian Dan, this one is yours.

176
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,000
Princess Mi Fen,

177
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,680
this is yours.

178
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Yue Tangtang,

179
00:11:46,782 --> 00:11:47,440
this is for you.

180
00:11:47,645 --> 00:11:48,480
I got one too?

181
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,000
Thanks.

182
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,680
So? Do you like it?

183
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,880
I love it!

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm going to put it on display.

185
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Oh, right, Jian Dan,

186
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,937
when Monkey picked me up
from the airport,

187
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:04,040
he said Gu Entong's back.

188
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,259
You'd better keep an eye on her.

189
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,660
Don't let her stir up trouble again.

190
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,360
I noticed she's not quite the same

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,640
as before.

192
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:11,960
Old habits

193
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:12,720
die hard.

194
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,960
You'd better be careful.

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,760
By the way,

196
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,844
how's Sheng doing lately?

197
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,160
Not so great.

198
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,577
He seems to be resisting treatment.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,800
It's okay.

200
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,440
Take it slow.

201
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
He'll get better.

202
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,280
I'll unpack my luggage now.

203
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:43,640
Han?

204
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:46,240
He went to the music room.

205
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:47,840
Hold on.

206
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,440
What's in your hand?

207
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
Breakfast, huh?

208
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,200
Oh, I forgot to tell you

209
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,760
about this habit of Han's.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,640
He likes training on an empty stomach.

211
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,160
So I guess you should just...

212
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,760
Entong went
to a music exchange recently.

213
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,251
She met a master who specializes

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,377
in music therapy.

215
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,320
This piece was handpicked just for you.

216
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,280
Shi told me you've been
having trouble sleeping.

217
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,840
We're not sure if this piece

218
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,400
will help at all.

219
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,680
It's definitely calming and soothing,

220
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,560
but my situation's a bit different.

221
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,022
Thus, it doesn't help much.

222
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,000
Anyway, thank you all.

223
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,480
Maybe my playing isn't good enough.

224
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,440
That master has a solo concert soon.

225
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,040
How about we attend it?

226
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,533
Just take it as a change of scene.

227
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,680
Let's invite Jian Dan too.

228
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,088
The four of us
can attend it together, okay?

229
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,200
Alright, let's begin.

230
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,280
Jian Dan, our climbing wall

231
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,440
is too old.

232
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:56,066
Let's get the members
to help refurbish it next week.

233
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,666
What's on your mind?

234
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,666
Waiting for a call from Han Yansheng?

235
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,080
No...

236
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
You're still denying it.

237
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,820
You've been staring
at your phone all day

238
00:15:14,822 --> 00:15:15,840
while we trained.

239
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,120
Why? Did you two fight?

240
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,520
No.

241
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,320
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

242
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:26,680
If there's a misunderstanding,
just ask him.

243
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,440
Don't keep guessing on your own.

244
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,240
I'll call him for you.

245
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,060
(Han Yansheng)

246
00:15:39,554 --> 00:15:41,708
Jian Dan, come to my office.

247
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
Han.

248
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,920
Aren't you the lucky one?

249
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,680
She gets you breakfast every day.

250
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,800
Breakfast?

251
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,400
Jian Dan went to the music room
this morning

252
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,311
to bring you breakfast.

253
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,200
Didn't you see her?

254
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,880
No, I didn't.

255
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,280
You'd better tell her yourself, then.

256
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
Monkey said

257
00:16:18,977 --> 00:16:21,240
you brought me breakfast
this morning in the music room.

258
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:22,520
Where's the food?

259
00:16:22,577 --> 00:16:24,888
You already had your fill
listening to the piece.

260
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,960
Why would you need breakfast?

261
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,440
So you did see us.

262
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Why didn't you call me?

263
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,760
I didn't want to get in your way.

264
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
The sheet music Entong picked for me

265
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,888
was actually pretty good.

266
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,640
You study psychology.

267
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,240
You should know a thing or two
about music therapy, right?

268
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,960
If you think she's better,

269
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,600
let her treat you from now on.

270
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
There, there. Don't get jealous.

271
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
It was Shi
who asked me to go there this morning.

272
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,120
He was there too.

273
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,533
It wasn't the romantic scene
you imagined.

274
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,400
Shi was there too?

275
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:09,955
If you don't believe me,

276
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,520
call and ask him yourself.

277
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,640
That won't be necessary.

278
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,320
It's not like I care anyway.

279
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,160
This is for you.

280
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,600
What is it?

281
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,640
A dress.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,911
Check it out
when you're back in the dorm.

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,400
Why are you giving me a dress?

284
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,080
Entong said

285
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
she's inviting us this weekend

286
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:35,560
to a concert.

287
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:41,760
Only the three of us?

288
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,933
Shi is going too.

289
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,080
I think

290
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,480
I forgot to lock my dorm.

291
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,440
I'll go check on it.

292
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:57,365
I've really been

293
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,000
looking forward to this concert.

294
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,355
It's definitely going
to be an amazing one.

295
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:02,320
Where's Shi?

296
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:03,480
Why isn't he here yet?

297
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,097
He just called

298
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:06,480
and said he'd be a bit late.

299
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Let's head in first.

300
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on.

301
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,600
Entong.

302
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,280
Your hair clip...

303
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,480
What's it?

304
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,480
It looks broken.

305
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:19,720
You're right.

306
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,800
No worries. You can wear mine.

307
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,720
It's okay, Jian Dan.

308
00:18:25,817 --> 00:18:26,760
Don't worry about it.

309
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,280
There.

310
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,880
Thanks.

311
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,080
Alright, let's head inside.

312
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Let's go.

313
00:18:50,777 --> 00:18:53,155
The aircon's really strong in here.
Don't catch a cold.

314
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,600
You too.

315
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,600
I'm not cold.

316
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,240
Excuse me.

317
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,937
Hi. We have one seat in the front row.

318
00:19:03,965 --> 00:19:05,720
Would you mind switching with us?

319
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,440
I want to sit with my boyfriend.

320
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,000
But I also want
to sit with my boyfriend.

321
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,040
Okay, then.

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Sorry about that.

323
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,640
Sorry, I'm late.

324
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,240
Come on. It's starting soon.

325
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,840
I got you this.

326
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,400
(Music Festival)

327
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,320
That concert

328
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,960
was both gentle and soothing.

329
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,240
Right from the start,

330
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,400
it was full of powerful emotion.

331
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,640
From the calm, solemn beginning,

332
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,120
to the elegant, peaceful middle part,

333
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,960
and the cheerful, energetic ending...

334
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:50,440
It really was a magnificent piece,
wasn't it?

335
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,714
The composer

336
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:53,360
is certainly a musical prodigy.

337
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,080
Since when did you
know much about music?

338
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,920
Music's good for your condition, right?

339
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,520
As your girlfriend,

340
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,080
of course, I had to do my homework.

341
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,600
Han Yansheng and I will head out first.

342
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:10,866
We'll leave you two to it.

343
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,960
I'll get you home.

344
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,120
Let's go.

345
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,440
Alright, we're almost done here.

346
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's all go grab some food.

347
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,600
- Let's go. Time to eat.
- Yeah.

348
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,200
Jian Dan, let's go.

349
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Hold on.

350
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,800
I forgot my phone.

351
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,600
You go ahead.

352
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,160
Sure.

353
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,440
Jian Dan.

354
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,240
I came to return your hair clip.

355
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,600
Thanks for helping me then.

356
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,600
It was no big deal.

357
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,280
Zhishan's waiting to eat with me.

358
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,440
If there's nothing else,

359
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,520
I'll head off.

360
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,982
I was about to leave too.

361
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,800
Let's go together.

362
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,880
Alright, I'm off, Jian Dan.

363
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,240
Bye.

364
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:32,920
Bye, Entong.

365
00:22:37,428 --> 00:22:40,500
(Psychological Clinic 1)

366
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,920
Your psychological evaluation results
aren't ideal.

367
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,840
But don't be too discouraged.

368
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,280
After all, there are
many successful recovery cases.

369
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,680
Thank you, Sir.

370
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,400
Wasn't it good?

371
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,360
That was too salty.

372
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,177
Fine, we'll try another one after this.

373
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,529
Alright, everyone,

374
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,010
go get ready for afternoon training.

375
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:12,960
Get changed first.

376
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,097
- Okay!
- Got it!

377
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,120
Where is it?

378
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,620
(HADS Psychological Assessment Form)

379
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,320
(The condition is getting worse.)

380
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,520
(It might never get better.)

381
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,080
(I feel more lost
and helpless than ever.)

382
00:24:20,514 --> 00:24:23,360
(Maybe I should give up.)

383
00:24:24,994 --> 00:24:29,040
(I should tell him I don't love him
and break up with him.)

384
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,040
(The condition is getting worse.)

385
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,120
(It might never get better.)

386
00:24:39,691 --> 00:24:42,800
(I feel more lost
and helpless than ever.)

387
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,080
(Maybe I should give up.)

388
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,760
(I should tell him I don't love him
and break up with him.)

389
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,520
My voice recorder!

390
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,320
So it was with you.

391
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,480
I thought I lost it.

392
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,200
(The condition is getting worse.)

393
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,080
(It might never get better.)

394
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,400
Turn it off.

395
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Did you say

396
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,000
those words?

397
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,640
Yeah.

398
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,800
I see.

399
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,777
So that's what you think.

400
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:58,960
What's that supposed to mean?

401
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,480
Why are you so mad all of a sudden?

402
00:26:03,844 --> 00:26:06,466
Don't tell me you didn't hear it all
and misunderstood me?

403
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,320
Han Yansheng.

404
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,480
I want to talk to you
about the recording...

405
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,320
I knew it. You do care about me.

406
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,560
Please stop following me.

407
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:33,720
Han Yansheng!

408
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:43,440
Alright, let's begin class now.

409
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,400
Get in position. Ready.

410
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,680
One, two.

411
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,320
One, two.

412
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,760
One, two.

413
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,160
One...

414
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,080
Han, Jian Dan's here.

415
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,840
As per our Swimming Club rules,

416
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,600
no outsiders are allowed
during training hours.

417
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,760
Monkey, please escort her out.

418
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,377
But Jian Dan's different, she...

419
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,000
If you don't follow club rules,

420
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,280
you'll be punished too.

421
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,360
Back to training.

422
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,120
One, two.

423
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,800
One, two.

424
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,920
One, two.

425
00:27:47,257 --> 00:27:50,160
One, two.

426
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,720
Jian Dan.

427
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:04,360
What's going on between you and Han?

428
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,720
I'd like to know what's going on too.

429
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,280
He's been avoiding me,

430
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,600
and he won't even give me
a chance to talk.

431
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
That's just how he is.

432
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,800
Once he makes up his mind,
no one can change it.

433
00:28:15,411 --> 00:28:16,320
But I think

434
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,480
you shouldn't panic.

435
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,711
You know what they say
Three heads are better than one.

436
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,377
I'll get everyone here
and we'll figure something out together.

437
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:36,720
Jian Dan, try to recall it.

438
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,800
When exactly did Han

439
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,200
start acting like this?

440
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,840
Well, he got really upset

441
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,400
after listening to the recording.

442
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,600
I think he probably

443
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,911
didn't listen to the whole thing.

444
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,000
I want to explain myself,

445
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,080
but he refuses to see me.

446
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,600
What recording?

447
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,960
A voice log of his condition.

448
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,348
The recorder's still here.

449
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
It's broken.

450
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,520
Broken?

451
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,320
Can it still be fixed?

452
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,760
I can give it a shot.

453
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
But it'll take some time.

454
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,000
What should I do now?

455
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,320
I want to explain,

456
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,800
but he won't give me the chance.

457
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,244
I hate this the most.

458
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:25,080
When two people fight,
one wants to explain,

459
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,320
and the other refuses to listen.

460
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,160
What era are we in?

461
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,000
Why are we still doing
this idol drama plot?

462
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,640
If you ask me, let's just go
with the most direct approach.

463
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:36,030
That's to make Han Yansheng
listen to Jian Dan's explanation.

464
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:37,520
I've got an idea.

465
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,600
Shi, Yuan Sen.

466
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,320
Let's go drag Han here.

467
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,200
That might be a bit too much, right?

468
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,240
Isn't this direct enough?

469
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
That's way too direct.

470
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,977
I can't believe
you even thought of that.

471
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,444
You come up with an idea, then.

472
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:56,240
I just came up with something.

473
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,200
Dr. Li Meng.

474
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,565
You've been studying PTSD
for a long time.

475
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,960
Based on your experience,

476
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,960
what are my chances of recovery?

477
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Sure, thank you.

478
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,480
I know what I need to do now.

479
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,800
Hey, Han.

480
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,994
Yuan Sen is planning

481
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,760
a surprise

482
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:42,960
for his 214-day anniversary with Mi Fen,

483
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,280
and he needs your help.

484
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,577
Go to the Swimming Club now.

485
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:47,960
Got it.

486
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,360
Alright.

487
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:50,782
Let's go.

488
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,422
Monkey, where are you guys?

489
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,880
We're almost there.

490
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,080
Well... Wait a second.

491
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,920
Jian Dan, Han's inside.

492
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:29,640
Go on in.

493
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:30,460
Hurry, Jian Dan.

494
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,088
This is your chance to talk to him.

495
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,200
- Go ahead. You've got this.
- Go now.

496
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,400
(According to your report,)

497
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,080
(your condition isn't very optimistic.)

498
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,560
(Overcoming PTSD)

499
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,760
(relies heavily on your own willpower.)

500
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,920
(First of all,)

501
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,960
(you need to overcome
your mental barriers.)

502
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:54,000
(You have to let go of yourself.)

503
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,880
(Otherwise,
during desensitization therapy,)

504
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,360
(you may experience anxiety,
irritability,)

505
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,133
(or even depression.)

506
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,160
(In extreme cases,)

507
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,844
(it may even lead to self-harm
or suicidal thoughts.)
