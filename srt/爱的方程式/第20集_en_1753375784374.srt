1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I love you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love you

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I love you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 18

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm done.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll tell you later.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So you don't have depression.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You lied.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The Long Ballad

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Dasheng, let me explain.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have nothing to explain.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
From childhood to the end,

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When a girl comes close to Dasheng,

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You just want to drive her away.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's not exception for the simple.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Dasheng, you don't know that,

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He gave the simple the WC2.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's true?

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I...

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
I like you too much.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,560
Guentong.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,760
Listen carefully.

35
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,440
I like Jian Da.

36
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,880
What about the South Garden?

37
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Have you forgotten?

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,280
That's our common experience.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,360
Only I know you best.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Only we are the most suitable, Da Sheng.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,560
Guentong.

42
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
You said you liked Han Yan Sheng.

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
But you hurt him by using a man's business.

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,360
That's not like.

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,080
Besides,

46
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,120
Han Yan Sheng is my boyfriend now.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,320
If you hurt him again,

48
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
I won't be polite.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,160
Let's go.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,640
Guentong.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,360
Okay, that's all for today.

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,040
Class dismissed.

53
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,760
Professor.

54
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
I just heard that

55
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,040
the trauma after injury

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,200
can be interfered by

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,160
psychological treatment.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,280
How should we do it?

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Every patient with trauma after injury

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,120
has different right and left sounds.

61
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
So, their individual performance is different.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,040
It needs long-term observation

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,640
to determine how to interfere.

64
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,240
How about this?

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,000
I can recommend some books to you.

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,320
You can learn more.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,960
That's great. Thank you, Professor.

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,360
Medical Summary

69
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,720
moins.

70
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,480
Your Highness.

71
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,240
Xiao Zi.

72
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,040
I made you coffee.

73
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,920
Drink it on the way.

74
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
When I was in my most helpless state,

75
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm glad you were there for me.

76
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,720
It's great.

77
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
You're the one who helped me.

78
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,560
Don't worry.

79
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,480
Everything will pass.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,360
I'm leaving.

81
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,600
Wen Tong.

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,840
I'll wait for you to come back.

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,200
Jian Dan.

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How many books are there in the library?

85
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
Why do you borrow so many?

86
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,160
Jian Dan.

87
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,960
You're too strong.

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,600
Jian Dan.

89
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,760
Did you hear that?

90
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
Gu Wen Tong asked for leave

91
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,440
to attend a music exchange.

92
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,520
In my opinion,

93
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,480
she was just exposed to the lie.

94
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,320
She didn't want to see anyone, so she tried to avoid it.

95
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,320
Gu Wen Tong is too scheming.

96
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,600
We used to be so wrong.

97
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
I was wrong.

98
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,240
All right.

99
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,440
Let's not talk about her.

100
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
Do me a favor.

101
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,320
Go ahead.

102
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
Help me ask Monkey and Yan Sen out.

103
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,920
I have something to tell you tomorrow.

104
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,120
Okay.

105
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,680
Okay.

106
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
I asked you here today

107
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,760
to discuss

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,960
how to solve Han Yan Sheng's psychological problem.

109
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,040
He also wants to get out of it.

110
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,960
You're a psychologist.

111
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,800
We'll listen to you.

112
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,800
The book says that it's a way

113
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,720
to treat a patient's mental disorder

114
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
by leading them to face their mental disorder.

115
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,760
You mean

116
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
to rewrite the situation?

117
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,040
Not exactly.

118
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,120
Let's just do it step by step.

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,320
We'll do it step by step.

120
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,200
What should we do specifically?

121
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
I have an idea.

122
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,080
This way?

123
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,800
It'll be difficult for us even if we ask you.

124
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,200
Why are you bringing me to the women's dorm?

125
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,720
Here they are!

126
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
My...

127
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Wait here.

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
I've called Jian Dan and is podstaw.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
Please wait here.

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,960
Go, go.

131
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,960
You have something to tell Jian Dan?

132
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,480
I'll wait at the entrance then.

133
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,000
Over there!

134
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,840
I can't see him at the entrance.

135
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,800
How could you?

136
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,000
He is a nobody.

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
What if someone saw him?

138
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,880
How could I miss it?

139
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,600
Everyone is waiting at the back door.

140
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,720
Back door?

141
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,120
Is there a back door?

142
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,400
She never walks behind the door.

143
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:52,880
I know she...

144
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,400
Stop!

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Han.

146
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,760
Just wait here.

147
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
We'll be out soon.

148
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,040
Hurry up.

149
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,840
Be careful.

150
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,000
Let's go.

151
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,480
Zhang Zhishan,

152
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
come down!

153
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,360
Who told you to be so close to Master?

154
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
You were supposed to be the one who made a mistake.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,560
Let's have a fight.

156
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,200
Let me do it.

157
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,760
Stop!

158
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,320
Zhang Zhishan.

159
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
Stop!

160
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,840
All right.

161
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,240
Stop fighting.

162
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,880
This is not working.

163
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
It's a bad idea.

164
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,720
But I have another way.

165
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,520
I'm sure it'll work.

166
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,880
Come with us.

167
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,240
You are here.

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Where are you?

169
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,840
I'm coming right away.

170
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,840
Don't move.

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Just stand there and wait for me.

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Is it going to work?

173
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
It's definitely going to work.

174
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
I've already asked around.

175
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,280
The fountain here

176
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,760
opens at noon every day at 12 o'clock.

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,920
We just need to make sure

178
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,120
that Old Han is standing in the center of the fountain.

179
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,160
The girl is here.

180
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,000
She's here.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She's here.

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
You must all like to drink milk tea.

183
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,640
Buy her a cup.

184
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,720
Old Han is leaving.

185
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,480
Do something.

186
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
No, no, no.

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Go, go, go.

188
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Go, go, go.

189
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Go, go, go.

190
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Han Yanshan!

191
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,840
The girl is here.

192
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
She's here.

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
She's here.

194
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
She's here.

195
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
She's here.

196
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
She's here.

197
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
She's here.

198
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
She's here.

199
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
She's here.

200
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,840
She's here.

201
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,840
She's here.

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,840
She's here.

203
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
She's here.

204
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,840
She's here.

205
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
She's here.

206
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
She's here.

207
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
She's here.

208
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
She's here.

209
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,840
She's here.

210
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,840
She's here.

211
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,840
She's here.

212
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,840
She's here.

213
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
She's here.

214
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
She's here.

215
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
She's here.

216
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
She's here.

217
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
She's here.

218
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
She's here.

219
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,840
She's here.

220
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
This idea was thought up by Monkey, right?

221
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
This idea is not even searched.

222
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,840
This is simply a magic trick.

223
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Aren't you afraid of water?

224
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
What's wrong?

225
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,840
I just can't swim in the sea.

226
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
It's not that I can't take a bath.

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,840
Is there any difference between this and taking a bath?

228
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
You're right.

229
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
One is on the side of the water,

230
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
the other is down the side of the water.

231
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Although it doesn't have much effect,

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
I'm very grateful to you.

233
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,840
You're not angry.

234
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Then let's move on to the next project.

235
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
There's more?

236
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I think Monkey's idea is not reliable.

237
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,840
How about we just do Plan B?

238
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
I think it's good.

239
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,840
Why is my plan not reliable?

240
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
It's not implemented yet.

241
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
What's wrong?

242
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
What's wrong with your brain?

243
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,840
Han is coming.

244
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,840
He's coming.

245
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Han.

246
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
Why are you shouting at me?

247
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
What are you doing?

248
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,840
Han.

249
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Han.

250
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Help me, Han.

251
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
Help me.

252
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Han.

253
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Han, help me.

254
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Han, I'm so tired.

255
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Han.

256
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Help me.

257
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Han, help me.

258
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Han.

259
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Han.

260
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
Han.

261
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Help me.

262
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Have you had enough?

263
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
No one believes me.

264
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
What if I really fall into the water?

265
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
There's too much water in your brain.

266
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
It's worth it to be in the water.

267
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
I...

268
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,840
Let's go.

269
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Let's go to the hot spring.

270
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,840
Let's go.

271
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
Han.

272
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Why is your necklace gone?

273
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
You were wearing it just now.

274
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,840
I was wearing it just now.

275
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,840
Is it because you fell into the water

276
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,840
when you were in the hot spring?

277
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,840
This is a water source.

278
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
We have to find it quickly.

279
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Then why are you still here?

280
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,840
Hurry up and find it.

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,840
Han.

282
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Are you okay?

283
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,840
Don't worry.

284
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
I'll help you find it.

285
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Here.

286
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,840
I found it.

287
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Don't lose it again.

288
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
I know you're fine.

289
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,840
How do you count

290
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,840
for lying to me?

291
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
This is not my idea.

292
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Have some water.

293
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
It's good.

294
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Come on.

295
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
Come on.

296
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,840
Is it okay to drink water?

297
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
What is this?

298
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
The

299
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
Great Challenge of Holdings.

300
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
The holdings record

301
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
of this store

302
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
is 4 minutes and 3 seconds.

303
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,840
Monkey said that

304
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
you're good at holding things.

305
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
You can hold it for

306
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,840
at most 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

307
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Try it.

308
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Han.

309
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,840
Can you eat a big lobster today?

310
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
It's all up to you.

311
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
Is it steamed or braised?

312
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Or let it go.

313
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,840
You even put on a hot spring.

314
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
You can do this.

315
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I'll do it.

316
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
I'll do it.

317
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I'll do it.

318
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,840
I'll do it.

319
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
I'll do it.

320
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
I'll do it.

321
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
You can do this.

322
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Han.

323
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
You can do it.

324
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Don't worry.

325
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,840
We'll all

326
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
accompany you to overcome the difficulties.

327
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Come on.

328
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Come on.

329
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Come on.

330
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Come on.

331
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Boss.

332
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I want to challenge.

333
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Okay.

334
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
One, two, three.

335
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Start.

336
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
One, two, three.

337
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,840
Start.

338
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,840
One, two, three.

339
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Start.

340
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
One, two, three.

341
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
Start.

342
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
One, two, three.

343
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Start.

344
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
One, two, three.

345
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Start.

346
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
One, two, three.

347
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Start.

348
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
One, two, three.

349
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Start.

350
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
One, two, three.

351
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
Start.

352
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
One, two, three.

353
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,840
Start.

Start.

356
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
One, two, three.

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Start.

360
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
One, two, three.

361
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Start.

362
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,840
One, two, three.

363
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,840
Start.

364
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
One, two, three.

365
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Start.

366
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
One, two, three.

367
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,840
Start.

368
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
Come on, bee.

369
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
4.01 seconds.

370
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
4.02 seconds.

371
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,840
4.03 seconds.

372
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,840
I've started.

373
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
I've started.

374
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,680
Lu Xia!

375
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
So handsome!

376
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,240
Lu Xia!

377
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,800
I'm so happy!

378
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,600
Big Lu Xia!

379
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,400
Big Lu Xia!

380
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:35,920
Sister!

381
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,600
Lu Xia!

382
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,200
Boy, you're so good.

383
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
Lu Xia is over there.

384
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,400
Go and pick one.

385
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,880
I'll go.

386
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,760
I'll go and pick a big one.

387
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Wang Yan Tian!

388
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,240
Wang Yan Tian!

389
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,840
Let's go to the seat.

390
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,440
Let's go.

391
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,240
I'll take you to the sofa.

392
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:49,600
Lu Xia.

393
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,120
Lu Xia!

394
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,800
Big Lu Xia!

395
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,440
Little Lu Xia!

396
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,360
This one!

397
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,160
Who will you pick?

398
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,960
You!

399
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,240
My hand!

400
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,360
My hand!

401
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,000
Lin Ning,

402
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,960
let me hold it.

403
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
It hurts!

404
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Boss,

405
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,840
please think of something.

406
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,600
Boss!

407
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Don't move your hand.

408
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,080
I won't move.

409
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:07,880
The more you move,

410
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,720
the more anxious he is.

411
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,680
I won't move.

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,760
I'll think of something.

413
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,200
Go!

414
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,800
Lu Xia,

415
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,920
hurry up!

416
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,960
Can you stop screaming?

417
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,880
He's getting on my nerves again.

418
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,200
Boss!

419
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,400
Can you think of something

420
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,600
to calm me down?

421
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I like you!

422
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,560
Come on.

423
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,760
Put your hand in the water.

424
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,640
Put your hand in the water.

425
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,760
All right.

426
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,960
Take it out.

427
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,920
All right.

428
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,760
Don't talk nonsense.

429
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,040
It's raining harder than Big Lu Xia.

430
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,960
It's raining harder than Big Lu Xia.

431
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
It's raining harder than Big Lu Xia.

432
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,160
It's raining harder than Big Lu Xia.

433
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,800
I'll kill you!

434
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,040
Dr. Han is in a good state today.

435
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,160
I'm confident that

436
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
I can cooperate with him.

437
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,560
I'm sure I can help him overcome

438
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,960
the psychological obstacles.

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,080
It's simple.

440
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Can you go to a place with me

441
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,600
at night?

442
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Okay.

443
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,640
This is the Nanyuan's house?

444
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,160
Since the accident,

445
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,920
they moved here.

446
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,360
After that incident,

447
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,680
I've never seen my uncle and aunt again.

448
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
I'm sorry.

449
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Aunt.

450
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,360
I'm here to see you and Uncle.

451
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,520
Han.

452
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,560
Why are you here?

453
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,320
Come on in.

454
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Come on.

455
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
It's a mess at home.

456
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Don't mind it.

457
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,080
Hello, your delivery.

458
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
Here's your lunch.

459
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
Thank you.

460
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,440
It smells so good.

461
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,480
Han, thank you.

462
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,040
I didn't send this.

463
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
You didn't?

464
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,600
Who sent it?

465
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,280
Maybe

466
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,840
A Yan's other friends.

467
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,120
Don't stand there.

468
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,120
Come on in.

469
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
Come on.

470
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,560
The yellow rose is also a sign of you.

471
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Han,

472
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
you haven't introduced yourself.

473
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,000
Who is she?

474
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,160
Aunt.

475
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,800
This is Jian Dan.

476
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,200
She's my girlfriend.

477
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Hello.

478
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Hello, aunt.

479
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,560
If A Yan is here,

480
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,320
maybe

481
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,960
she also has a girlfriend.

482
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,160
I'm sorry, aunt.

483
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,800
If I hadn't insisted on diving,

484
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,240
she wouldn't have been in trouble.

485
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Han,

486
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,360
I've never blamed you.

487
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,760
A Yan was in trouble.

488
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,560
It was an accident.

489
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,760
You didn't think about it.

490
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,360
Don't blame yourself.

491
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,960
Besides, time has passed.

492
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,360
Uncle and aunt

493
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,360
have already come out

494
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
and started a new life.

495
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
They're all here.

496
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
They're all here.

497
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
They're all here.

498
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
They're all here.

499
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
They're all here.

500
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,360
You have to

501
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
get out of here as soon as possible.

502
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
A Yan and you are best friends.

503
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,760
She definitely doesn't want to see you like this.

504
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Han.

505
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Uncle.

506
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,760
It's been a long time.

507
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,960
Fortunately, you came over today.

508
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,160
In a few days,

509
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,960
your aunt and I will move abroad.

510
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,160
I'm afraid we won't see each other again.

511
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
How is it?

512
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Well,

513
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,960
we're putting on the incense.

514
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Uncle,

515
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,960
are you moving?

516
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,560
We bought a house abroad.

517
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,960
We planned to move

518
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,960
after A Yan went to college.

519
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
But we didn't expect...

520
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,160
There are no people and things

521
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,560
that matter in China anyway.

522
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
We want to move now.

523
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,160
The moving company is downstairs.

524
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,960
Why don't you go with me?

525
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,160
Aunt Shushuang,

526
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,960
leave this to me.

527
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,560
I'll help you.

528
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,960
Okay, thank you.

529
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:09,960
Here.

530
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Here.

531
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
Here.

532
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
I didn't expect this.

533
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Is there anything special?

534
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,360
This is the gift I gave her

535
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,960
on Nan Yuan's birthday.

536
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
She likes it.

537
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,560
She always wears it.

538
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,960
How did you know Nan Yuan?

539
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
Nan Yuan and I are childhood friends.

540
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,560
We entered the same swimming club in high school.

541
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,160
Her physical strength and speed

542
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,560
are comparable to mine.

543
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,160
We trained together,

544
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,960
competed together,

545
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,560
and participated in the swimming club in Haida together.

546
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,760
To incubate uninhibited brine

547
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,060
The test pool pool match

548
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,560
is going to happen at the University of Shanghai.

549
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,760
Our university has two places

550
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,520
The first two will represent the school for the next round.

551
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,200
The selection

552
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,920
requires every member to develop fully.

553
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,640
The results of free swimming, butterfly swimming, sheep swimming,

554
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,560
and digging will be calculated in the total.

555
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,160
What's wrong, Dasha?

556
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,040
The enemy is my weakness.

557
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,760
It's okay. I'll go with you.

558
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,520
Go.

559
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,080
Xu Ran, you fooled.

560
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,200
You ended up second.

561
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,320
It's indeed you, Captain.

562
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,720
Indeed.

563
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
How could this happen?

564
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
She usually doesn't...

565
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,320
Nanyuan,

566
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,760
you don't have to go back

567
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,040
if you didn't get selected.

568
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,320
You still have a chance.

569
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,800
Take good care of your injury first.

570
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,560
It's not a small thing

571
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,800
to heal your joints.

572
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,400
I've contacted the best

573
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,040
recovery training system for you.

574
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,600
Take good care of yourself.

575
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,880
Nanyuan is injured.

576
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,720
Is it because she was with me when I was training?

577
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
Thank you, coach.

578
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,720
But,

579
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,200
can you not tell Dasheng

580
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,600
about my injury?

581
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,960
I want her to play the game peacefully.

582
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,760
Dasheng.

583
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,720
Dasheng.

584
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,360
I'm not going to the game.

585
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,360
I want to accompany you to do the recovery training.

586
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,280
The list has been set.

587
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,880
But you're injured because of me.

588
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,480
So you have to go to the game.

589
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,720
Dasheng.

590
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,280
Do you remember our agreement?

591
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,800
We're going to win the championship together.

592
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,320
Now I'm injured.

593
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,920
You have to get the trophy back for me.

594
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,840
For the team's glory.

595
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,040
Dasheng, come on!

596
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,720
Come on!

597
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,600
Come on!

598
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,000
Dasheng, come on!

599
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,520
Dasheng, you're the champion!

600
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,680
You're the champion!

601
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,280
Nanyuan is my best friend.

602
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,360
She's also my best friend.

603
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,280
On her 18th birthday,

604
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,120
I gave her this watch.

605
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,480
I hope our friendship

606
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,760
will last forever

607
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,640
like time.

608
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,000
Is this the photo you took with Nanyuan?

609
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,280
Yes.

610
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,040
Where did you take it?

611
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,400
Nanyuan and I

612
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,760
took it in a small town in the west of France.

613
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,000
Behind us is a time travel agency.

614
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,360
Someone wrote down what they wanted to say

615
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,960
or what they wanted to achieve.

616
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,640
They sent it to their future self

617
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,520
through the time travel agency.

618
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,080
Nanyuan and I

619
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,600
also wrote a postcard

620
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,320
to our future selves.

621
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,040
Unfortunately,

622
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,560
I lost that postcard.

623
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,440
I never received it again.

624
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,600
I don't know

625
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,880
if Nanyuan received it.

626
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,280
I think I've seen

627
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,480
the postcard you mentioned.

628
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,840
Look, is it this one?

629
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,800
It's this one.

630
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,760
Aunt,

631
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
I've made up my mind.

632
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I want to take the test of

633
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,880
the rescue volunteers in Shui Shang

634
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,160
to help Nanyuan

635
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,760
realize her dream.

636
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
That's great.

637
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,280
That's great.

638
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
Thank you.

639
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,280
That's great.

640
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,960
Have you passed the test?

641
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,120
I knew we could do it.

642
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,600
You want to take the test?

643
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
I just want to help you

644
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
realize your dream.

645
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,960
And I've checked it.

646
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,920
The selection of the rescue volunteers

647
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,640
is held at the swimming pool of Haiyang University.

648
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,240
It's very beneficial to us.

649
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,680
Swimming is easy to say.

650
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,440
In theory,

651
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,600
we just need to memorize the test.

652
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
It shouldn't be a big problem.

653
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,880
The key is the practicality.

654
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,640
The main test is

655
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,120
the rescue on the spot,

656
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,440
the relief on the road

657
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,240
and the recovery of the heart and lung.

658
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,320
The recovery of the heart and lung is the key.

659
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,840
I learned the recovery of the heart and lung

660
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,280
in high school.

661
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,480
It's not difficult.

662
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,600
But I haven't learned it.

663
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,560
I'll teach you.

664
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,680
First,

665
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,040
adjust the body position of the drowning person.

666
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,520
Determine his consciousness.

667
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,520
Check his breathing.

668
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,040
If there is something in his mouth,

669
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,160
you need to remove it first

670
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,320
and then press it against his chest.

671
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,840
How about

672
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,080
you be the drowning person?

673
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,880
Press for thirty times.

674
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,080
If this poets is still faint,

675
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,800
you need to breathe in by yourself.

676
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,480
I need three metres.

677
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,320
Feel your breathing.

678
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,280
What floor am I in now?

679
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,640
Over balanced.

680
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,880
Here.

681
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:44,760
OK.

682
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,320
Here.

683
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,840
Of course,

684
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,040
your high school was close.

685
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,080
The past is so old

686
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,080
The vague name is still good

687
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:40,080
We once had each other

688
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,080
Those young days are gone

689
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,080
The heart is not to be recognized

690
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:53,080
But one day the promise becomes a luxury

691
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Those broken pasts

692
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,080
They will never be forgotten

693
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,080
The color of life
