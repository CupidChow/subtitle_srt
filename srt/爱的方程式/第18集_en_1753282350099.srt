1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I love you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love you

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I love you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Love by Hypnotic

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 18

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're my girlfriend

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take care of it

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Who's your girlfriend?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I've accepted the love token

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and you still want to deny it?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Love token?

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Isn't this the gift you gave to Jiang Zhishan?

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You know, I'm not a girl

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't know how to love

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you know

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
what the letters on the necklace mean?

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Xipadia

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, Xipadia

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My math goddess

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the necklace was given to me from the beginning

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why did you give it to me?

35
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why did you give me the necklace?

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why did you give me the cup?

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's wrong with your ass?

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're not allowed to look

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're an adult

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and you're still a little bit handsome

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're just a kid

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The necklace is ready

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Stop

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're the one who's going to throw it

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sorry

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm sorry

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sorry

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sorry

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sorry

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm sorry

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sorry

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's with the face?

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I thought it was a gift from your boyfriend

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
for you.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
Isn't that Jiang's gift?

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,320
It's his boyfriend's gift.

81
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,880
Actually, tonight...

82
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
I'm back!

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,120
It's so tiring to date.

84
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,960
Right, Jinan?

85
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
Yeah.

86
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,800
You must be tired

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,960
to date monkeys every day.

88
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm tired to date monkeys.

89
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
You're not as bad as

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,680
Yuan Sen and you.

91
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,760
Why are Yuan Sen and I

92
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,080
so bad?

93
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,200
Why are Yuan Sen and you

94
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,560
so bad?

95
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,240
Because you're not as bad as monkeys.

96
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,200
When did you see

97
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
me being bad with monkeys?

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
I'll help you sit down

99
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,600
for the football class tomorrow.

100
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,640
What?

101
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,360
What do you mean by that?

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,320
It's because you're bad.

103
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
We feel bad

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,360
when we see you being bad.

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,960
Your eyebrows are so pretty.

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Really?

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
I'll draw one for you.

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I'll start now.

109
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Here.

110
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,080
It's done.

111
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
Okay, I'm done.

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,280
Let me see.

113
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,600
How is it? Not bad, right?

114
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Three, two...

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,080
Okay.

116
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
This one.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
Right.

118
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Wait a second.

119
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
Hello, Yuan Sen.

120
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,640
Yifan, the movie

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,800
will start in ten minutes.

122
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Come down now.

123
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,360
I forgot.

124
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
Okay, I'll be there soon.

125
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Bye.

126
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Really?

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm going.

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,440
It's okay. Go now.

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
Didn't you draw one for me?

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,920
I'll draw this one

131
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
and the other one.

132
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,600
Okay. I believe you.

133
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,120
Don't worry.

134
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
Let's go.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Yanran.

136
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
What's wrong?

137
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Your laptop.

138
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
What's wrong?

139
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Nothing.

140
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Let me see.

141
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Let me see.

142
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,560
Here.

143
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
Let me see.

144
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Get ready for class.

145
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I didn't mean to.

146
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Are you angry?

147
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
You look so cute when you're angry.

148
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,360
Let's start.

149
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
The back foot and the forefoot.

150
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
Start first.

151
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
The forefoot.

152
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Let's learn the basics.

153
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Learn the feeling.

154
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Chief and Jian Dan are here.

155
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,360
They're holding hands.

156
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
What's going on?

157
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
They're holding hands.

158
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
You two are...

159
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Holding hands.

160
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
They must be girlfriends.

161
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
If this news is spread,

162
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
it will be a big trouble for the whole school.

163
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Right.

164
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Jian Dan and I are in love.

165
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Now it's true.

166
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
I'm in love.

167
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
I didn't know that Han Yan

168
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
fell in love with her.

169
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,360
Jian Dan.

170
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Why are you covering your face?

171
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Are you shy?

172
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,360
It's okay.

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
I think it's pretty special.

174
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Why are your eyebrows so rough?

175
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
Be careful with the spicy pen.

176
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,360
I'll go to see Xie Zhangmian now.

177
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
Great, Han.

178
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
You like it.

179
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,360
Chief.

180
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,360
Your fried chicken.

181
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Your fried chicken.

182
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Why are you so slow?

183
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
My WeChat is fast enough.

184
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
You don't know how many times I've blocked the road.

185
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I've blocked it for an hour.

186
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Besides,

187
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
there's fried chicken in the cafe.

188
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Why do you eat internet celebrity fried chicken?

189
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Can it be the same?

190
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
I got the special store of Tongtong fried chicken

191
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
on Doumin.

192
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
It's very popular.

193
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,360
This should be a new app.

194
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Do you want a piece?

195
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
No.

196
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
You're not worth it.

197
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Such a big person.

198
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
He doesn't even know how to eat fried chicken.

199
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Let's go.

200
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
What are you digging?

201
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Eat slowly.

202
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I...

203
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
I'll go to the bathroom.

204
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
What's wrong?

205
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
You don't even look at the road.

206
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
I'm asking you.

207
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,360
You're acting silly.

208
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
You're not playing with me.

209
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
Drink my coffee.

210
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Just a cup of coffee.

211
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Do you have to be so rude?

212
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Who are you?

213
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
What does it have to do with you?

214
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
I'm her boyfriend.

215
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Isn't it just a cup of coffee?

216
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
I'll drink with you.

217
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Hello.

218
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Here.

219
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Two cups of coffee for this gentleman.

220
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll pay.

221
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Wait for me.

222
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,360
You're really dating Han Shuo?

223
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
If it wasn't for the color,

224
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
I wouldn't even know.

225
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
When did it happen?

226
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Not long ago.

227
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Not long ago?

228
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
Look, I told you.

229
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
You and Han Shuo are a perfect match.

230
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Now,

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
the lovers are finally together.

232
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
Wait for me.

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Here, I'll calculate it for you.

234
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,360
No, no, no.

235
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I'm good at it.

236
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I'll calculate it for you.

237
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
What does it have to do with you now?

238
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,360
I'll calculate it for you.

239
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll calculate it for you.

240
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
I'll calculate it for you.

241
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Rice noodles.

242
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
Why don't you calculate it for me?

243
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I just want to see

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
if you're accurate.

245
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Look,

246
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,360
if you don't calculate it, someone else will.

247
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Here.

248
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Take it.

249
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Drink one.

250
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Here.

251
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
The right one.

252
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
It means your true love

253
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,360
is right next to you.

254
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,360
How is that possible?

255
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
You're not accurate at all.

256
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
What are you talking about?

257
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm accurate at it.

258
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
Aren't you and Monkey

259
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
pretending to be in love?

260
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Maybe this person is...

261
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Impossible.

262
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
Absolutely impossible.

263
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I like him at all.

264
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,360
Two eggs, two eggs, and a scallion.

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
One with chicken and one without scallion.

266
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,360
Okay.

267
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
You ate a lot of dog food this morning.

268
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
What's the breakfast money?

269
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
I bought breakfast for my boyfriend.

270
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
What's so embarrassing about it?

271
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
Thank you.

272
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,360
What do you want?

273
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
What do you want?

274
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I want a chicken thigh burger.

275
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,360
No, two.

276
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,360
I'll take it.

277
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
Thank you.

278
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Thank you.

279
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,360
Thank you.

280
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,360
Thank you.

281
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you.

282
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,360
Thank you.

283
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Two.

284
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Almost done.

285
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
Okay.

286
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Good morning, Jiannan.

287
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,360
Are you looking for Dasheng?

288
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,360
He hasn't come yet.

289
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
It's okay. I'll just put it here.

290
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
I'll bring him breakfast.

291
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
You're really a considerate

292
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,360
and gentle girlfriend.

293
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,360
You're my girlfriend.

294
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Okay. I'll tell him when he comes.

295
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Thank you, Senior.

296
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
Bye.

297
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Good morning, Senior.

298
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
Good morning, Senior.

299
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Good morning, Senior.

00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Good morning, Senior.

301
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
Good morning, Senior.

302
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,360
Good morning, Senior.

303
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Good morning, Senior.

304
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Good morning, Senior.

305
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,360
Good morning, Senior.

306
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
Good morning, Senior.

307
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,360
Good morning, Senior.

308
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Good morning, Senior.

309
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,360
Good morning, Senior.

310
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Good morning, Senior.

311
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,360
Good morning, Senior.

312
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,360
Good morning, Senior.

313
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Good morning, Senior.

314
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Good morning, Senior.

315
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Good morning, Senior.

316
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Good morning, Senior.

317
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Good morning, Senior.

318
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Good morning, Senior.

319
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Good morning, Senior.

320
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Good morning, Senior.

321
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Good morning, Senior.

322
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Good morning, Senior.

323
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Good morning, Senior.

324
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Good morning, Senior.

325
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Good morning, Senior.

326
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,360
Good morning, Senior.

327
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Good morning, Senior.

328
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
You scared me.

329
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Yo.

330
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
The Surface Peace pompea weilti.

331
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Go brauchennyape.

332
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
You have to do it.

333
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,560
Remember,

334
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,800
30 yuan.

335
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
30 yuan in a row.

336
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,960
Be careful.

337
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I know.

338
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,880
It's so hard to make money every year.

339
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,760
I bought you breakfast.

340
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
What are you doing?

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,080
Is it acting?

342
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,480
I bought you breakfast.

343
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
You're not happy?

344
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,120
You never bought me breakfast.

345
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,280
You never

346
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,120
talked to me like this.

347
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,160
I understand.

348
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,320
Tell me.

349
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,440
Is there a thief in there?

350
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
You're a bad guy.

351
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,120
Monkey!

352
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
Did you get hurt by Wan Xiang Zhen?

353
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,080
Yes.

354
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,960
I'm used to you being like this.

355
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
Why are you so gentle all of a sudden?

356
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
You scared me.

357
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,240
I thought I did something wrong.

358
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,640
Do you want to eat?

359
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,320
Here.

360
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,560
Did you have breakfast?

361
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,600
No, we don't.

362
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,720
Keep it for yourself.

363
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:46,800
I knew it.

364
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,040
There must be a thief.

365
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:55,880
Senior.

366
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,360
I want to talk to you.

367
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,000
What's wrong?

368
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,200
I'll just get back to work.

369
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,640
Why did you throw my breakfast

370
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,720
into the trash can?

371
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,600
I didn't.

372
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,360
I'm in a hurry to go to class.

373
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,400
I'm leaving.

374
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,560
What about the video?

375
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,800
You knew Dr. Han Yang

376
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,440
would be out of control when he saw the video.

377
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,000
You even gave me the video

378
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and asked me to persuade him.

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,360
Didn't you do it on purpose?

380
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,680
It's simple.

381
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,880
You really misunderstood me.

382
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,560
I just hope that Dasheng can cheer up.

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,320
He'll react to the video after watching it.

384
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,680
You don't have to pretend anymore.

385
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,880
I'll tell Dr. Han about this.

386
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,920
You need to prove it.

387
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,200
Do you think Dasheng will believe

388
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
your empty speculations?

389
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,440
You'll know it later.

390
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,400
Hello?

391
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,400
Dr. Han.

392
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry. I'm in a meeting.

393
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,160
I'll come to you later.

394
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
He'll know sooner or later.

395
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,320
Actually, it's a date with Zhao Jinjie.

396
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,800
Zeyi's boyfriend is a friend of Jinjie's.

397
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,560
I also have a boyfriend.

398
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Let's go.

399
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,840
Ś.

400
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,240
You're here so early.

401
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,240
Nothing happened.

402
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,480
So I come here work.

403
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,120
I see.

404
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,240
I'll go by myself.

405
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,080
Someone is drowning!

406
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Hurry up!

407
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Hurry up!

408
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,280
Be careful!

409
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Hurry up!

410
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
Come on.

411
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Come on.

412
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
Slowly.

413
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Slowly.

414
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Senior Sister!

415
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Senior Sister!

416
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Senior Sister, wake up!

417
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Hurry up!

418
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Hurry up!

419
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Hurry up!

420
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Hurry up!

421
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Hurry up!

422
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,760
Hurry up!

423
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Hurry up!

424
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Senior Sister, don't scare me!

425
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Senior Sister!

426
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,040
Senior Sister!

427
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,040
Senior Sister, wake up!

428
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Brother, no problem.

429
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Remember to send it to the company.

430
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,840
Okay, Commander.

431
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,160
It's simple.

432
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,280
It's all over.

433
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
I'll go now.

434
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Hello?

435
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,720
What?

436
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
N-Tong is drowning?

437
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Okay.

438
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,400
I'll go to the hospital first.

439
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
It's simple.

440
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,440
N-Tong is drowning. I'll go to the hospital first.

441
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,840
We'll talk face to face.

442
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
N-Tong, you're awake?

443
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you want some water?

444
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
What's wrong with him?

445
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
He's on his way here.

446
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
What's wrong?

447
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Do you need me to call the doctor?

448
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
No, I don't.

449
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,880
There's medicine in my bag.

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,880
Let me get it.

451
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,880
N-Tong,

452
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,880
why are you taking medicine for depression?

453
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
You have depression?

454
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
What depression?

455
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
How long have you been taking this medicine?

456
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
More than a year.

457
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,880
Did you get a lot of stimulation before the patient?

458
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
From now on,

459
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,880
try to avoid stimulating patients.

460
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
You should accompany him

461
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,880
and help him get out of it.

462
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,880
Okay, Doctor.

463
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,880
Is there anything else you need to pay attention to?

464
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,880
The patient's specific condition

465
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,880
needs further observation

466
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
to make the right judgment.

467
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,880
I'll arrange a psychological assessment

468
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
for the patient as soon as possible.

469
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,880
Thank you, Doctor.

470
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
I'm sorry to trouble you.

471
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,880
Actually,

472
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
what I'm most afraid of

473
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
is that

474
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,880
you care about me.

475
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Why have I never heard you mention it?

476
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm actually like you.

477
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,880
I've never walked out

478
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,880
of the faraway things.

479
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,880
I often have nightmares at night.

480
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I dreamt of Nanyuan.

481
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
She was looking at me under the water,

482
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
begging for help.

483
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,880
She even questioned me,

484
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
asking why I didn't save her.

485
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
Because of my situation at that time,

486
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,880
I could only save one person.

487
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,880
I saved you,

488
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,880
but I could only watch Nanyuan

489
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
fall into the water

490
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
before I did.

491
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,880
She was

492
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
completely submerged.

493
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
I killed her.

494
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
I killed her.

495
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Are you okay, Dacheng?

496
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Are you okay?

497
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Are you okay?

498
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Sit down.

499
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,880
It's all my fault.

500
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,880
If I hadn't only asked for it that day,

501
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
I wouldn't have been able to

502
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,880
save you.

503
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm sorry.

507
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
I won't do anything

508
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,880
that will cause you to sink.

509
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Who's there?

510
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I'll share a big puzzle with you.

511
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
What's wrong?

512
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,880
Qian, listen to me.

513
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
Gu Wentong is in the hospital.

514
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
What happened?

515
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
He's drowning.

516
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
I heard from Yuan Sen

517
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:02,880
that he has depression.

518
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
He's been taking medicine for more than a year.

519
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,880
He has depression?

520
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
Han Yansheng is still in the hospital.

521
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Call him and ask him what's going on.

522
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
What's wrong?

523
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Han Yansheng,

524
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,880
how is he?

525
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
He's awake.

526
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
But he needs to do a further examination.

527
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,880
By the way, you told me

528
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,880
something important.

529
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
What is it?

530
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,880
We'll talk about it later.

531
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
When will you come back?

532
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
I'm almost there.

533
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
I'll go find you after school.

534
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
You're not feeling well?

535
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,880
I'm fine.

536
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
If you're not feeling well,

537
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,880
go back to work.

538
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm fine.

539
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
I'll call the doctor.

540
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
I just want to see you.

541
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
I'm fine.

542
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
I'll go with you.

543
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
I'll go with you.

544
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
I'll go with you.

545
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
I'll go with you.

546
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Is there anyone who can talk to me?

547
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Especially

548
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,880
someone who has experienced that with me

549
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,880
and has the same feelings.

550
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Mr. An's report is out.

551
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
I have something to do at the cafe.

552
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,880
I'll go first.

553
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
You stay here with Mr. An.

554
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Mr. An, have a good rest.

555
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Okay.

556
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
It's simple.

557
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
I have to stay in the hospital for a while.

558
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,880
Don't wait for me.

559
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,880
It's simple.

560
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,880
How is Gu Wentong?

561
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
He's awake.

562
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,880
He's still in the hospital with him.

563
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,880
No.

564
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Gu Wentong's depression is really happening.

565
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,880
How come you and Dasheng

566
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
fell in love and he's already having it?

567
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Zhichen,

568
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
why haven't I heard about

569
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
your new love story

570
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,880
with Xia Houlin recently?

571
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Don't mention it to me.

572
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
I'm sorry.

573
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,880
You sent a psychological assessment

574
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,880
to the hospital yesterday.

575
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
What did the doctor say?

576
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
It was only today.

577
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
The report is out.

578
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
How did it go?

579
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,880
It's just a mild depression.

580
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,880
The doctor suggested that I stay in the hospital for observation.

581
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
But I think I'm fine now.

582
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,880
Let me see.

583
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,880
I know my own body very well.

584
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
Can you not always

585
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,880
treat me as a patient?

586
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
An Tong,

587
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
don't be nervous.

588
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,880
We don't treat you as a patient.

589
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
If you want to leave the hospital,

590
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
then do it.

591
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
I'll help you with the procedures.

592
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
I'll go with you.

593
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
Han,

594
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I'm still worried about An Tongtong's illness.

595
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,880
Can you ask Uncle Han

596
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,880
to find some foreign experts?

597
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,880
Okay.

598
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
I'll do it.

599
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,880
Shizi,

600
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
good news.

601
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
My dad found one of the most

602
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
authoritative experts

603
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
in international depression.

604
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Professor Wu Yaoxin.

605
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
He's going to be in China soon.

606
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
He's going to hold a lecture

607
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
at Qingning University in a few days.

608
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
That's great.

609
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
I'll buy the tickets now.

610
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Han, I'm in the capital.

611
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Don't worry.

612
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Everything is going well.

613
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
I'm just a little worried about An Tong.

614
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Don't worry.

615
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm here.

616
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Hello?

617
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
An Tong?

618
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
Hello?

619
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Han,

620
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm here.

621
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
I'm here.

622
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Han,

623
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
I'm here.

624
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
Han,

625
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm here.

626
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
Han,

627
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
I'm here.

628
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
Han,

629
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
I'm here.

630
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm here.

631
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
Han,

632
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
I'm here.

633
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,880
An Tong,

634
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,880
I heard your voice on my phone.

635
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
I think something was wrong.

636
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,800
It's out of power.

637
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,960
It's turned off automatically.

638
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,000
That's good.

639
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,760
What's wrong?

640
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,280
I just felt a little...

641
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,160
a little annoyed.

642
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,760
Let me help you.

643
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,880
National Day Announcement

644
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,520
Where are you?

645
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,640
Are you at the library?

646
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Something came up.

647
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,240
I can't go to the library.

648
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,800
I'll take you there next time.

649
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,680
OK?

650
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
OK then.

651
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,760
Sheng.

652
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,120
Do you want coffee?

653
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,240
I'll go buy it.

654
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,400
No need.

655
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,840
Hello?

656
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,120
Are you done, Jian Deng?

657
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,080
I'm done.

658
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,400
Group B, what's wrong with you?

659
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,960
I have a stomachache. I want to vomit.

660
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,600
Do you want to go to the hospital?

661
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,440
No.

662
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,040
I might have been too cold and drunk last night.

663
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:43,640
You...

664
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,640
I'll go to the hospital with you.

665
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,440
No.

666
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,360
Take care of yourself.

667
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,800
I have to go to the climbing club.

668
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,760
Call me if you need anything.

669
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,720
I know.

670
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,360
You don't have to train today.

671
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,520
Why are you here?

672
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,280
You're here too.

673
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,760
You're free.

674
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,720
Why don't you train together?

675
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,600
I'm single.

676
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
I'm not like you.

677
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,520
I have a boyfriend.

678
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,720
But I still come here to train.

679
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,400
Look at Mi Fen and Yuan Sen.

680
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,680
They're tired of each other.

681
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,040
I suspect that you had a fake relationship.

682
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,280
I also suspect that I had a fake boyfriend.

683
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,040
Han Yingsheng went to accompany Gu Wentong again?

684
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:36,880
It's a long story.

685
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,280
Just tell me. I'm not afraid of you.

686
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,880
She has some special feeling?

687
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,480
You're really well-behaved and exploring her.

688
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,080
You dance well all day.

689
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,520
Aren't you sleepy?

690
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,200
Yes.

691
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,640
Hi.

692
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,640

Please hand it over to Mr. Han.

695
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,920
You joined the netball club?

Hold on.

699
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,680
It's still early.

700
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,920
Do you want to watch a movie together?

701
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,400
I want to go back to the dorm and have a rest.
