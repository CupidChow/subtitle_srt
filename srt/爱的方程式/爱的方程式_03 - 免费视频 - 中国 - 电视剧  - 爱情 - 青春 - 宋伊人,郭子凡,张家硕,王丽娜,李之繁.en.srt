Han Yansheng?

15
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,060
I knew it was you.

16
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:01,060
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:01,258 --> 00:02:02,620
Don't play dumb.

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,860
What's with the attitude?

19
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,777
Do you think I wanted to come
to this concert with you?

20
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:17,140
Just leave if you want to.
Don't block the view.

21
00:02:17,177 --> 00:02:19,280
Right. Don't come
if you're unable to appreciate it.

22
00:02:19,288 --> 00:02:21,088
What's the point of coming up
just to leave?

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,860
The performance has already started.

24
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,860
If you leave now,

25
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:28,380
you'll just disturb everyone.

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,300
It's also disrespectful
to the musicians.

27
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,380
Still here?

28
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,020
For you to fall asleep
at such a classy concert,

29
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,860
what a waste of something so precious.

30
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,439
I wouldn't be this exhausted

31
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,090
if you didn't constantly
order me around.

32
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,740
Why didn't you wake me

33
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,780
when the concert ended?

34
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,940
She's exhausted.
Let her sleep a little longer.

35
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,420
You can wake her
after you're done cleaning up.

36
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,100
Do I know you that well?

37
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,980
Glad to hear you say that. See you.

38
00:04:26,604 --> 00:04:27,180
Wait.

39
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,152
Where did you get that bike?

40
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,900
Over there.

41
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,300
But tough luck.

42
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,460
It's the last one.

43
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,700
Just my luck.

44
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,260
Seeing how miserable you look,

45
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,020
I'll give you a ride.

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,580
Hop on.

47
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,288
I don't need your pity.

48
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,420
Suit yourself.

49
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,860
Last chance,

50
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:07,860
are you coming or not?

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,540
I'd rather walk until sunrise

52
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,020
than get on that bike with you.

53
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,660
Slow down! You're going too fast!

54
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:22,576
You dress like a lady.

55
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,777
But behaves like a tomboy.

56
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,111
You're doing this on purpose!

57
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,900
Jian Dan, listen.

58
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,933
What happened today stays between us!

59
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,622
Don't tell anyone at school.

60
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,331
I'll think about it.

61
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,500
What's there to think about?

62
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,020
Helmet. Give me the helmet!

63
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,380
Slow down! Watch it!

64
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,220
Speed bump ahead!

65
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:39,940
Hey, slow down!

66
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,900
Okay, easy. Easy...

67
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,860
That wasn't exactly a fun ride.

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,088
But thank you for giving me a ride.

69
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,780
Don't give me concert tickets
ever again.

70
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,540
Your scholarship

71
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,940
is for studying.

72
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:10,511
Even if you give me another one,

73
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,860
I won't go.

74
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,340
When did I give you a ticket?

75
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,288
Drop the act.

76
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,703
I found it under the photo frame,

77
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,020
next to the broken trophy.

78
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,711
And we were sitting next to each other.

79
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,820
So, who else could have put it there?

80
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,580
Jian Dan.

81
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,620
This is for tonight's 8 PM concert.

82
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,420
Take a moment to relax

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,555
and clear your head.

84
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,260
I didn't earn this.

85
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,940
Besides, that ticket is expensive.

86
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,500
You should go.

87
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
We're classmates and roommates.

88
00:06:43,423 --> 00:06:44,820
If you don't take it,

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,311
it means you're still mad
about the hair dye thing.

90
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,900
Jian Dan, just take it.

91
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,660
Those tickets are hard to get.

92
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,140
Since Yue Tangtang is so generous,

93
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
you might as well go

94
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,380
and enjoy yourself.

95
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,180
All right then. Thanks.

96
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,311
So it really wasn't you?

97
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,879
Please, like I would waste
my scholarship

98
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,700
on something so dumb.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,480
And I'd never buy a ticket for someone
arrogant, smug, and self-obsessed.

100
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,900
If you hate me that much,

101
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,300
why are you still in the Swimming Club?

102
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,500
Quit then!

103
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:26,580
Then I'll quit!

104
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,220
Yue Tangtang, you set me up!

105
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,977
What are you talking about?

106
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Quit pretending!

107
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,420
You broke Han Yansheng's trophy

108
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,019
when you tried to give him the ticket.

109
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,390
You were scared he'd find out,
so you skipped the concert.

110
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,590
Then you gave the ticket to me,
so I'd take the fall.

111
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,860
Am I right?

112
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,620
Yue Tangtang,
you gave Jian Dan the ticket

113
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,809
because of that?

114
00:08:06,049 --> 00:08:07,423
I did not!

115
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,580
I gave it to you out of kindness.
How could you accuse me?

116
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,220
And do you even have proof

117
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,688
about that broken trophy?

118
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,300
The ticket Han Yansheng had

119
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,300
is the best proof!

120
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:19,300
Even if you deny it,

121
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:20,620
Han Yansheng and I both know

122
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,540
you did it.

123
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:22,820
Han Yansheng?

124
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,442
Besides the trophy,

125
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:27,460
you're the one who swapped
my apology letter

126
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,844
for his meme, aren't you?

127
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,494
It wasn't me.

128
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,820
Don't lie.

129
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,797
That day, just Mi Fen, you, and I were

130
00:08:34,858 --> 00:08:35,740
in the dorm.

131
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,500
It's just your theory.

132
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,577
Where's your proof?

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,220
That's easy.

134
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,911
There are only a few places on campus

135
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:43,755
that print photos.

136
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:44,900
I'll just ask around.

137
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,380
So what if it was me?

138
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,088
This all started because of you.

139
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:52,666
I wouldn't have quit the Swimming Club

140
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,711
if it weren't for you!

141
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,060
You little pest! You're such a pain!

142
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,980
You don't have to like me.

143
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,700
But you don't get to frame me.

144
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,700
I let the past slide.

145
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:07,860
But if you come after me again,

146
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,755
don't blame me for fighting back.

147
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:11,300
Do you think I'm scared of you?

148
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,460
What did you say? I'll...

149
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,860
Jian Dan, where are you going?

150
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,020
To the library.

151
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,420
Aren't you going to the pool?

152
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm not going anymore.

153
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,432
Excuse me, can I borrow your phone?

154
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,220
Sure.

155
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,260
Thank you.

156
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,940
Hello, Grandma?

157
00:10:14,807 --> 00:10:17,100
Jian Dan, what's wrong with your phone?

158
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:19,540
It's off.

159
00:10:19,777 --> 00:10:21,540
Plus, the signal's really bad
in the dorm.

160
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,900
So I miss a lot of calls.

161
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:24,200
But don't worry, I'm fine.

162
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,180
Are you getting along
with your classmates?

163
00:10:27,771 --> 00:10:30,100
They love the snacks you made.

164
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,620
What about your club activities?

165
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,620
Club activities?

166
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:36,340
Wow, you know about it?

167
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,740
I joined the Swimming Club.

168
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:41,540
I'm the fastest girl on the team.

169
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,660
Everyone likes me a lot.

170
00:10:43,814 --> 00:10:45,500
Do you have enough money to spend?

171
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,420
I have enough.

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,688
Just take care of yourself, okay?

173
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,060
All right.

174
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,140
I'm still in the library.

175
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,460
So I have to go.
I'll talk to you next time.

176
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:55,300
Okay.

177
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,340
Thank you.

178
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,820
(Apartment 17)

179
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,620
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

180
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,260
Han, what are you doing?

181
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,577
Did you get a new phone?

182
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:18,377
Is Yue Tangtang in the same department
as Jian Dan?

183
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,020
Same department and same dorm.

184
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,800
Send me her number.

185
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:25,980
Now.

186
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,860
Why do you need it?

187
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,340
Who's this?

188
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,460
It's me, Han Yansheng.

189
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,377
Han Yansheng?

190
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,020
Why are you calling me?

191
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,900
Put Jian Dan on.

192
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:07,780
Jian Dan?

193
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,977
Let her take the call.

194
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,133
I need to talk to her.

195
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,340
Jian Dan, quit pooping
and take this call!

196
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,820
You're...

197
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,420
Who's that?

198
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,666
Write me a Club Withdrawal Application.

199
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
Minimum 3,000 words.

200
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,540
What?

201
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,940
A 3,000-word withdrawal letter?

202
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,220
Why don't you go eat dirt...

203
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,180
Jian Dan, what did Han Yansheng want?

204
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,953
I already quit the club,

205
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,420
and now he wants a 3,000-word essay?

206
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,793
Is he crazy?

207
00:14:48,866 --> 00:14:49,820
When you go talk to him,

208
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,580
I'll come with you.

209
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,222
Give it back to me.

210
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,540
Why did he call me to find you?

211
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,500
A 3,000-word withdrawal letter...

212
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,488
How am I even supposed to write that?

213
00:15:20,244 --> 00:15:22,333
Here is the 3,000-word
withdrawal letter you wanted.

214
00:15:22,377 --> 00:15:23,600
Not one more, not one less.

215
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,060
Not good enough. Rewrite it.

216
00:15:26,866 --> 00:15:29,577
How can you say it's not good enough
when you didn't even read it?

217
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,288
I have the final say.

218
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:32,820
You're not officially out

219
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,140
until it's approved.

220
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:34,900
You...

221
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,700
Approved or not,

222
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,790
(Club Withdrawal Application)
I'm not coming back.

223
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,777
Stop right there!

224
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,820
Is there anything else?

225
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,020
For you.

226
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,422
Why are you giving me a phone?

227
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,420
I broke yours the other day.

228
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,100
Take this one for now.

229
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,300
No, thanks.

230
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,540
Do you still want
to keep dragging this out with me?

231
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,288
Who said I want anything to do with you?

232
00:16:11,266 --> 00:16:12,780
Or do you just want a new phone?

233
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,000
Fine. I'll use it for now.

234
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,977
But I will pay you back gradually.

Jian Dan, let's eat. I'm starving.

250
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,700
Break time!

251
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,580
Han, have a drink.

252
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,660
Something feels missing
without Jian Dan around.

253
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,700
I'm off to class.

254
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,420
I'll leave the rest
of the training to you.

255
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:39,400
Hey, Han, you can't just...

256
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,820
Han is cold-blooded.

257
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:55,540
(Gu Entong:
Shi, I'm coming back.)

258
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,740
Electives start next week.

259
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,820
Mi Fen, what class did you sign up for?

260
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,860
Film Appreciation.

261
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,460
We only watch movies,

262
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,190
write a few reflections,
and take no exams.

263
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,380
Pretty smart, right?

264
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,900
What did you pick?

265
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,860
Applied Math.

266
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,740
What? You picked Applied Math?

267
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,173
It has high credit hours.

268
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:27,213
I know that.

269
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:28,540
But haven't you heard?

270
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,260
Professor Wang teaches that course.
He's a total nightmare.

271
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,444
He has the highest fail rate
in the whole university.

272
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,060
Every year, he fails so many students

273
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,460
who took his classes.

274
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,860
Is it really that bad?

275
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,540
There is even worse.

276
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,260
One year, the dean talked
to him about it,

277
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,820
and he said,

278
00:20:43,888 --> 00:20:45,420
"How dare you treat me like this?

279
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,860
I'll make the course even harder."

280
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,380
And he did.

281
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,933
How hard are we talking?

282
00:20:50,006 --> 00:20:52,140
The passing rate dropped to 10%.

283
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,780
That's a real nightmare.

284
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,780
I can't believe

285
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,640
people still bring up

286
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,180
ancient history like that.

287
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,020
Professor Wang,

288
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,466
she's a first-year psych student
who is at the bottom of the class.

289
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,844
- Professor Wang, hello.
- Professor Wang, hello.

290
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,311
Professor Wang, thank you
for explaining it to me.

291
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,340
I don't have any more questions.

292
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,100
Stop right there.

293
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,060
About what you said earlier,
that data is wrong.

294
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,540
The passing rate wasn't 10%.

295
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,820
It was 5%.

296
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,666
There were 61 students in the class.

297
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,380
Only three students passed.

298
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,780
Jian Dan, he is terrifying.

299
00:21:45,826 --> 00:21:47,460
Do you still want to take Applied Math?

300
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,820
Well, there is still a 5% chance
of passing.

301
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
You're seriously amazing.

302
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,780
I can't help but admire you.

303
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,900
I am doomed.

304
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,120
(Your final grades now depend
more on club involvement.)

305
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,929
What's it?

306
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,500
To get students more involved

307
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,780
in club activities,

308
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,460
the university increases

309
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,700
club involvement in final grades.

310
00:22:07,822 --> 00:22:10,377
What are you going to do
about your club activities now?

311
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,180
Won't it affect your scholarship?

312
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,486
Do you think
Han Yansheng will kick me out

313
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,260
if I go back to the Swimming Club?

314
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,220
He won't.

315
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,620
Because he would never let you back in.

316
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,460
I was messing with you.

317
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,333
If the Swimming Club doesn't want you,

318
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:29,240
you can join another one.

319
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,186
The recruitment is over.

320
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,033
No club is accepting new members now.

321
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,773
Yes, regular clubs don't accept

322
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,500
new members now.

323
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,260
What if it's a new club?

324
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,540
Check the school forum later.

325
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,177
Maybe you'll get lucky.

326
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,526
Starting a new club?

327
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,380
Our Cosplay Club

328
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,420
was only formed last semester.

329
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,900
What are you thinking?

330
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,060
Sorry,

331
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,380
your application
to start the Rock Climbing Club

332
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,660
has been rejected.

333
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,340
That area is currently managed
by the Swimming Club.

334
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,733
You will need authorization

335
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,340
from the club president, Han Yansheng.

336
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,177
Am I supposed to go plead with him now?

337
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,100
Han Yansheng!

338
00:23:44,155 --> 00:23:45,380
This is a training facility.

339
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,860
No unauthorized entry.

340
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:50,177
(Club Authorization Application)
I need to talk to you.

341
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,900
I have class. No time.

342
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,260
Monkey.

343
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,340
Hey, Jian Dan.

344
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,140
But I...

345
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,180
That's what Han is like.

346
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,740
Don't take it personally.

347
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,660
I'm off to my elective class.

348
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,380
Why is it always me?

349
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,180
Han Yansheng.

350
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,580
Here's your book back.

351
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,420
Thanks.

352
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,760
Why are you following me?

353
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,580
I'm not.

354
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,740
I have class here.

355
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,140
What do you want?

356
00:24:44,822 --> 00:24:46,888
(Club Authorization Application)
Please sign this

357
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,377
and return the second-floor space
to the Rock Climbing Club.

358
00:24:51,111 --> 00:24:52,540
The Rock Climbing Club was disbanded.

359
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,620
Exactly.

360
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,420
But the moment you sign this,

361
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,380
we can revive it.

362
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,100
Wait, you're starting
a Rock Climbing Club?

363
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,260
All that's missing is the venue.

364
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,060
Stop wasting your time.

365
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,540
I'm not signing.

366
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,460
That space originally belonged

367
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,900
to the Rock Climbing Club.

368
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,940
The pool
was just managing it temporarily.

369
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,020
Now, we're reviving the club.

370
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,700
It's only fair to return it.

371
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,660
Why won't you sign?

372
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,955
Since I'm managing it now,

373
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,940
I get to decide who uses it.

374
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,660
And

375
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,380
you're not on my list.

376
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,700
This is personal, isn't it?

377
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:31,022
I don't care what you think.

378
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,940
Then what do I have to do

379
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,220
to get your signature?

380
00:25:38,355 --> 00:25:39,288
The class is starting.

381
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:45,888
(Chapter One: The Limit)

382
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,060
That's all for today's lecture.

383
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Here's my email.

384
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,820
If you have any questions,

385
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,500
feel free to reach out.

386
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,140
Now, can we talk?

387
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,940
Please excuse me.

388
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:10,688
The authorization form.

389
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,380
Let me see.

390
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,380
(Club Authorization Application)

391
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,980
Han.

392
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,900
Han, you're finally here.

393
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,060
Shi has been wearing me out.

394
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,480
You've been planning this
for a while, huh?

395
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:01,300
Isn't it obvious?

396
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,540
Shi always puts in effort
when it comes to Entong.

397
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,355
You'll have to wait a little longer.

398
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:06,190
Entong is on her way.

399
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,460
She's here.

400
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,340
Long time no see, guys.

401
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,355
It's been a while.

402
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,140
Look at her.

403
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,300
Still as gorgeous as ever.

404
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,673
Welcome back.

405
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:41,940
Thank you.

406
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:43,906
I missed you guys so much

407
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,913
while I was on exchange.

408
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,446
It looks like all this

409
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,340
is for me, huh?

410
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,780
Shi handled it all.

411
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,380
We wouldn't dare take credit.

412
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,100
Shi, thanks.

413
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,100
I'm glad you like it.

414
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:05,780
Oh,

415
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,340
I've prepared this for you too.

416
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,454
(Ocean University Life Guide)

417
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,420
"Ocean University Life Guide?"

418
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,726
I've only been gone a year.
It's not necessary.

419
00:28:14,066 --> 00:28:16,060
A lot has changed
at Ocean University in a year.

420
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,380
There is a new cafeteria,

421
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,380
and the piano rooms have moved.

422
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
Then I have to check this out.

423
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,300
Pasta is on the new cafeteria's
third floor.

424
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,300
Sushi is on the second floor
of the old one.

425
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:32,888
Milk tea is on the 1st floor
of the new cafeteria.

426
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,820
These are all my favorites.

427
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,753
And the new piano room

428
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,460
is in Room 203 of the music building.

429
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,780
This is exactly what I need.

430
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,340
Shi, you're so thoughtful.

431
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
Glad you like it.

432
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,900
I love it.

433
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,420
I don't see Yuan Sen around.

434
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,260
Where is he?

435
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,044
He stepped out for something.

436
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,860
All right. Tell me.

437
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,260
How has everyone been

438
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,340
while I was gone?

439
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:01,700
Same old.

440
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,540
But lately, we've met

441
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,860
someone pretty interesting.

442
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,533
Oh? Who?

443
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,066
Just someone totally irrelevant.

444
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:10,244
