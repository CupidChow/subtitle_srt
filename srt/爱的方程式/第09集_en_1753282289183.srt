1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,680
Slowly growing

3
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,880
She is a flower that is fragrant

4
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,160
Will it be afraid?

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,960
Zipadiya

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,760
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
Only thinking

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
Will melt like a smile

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
Zipadiya

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,480
The one who is clear

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,160
She who loves

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,800
Will answer with a smile

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,360
Zipadiya

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,320
The one who is clear

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,440
She who loves

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Will answer with a smile

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Zipadiya

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,400
The one who is clear

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,440
She who loves

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,400
Will answer with a smile

22
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,360
Zipadiya

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,560
The one who is clear

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
She who loves

25
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,560
Will answer with a smile

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,520
Zipadiya

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
The one who is clear

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,520
Will answer with a smile

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,560

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,560
Will answer with a smile

Zipadiya

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,280
What are you doing here?

34
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,400
Monkey is really good

35
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I'll give you the question

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,120
I don't know who

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
In this special day

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Learned a problem of solving the question

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
Really stupid

40
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,520
That's better than someone already

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Have a boyfriend and still come to solve

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,240
What boyfriend

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
Whose boyfriend

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Forget it

45
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,200
Just treat it as a daily meal

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I don't know what you are talking about

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,440
Zipadiya

48
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
It's really you

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,440
Zipadiya

50
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
The one who is clear

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Will answer with a smile

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,440

Will answer with a smile

55
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440

56
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
The one who is clear

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Will answer with a smile

58
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
The one who is clear

60
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
Will answer with a smile

61
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Zipadiya

62
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
The one who is clear

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Zipadiya

64
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
He has something to go out

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Call him later

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,680
Who are you

67
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
You are

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Hello

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I am the grandmother of Jian Dan

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Grandmother

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Grandmother

72
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Hello grandmother

73
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,720
That one

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,720
Jian Dan just had something to go out

75
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,720
He went out

76
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,720
He is back

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,720
I will let him listen

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
You answer

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Jian Dan

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I am the grandmother

81
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
Who is the one who just answered the phone

82
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,720
Is it your new boyfriend

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,720
No no

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
No no grandmother you misunderstood

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,720
He is not my boyfriend

86
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
We are just ordinary classmates

87
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
I am still in the library

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
I am still in the library

89
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
I will be in the hall

90
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Bye bye

91
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Why did you answer my phone

92
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
Your phone is always ringing

93
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,720
It has affected everyone's learning

94
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,720
Then you can turn it off

95
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Does grandmother think I am her boyfriend

96
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Didn't you find a boyfriend

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Of course not

98
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Who told you I have a boyfriend

99
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
You said it yourself last night

100
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
You said you were going on a date

101
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Date

102
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
Is it necessary to be a boyfriend

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,720
We are here together

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
It's a date

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
So the one you said

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Good math, beautiful writing

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
And the one who has a common topic with you

108
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Is not your boyfriend

109
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Of course not

110
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
I am not

111
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Of course not

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
He is my boyfriend

113
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
You should have said it earlier

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
If you had said it earlier

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
It won't cause so many misunderstandings

116
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
You are so mean

117
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Please come in

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
This is where you work

119
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,720
This is so professional

120
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Yuan Sen

121
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I have prepared two clothes for you

122
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
I will go back to work

123
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
For you

124
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,720
Are you going to take a photo with me

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Isn't this your wish

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Qian Tan, I really love you

127
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Yes, it's my wish

128
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
This is Yue Luo's clothes

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Mine is Lin Xi

130
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
How do you know I like this pair of god's couple

131
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
I saw her in your circle of friends

132
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
I like their love story the most

133
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Because Lin Xi is a typical

134
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Love-hate relationship

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
She can be an enemy to the whole army

136
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
For Yue Luo

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Go change your clothes

138
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I am sorry

139
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720

I am sorry

157
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
I am sorry

158
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,720
I am sorry

159
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720

I am sorry

163
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I am sorry

164
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I am sorry

165
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I am sorry

166
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I am sorry

167
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
I am sorry

168
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
I am sorry

169
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
I am sorry

170
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
I am sorry

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I am sorry

172
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I am sorry

I am sorry

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I am sorry

183
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
I am sorry

184
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I am sorry

185
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
I am sorry

186
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,720
I am sorry

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Take it slow

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Okay

189
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Here you come

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,320
Give you.

191
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,280
Here.

192
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,720
Again.

193
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
Niu Jiaаз.

194
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,840
Jian dan !

195
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,800
You killed me !

196
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,840
What's almost happened?

197
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,020
I tell you,

198
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,220
Today is the happiest day I've ever had.

199
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,320
Woo-hoo !

200
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,560
You and Luo Shui

201
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
are in love?

202
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,400
By the way,

203
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,800
have you fulfilled your wish?

204
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,120
What wish?

205
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,120
I wrote to you to meet my best friend.

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,280
Don't mention it.

207
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,280
I haven't met my best friend.

208
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
But I met Han Yansheng.

209
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
He pissed me off.

210
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
Han Yansheng?

211
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,080
What's going on?

212
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,000
Tell me the details.

213
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,680
I want to hear it.

214
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
I just washed it.

215
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,120
Say it.

216
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,800
Have you written your question?

217
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Did you write it?

218
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,560
I didn't write it.

219
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,400
Is it important?

220
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,400
I just wrote it.

221
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,440
I just wrote it.

222
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
I just wrote it.

223
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,440
I just wrote it.

224
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,320
I just wrote it.

225
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,760
Is it important to write it?

226
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Just fulfill your wish.

227
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,360
Why is the note on it

228
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
the same as the note on my paper?

229
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,280
All the numbers are the same

230
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
in your eyes.

231
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,880
You're right.

232
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,360
It's all the same anyway.

233
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,920
When new duties occur,

234
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,320
it's better to do it

235
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
by the inertia of exercise.

236
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,120
I'm so tired these days

237
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,280
and I still don't want to waste time on studying.

238
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,600
If I could only get some sleep,

239
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
I might as well

240
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,400
readnot once a week or twice a week.

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,840
Change like operations can't be Selbst suffered!

242
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,840
I don't understand.

243
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,480
Now,

244
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
before class,

245
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,360
I have a good news to announce.

246
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,120
The paper of the simple class

247
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,640
has been officially passed

248
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,120
by the magazine's review.

249
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,360
It can be published.

250
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,400
Congratulations to the simple class.

251
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,800
Okay, now we're going to class.

252
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,600
Congratulations.

253
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,480
Thanks to your help.

254
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,520
Thanks.

255
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,600
How to thank you?

256
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,560
Dad.

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I have a good news to tell you.

258
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,160
What?

259
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,680
My paper

260
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,880
has been officially published.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,760
Really?

262
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,960
That's great.

263
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,080
You're so good.

264
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,000
Give me a kiss.

265
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,760
It's really not the right time.

266
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,040
Who?

267
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,480
What?

268
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,600
What's wrong?

269
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
What's wrong with you?

270
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,320
Scream!

271
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,320
It's not a crime.

272
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,360
It's a food.

273
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
Food.

274
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,640
I like food.

275
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,040
Xia Na.

276
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
When are we going to eat food?

277
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,920
You guess.

278
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,280
I think you've been fat recently.

279
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,200
It's time to lose weight.

280
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Food doesn't suit you.

281
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,280
Really?

282
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,440
You lied to me.

283
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,400
Yuan Sen.

284
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,000
Follow me.

285
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,800
Support me. Hurry.

286
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,200
I'm following you.

287
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,840
Hurry.

288
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,320
No.

289
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,120
I'm going to hang up.

290
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
I'm going to die.

291
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,680
I'm dead.

292
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm still here.

293
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
Han is in a good mood recently.

294
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,520
I don't know what's going on.

295
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,560
Han.

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,720
Han.

297
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,840
The phone.

298
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,600
I'm sorry.

299
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm going to Nanshan Restaurant at six o'clock tomorrow night.

300
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,360
Are you okay?

301
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,840
Okay.

302
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
5.30 p.m.

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
See you downstairs.

304
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,840
It's okay.

305
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,760
Let me.

306
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,800
Are you having a date?

307
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,120
It's one hour after getting dressed.

308
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,120
Is it that long?

309
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
for a meal outside.

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
It's not a date.

311
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,160
It can't be that casual.

312
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,880
Is there a problem?

313
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,160
Of course.

314
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,600
How can you eat out with Xiao Cao?

315
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,560
Come here.

316
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,280
This one.

317
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:46,880
This one is fine.

318
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,280
You can wear it yourself.

319
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,920
Fan Er,

320
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,960
are you sure I'll look good in this?

321
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,600
Of course.

322
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
You have to trust my taste.

323
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,600
Let me tell you.

324
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,280
My taste

325
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,240
is the best with this JK uniform.

326
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,600
Your little face

327
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,640
is the best for everyone.

328
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm downstairs of your dorm.

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:27,640
Jiang Dan,

330
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
I have something to do.

331
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,960
Send me a photo after you're done.

332
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,360
Jiang Sen.

333
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,840
What are you doing here?

334
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
I'm passing by.

335
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,760
Yifan,

336
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
where's Jiang Dan?

337
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,640
He's upstairs.

338
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,040
I'll call him for you.

339
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm leaving.

340
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:45,880
I'm leaving.

341
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,160
Why are you here?

342
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,800
Didn't we meet at the restaurant?

343
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm passing by.

344
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
Where did you talk to 난 you going?

345
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,560
Lui reports.

346
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,800
I'm scared.

347
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,600
Argh!

348
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
I...

349
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I'll still have to keep my mouth shut.

350
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,320
Lui.

351
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
That's right.

352
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Jonas.

353
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,320
It is...

354
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,000
Jonas.

355
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,920
I met this person today once.

356
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:14,520
Let's go.

357
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,680
What are you doing?

358
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm riding a public transportation.

359
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,640
It's green, environmentally friendly and inexpensive.

360
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,200
And

361
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,040
when we came back from the concert last time,

362
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
we rode this.

363
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,040
Are you sure you can afford it today?

364
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,360
Then let's take a taxi.

365
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,000
The cost of the human resources in that restaurant is quite high.

366
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Are you sure you'll have money to pay for it later?

367
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,760
Or do you want to eat the king's food?

368
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,280
Eat the king's food.

369
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,040
Sit down.

370
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,400
What's going on?

371
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,840
What's going on?

372
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,560
I'm calling a taxi.

373
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,560
Ahem.

374
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,560
They ate it themselves?

375
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier that you called for a flat tire?

376
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If I told you,

377
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
you would still do it.

378
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
If that's the case,

379
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
I'd rather share an electric car.

380
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Let's go.

381
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Here's your snail noodles.

382
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Thank you.

383
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,480
I ordered two bowls of snail noodles for you.

384
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Thank you.

385
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Here you go.

386
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Let me open it.

387
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,720
This is so delicate.

388
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Here you go.

389
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,480
He's so handsome.

390
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,240
You can only finish the photo

391
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
in a week.

392
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
I'll give it to you then.

393
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Welcome.

394
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Hello, do you have an appointment?

395
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Hello, I'm Jian.

396
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I made an appointment in advance.

397
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
What you ordered is seafood with sauce.

398
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
There are two servings.

399
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
This way, please.

400
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
Thank you.

401
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
You didn't give it to me on purpose.

402
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I ordered two bowls of snail noodles.

403
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,480
Did you meet your friend?

404
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
After he made an appointment with me,

405
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
he was so happy.

406
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,480
What kind of person do you think he is?

407
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
He's smart,

408
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
smart,

409
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
and a little mysterious.

410
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,480
He's also very handsome.

411
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,480
But he's not a good person.

412
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
He's not a good person.

413
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
He's not a good person.

414
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
But

415
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
he's not a good person.

416
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,480
How do you know his personality?

417
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
After he made an appointment last time,

418
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
he didn't even explain anything.

419
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Then he was so quiet.

420
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,480
It can be seen that he's a man of his word.

421
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,480
He's very irresponsible.

422
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Isn't it because of you?

423
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,480
What do you ask me about?

424
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
I guess he didn't explain it

425
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,480
because he couldn't contact you.

426
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
I gave him a contact method.

427
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
Why can't I contact him?

428
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Maybe he didn't see it at all.

429
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Maybe.

430
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Thank you.

431
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I'll keep it well.

432
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
About the question you asked me last time,

433
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
my answer is

434
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
yes.

435
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,480
Yes.

436
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,480
I can.

437
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Okay.

438
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
He means he's willing to be my friend.

439
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,480
Yes.

440
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Yes.

441
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,480
Yes.

442
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Yes.

443
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,480
Yes.

444
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Yes.

445
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
Yes.

446
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
Yes.

447
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
Yes.

448
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Yes.

449
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
Yes.

450
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Yes.

451
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
Yes.

452
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Yes.

453
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
Yes.

454
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Yes.

455
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
Yes.

456
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
Table No. 6.

457
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,480
Pay the bill.

458
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Wait a minute.

459
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,480
Table No. 6

460
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
is the best meal we've ever had.

461
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
You don't need to pay.

462
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
Best meal?

463
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Our restaurant

464
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
is doing activities on the app.

465
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
You've been chosen by us.

466
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
So you don't need to pay.

467
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
So

468
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
we really had a great meal today.

469
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Is the best meal

470
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
including the wine?

471
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
This is the best champagne

472
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
in our restaurant.

473
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
It's very fragrant.

474
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Can I open it now?

475
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Wait.

476
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
I...

477
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm allergic to alcohol.

478
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
I'm allergic to alcohol.

479
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I can't drink.

480
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
It's okay.

481
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'll drink.

482
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
You have class tomorrow.

483
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,480
I don't have class tomorrow.

484
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
How about

485
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
we drink beer?

486
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Beer and self-sufficient food are good.

487
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
We have black beer in our restaurant.

488
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,480
It's specially imported from Germany.

489
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Drinking beer makes me feel so hungry.

490
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
Table No. 2.

491
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Table No. 2.

492
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
You don't want a drink?

493
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,480
This is 698 yuan.

494
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
I'll have a drink.

495
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Thank you for the dinner.

496
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
You're welcome.

497
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
Table No. 6.

498
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Pay the bill.

499
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,480
Table No. 6

500
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
is the best meal in our restaurant.

501
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,480
You don't need to pay.

502
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Didn't we order

503
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,480
a bottle of champagne?

504
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
The gentleman who was with you

505
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
just now has paid the bill.

506
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
You're messing with me.

507
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
You said you'd treat me to dinner.

508
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
It turned out to be the best meal.

509
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Don't underestimate the best meal.

510
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
It's hard to get.

511
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Especially that seafood restaurant.

512
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
It's very delicious.

513
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,480
It's very delicious.

514
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
It's very delicious.

515
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Actually, that seafood restaurant

516
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,480
is the cheapest.

517
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:51,880
The rate of

518
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,480
I'll make it up to you.

519
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,480
It's almost the same here.

520
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,480
The school opens on weekends.

521
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Our swimming club is responsible for

522
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
some students and parents.

523
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
And the person who...

524
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
No problem.

525
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
I'll help you.

526
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
Hello, sir.

527
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm a volunteer.

528
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
Please fill in the survey form

529
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
for me in a minute.

530
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,480
Okay.

531
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,480
Hi.

532
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
You have good taste.

533
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
This pair of shoes

534
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
is on sale now.

535
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
It's only 299 yuan after the sale.

536
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Do you want to buy one pair?

537
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
When will our discount

538
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
end?

539
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
Today is the last day of the activity.

540
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I'll take a look.

541
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Thank you.

542
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
You're welcome.

543
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Thank you.

544
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Thank you.

545
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
Thank you.

546
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Thank you.

547
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Thank you.

548
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Thank you.

549
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Thank you.

550
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,480
Thank you.

551
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,480
Sure.

552
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:48,960
You can have the money and the

553
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
tutor.

554
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
All right?

555
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Thank you.

556
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Thank you.

557
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,960
Thank you.

558
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,960
Thank you.

559
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Thank you.

560
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
Thank you.

561
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Thank you.

562
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,960
Thank you.

563
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,960
Thank you.

564
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,960
Thank you.

565
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:10,920
How many times should I touch my heart from the beginning

566
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Some look, some words, I haven't missed it yet

567
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:25,920
My eyes are red like a poem

568
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:33,040
Those young little things, they are ordinary but interesting

569
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:39,280
In the gap in time, quietly beautiful

570
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,920
Those broken pasts, the vague name

571
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Fortunately, we once had each other

572
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:02,920
Those young days are gone, the heart does not need to be delayed

573
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,920
But one day, the promise becomes a shame

574
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,920
The broken past has never stopped

575
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:25,280
This OH discus of
