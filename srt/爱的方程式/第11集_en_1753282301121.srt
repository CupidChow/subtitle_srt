1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,840
Easy to express

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,000
She is a flower that smells of incense

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,240
Will it be afraid

5
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,400
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,160
Zipadia

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,800
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:55,600
Only thinking

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,200
Will melt

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Zipadia

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,600
The one you love

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,400
Love is complicated

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,000
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,200
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Episode 16

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm coming. I'm coming.

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Why are you so late, Monkey?

18
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,800
Although I'm late,

19
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,200
look who I brought.

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Simple rice noodles?

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Sit down.

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello.

23
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Simple and rice noodles are here too.

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,800
Come with us.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Come, sit together.

26
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Come, Simple, sit with us.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,400
Can I sit here?

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Yes.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,800
Before the entrance examination,

30
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
we have to supervise each other.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,000
No one can be wronged.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Especially you, Monkey.

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,000
I know. I know.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,800
I will try my best.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,600
Monkey, my English is not bad.

36
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
If you have any questions,

37
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
just ask me.

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,400
Okay.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Then my English is up to you.

40
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
No problem.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
I'm coming.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm coming.

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm coming.

44
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm coming.

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm coming.

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm coming.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm coming.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm coming.

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm coming.

50
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I'm coming.

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm coming.

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I'm coming.

53
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
I'm coming.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm coming.

55
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm coming.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
I'm coming.

57
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm coming.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm coming.

59
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,400
I'm coming.

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,400
I'm coming.

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm coming.

62
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,400
I'm coming.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I'm coming.

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm coming.

65
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
I'm coming.

66
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm coming.

67
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
I'm coming.

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I'm coming.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
I'm coming.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Yuan Sen, you're amazing.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,000
You used the form of comics

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,400
to solve the problems.

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,440
It's even more...

74
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,520
I think it's easier to see

75
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,680
if you draw it like this.

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
It's easy to understand.

77
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,920
If you need it,

78
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,800
I have some over there.

79
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,480
I can give it to you.

80
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh my god.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,560
Yansi,

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,760
you've said so many words.

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,240
Are you the Yansi I know?

84
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,040
It's too noisy.

85
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,960
Let's change the place.

86
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,840
Interior innovation

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
classified new life

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,920
Sherry,

89
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,680
I don't think

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
I can type and answer.

91
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
Help me see.

92
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,560
B against a button.

93
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,120
Let me help you.

94
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,640
Okay.

95
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
All of you,

96
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,280
you're here.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,680
You're here.

98
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Okay.

99
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,480
I see.

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,240
Let's go.

101
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,800
En Tong, what did you want to say?

102
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,880
I wanted to say

103
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,520
I want to drink with you.

104
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,000
Take the bill.

105
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,920
It's open.

106
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,360
Okay.

107
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,440
Why are you standing there?

108
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,040
What color do you want?

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Black.

110
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,360
I...

111
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,080
What kind of music do you like to listen to?

112
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,880
Metal music.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Me too.

114
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,800
What kind of movie do you like to watch?

115
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
A quiet one.

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I like to watch a quiet comic book.

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I don't like action movies.

118
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,240
Me too.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,520
Are you still drunk?

120
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,520
So에서XD

121
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,280
I see.

122
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,080
villagers teacher to failing ones

123
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,200
Write this as the ordinary famous

124
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,040
plural of the street

125
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:16,960
Strawberry

126
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,280
We're going to buy some cupless coffee

127
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,440
The vending machine is there

128
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Foreign?

129
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,440
Foreign math books have

130
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,240
Peter Glass,

131
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Ajimid and Ola.

132
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,800
Which one do you want?

133
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:35,800
None.

134
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,880
Then, domestic math books have

135
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,280
Huaruo Geng,

136
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,040
Zuchong Zhi, Chen Jingrun.

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,600
These math books

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,120
have been written too many times.

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,720
I want to write something special.

140
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,880
For example,

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,320
female math books.

142
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,560
I'll recommend this one to you.

143
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,800
The first female mathematician

144
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,200
in human history,

145
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,960
Seppadia's book.

146
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,920
It records the story of Seppadia

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,160
and his father,

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,360
Ogilide, when they were young.

149
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,800
It also talks about

150
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,480
how he fell in love with math

151
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,160
and how he became a female mathematician.

152
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,120
I like his book very much.

153
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,440
He is my favorite female mathematician.

154
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,480
It sounds good.

155
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,320
Have you read it?

156
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
What a coincidence.

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,200
Remember I told you

158
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,560
that my pen mate

159
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,800
and I are through this math mathematician.

160
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,800
Then, you and your pen mate...

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,920
He is afraid of darkness too.

162
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,160
Oh, no.

163
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,120
My imagination is going to be ruined.

164
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,080
What's up?

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,120
The door is locked.

166
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,560
But I've already called the Department of Defense.

167
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,640
Someone will open the door later.

168
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,680
Hello?

169
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,160
I don't know how long it will take.

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm scared.

171
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,440
I'm scared.

172
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm scared.

173
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,560
I'm scared.

174
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,160
I'm scared.

175
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm scared.

176
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,480
I'm scared.

177
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm scared.

178
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm scared.

179
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm scared.

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,480
I'm scared.

181
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm scared.

182
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,600
I'm scared.

183
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,200
I'm scared.

184
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:49,680
I'm scared.

185
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm scared.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm scared.

187
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm scared.

188
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,200
I'm scared.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm scared.

190
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm scared.

191
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm scared.

192
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,240
I'm scared.

193
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,640
I'm scared.

194
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm scared.

195
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm scared.

196
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm scared.

197
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,120
I'm scared.

198
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,880
I'm scared.

199
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,200
I'm scared.

200
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm scared.

201
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
Okay.

202
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,520
I have a few more questions to do.

203
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,640
I'll go on.

204
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,520
Okay.

205
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
Why is there a button missing?

206
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,760
Did you just ask me to take it off?

207
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,920
It should be here.

208
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,520
No need.

209
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,880
I'll find it myself later.

210
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,640
Write the questions first.

211
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,880
Okay.

212
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,520
Okay.

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,120
What's wrong?

214
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,480
I cried because I was stupid.

215
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,080
Apple?

216
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,320
What's wrong?

217
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Minquality.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,600
I'll fix her husband now.

219
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm doing it first.

220
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,080
Then I'll do the rest.

221
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,240
But,

222
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,360
As a mother of my 3 children,

223
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
usually,

224
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm most important.

225
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
But it's not easy for me to continentally

226
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,440
I'm sorry.

227
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,640
Send someone over.

228
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
You said

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,240
you knew Bill through this book.

230
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
Are you curious

231
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,880
who he is?

232
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,920
Of course I am.

233
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,320
I can't find a Bill who is straight forward.

234
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,640
He left me a call.

235
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,560
But I can't see the last two.

236
00:13:50,720 --> 00:14:15,800
I'll check the basic labels in 가지고.

237
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,840
are you reallyTPH hair strength?

238
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,560
I'm telling you.

239
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,480
It's you.

240
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,240
She is a simple flower

241
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,240
Be brave

242
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,240
She also asked herself

243
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,240
Zipadiya

244
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,240
We are always together

245
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,240
The one who is passionate

246
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Only the summer

247
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Will bloom in the mountains

248
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Zipadiya

249
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Zipadiya

250
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,680
The one who is clear

251
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Love like a wind

252
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
With a smile

253
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Zipadiya

254
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,680
The one who is passionate

255
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Knowing that I am your best friend

256
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Isn't it very lucky?

257
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,680
Why are you so selfish?

258
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,680
But

259
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,120
To be your desire

260
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I feel very lucky

261
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,120
With a smile

262
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Zipadiya

263
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,120
The one who is clear

264
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Love like a wind

265
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,120
With a smile

266
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Zipadiya

267
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,120
The one who is clear

268
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,120
Love like a wind

269
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
With a smile

270
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Zipadiya

271
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,560
Lao Han, do you have any humanity?

272
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
Today is the weekend

273
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
When you hang up, you will know

274
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I have no humanity

275
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
Or the score is not human

276
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
Hello

277
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Hello

278
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
This is the store for the shoes

279
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
You bought a pair of shoes a few days ago

280
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,560
When is it convenient to come and get it?

281
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Ok, I'll go now

282
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
I have something to go out

283
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll let you go first today

284
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hello, I'm here to pick up the goods

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You are Mr. Han, right?

286
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You came last time

287
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No. 36's food is sold out

288
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
We just sent you a pair from other stores

289
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Come, look

290
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Is there any problem?

291
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No problem

292
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hang up

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Ok

294
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Wait a moment

295
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Here you are

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Thank you, young man

297
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You are welcome

298
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Young man

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How do you go to the girls' dorm?

300
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
My granddaughter also studies in this school

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
She is a psychology student

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Have you contacted your granddaughter?

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The school is very big

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If no one takes you there, you may get lost

305
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm sorry

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm sorry

307
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry

308
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm sorry

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm sorry

310
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry

311
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
No

312
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
I want to give her a surprise

313
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Ok, I'll go with you

314
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Thank you so much

315
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Let me do it

316
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Thank you

317
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Go this way

318
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Grandma

319
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
We are not far from here

320
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
This is a new pair of shoes

321
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
It's for delivery

322
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,440
It's a prize for giving your girlfriend's shoes

323
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
It's not a good idea

324
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,880
The farther she goes, the more she runs away

325
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
It's not for giving my girlfriend's shoes

326
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
It's just a normal friend

327
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,880
You give your shoes to a normal friend?

328
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,880
I think you like it and you don't want to show it

329
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Grandma

330
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,880
What's wrong?

331
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Are you feeling unwell?

332
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm old and useless

333
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
I only took a few hours' drive

334
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,880
I feel dizzy

335
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
Let me help you rest

336
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,880
No need

337
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,880
I haven't seen my granddaughter for a long time

338
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
I'm anxious to see her soon

339
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,880
It's ok

340
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Go

341
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Ok

342
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Go

343
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,880
Director

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Jian Dan

345
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Your grandma is going to school

346
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,880
She should be here soon

347
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
Grandma is here again?

348
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,880
She said it's next weekend

349
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
I heard you hurt your foot

350
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
So I came a week earlier

351
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
Don't forget to remind her

352
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Wait for me at the school gate

353
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,320
I'll drive and pick her up

354
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Ok, director

355
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
Hello

356
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
The phone you dialed is power off

357
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Why is it power off?

358
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
She doesn't have a phone, does she?

359
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
I'm sorry

360
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
I have to go

361
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Bye

362
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,320
Ok

363
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Bye

364
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
Young man

365
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
There are so few young people

366
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,320
who are honest and enthusiastic like you

367
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
You have a girlfriend

368
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Otherwise

369
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
I have to introduce my granddaughter to you

370
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
My granddaughter is so beautiful

371
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I have a grandson

372
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
He is so handsome

373
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
He is so talented

374
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,760
He can swim

375
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,760
He swims faster than fish

376
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,760
People in our village like him

377
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,760
You will like him when you see him

378
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
By the way

379
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,760
He also told me

380
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,760
He joined a swimming club when he just entered school

381
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,760
He said that the director cared about him

382
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,760
He likes him very much

383
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Grandma

384
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
How do you know my granddaughter's name?

385
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
You don't know her?

386
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Grandma

387
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
I'm the swimming club director

388
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
that your granddaughter cares about

389
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Han Yansheng

390
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
So it's you

391
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I told you

392
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,200
You will like him when you see him

393
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
You misunderstood

394
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
I miss you so much

395
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm not your granddaughter

396
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
I miss you so much

397
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
How is your foot?

398
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
It's better

399
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

400
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I knew it after you called me

401
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
By the way

402
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Why is your phone off?

403
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
To save electricity

404
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Why are you here?

405
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I was in a car

406
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
It's all because of Xiaohana

407
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
She helped me with my luggage

408
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
She helped me to find you

409
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Thank you for taking care of my grandma

410
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
You're welcome

411
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Xiaohana

412
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I told you

413
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
You will like him when you see my granddaughter

414
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,200
By the way

415
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,200
You are going to send shoes to that girlfriend

416
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Go

417
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Don't delay your big event

418
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Go

419
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Sister Anshou will like it when she sees the shoes

420
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Who said these are for her?

421
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Feng Ning

422
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,200
For

423
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,200
For me

424
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,200
So you are giving them to Jian Dan

425
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I told you

426
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
The shoes for your girlfriend

427
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
Are a pair

428
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
It means she will be with you for the rest of her life

429
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
It's so good

430
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
You didn't say that

431
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I have something to do

432
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm leaving

433
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
Bye

434
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Grandma

435
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Wait for me here

436
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
I will put my luggage on the table

437
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,640
I will take you to the canteen to eat

438
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
Ok

439
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,640
Grandma

440
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,640
This is the specialty of our canteen

441
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
Spicy fried skin

442
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,640
Try it

443
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Speciality

444
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
I think

445
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,640
It must be delicious

446
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
You think

447
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
Grandma

448
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
This is my roommate, Mi Fen

449
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Hello, grandma

450
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
This is my grandma

451
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Hello

452
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Jian Dan always says that you are his best friend

453
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Really?

454
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Sit down

455
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,080
Let's eat together

456
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
You are like my grandma

457
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Don't steal food

458
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Who is the one sitting next to Jian Dan?

459
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Jian Dan's grandma

460
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Jian Dan's grandma

461
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
Then you have to say hello to me

462
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Sit down

463
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Sit down

464
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Grandma

465
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,080
Hello, grandma

466
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I am Jian Dan's friend

467
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
Xia Hou Ling

468
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
You can call me monkey

469
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Monkey

470
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
How can you call me monkey?

471
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,520
Then you must be like Song Wukong

472
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
Smart

473
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,520
Like

474
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Xiaohan

475
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
You also come to eat

476
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Sit down and eat together

477
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
People are more lively

478
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Ok

479
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I will go

480
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Mi Fen

481
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Jian Dan's foot is injured a while ago

482
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
You have been taking care of him

483
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
No, it's not me

484
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
He

485
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
Ok

486
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
Jian Dan's foot

487
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Is injured because he participated in the swimming club's opening day activity

488
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
I take care of him as the president

489
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
It's a public service

490
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
So funny

491
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
It's for the sake of sacrifice

492
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,960
I won't pick you up on the last day

493
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,960
Is it because you said it yourself

494
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Don't let me send it

495
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I didn't say that

496
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Then what did you say

497
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
What I said is

498
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,400
You said you were busy

499
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,400
And you went to the dessert shop

500
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
That's because I went to the computer with En Tong

501
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,400
I went to the dessert shop when I was waiting for the computer

502
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,400
How do you know I went to the dessert shop

503
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
Is it because of this

504
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
You won't let me pick you up

505
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,400
I didn't, Cai Busheng

506
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,400
Who did you go to the dessert shop with

507
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
What does it have to do with me

508
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,840
What's going on

509
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,840
Mi Fen

510
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,840
What's going on with them

511
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
I don't know either

512
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,840
He started on the first day

513
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,840
And then

514
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
I know this

515
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,840
This has to start with the forum

516
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Don't say it

517
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,840
Jian Dan

518
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,840
Let's take a picture

519
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,840
You are often not at home

520
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
When grandma misses you

521
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I'll come out and have a look

522
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Ok

523
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
Then I'll help you

524
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Ok

525
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Jia Gu

526
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
You take the photo

527
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,280
Xiao Han

528
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,280
Come here

529
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Let's take a picture together

530
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
Ok

531
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Come

532
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Come, Tan Zhening

533
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,280
One

534
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Two

535
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Three

536
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,280
Two

537
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,280
One

538
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Monkey

539
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Did you find the button on Chen Yi's shirt

540
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
The headmaster has closed the door

541
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
I guess I can't find it

542
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
It doesn't matter

543
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
It's the first time I see my parents

544
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm the first one

545
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
I'm the first one

546
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
I'm the first one

547
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
I'm the first one

548
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,160
I like to joke

549
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Be careful

550
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Thank you

551
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
Your canteen is really good

552
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Grandma, are you uncomfortable

553
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
I saw you coughing when I was eating

554
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
It's ok

555
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,600
The air in the city

556
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
is not as fresh as the air in our village

557
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
I'm not used to it

558
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
Grandma

559
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Let's go back to the dorm and have a rest

560
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
I have to take a long-distance bus in the afternoon

561
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,600
Ok, let's go

562
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,600
I'm leaving

563
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Thank you

564
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
Bye

565
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Take care

566
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Bye

567
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Bye

568
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,600
Take care

569
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Ok

570
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Bye

571
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
Grandma

572
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Take care of yourself

573
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Call me if you need help

574
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
You should take care of yourself

575
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,600
Eat well

576
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Don't be reluctant to spend money

577
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Grandma

578
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
Grandma

579
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Monkey

580
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Grandma

581
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,400
This is a snack prepared by Old Huang.

582
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,280
Take it.

583
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,360
How can I be embarrassed?

584
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,560
This is our snack.

585
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,680
Please accept it.

586
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,920
You guys are so stingy.

587
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,720
This...

588
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,320
Can I talk to you in private?

589
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,200
Of course.

590
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,680
Easy. Easy.

591
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,520
Come on.

592
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,600
Call the director of Shenmu Village.

593
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,880
Ask when the bus will arrive.

594
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,840
Mrs. Shen.

595
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
You came to the city

596
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,880
not only to see Jian Dan,

597
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
but also to see a doctor.

598
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
How did you know?

599
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,560
I saw your medical report.

600
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,000
Your illness...

601
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,400
Since you already know,

602
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,320
I won't hide it from you.

603
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,600
I came this time

604
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,520
to see a doctor.

605
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,320
But you can't let Jian Dan know about this.

606
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,960
This kid is very thoughtful.

607
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,000
If he knows that I'm sick,

608
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,600
he won't be able to learn it.

609
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,160
Don't worry about this.

610
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,800
I'll keep it a secret.

611
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,600
But you can't delay your illness.

612
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,080
Remember to take your medicine on time.

613
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,200
Thank you, kid.

614
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,040
Kid.

615
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,720
With you taking care of Jian Dan,

616
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,080
I feel much more relieved.

617
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,680
Thank you.

618
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,760
It's okay.

619
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,920
Grandma.

620
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
The bus is here.

621
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
Let's go.

622
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,920
Here it is.

623
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,080
Here it is.

624
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,960
Jian Dan.

625
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,640
Slow down.

626
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,240
Take care of yourself.

627
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:27,840
Don't worry.

628
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,880
Take care of yourself.

629
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,640
Bye, grandma.

630
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,560
Bye, Jian Dan.

631
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,320
Bye, grandma.

632
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,720
Bye.

633
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
Han.

634
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
I have a class with Yuan San.

635
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,480
We're leaving now.

636
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,760
I have to go to the supermarket to buy something.

637
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,200
Bye.

638
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,920
Bye.

639
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,200
Stop.

640
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,600
What did you say

641
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,720
when you pulled grandma over?

642
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,800
It's a secret.

643
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,280
I'll ask grandma later.

644
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,760
I'm afraid grandma will misunderstand our relationship.

645
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,120
I'll explain it to grandma.

646
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,280
What did she say to you?

647
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,080
She said...

648
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,520
What did she say?

649
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,840
She said she wanted me to be her grandson's son-in-law

650
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,440
and take care of you.

651
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
Who wants you to take care of me?

652
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,480
I heard that Jian Dan's grandma came yesterday.

653
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Han Yansheng is having dinner with her.

654
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,000
Is it a family reunion?

655
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,600
Luckily, I'm with Han Yansheng and Jian Dan.

656
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,400
Those who are with Han Yansheng and Gu Wentong

657
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,000
are heartbroken.

658
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,920
Tong Yan's couple is in danger.

659
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,720
I'll be with the Christmas couple.

660
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,280
I have something to talk to you.

661
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,320
Can we meet?

662
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,200
Amazing!

663
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,080
Suddenly I am so Doctors In Lausort,

664
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,800
my memory is too whack.

665
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,920
I didn't notice, but it used to be too often.

666
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,920
When we first met

667
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,920
One look, one word

668
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
I still can't forget

669
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,920
My eyes are already red

670
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Like a poem

671
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Those young days

672
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Are ordinary but interesting

673
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,920
In the gap of time

674
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,920
We secretly

675
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Fly away

676
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Those broken pasts

677
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,920
The vague name

678
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
Fortunately

679
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:49,920
We once had each other

680
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,920
Those young days

681
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,920
The heart does not need to be delayed

682
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
But one day

683
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,920
The promise becomes a luxury

684
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,920
Those broken pasts

685
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,920
It never changes

686
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:18,920
The life is just a picture

687
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,920
