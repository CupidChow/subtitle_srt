1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
Slowly growing

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
She is a flower that has fallen into the incense

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
For her parents

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Zipadiya

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only the sound

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Zipadiya

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you love

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Love is not complicated

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
The one you love

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Love is not complicated

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,800
Have a smile to answer

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Zipadiya

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
Have a smile

19
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,400
I have read your psychological evaluation report

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,600
Are you afraid of dragging me down?

21
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,000
You know it all

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
But we still have a lot of ways to be fine

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
How do you know it's not going to be good?

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
Even if it's not good, I won't give up

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I won't give up either

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Me and Youyou

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
I can protect you in the future

28
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
I've heard all the recordings you posted

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
What happened before

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
The past is over

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
in the future

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Don't hide from me

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
Okay

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
This is a birthday gift for you

35
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
I deliberately borrowed the kitchen of Zhishan's house to cook

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,000
I messed up

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,600
It's okay

38
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
I like it

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
But

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,800
I have a second gift

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to give it to you

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I want to give it to you

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I want to give it to you

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to give it to you

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to give it to you

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to give it to you

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to give it to you

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I want to give it to you

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to give it to you

50
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want to give it to you

51
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to give it to you

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to give it to you

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to give it to you

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I want to give it to you

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,600
I want to give it to you

56
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
I want to give it to you

57
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
I want to give it to you

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
I want to give it to you

59
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
I want to give it to you

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I want to give it to you

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I want to give it to you

62
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,200
I want to give it to you

63
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I want to give it to you

64
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I want to give it to you

65
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Thanks

66
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Thank you

67
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,400
Drink

68
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Drink

69
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Drink

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
I love you

71
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,280
Cheers.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,280
Tian Dan.

73
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,480
Luckily, you and Han

74
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,480
made up this time.

75
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,440
Otherwise,

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,520
we don't have to turn on the air conditioner

77
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,640
in summer.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,920
Han is just a smart air conditioner.

79
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,560
We have to be alive.

80
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,080
Who on earth

81
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,560
put the edited recording pen

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
on the table of Sheng

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
and made them fight on purpose?

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,560
It's so horrible.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,840
I asked other photographers.

86
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,280
No one noticed who put it on the table.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,600
So there's no other clue?

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,440
Alright.

89
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,400
Let's stop talking about this.

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,280
Let's stop talking about the unhappy things.

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:57,800
Let's eat.

92
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,440
Let's eat.

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,920
Here, cheers.

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,680
Here, cheers.

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Can I see your phone?

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Sure.

97
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,760
Here.

98
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,480
Here.

99
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,440
I put something on it.

100
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,600
What did you put on it?

101
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,600
The paint.

102
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,920
Alright.

103
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,080
Thank you all

104
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,840
for solving the misunderstanding

105
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,800
between Han and me.

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll treat you to a meal.

107
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,680
I'll pay.

108
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,520
Brother.

109
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,640
I'm bored today.

110
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,040
What are you discussing?

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,960
You have no time now.

112
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,880
Honey.

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm home.

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,440
Let's have a game of discovered.

115
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,440
Uncle,

116
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
why are you leaving so suddenly?

117
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,040
You're moving so impertinent.

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,000
Everything is quite unfair.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
What are they doing here?

120
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,160
I'll tell you.

121
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,920
Really?

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,640
Begonia.

123
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,800
Making them fear for her mom,

124
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,480
You took the recorder, right?

126
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,760
You suspect me?

128
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,400
Indeed,

129
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
I did a lot of things

130
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,640
to destroy you and Dasheng.

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,360
But I gave Dasheng up long ago.

132
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,280
I have no reason to do that.

133
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,760
I'm not suspecting you.

134
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm just confirming it.

135
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,560
During this period,

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
you did a good job of pretending.

137
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,280
Until I found

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
the pigment on your phone.

139
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,200
I'll leave now, Zhennan.

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,480
Bye.

141
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,200
Bye.

142
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,960
What does it mean?

143
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,000
It's the same as the pigment

144
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,920
on my wall

145
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,280
when I was taking the photo.

146
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,000
It's okay if you don't admit it.

147
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,360
I know the answer

148
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
from your expression.

149
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
But I still want to tell you

150
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,520
not to do this again.

151
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,960
Because no matter what you do,

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,200
you'll never be able to

153
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,240
get the answer.

154
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm not going to let you

155
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,360
do this again.

156
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,280
I'm not going to let you

157
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,000
do this again.

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
Because no matter what you do,

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,320
I won't separate from Han Yansheng.

160
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Yes, I did it.

161
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,360
I knew Dasheng first.

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,480
I grew up with Dasheng.

163
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,240
If it weren't for you...

164
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,360
Even if it's not simple,

165
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,680
I won't like you.

166
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
I'll never like you.

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,880
I've always treated you as a friend.

168
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,960
I don't have any other feelings.

169
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,120
Dasheng!

170
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,620
As for our Basic Meeting...

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:44,520
I never heard of the

172
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,120
girl you like.

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
I hurt others in the past.

174
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,240
You're no longer the one I know.

175
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm just afraid that others will take the voice away from me.

176
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
Am I wrong?

177
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,240
But you're wrong again.

178
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,040
You can dislike me.

179
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,880
But you can't use me

180
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
and pretend to be close to me

181
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
to make others think that you don't like Han anymore.

182
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,640
I'm really sorry.

184
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
You're the only one I have now.

185
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Don't leave me.

186
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,920
You've done so many wrong things.

187
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,720
What did you get?

188
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,160
I went to the nursing home just now.

189
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,200
I didn't see the Heir Apparent.

190
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
Where is he?

191
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,360
Guys,

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm going to teach him a lesson.

193
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
I've already set off.

194
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,840
Don't blame me for leaving secretly.

195
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,520
I really don't want to see

196
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,320
Song Bi's scene.

197
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,000
Everyone,

198
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,360
I'll see you later.

199
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,840
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
I'm sorry.

202
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,120
I'm sorry.

203
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm sorry.

204
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,840
I'm sorry.

205
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm sorry.

208
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm sorry.

210
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
I'm sorry.

211
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm sorry.

212
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm sorry.

213
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm sorry.

214
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm sorry.

215
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I'm sorry.

216
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,840
I'm sorry.

218
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm sorry.

219
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm sorry.

224
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I'm sorry.

225
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
I'm sorry.

226
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,840
I'm sorry.

228
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
I'm sorry.

229
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,640
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,040
I'm that kind person,

231
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
I won't give you free time.

232
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,520
If it's not easy like this,

233
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,400
why don't you head back now and

234
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
give me a little time?

235
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Don't force your own side.

236
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,760
No.

237
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,960
After everything,

238
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,600
umu will have to move on.

239
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
Get out of my way.

240
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
I've told you several times

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,240
I won't give you any free time.

242
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Silly me.

243
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,840
I'm listening to you.

244
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,080
Will this season

245
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,000
be too noisy and boring?

246
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,400
You just said you would listen to me.

247
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,800
Let's check the flight tickets first.

248
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,040
I'm going to study abroad soon.

249
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm going to study abroad soon.

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm going to study abroad soon.

251
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm going to study abroad soon.

252
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,680
I'm going to study abroad soon.

253
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,520
I'm going to study abroad soon.

254
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
We may never

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
see each other again.

256
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,400
Dasheng,

257
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,720
before I leave,

258
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,560
I have to tell you

259
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,360
something.

260
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,520
It's not entirely your fault

261
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,080
that Nanyuan died.

262
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,040
What do you mean?

263
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,720
Hello, boss.

264
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,160
I rented three air conditioners.

265
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,360
They're ready.

266
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,120
Wait a minute.

267
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,640
I'll get them for you after I finish tidying up.

268
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Okay.

269
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,440
Boss,

270
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,760
why don't you get back to your work?

271
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,680
I'll get them myself.

272
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,400
I'll get them myself.

273
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:39,800
Hello?

274
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,000
Lin Tong, how are you?

275
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm renting air conditioners.

276
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Come over quickly.

277
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,760
Okay, I'll be there soon.

278
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,560
Okay.

279
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,320
I didn't expect that

280
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,640
the three air conditioners I rented that day

281
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,960
would be so expensive.

282
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,920
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,840
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,840
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,280
Two of the three air conditioners

286
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,680
I rented that day were broken.

287
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,320
One was carried by you,

288
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,520
and the other

289
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
was carried by Nanyuan.

290
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,920
So that day, Nanyuan...

291
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm very responsible for this.

292
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,520
I've been keeping this secret

293
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,760
and even selfishly

294
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,440
let you bear the responsibility with me.

295
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,760
I'm sorry, Dasheng.

296
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,920
So,

297
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,760
you're the one

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,320
who sent the yellow rose to Nanyuan that day.

299
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,680
Yes.

300
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,480
I've been keeping this secret

301
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
for too long.

302
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,000
I finally told her today.

303
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,520
I let myself go

304
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
and let you go.

305
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,400
I've made so many mistakes.

306
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,080
I finally made one more mistake.

307
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,160
It's been so long.

308
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
It's meaningless

309
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
to blame someone else now.

310
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
We should move on.

311
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,760
Nanyuan doesn't want you

312
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,680
to be so petty.

313
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
You're right.

314
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,520
I shouldn't be so petty.

315
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,240
I should help Nanyuan

316
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,400
to fulfill her wish.

317
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
I'll all return.

318
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,800
Focus.

319
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,760
Row.

320
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,680
Guard.

321
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Progress.

322
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
Do everything you can.

323
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
There's no Trying Seek.

324
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,080
Help others.

325
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,240
Congratulations.

326
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,680
You did it.

327
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Thank you.

328
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,160
It's true.

329
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:33,840
white

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,240
This is National Institute of Overseas teammate on the colorful ocean.

331
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,640
If he sees this,

333
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,960
he will be very happy.

334
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
Lan Yuan, hello.

335
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,200
I'm Han Yingsheng's girlfriend.

336
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,640
I often hear him talk about you.

337
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,040
He's a positive and optimistic person.

338
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,400
He wants to cherish the friendship between you two.

339
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,440
Han Yingsheng has also made

340
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
an unfinished wish for you.

341
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,280
He really worked hard.

342
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,400
And he did it.

343
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,440
Besides,

344
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,120
don't worry.

345
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,640
I will be with him in the future.

346
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,800
I won't do anything to hurt your feelings.

347
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,040
Relax a little.

348
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,400
I'm nervous because it's not the first time.

349
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,040
I was worried about the last time.

350
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
I was worried about it.

351
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,920
I didn't draw it last time.

352
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,600
Are you ready?

353
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
The graduation ceremony is about to start.

354
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,840
Okay, let's go.

355
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,600
This time,

356
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,280
you have to finish drawing two.

357
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
It's too late.

358
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,240
It's about to start.

359
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,720
I've almost finished.

360
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,320
Draw.

361
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,480
Okay, draw.

362
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,960
Take it away.

363
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,680
Stop.

364
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,560
Why aren't you wearing your school uniforms?

365
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,800
You're not graduates, right?

366
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,920
Our boyfriend is inside.

367
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,040
Yes.

368
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
Let them come.

369
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,760
Brother, let us in.

370
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,080
Next, let's welcome our excellent student representative,

371
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,480
Han Yansheng,

372
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,320
to give us a big round of applause.

373
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,480
Please welcome Han Yansheng,

374
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,400
Han Yansheng will explain the final results.

375
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,700
Thank you,

376
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,920
thank you,

377
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,520
please sit down.

378
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,560
Good first class tubulence,

379
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,400
Thank you for your guidance.

380
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,480
Four years in college

381
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
is the best time for me.

382
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,000
His boyfriend is the one who's speaking on stage.

383
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
He can't come out now.

384
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,440
Let others come.

385
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,920
Please let us in.

386
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
Do you really know each other?

387
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:49,960
Let's go in.

388
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Coming.

389
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
Bro.

390
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,800
Bro.

391
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,760
They are my friends.

392
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,240
Let's go.

393
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:54,880
Let's go.

394
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Let's go.

395
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,960
Finally,

396
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,480
I have something to say.

397
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,360
Here it is.

398
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,120
It's simple.

399
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Before I knew you,

400
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,080
math was my favorite.

401
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
The blood transfusion was the best thing in my eyes.

402
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
But then I found out

403
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
that meeting you

404
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,080
was the best thing.

405
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,200
We had a fight,

406
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,040
had a fight,

407
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
watched fireworks together,

408
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,160
and took the test together.

409
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,240
You spent the darkest days with me.

410
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,080
You are like a mirror

411
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,160
that shows me my arrogance.

412
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
You are like the sun that breaks through the clouds

413
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
and shines into my heart.

414
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
You make me feel warm.

415
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
You are so brave.

416
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,160
You never have a moment of fear.

417
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
Because of you,

418
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
I became braver.

419
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
I no longer have to be selfish

420
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
and have to be brave

421
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
to achieve a better me.

422
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,160
I am not selfish.

423
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
It's you who made my soul no longer be lonely.

424
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
It's also you

425
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
who made me wear the real armor

426
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
and belong to my hip-hop team.

427
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,160
It's simple.

428
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
I love you.

429
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
I love you.

430
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
I love you.

431
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I love you.

432
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I love you.

433
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
I love you.

434
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
I love you.

435
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I love you.

436
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,160
I love you.

437
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
I love you.

438
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,160
I love you.

439
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,160
I love you.

440
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
I love you.

441
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I love you.

442
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I love you.

443
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
I love you.

444
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
I

445
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
I love you.

446
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,160
I love you.

447
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I love you.

448
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
I love you.

449
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
I love you.

450
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I love you.

451
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I love you.

452
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
This is precious

453
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
and want to see you so much.

454
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,160
This is not used

455
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
by my children,

456
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,960
Happy graduation!

457
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,360
Bend it.

458
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,000
Okay.

459
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,800
Okay.

460
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,240
Look at me.

461
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,840
One more.

462
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,040
Hurry up.

463
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,120
Be more confident.

464
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:34,840
One more.

465
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,400
Good.

466
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,360
Okay.

467
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,800
It's almost the summer vacation.

468
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,120
What are you doing?

469
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,760
You're a graduate.

470
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,040
You're not a student.

471
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,520
Go to the university.

472
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,760
I didn't cherish

473
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,280
a carefree university life.

474
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,240
I didn't cherish it.

475
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
I'll regret it

476
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,880
after graduation.

477
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,000
If you don't want to regret it,

478
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,520
take more photos.

479
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,680
Be gentle.

480
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:05,880
Yuan Si.

481
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,800
I've prepared a surprise for you.

482
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,240
Go.

483
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:12,880
Hurry up.

484
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,400
Hurry up.

485
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,200
Be careful.

486
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:25,560
Come on.

487
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,200
Change the position.

488
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,520
Three, two, one.

489
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,920
Three, two, one.

490
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,040
Come on.

491
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,680
Take a photo.

492
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,560
Miss.

493
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,360
I graduated.

494
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,760
I want to cherish

495
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,720
my university life.

496
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,720
Why should I take a photo for you?

497
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,760
Your university life

498
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,800
is the most worth cherishing.

499
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,760
It's me.

500
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,400
Of course I need to take more photos.

501
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,080
Hurry up.

502
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,560
Okay?

503
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Okay.

504
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,640
Open it and close it.

505
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,520
Go.

506
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,160
Be careful.

507
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,800
Move forward.

508
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Why is it so mysterious?

509
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,600
Just wait.

510
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,160
Be careful.

511
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,760
Okay. Sit.

512
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,560
Don't open your eyes.

513
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,400
Okay.

514
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,000
Three, two, one.

515
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Happy graduation, my queen.

516
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:27,960
You're a good singer.

517
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,280
You're a painter.

518
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,760
You're a good singer, too.

519
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,920
You scared me.

520
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,960
I've prepared a gift for you.

521
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,840
I didn't graduate.

522
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,920
Why did you prepare this for me?

523
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,520
Because today is our

524
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,840
120th anniversary.

525
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,280
I thought you forgot.

526
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,600
It's beautiful.

527
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,080
Do you like it?

528
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,320
Yes.

529
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,640
Then how should we

530
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,480
celebrate the next 521 days?

531
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,520
It's up to you.

532
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,600
Then

533
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,320
this is enough.

534
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,080
We are one day late.

535
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,560
As long as you don't break up,

536
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,280
I will die.

537
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,520
You're the best.

538
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,960
As long as you live,

539
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,120
we will go to the idol service company.

540
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,000
Xia Ruining,

541
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,920
don't spend too much time on her.

542
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,120
Have drag training.

543
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,160
and you're still holding your head up.

544
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,080
You're the one who's in a rush.

545
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,200
You knocked me down on the first day I graduated.

546
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,120
You're still not apologizing.

547
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,120
Of course I have to break the law.

548
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,840
Many beautiful love

549
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
are like us.

550
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,520
It starts from a bad relationship.

551
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,080
You said

552
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,640
we've seen each other's most embarrassing faces.

553
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,800
We've seen each other

554
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,440
getting better and better.

555
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,840
Right?

556
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,480
Right?

557
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,320
Then we've made a deal.

558
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,320
No matter what difficulties we encounter in the future,

559
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
we'll never let each other go.

560
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,600
It's the summer vacation.

561
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,320
Can't you take a vacation?

562
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,320
A company I interviewed last time

563
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,040
contacted me and I'll be in.

564
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,000
My grandma asked me

565
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,680
when I'd go on vacation.

566
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,440
It seems like I don't have a chance.

567
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,640
Lin Hong Town

568
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,160
It's the 11th day since he was Ginza.

569
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,220
Esper Vous

570
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,320
It's easy.

571
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,280
We have guests today.

572
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,000
We can catch some fish with them.

573
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
Who?

574
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,480
You'll know soon.

575
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,280
I found a pair of glasses!

576
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,760
Can I make a wish with you?

577
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,280
I hope I can see Han Yansheng today.

578
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,800
Linda!

579
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,800
Linda!

580
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,240
Han Yansheng!

581
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,040
Han Yansheng!

582
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,320
Can't sleep at night?

583
00:33:38,960 --> 00:34:04,220
He

584
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,200
The All!

585
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:31,980
Actors in our

586
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,320
Shawn ist

587
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,880
Happy

588
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,720
Still

589
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,200
Good

590
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:13,680
And theナ

591
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:21,080
Those affected by the investigators

592
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,820
Should die at an油

593
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,000
That shattered

594
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,600
The vague name is still good

595
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:44,600
We once had each other

596
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,200
Those young days

597
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,600
The heart is not to be delayed

598
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:57,800
But some promises have become a lie

599
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,600
Those broken pasts

600
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,600
It has never been a complete

601
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,600
Life color

602
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Painting

603
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,400
Three two one

604
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,000
Happy graduation
