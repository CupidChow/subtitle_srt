Your girlfriend left her phone here.

Can you come pick it up?

I have plans later.

I'm taking the phone with me.

Excuse me,

I'm looking for a book,

33

"Mathematician and Martyr, Hypatia."

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,340
Can you help me find its location?

35
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,980
- Sure, give me a second.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,860
I know about that.

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,800
Sheng got to know his pen pal

38
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:16,780
because of that book.

39
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,660
It's called Hypatia.

40
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,720
The book you wanted is located
on the first floor,

41
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,520
in the East Wing,
on Bookshelf 2, second row.

42
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,140
- Okay, thanks.
- You're welcome.

that Jian Dan is Sheng's pen pal?)

I can help you find what you want.

I'm good.

57
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:14,940

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,740
why do you have my friend's phone?

61
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,620
I thought you were
the guy with her just now.

62
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,160
What guy?

63
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,300
A tall guy, handsome,

64
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,540
and they look great together.

65
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,820
I think he's her boyfriend.

66
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,380
You're mistaken.

67
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,644
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

68
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,400
I doubt that.

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,220
I can tell from the way
they looked at each other.

70
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:04,250
They must like each other.

71
00:05:04,266 --> 00:05:06,140
Since you know her,

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,900
can you return this to her?

that she has a boyfriend now?)

Excuse me.

86
00:07:38,755 --> 00:07:39,777
Can I ask you something?

87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,260
Are you a math major?

88
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:41,860
Yes.

89
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,380
Then I highly recommend

90
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,100
studying this book.

91
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:47,577
A good friend of mine

92
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:48,737
is in the math department.

93
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,460
He told me

94
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,900
this book is great

95
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,940

Really?

99
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,780
If you don't study it,
you're doomed to fail.

100
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,488
Then I'll definitely check it out.

101
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
Yeah, take this back.

102
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,340

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,755
- Don't worry about it.
- Bye-bye.

106

to buy your new merchandiser.

109

About the promise,

121
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,340
can I have it fulfilled now?

125
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,260
Can we?

126
00:09:56,354 --> 00:09:57,060
It's fine.

127
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,220
Even if we can't be friends,

128
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,333
I'll still help you however I can.

129
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,020
I'll head up now.

130
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,340
Bye-bye.

131
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,300
We can.

132
00:10:30,577 --> 00:10:32,155
Did you just come back from a date?

133
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,540
How did you know?

134
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,220
But it wasn't really a date.
I was just meeting someone...

135
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,711
How long have you two known each other?

136
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,980
A while.

137
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,377
It's just our first time meeting
in person.

138
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,900
So basically,
you know nothing about him.

139
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:52,660
That's not true.

140
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,844
I know he's really good at math.

141
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,900
Good at math?

142
00:10:57,565 --> 00:10:58,885
Has he published any papers?

143
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,700
Won any competitions?

144
00:11:00,844 --> 00:11:02,990
Has he been invited
to any international conferences?

145
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,420
He has really nice handwriting.

146
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,940
A lot of people do.

147
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,333
Just join the calligraphy club.

148
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,740
He and I connect through academics.

149
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,555
You wouldn't get it.

150
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,228
You never really know someone.

151
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,828
So don't get played.

152
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,620
How I make friends

153
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,297
is none of your business.

154
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,900
I'm just worried

155
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,066
you're being too naive.

156
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,300
Here.

157
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,180
Don't lose it again.

158
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,140
Why is my phone with you?

159
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,244
Didn't you say
it was none of your business?

160
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,891
Jian Dan, I miss you so much.

161
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,588
I miss you too.

162
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:52,540
Have you been eating well

163
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:53,860
and taking care of yourself?

164
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,820
Don't worry. I've been eating on time.

165
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:56,780
That's good to hear.

166
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:14,051
Why did you set my phone

167
00:12:14,088 --> 00:12:15,466
with a password without asking?

168
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,860
I was just trying to remind you

169
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,380
to set a password

170
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,866
so your info doesn't get leaked.

171
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,700
Thanks.

172
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,860
Then, can you tell me
the new password now?

173
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,260
It's easy.

174
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,300
Just three words.

175
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:28,180
Curly-haired girl.

176
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:31,700
Curly-haired girl?

177
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,740
What kind of password is that?

178
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,911
Han Yansheng, how dare you mess with me!

179
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,460
It's not my birthday.

180
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,100
Not my student ID either.

181
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,780
What on earth is the password?

182
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,060
What are you doing?

183
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,460
Why is your phone with you?

184
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,220
I was about to ask you the same.

185
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,800
Why did my phone end up
with Han Yansheng?

186
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:15,822
He gave it to me.

187
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,060
Han Yansheng?

188
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,500
But I didn't see him tonight.

189
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,610
So, did the phone fly to me by itself?

190
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,860
What are you even talking about?

191
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,933
Weren't you supposed
to meet your pen pal?

192
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,980
Don't even bring it up.

193
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,080
I waited an hour, and he never showed.

194
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,340
Maybe he did show up,

195
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,100
but bailed out

196
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
once he saw it was you.

197
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,980
Let's mind each other's business.

198
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,666
Why do you always meddle?

199
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,733
Don't listen to her.

200
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,580
Maybe something urgent came up.

201
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,740
But I left my contact info

202
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,640
before I left.

203
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,300
Even if he was occupied,

204
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,060
he would have called me

205
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,060
after he saw it.

206
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,080
That's true.

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,860
But what does any of this

208
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,155
have to do with Han Yansheng?

209
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:03,100
I get livid at the thought of him.

210
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,645
Sure, he gave me back my phone.

211
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,125
But he locked it with a password.

212
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,700
I still haven't figured it out.

213
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,394
Why not just ask him?

214
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,340
I did.

215
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,022
He refused to tell me.

216
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,820
He only gave me one hint.

217
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,100
"Curly-haired girl."

218
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,220
Curly-haired girl?

219
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,420
Isn't that when you first got here

220
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,488
with that crazy perm?

221
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:30,540
Yeah, it was interesting.

222
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,340
What?

223
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:42,740
It's unlocked.

224
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,622
How did you crack it?

225
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,060
Remember

226
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,457
when Han Yansheng and I ended up

227
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:48,940
on the university news?

228
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,540
"Swimming Club President Drowns,

229
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,020
Curly-haired Girl
Gives Him Mouth-to-Mouth..."

230
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,220
He must have used the date

231
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,340
we were on the headlines
as the password,

232
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,820
which is 0901.

233
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,711
Not bad.

234
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,180
But that was such

235
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,900
an embarrassing moment for him.

236
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,660
Why would he use that as your password?

237
00:15:15,066 --> 00:15:17,500
Probably because of the nickname
I gave him?

238
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,020
So this is payback.

239
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,100
What nickname?

240
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,740
Since I've got my phone back,

241
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,577
it's time to go all in on both fronts.

242
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,380
What "fronts?"

243
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,755
You're always talking in riddles.

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,560
The 11.11 sales.

245
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,933
There are so many deals today!

246
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,290
Don't tell me you want to miss out.

247
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,405
Who would lose their beauty sleep

248
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:37,340
over saving a few yuan?

249
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,820
It's not just a few yuan!

250
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,660
Didn't you see the news?

251
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Someone bought 1000 yuan worth of things

252
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,860
and only paid 70 yuan.

253
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,340
Seriously?

254
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,691
But all those promo codes

255
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,500
give me a headache.

256
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,100
Don't even get me started
on all the discounts.

257
00:15:56,948 --> 00:16:00,060
(The 11.11 Coupon Discount Calculation)
I made a spreadsheet with formulas.

258
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,580
Just enter what you want to buy,

259
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,740
and it gives you the cheapest combo.

260
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,900
No way!

261
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,940
Show me, quick!

262
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,022
Like this one.

(Apartment 17)

264
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,711
Did you meet the goddess?

265
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,820
Yeah, how did it go?

266
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,111
Was she a goddess or a tomboy?

267
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,460
Something came up last minute.

268
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,800
So I didn't even get to see her.

269
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,711
What's more important
than meeting your goddess?

270
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,460
Exactly.

271
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,300
Jian Dan lost her phone.

272
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,940
Someone found it but couldn't reach her.

273
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,333
So I went to get it.

274
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,190
So Jian Dan's more important
than the goddess now, huh?

275
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,860
Shut up.

276
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,340
Monkey,

277
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,500
has Jian Dan ever mentioned
having a boyfriend?

278
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,511
Does she have one?

279
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,460
Just asking.

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,620
He says he doesn't care,

281
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,260
and then asks about her love life.

282
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,300
Han, you stood the goddess up
on your first meeting.

283
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,777
Wouldn't that give a bad impression?

284
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,460
I had my reasons.

285
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,180
I wanted to apologize,

286
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:13,800
but someone else borrowed
the biography book.

287
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,980
Could it have been the goddess?

288
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,460
I asked the librarian.

289
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,780
She said it was a guy who borrowed it.

290
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,700
What?

291
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,340
The goddess is a guy?

292
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,780
It wasn't she who borrowed it.

293
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,740
How are you so sure?

294
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,000
My instinct.

a Singles' Day special event!

300
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:51,820
Now,

301
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
everyone gets a card

302
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,700
and writes their wish on it.

303
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,860

We're doing a Singles' Day activity

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,380
at the Swimming Club.

308
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,100
Do you want to join?

309
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,860
How does it work?

310
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,300
Write your wish on a card,

311
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,600
drop it in the box,

312
00:18:28,644 --> 00:18:31,000
then draw someone else's wish
and help make it come true.

313
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,340
Sounds fun.

314
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,580
Come on, Jian Dan.

315
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,420

that can be fulfilled today.

322
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:50,755
Then write your wish.

323
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,155
Jian Dan, have you figured out
what you're going to write?

324
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,700
Not yet.

325
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,844
Why don't you write one for me,

326
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,380
and I'll write one for you?

327
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,088

I haven't picked yet.

332
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,380
I want to wait
until everyone is done writing

333
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,220
and draw together.

334
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,900
What if I draw yours?

335
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,340

336
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,860
Not yet. I'll go and see him in a bit.

Yeah.

All right.

344
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,220

Hey, I'm a lucky charm.

355
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,533
If you picked mine,
you'll be lucky for a whole year.

356
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,100
Can I pick another one?

357
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,660
No.

358
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,540
But you can swap it

359
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,540

Didn't you say we could swap?

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,220
Now, I'm curious.

368

369
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,740
It's a secret.

Right, I'm going now.

00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:51,879
The class is starting soon.

375
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,730
Go and save me a seat.

376
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,866
I'm heading to the Rock Climbing Club
for something.

377
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,540
Then I'll get going.

378
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,460
See you later.

379
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:15,900
Han.

380
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,300
Hey, Han.

381
00:22:17,748 --> 00:22:18,940
You're the last one.

382
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,700
Write a wish.

383
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,822
I'm not interested.

384
00:22:22,422 --> 00:22:23,940
The Rock Climbing Club has all joined.

385
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,940
Even the president joined.

386
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,940
You're the Swimming Club president.

387
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,980
How can you not join your club activity?

388
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,780
Jian Dan joined too?

389
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,500
Didn't you say only singles can join?

390
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,333
Jian Dan is single too.

391
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:39,940
(She has a boyfriend
but pretends to be single.)

392
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,780
(So fake.)

393
00:22:42,266 --> 00:22:44,688
Just write your wish.
Everyone is waiting for you.

394
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,097
No, thank you.

395
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,020
Fine.

396
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,844
If you don't write it,

397
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,688
I'll write it for you.

398
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:53,977
So tell me what your wish is.

399
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,160
Then

400
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,460
solve this math problem.

401
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,777
Are you for real?

402
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,380
My biggest wish

403
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,140
is to solve this problem right now.

404
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,400
Is that a problem?

405
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,777
Okay then. To solve your math problem.

406
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,060
Whoever draws your card

407
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,666
is doomed.

408
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,000
Then you draw one.

409
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,666
I don't have time
to fulfill someone else's wish.

410
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,660
If you don't draw,

411
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,540
I'm not leaving.

412
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,542
Let's see

413
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,600
whose wish you got.

414
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,500
What about you?

415
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,900
I haven't drawn mine yet.

416
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,711
Then I'll draw one now.

417
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,660
Spirits, hear my plea.

418
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,965
Anyone's wish but Han!

419
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,340
You're it!

420
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,700
(Han Yansheng)

421
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
No way. I want a redraw.

422
00:24:14,377 --> 00:24:15,220
No, you can't.

423
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,980
You're the event organizer.

424
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,040
If you cheat, what kind
of example are you setting?

425
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:21,900
Just sit down and do the math,

426
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,260
and enjoy your Singles' Day.

427
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:23,740
Go.

428
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,500
Han,

429
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,111
you're an absolute weirdo!

430
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,222
Who writes "solve a math problem"
as a wish card

431
00:24:41,222 --> 00:24:42,266
on Singles' Day?

432
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:43,533
No wonder you're single!

433
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,180
Like you have a girlfriend.

434
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:26,060
(Meeting my math pen pal, Jian Dan)

435
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,085
Who hasn't drawn yet?

436
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,245
Hurry up!

437
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:52,068
So, how did it go?

438
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,111
Did Sheng write his wish?

439
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,988
Yeah, he did.

440
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:57,822
Entong, be honest.

441
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,820
You really wanted

442
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,780
Han's card, right?

443
00:26:00,217 --> 00:26:01,140
Here, take it.

444
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,060
Can I?

445
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,308
Of course, you can.

446
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,220
Congratulations.

447
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Enjoy the math problem.

448
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,822
You don't want it?

449
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:21,902
Come on, Entong.

450
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,100
You haven't drawn one.

451
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,659
Wow, Han.

452
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,620
You finally see how unpopular you are?

453
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
(Reading Booth)

454
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,820
Jian Dan!

455
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,355
Hey, Jian Dan!

456
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,780
Jian Dan, how about we swap our cards?

457
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,020
Why?

458
00:26:45,285 --> 00:26:47,100
That game skin is crazy expensive.

459
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,260
I feel bad about making you buy it.

460
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,420
Really?

461
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,834
Yeah.

462
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,111
It's just a math problem.

463
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:56,777
Here, look.

464
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,688
You're a straight-A student.
It'll be a breeze.

465
00:26:59,622 --> 00:27:00,420
I'm not swapping.

466
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,460
Come on, Jian Dan.

467
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,645
That skin costs a lot.

468
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:04,777
Are you sure about that?

469
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,462
I'm happy to spend a little money

470
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:10,977
to fulfill a friend's wish.

471
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,100
Jian Dan!

472
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,020
Please help me out here.

473
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,789
I'm the one who started this event.

474
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:16,866
If I'm off to a rough start

475
00:27:16,866 --> 00:27:18,220
and unable to grant a single wish.

476
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,260
How can I face anyone
if I flop at the first one?

477
00:27:23,702 --> 00:27:24,820
Then what about your wish?

478
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,700
Easy.

479
00:27:32,044 --> 00:27:32,980
I've bought it myself.

480
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,500
Thanks!

481
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:47,300
Yes!

482
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:54,220
Sheng,

483
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,300
wait up!

484
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,420
Whose wish did you draw?

485
00:28:00,948 --> 00:28:01,740
A girl I know.

486
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:04,034
A girl you know?

487
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,860
That narrows it down
to fewer than five people.

488
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,733
Wow, am I really that unpopular?

489
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,460
It's not that you're unpopular.

490
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,460
It's just that your obsession with math

491
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,444
is way stronger
than your interest in girls.

492
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,500
You even wrote "solve a math problem"

493
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,188
as your Singles' Day wish.

494
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,540
Aside from a few of us who know you,

495
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,288
who else could deal with that?

496
00:28:25,862 --> 00:28:28,194
Math is just way more logical
than girls.

497
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:30,860
No matter how hard the problem,
there's always a right answer.

498
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,900
Girls?

499
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,466
Completely unsolvable.

500
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,460
Who are you throwing shade at?

501
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,100
No one.

502
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,220
Oh, Entong.

503
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,466
Do you want someone to grant your wish?

504
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,900
Of course.

505
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
That's a lot of work.

506
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,500
Jian Dan,

507
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,288
what wish did you write for me?

508
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:01,620
It's something you've always wanted.

509
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:05,500
What about you?

510
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,925
What did you write for me?

511
00:29:07,644 --> 00:29:09,333
It's also something
you've always wanted.

512
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,434
Jian Dan, where are you going later?

513
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,140
The library.

514
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,091
But

515
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,511
you don't have to come with me.

516
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,580
Are you waiting for me?

517
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,580
I drew your wish.

518
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,660
(Oh, heavens!)

519
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,900
(He actually picked mine!)

520
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,340
(But what was that wish?)

521
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,688
(Never mind. It doesn't matter.)

522
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:55,755
(It's already come true.)

523
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,420
Let's go and make your wish come true.

524
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,820
