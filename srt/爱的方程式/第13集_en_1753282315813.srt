1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
I will use my heart to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Grow up gently

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
She is a flower that has no fragrance

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Will it be afraid?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Tipatia

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only the fragrance

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt the sadness

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Tipatia

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,400
The one who is beautiful

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Love is complicated

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,400
The Today Burns мне

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Episode 18

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,600
You did prepare this for me.

17
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,760
Bai Yan Shou.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't say anymore.

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
I promise you.

20
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,520
Why is it open?

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
Yuan Sen will be here soon.

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,040
What should we do?

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Hurry up and return the books to me.

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,640
Hurry up.

25
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,120
What should we do?

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,400
Really?

27
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,000
Hurry up.

28
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,560
Hurry up and close the VCR for me.

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,760
Before Yuan Sen comes,

30
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,160
return the books to me.

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,680
What's wrong with Yuan Sen?

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,920
Did I come at the wrong time?

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
What did you promise me?

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,960
I promised...

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
I promised to help you return the books.

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,280
But Yuan Sen is already here.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,480
There's no need for that.

38
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,080
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,520
Your Highness.

40
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,400
Your Highness.

41
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
I'm not called Your Highness.

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,320
I'm called Yuan Sen.

43
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,760
I didn't expect that Luo Shui is actually Yuan Sen.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,880
This news is too shocking.

45
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,760
Anyway,

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,200
you've always been my idol.

47
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
I'm very lucky to be able to

48
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,080
become friends with you in real life.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,320
And when I was with you,

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,440
I was really...

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,000
I was really happy.

52
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,320
I...

53
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,080
Don't say it.

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
Let me say that

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,040
there's nothing in common

56
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,120
between us except for our cosplay.

57
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,760
But I really like you.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,600
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

59
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
I...

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,800
Don't take pictures.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,600
I'm being filmed.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,640
Stop!

63
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm not taking pictures.

64
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,440
Stop!

65
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,400
Stop running!

66
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,520
What's wrong?

67
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,560
Huo Zeyang.

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,640
Huo Zeyang took photos of Yuan Sen.

69
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Go after him!

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Yuan Sen?

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Isn't he a simple guy who wants to confess his love?

72
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,520
That's not enough.

73
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,400
I was thinking about how to make my Democrats

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,720
confess their love to Yuan Sen as quickly as possible.

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,800
I didn't expect Huo Zeyang too quickly.

76
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
He disappeared in a minute.

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
No wonder he got a large and small nail gap.

78
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,640
About my crrendocav Uh-oh chat today,

79
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,740
I've prepared it for so long

80
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,740
I'm not going to do it.

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,780
Then you can count it.

82
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,660
See if he will answer you.

83
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,620
When did I say you are a coward?

84
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
A lazy goose wants to eat the meat of a swan.

85
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,780
You don't look at the mirror to see if you are worthy.

86
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,620
Can you think of falling into the water?

87
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,100
Yue Tang Tang, don't be so bad.

88
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,980
I didn't say that.

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,020
The netizens said it.

90
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,260
I just read it.

91
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,620
I don't remember, you should be harder.

92
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,660
It's a nice drama.

93
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,840
It must spread.

94
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
I'm here to see you.

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,640
So, His Highness is Yuan Sen.

96
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,440
He's hiding too well.

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,400
I knew he wouldn't show his face

98
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,400
because he's too handsome.

99
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,040
But who is this woman?

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,680
She doesn't deserve our Master.

101
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
She looks so ordinary.

102
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,960
She can't be Luo Shui's girlfriend.

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,320
I don't believe it.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,560
Those people are so mean.

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
They're just trying to get rid of Yuan Sen

106
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,320
and even attack Mi Fen.

107
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
That's too much.

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,720
So, what are you going to do?

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,040
I'll propose to her.

110
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,400
You're so ugly.

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,640
How dare you confess to Luo Shui?

112
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,800
You should look at yourself in the mirror.

113
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
That's right.

114
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,080
Stay away from Luo Shui.

115
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,880
You don't deserve it.

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,800
You don't deserve Jiayi.

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
How could this happen?

118
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,840
I can't stand it anymore.

119
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,560
There are still many people behind you.

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
I'll read it for you.

121
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,560
People should know their own self.

122
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,880
Please let me go.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,880
Stop it.

124
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,480
You're making me dizzy.

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,400
Stop reading it.

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,840
You can't stand it, right?

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,520
Give it to me.

128
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,520
Luo Shui sent Weibo.

129
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Hello, everyone.

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,320
I'm Luo Shui.

131
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,600
I want to clarify

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,720
some photos and rumors

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
about Luocheng.

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,880
My real name is Yuan Sen.

135
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,960
I'm a student of the Department of Fine Arts in Haizhou.

136
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,240
I wore this mask before.

137
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,520
I didn't want to be an outsider

138
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,960
and get attention.

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
But now that everyone knows

140
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,360
my real identity,

141
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,720
I've already

142
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,080
put this mask on

143
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,080
for you.

144
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,680
I won't keep hitting you.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,640
As for that girl in the photo,

152
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,800
she's not my girlfriend.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
Because

154
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
I haven't confessed my love to her.

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,040
Floating in Refelation

156
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,840
Little girl,

157
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,320
if you watch this video,

158
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,640
please come downstairs.

159
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,960
I'll wait for you

160
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,680
waiting for you downstairs.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,880
Why are you still watching?

162
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,960
Go, go, get off the building.

163
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,720
Do you really want to be my girlfriend?

164
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,240
I do.

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,720
Oh.

166
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,440
You two are both here?

167
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,200
What's this?

168
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,720
This is the confession activity

169
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
that the boss was inspired by rice.

170
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:36,840
This is the list of the things.

171
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,240
As long as 1314,

172
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,760
you can have true love for a lifetime.

173
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,680
If this set had been launched earlier,

174
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
Han wouldn't have spent 800 yuan

175
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,920
on the price of the original three.

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,320
The maximum loss is 1314.

177
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,480
Here you are.

178
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,800
No need.

179
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,360
Just treat it as my share.

180
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,200
Han, you're so stingy.

181
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,760
You think you can just take it?

182
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,120
Yuan Cai,

183
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,280
I think you can keep the 800 yuan

184
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
on your own.

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,760
When Han confesses in the future,

186
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,680
you'll pay the bill.

187
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,200
I...

188
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
I don't need to confess.

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,080
Didn't everyone say

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,520
it was easy to confess to you?

191
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,160
What?

192
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,200
You don't understand at all?

193
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,440
Right.

194
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,160
If it's easy, you can confess first.

195
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,360
Keep this book.

196
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,400
Study hard.

197
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,600
No need.

198
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,520
Okay.

199
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,440
If you don't read it,

200
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,400
I'll read it for you.

201
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,120
Confession is a sacred thing.

202
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,400
There are many rules.

203
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,320
First, you have to choose a special day.

204
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
And before confessing,

205
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,080
you have to test if the other person likes you.

206
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
First,

207
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,600
when you call the other person,

208
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,720
if the other person answers,

209
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,240
it means the other person likes you.

210
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,680
You're in a relationship.

211
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
You give gifts.

212
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,960
How do you know

213
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
what to give?

214
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
I'm afraid you'll get hot.

215
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
Our Yuan Qing said

216
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,840
she likes me

217
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,240
because I'm a little cute.

218
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
I'm full.

219
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Come to my office.

220
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,520
Do you need anything?

221
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,480
I need your help.

222
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,560
I need to go to the bathroom.

223
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,880
Why are there

224
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,280
all the tomato sauce on my pants?

225
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,080
I was going to change the clothes for the shoot.

226
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,840
Go get them.

227
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,320
Do you need my help?

228
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,120
Every time I meet you,

229
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,960
I'll wear beautiful clothes

230
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,200
and different clothes from usual.

231
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,560
I ordered a box.

232
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,640
Help me eat it.

233
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,400
If you don't eat it,

234
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
I'll have to throw it away.

235
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,920
Don't throw it away.

236
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,960
It's a waste.

237
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,440
Third,

238
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
in front of the person you like,

239
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,960
the other person will pay special attention to their image

240
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,040
and act.

241
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,440
Well,

242
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,040
I haven't eaten the rice noodles.

243
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,520
Can I have a bowl of rice noodles

244
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,800
with a bowl of rice noodles?

245
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm not hungry.

246
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm full.

247
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,680
I'm full.

248
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,560
I'm full.

249
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm full.

250
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm full.

251
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm full.

252
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
I'm full.

253
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,040
I'm full.

254
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,280
Can I pack up and eat with him?

255
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,080
Up to you.

256
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,800
Here you are.

257
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,680
I don't want it.

258
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,360
You eat.

259
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:20,840
I don't want it.

260
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,480
I don't want to eat fried chicken for a week.

261
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,720
I ate too much today.

262
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,160
You ate too much.

263
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,680
I ate too much today.

264
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,560
I have to go to the hospital later.

265
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,280
Jiang Dan,

266
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,200
you look good in my dress.

267
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,080
If it weren't for the fried chicken,

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,960
my pants would be dirty.

269
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,200
I wouldn't have been able to wear it.

270
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,520
I'll put it on for you.

271
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,600
I have to put it on for you.

272
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
Jiang Dan.

273
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,880
You left your phone in my office.

274
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,320
Thanks.

275
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,520
Classmate,

276
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,560
this isn't a playground.

277
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,120
It's dangerous to shoot here.

278
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,240
The last one

279
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,240
is also the most important one.

280
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,320
The person who likes you

281
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,680
will take a better look at you than himself.

282
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,360
The person who likes you is a little turtle.

283
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,760
It symbolizes a long love.

284
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,680
I'll give 999 roses to the girl.

285
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,600
The rose tea made of roses is beautiful and delicious.

286
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,080
The lipstick has the power

287
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,320
to resist every girl.

288
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,640
The U-shaped lipstick

289
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,640
must be suitable for girls who love to study.

290
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,920
What's up?

291
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,760
Isn't it the New Year's Day soon?

292
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,040
Do you remember our traditional party?

293
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,720
Of course.

294
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Let's invite more people this year.

295
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,520
Who do you want to invite?

296
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,520
For example, Yuan Sen's girlfriend, Mi Fen,

297
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,840
and the people in the same room as her.

298
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,240
You want to invite簡單?

299
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,520
There are many people.

300
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,200
It's more lively.

301
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,280
Okay.

302
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,600
I'll invite them.

303
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,440
Han.

304
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,520
The swimming competition in the city

305
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,280
is starting to be registered.

306
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
Do you want to join?

307
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
No.

308
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,040
Try it.

309
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Don't persuade me.

310
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,640
I won't join.

311
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,480
I think

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,640
Dazheng is hard to get out of Nan Yuan's shadow.

313
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,440
Yes.

314
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,160
They used to be the winners of the competition together.

315
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,840
He must believe in Nan Yuan

316
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
when he participated in the competition.

317
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,120
He must be sad.

318
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,600
Even your Zifeng is good,

319
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,360
but Zifeng doesn't believe in her.

320
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
That's also my decision.

321
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,000
Turn around.

322
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,620
Nurse.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,840
Good morning.

324
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,620
Ms. Ramen.

325
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
I'm waiting for Mr. Hang.

326
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,640
Okay.

327
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,440
Let's take a rest.

328
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,560
I want to invite you to join the party with us.

329
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,600
Do you have time?

330
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,880
Yes.

331
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,600
So I invite you to join us.

332
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,760
Go. Go.

333
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Go. Go.

334
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,600
By the way,

335
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
what's the gift you want to give to Dr. Han?

336
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,800
The 800 yuan from the cafe

337
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,760
is from his shop.

338
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,840
This time I invite you to join the party.

339
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
You must pay me back.

340
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,920
The 800 yuan is the salary of our cleaning shop.

341
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,800
No.

342
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,360
Yuan Sen told me.

343
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,560
He said that

344
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,640
someone is cleaning the floor.

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,960
He doesn't need to invite anyone.

346
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,720
Dr. Han bought the 800 yuan from his shop.

347
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,280
I tell you.

348
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,440
He must have done it because he likes...

349
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,040
Don't talk nonsense.

350
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,800
Yuan Sen.

351
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,040
Come on.

352
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,840
Okay. Okay.

353
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,040
Okay. Okay.

354
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,960
See you later.

355
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
Sheng has always been a warm-hearted person.

356
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,520
Besides,

357
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,080
it's about Yuan Sen's happiness.

358
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,960
It's normal for him to help.

359
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,520
I see.

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,880
But Sheng's heart

361
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,440
is used to care about others.

362
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,280
He really doesn't care

363
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,280
about himself at all.

364
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,920
What's wrong with him?

365
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,040
The swimming competition in the city

366
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,160
is about to start.

367
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,640
Sheng hasn't signed up yet.

368
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,320
He used to be a swimmer.

369
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,160
But

370
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,280
after what he went through last year,

371
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,000
he never went to the water again.

372
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,560
He refused to participate in all the competitions.

373
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,560
What happened

374
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,880
at that time?

375
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,720
That day,

376
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
the wind was strong and the waves were fast.

377
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,200
But I don't know why

378
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,040
Sheng insisted on going to the water.

379
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,680
He was drowning.

380
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,800
I saved him.

381
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
Since then,

382
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,240
he seems to have a heavy psychological influence on the water.

383
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
Jiang Dan,

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,320
you're a psychologist, right?

385
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
You should have a way.

386
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,640
Besides,

387
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,240
you're close to Sheng.

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,840
You can persuade him.

389
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,280
I think he'll listen to you.

390
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,040
Okay?

391
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,440
Senior,

392
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,080
why don't you persuade him?

393
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,960
Didn't you say

394
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,200
that you're the most special person in his heart?

395
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,240
I've tried all the ways I can think of.

396
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
It's useless.

397
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,080
But he doesn't listen to me.

398
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,880
Besides,

399
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,520
I don't know how to persuade him.

400
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,680
I've come up with a way these days.

401
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,480
I think

402
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,960
maybe Sheng can be excited

403
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,280
by watching his previous video.

404
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,400
I edited all the clips

405
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,600
of his previous awards.

406
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,280
I put them all here.

407
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,960
Week One

408
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,960
Senior, bye.

409
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,360
Bye.

410
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,080
Bye, Senior.

411
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,360
Come on.

412
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,920
evaporated

413
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,340
Those times they spent together

414
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,460
is one of them

415
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,740
Ohio

416
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,240
That list of times

417
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,180
is in theagle

418
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:43,580
We used to have each other

419
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,300
Please don't call me that name again.

420
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,960
I'll always be your minister.

421
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,720
Thank you,TRUPID.

422
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,800
No problem.

423
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,040
Miss Du,

424
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,260
after the usual desert trip,

425
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,720
we'll late on our trip.

426
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,840
And you can't forget about me and Miss Hu ziji.

427
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,240
If you have any questions,

428
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,500
don't worry, listen to this.

429
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,240
Then, we can make some누구� lecturing!

430
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,360
Come on, sit here.

431
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
Come on, sit here.

432
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
Sit down.

433
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,280
Sit down, everyone.

434
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,920
I think

435
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,760
before we eat,

436
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,840
let's play a game.

437
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:55,600
Sure.

438
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,920
What game?

439
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,680
I bought this

440
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,320
New Year's gift for you online.

441
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,920
There's a small card inside.

442
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,760
You can just

443
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,640
carry out this task.

444
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's play.

445
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,960
You...

446
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,200
I'll go first.

447
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,240
I'll go first.

448
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,840
Okay.

449
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,320
So, please hug me

450
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,560
and be my identity.

451
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,240
I didn't expect the size of the paper

452
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,000
to be so big when I bought it.

453
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's just forget about it.

454
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,720
No, no, no.

455
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,320
No.

456
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,200
Let's just forget about it.

457
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,080
No, no, no.

458
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,440
Yes.

459
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,120
One, two, three, four, five.

460
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,000
I think

461
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,080
it's not an apple or a card.

462
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,960
It's clearly a dog food.

463
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,760
I've checked.

464
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,080
It's dog food.

465
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
Yes, it's dog food.

466
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,920
What? Let me see.

467
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,600
Are you okay?

468
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
A dance of a girl group.

469
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,240
I'm not a girl group.

470
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,120
Come on.

471
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,080
It's okay even if you don't know it.

472
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,240
We can watch the video.

473
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,760
Yes.

474
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,280
Come on.

475
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:21,880
Come on.

476
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,760
Come on.

477
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,280
Come on.

478
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,040
Come on.

479
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,720
Help me.

480
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,120
Help me.

481
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
Hug me.

482
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:27,760
No.

483
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,920
I can't.

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,080
Come on.

485
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,480
I'll put it here.

486
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:31,920
Jian Dan.

487
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,360
If the paper is too big,

488
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
I'll definitely hug you.

489
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,960
You can do it after you finish it.

490
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,640
Yes.

491
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,760
Come on.

492
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,880
Come on.

493
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,040
Come on.

494
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,880
Hug me.

495
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,360
Xiao Ning.

496
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:08,560
Mr. Xiang.

497
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,360
Qi Ifang.

498
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,760
trainings for your team.

499
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,740
I...

500
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,260
I'm lovesick.

501
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,540
I don't expect that you...

502
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,480
I..

503
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,860
I'm lovesick.

504
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,740
I absolutely love you.

505
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,860
I'm lovesick.

506
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,300
Yes, exactly.

507
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,380
I'm lovesick.

508
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,460
Qi Yesheng.

509
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,260
He's lovesick.

510
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,220
He almost falls apart when he was young.

511
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
I'll be the first one to be the next one.

512
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,500
Come here. Let me see.

513
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,220
No.

514
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,220
Let me see.

515
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,780
Let me see.

516
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,980
Your first kiss is still here.

517
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,900
Wait.

518
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,700
Your first kiss

519
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,620
is not a kiss of

520
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,260
hanging with Han, is it?

521
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,260
First kiss.

522
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,100
Why should I answer two questions?

523
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,100
It's not fair.

524
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,220
Who?

525
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,060
Who asks me?

526
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,740
It's because...

527
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,460
It's yours.

528
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,540
Burn kiss to the right or

529
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,540
indicative kiss to the left.

530
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,740
It's unique.

531
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,860
I'll have four.

532
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,860
Choose one, choose one.

533
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,180
tired

534
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,620
That's enough

535
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,360
Everybody

536
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,780
lock the door

537
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,460
and wait for me

538
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,720
Yes

539
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,180
I got it

540
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,540
Line up

541
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,740
Please

543

Please

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,320
Line up

547
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,100
Yes

548
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,180
Friends

549
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,180
Please

550
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,200
You're here

551
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,740
We will nãof

552
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:03,980
Wait a minute.

553
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,740
Now,

554
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,460
I've been thinking about something for a long time.

555
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,740
I want to tell you.

556
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,940
Is he really going to kiss me?

557
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,220
But I'm not ready yet.

558
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,940
Pick up the egg.

559
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:45,700
Okay.

560
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,060
This is the New Year gift I prepared for you.

561
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,660
When you were at the swimming pool,

562
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,220
didn't your swimming goggles break?

563
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,700
I bought you a new one.

564
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,220
No matter what the reason was,

565
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,180
you gave up swimming.

566
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,140
I hope you can get your dream back and go swimming.

567
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,700
Who do you think you are?

568
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,020
Why are you talking about my dream?

569
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,060
I don't need you to care about my business.

570
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,740
Han Yansheng.

571
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,460
Don't follow me.
