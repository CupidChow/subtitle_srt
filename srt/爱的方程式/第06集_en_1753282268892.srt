1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A breeze blew through her curly hair and sweet face

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This love is a difficult one to untie, and it's expressed with sincerity

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Growing up slowly, she is a flower that blooms

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Will it be too scary? She also asked herself

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Tipatia, the one who is popular

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Only the sound of the flute will melt into the sound

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Tipatia, the one who is beautiful

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Love is complicated, and there is a smile to answer

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The Love by Hypnotic

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Love by Hypnotic

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The Love by Hypnotic

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 10

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Next group

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:42,280
The chance studies are different from what we encountered in the éifféry

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,780
It's like the smell of the fairy hotels

17
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,280
and falling cloud

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
is the practical application of mathematical probability statistics

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,280
in real life.

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,280
That's all about our group's content.

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
Group C, next.

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Professor Wang, I don't understand.

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
He said it so well.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Why did he give us group C?

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
This assignment is a team cooperation.

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,280
It needs the total score of PPT and speech.

27
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
He speaks well.

28
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
That can only represent his personal ability.

29
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,280
He turned off PPT.

30
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
Not only did he deny you,

31
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,280
but also your team.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,280
A team without cooperation,

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
no matter how good it is,

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
it can only get C.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
But...

36
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
No buts.

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Next group.

38
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Why did you turn off PPT?

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Do you know what C means to me?

40
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Let's talk about it later.

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
Let's go.

42
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Explain.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
There are some errors in PPT.

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Don't you know?

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
How is that possible?

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Look at it yourself.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
If I hadn't turned off PPT,

48
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
you wouldn't even get C.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
You wouldn't even get C.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Why did he give you

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,280
the number of the day before yesterday?

52
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
So over-reacting.

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
He didn't even tell me

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
what he did.

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
He knew that

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
PPT was wrong.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
He should have changed it.

58
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Even if he didn't,

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
he should have reminded you.

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,280
So this is his fault.

61
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Forget it.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
It's meaningless

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
to pursue Shanshan now.

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,280
I'll think about it.

65
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
What if I pursue Shanshan's tuition fee?

66
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Tumor?

67
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,280
I took the whole amount of money.

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
So I have high requirements for the score.

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
If you want to pay me tuition fee,

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,280
you have to quit school, right?

71
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
It's okay.

72
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
I'll think of a way.

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
I'll think of a way for you, too.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,280
I'll change my family account.

75
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Can you stop making me

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
do the cleaning?

77
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Sorry.

78
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
Be careful.

79
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
Excuse me.

80
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Xia Na,

81
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
what happened to you today?

82
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's go.

83
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,440
The part-time job at the cafe has been recruited.

84
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,920
But if you want to solve the problem,

85
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,960
you can ask Han.

86
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
I remember that there is a chance for a swimming pool.

87
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,520
It's simple.

88
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,880
The part-time job in the campus is usually less thought.

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,040
If you are in a hurry to find a job,

90
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,680
how about introducing a part-time job to you?

91
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,120
That's great.

92
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,920
You really helped me a lot.

93
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,560
You don't have to be so polite to me.

94
00:05:59,160 --> 00:05:59,720
Boss,

95
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,760
please take care of my friend.

96
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll trouble you.

97
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,680
Don't worry.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,840
Give your dad a good one.

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,720
Okay.

100
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,400
Thank you, boss.

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,080
I'm leaving. Bye.

102
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,680
Bye.

103
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Simple.

104
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,160
How is it?

105
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,400
I've already told Manager Chen.

106
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,000
He agreed to work part-time here.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,560
But it takes a month to try it out.

108
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm fine.

109
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,840
Manager Chen is my dad's good friend.

110
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
So don't worry.

111
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,120
He will take good care of you.

112
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,200
Thank you, Senior.

113
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,040
If you need any help in the future,

114
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,280
you can always find me.

115
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,520
Don't be so polite to me.

116
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
You are Sheng's good friend.

117
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,520
Of course, you are my good friend.

118
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,600
In the future,

119
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,920
you can come to me

120
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,000
no matter what happens.

121
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,760
We haven't sent each other a WeChat message yet, right?

122
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,800
Let me add you.

123
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,220
You...

124
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,600
What are you looking at?

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,560
Speaking of which,

127
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,520
I haven't seen Jian Dan for days.

128
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,760
Really?

129
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,400
Yes.

130
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,920
I heard from the rock climbing club that

131
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
Jian Dan always leaves

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
after cleaning up

133
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,120
and arranging tasks.

134
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,360
Right.

135
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
You always look at the direction of the rock climbing club.

136
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,000
Do you want to go to him?

137
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,480
Or you...

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
Why do you always ask me about Jian Dan?

139
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,080
Have I ever asked him

140
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,120
about Jian Dan?

141
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,200
I don't think so.

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,520
But I think he does.

143
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Let's get down to business.

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
The president of KOSE

145
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,080
has come to you.

146
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
He wants to invite you to

147
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,960
get the job.

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,200
After all, our swimming club

149
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,720
is the most influential club.

150
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,600
Okay.

151
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,800
Jian Dan.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,400
Jian Dan.

153
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,360
Tomorrow,

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,000
there will be a club

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,120
holding an event here.

156
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,600
The person in charge will come later.

157
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,640
Please look forward to it.

158
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,440
Which club?

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
What's your name?

160
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,400
Okay.

161
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,160
Jian Dan.

162
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Yin Fen?

163
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,100
Here.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,520
Jian Dan.

165
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
It's so pretty.

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,760
Let me see.

167
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,360
Turn around.

168
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:26,960
Let me see.

169
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Which one is pretty?

170
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,760
It's pretty.

171
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,160
Why is it not pretty?

172
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,560
I didn't expect that our boss

173
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,960
is a crazy fan of Kouzi.

174
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Just treat it as a service for your employees.

175
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,560
It's so cute.

176
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,960
I want to turn this service into a movie.

177
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,560
Why do you like money so much?

178
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,360
I like it.

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,160
It's simple.

180
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,960
Customers who are sitting on the 7th and 12th

181
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,760
want coke.

182
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,560
You can give them a ride.

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,360
Okay.

184
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,360
Beauty, have fun.

185
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,160
Beauty, have fun.

186
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,160
Which way is the dressing room?

187
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,360
Go straight ahead.

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
Thank you.

189
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,760
What did he ask you just now?

190
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
He said he was a water-repellent assistant.

191
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,160
He asked me how to get to the dressing room.

192
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,560
Water-repellent assistant?

193
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,760
Water-repellent assistant?

194
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,760
Thank you.

195
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,560
It's okay.

196
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,640
College of Science and Technology

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,400
Shating

198
00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:18,200
미�

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
Hmm.

200
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,080
Yuan Zeng has become the assistant of Prince Luo Shui.

201
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,280
Hello.

202
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,440
Your coke.

203
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,280
Thank you.

204
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,760
Sir, I'm sorry.

205
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
If you want to drink something,

206
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,960
just tell me. I'll get it for you, okay?

207
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,560
No need.

208
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,360
Just let him...

209
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,920
Just let him send it to me.

210
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,720
Okay.

211
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
It's simple.

212
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,400
What kind of service attitude were you just now?

213
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,080
Manager, listen to me.

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,400
Don't explain.

215
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Don't explain.

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,040
Now, pour a drink for him right away.

217
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
Then apologize to him in person.

218
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,000
You...

219
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,200
Go. Go. Go.

220
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,160
Okay.

221
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,000
Go.

222
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
A cup of coke.

223
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,240
Okay.

224
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,560
It's simple.

225
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,880
My stomach hurts.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Help me find some drinks for the customers over there.

227
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,120
Thank you. Thank you.

228
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,080
My stomach hurts.

229
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,160
Put the shoes here.

230
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,120
Okay.

231
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,000
It's simple.

232
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
What are you doing?

233
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
You stole the drinks for the customers.

234
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,800
I didn't steal the drinks.

235
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,400
You didn't drink it.

236
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
You even have the straw on your mouth.

237
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,240
What are you doing?

238
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:55,960
Is it done?

239
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,480
It's done.

240
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,440
Hurry up. Take it away.

241
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,760
Hurry up.

242
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,720
Hurry up.

243
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
Stand there.

244
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,720
Listen to me.

245
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm warning you for the last time.

246
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,840
If you do it again,

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,920
you'll be fired.

248
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,720
I'm so angry.

249
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
This is...

250
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,640
Who is it?

251
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,680
Water.

252
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,400
Letuis D Master!

253
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,680
Don't crack it.

254
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,000
D Master...

255
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,560
Did I tell you to take a picture?

256
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,960
Go out for Sure 이 chore.

257
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,000
Can you shout one more time?

258
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,880
Peek a secret.

259
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,760
There's a crack in the acid.

260
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,320
Get out.

261
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Your Highness, what's wrong?

262
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,880
Who are you?

263
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,760
Get out!

264
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,760
Well,

265
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,400
Master Luo Shui, don't get me wrong.

266
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,840
I just want to get a private report.

267
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,520
One more.

268
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,280
No!

269
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,800
No?

270
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,680
It's broken.

271
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,600
You can break it yourself.

272
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,520
Or I'll help you.

273
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,400
Well,

274
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,080
don't be so polite.

275
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,200
Go!

276
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
Stop!

277
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,880
Don't chase me.

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,720
Your Highness,

279
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,960
I'm so sorry.

280
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,880
I didn't see him come in.

281
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm so sorry.

282
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
It's our job.

283
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,320
It's okay.

285
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,040
Why does your voice

286
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,360
sound so familiar?

287
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,400
Have we met before?

288
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,640
You've got the wrong person.

289
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,480
But it's very familiar.

290
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,520
Isn't this the bag

291
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
Yuan Sen just took in his hand?

292
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,400
Could it be...

293
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,880
What if it's not?

294
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,920
Will he just

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,280
pretend to be innocent?

296
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,680
If there's nothing else,

297
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I'll continue to put on makeup.

298
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,520
Okay.

299
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,040
I'll wait for you outside.

300
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,600
Yuan Sen.

301
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,720
Yifan.

302
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,880
Please keep this a secret for me.

303
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,800
You look revving up all the time.

304
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Okay.

305
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,440
I've just found my lost brother later.

306
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,800
Well,

307
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,520
you're...

308
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,480
I'll get going.

309
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,480
Give me a minute.

310
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,520
Hold on.

311
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
Help me to look for someone else.

312
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,480
?

313
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,560
I'm here.

314
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,960
Your Highness.

315
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Please excuse me.

316
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,000
I've got something.

317
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,320
Let me look around

318
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,440
to find out if there's anything I can't find.

319
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,080
Nope.

320
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,920
But you're already here and saying that thanks to networking.

321
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,480
Meaningless!

322
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,480
Hey, I'm not bad at service.

323
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,320
It's really you!

324
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
I'm not afraid of you.

325
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
I'm not afraid of you.

326
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,920
Your Highness, don't worry.

327
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,040
I'll keep it a secret for you.

328
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,040
I swear.

329
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:29,840
Thank you.

330
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,880
I like cosplay.

331
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
But I don't like to be paid much attention.

332
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,640
I know.

333
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
Did I think differently from you?

334
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,680
Did I disappoint you?

335
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,560
No.

336
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,440
You're much more handsome than I thought.

337
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,200
No.

338
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,520
I mean,

339
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,680
although you look cold and awkward,

340
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,800
I can't get you and Luo Shui together.

341
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,440
No.

342
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,000
I mean,

343
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,720
you're handsome when you're Yuan Sen.

344
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,640
And you're...

345
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,880
You're now the Princess Luo Shui.

346
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,840
I just can't accept it.

347
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,640
So I...

348
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
I don't think it's right.

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,800
The show is about to start.

350
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,000
I'd better get ready.

351
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,160
I'll wait for you at the door.

352
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,240
Your Highness Luo Shui, Yuan Sen...

353
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,840
Yuan...

354
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,480
Okay.

355
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:42,280 --> 00:20:10,200
I actually nan the

357
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,120
Wrong?

358
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,200
No

359
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,260
Our lunch

360
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,340
Who's that?

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,920
Ladies and gentlemen

362
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,540
Let's welcome today's stars

363
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,920
Your Royal Highness

364
00:20:36,920 --> 00:21:04,860
Power Jasmine

365
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:34,860

369
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:54,740
Okay.

370
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,940
Maybeland.

371
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,140
OK, you go away Championship.

372
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,060
I won't.

373
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,660
If you didn't tell the manager,

374
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,780
I wouldn't have gone to the club

375
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,820
and lost my job.

376
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,060
It's fine if you don't want this job.

377
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,420
Of course you don't care.

378
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,100
But...

379
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,740
Forget it.

380
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,820
I don't want to explain it to you.

381
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,460
You said

382
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,380
I didn't check the PPT in advance.

383
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,620
What do you mean?

384
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,060
I mean...

385
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,140
It's not important.

386
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:26,980
What's important is

387
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,900
to stay away from me.

388
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,380
Who do you want to stay away from?

389
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,820
I don't care.

390
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

391
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

392
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

393
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

394
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

395
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

396
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

397
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

398
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

399
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

400
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

401
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

402
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

403
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

404
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

405
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,020
I don't want to be a burden to you.

406
00:23:49,120 --> 00:24:16,140
Qi Nian's

407
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,740
My teacher has explained to me

408
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:18,660
what happened

409
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,180
in Korea,

410
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:19,980
when Hong Kong and China

411
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,460
were in hiding.

412
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:29,260
He said

413
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,740
in one day,

414
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,500
China has turbo-varied

415
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,020
the warehouse of human moral Ice å

416
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,540
and japanese police

417
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,740
題材 pointed at the city,

418
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,700
in a very continua

419
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,140
direction

420
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,240
It's an instructional di envelope.

421
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,740
Please give the paper to my mail

422
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,420
and submit it

423
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,780
within a month

424
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,180
The paper will be recommended

425
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,260
to the magazine company

426
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:55,460
by the biological magazine過territorial Office.

427
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:56,660
I understand you.

428
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:10,580
Senior.

429
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,500
simply

430
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,820
Manager Chen told me

431
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,340
about the work.

432
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,540
I'm sorry. I failed you.

433
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,980
Don't take it to heart.

434
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,260
By the way,

435
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,900
this cafe is hiring people now.

436
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,700
I think you can try it.

437
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,500
No need.

438
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,580
I've found a way to keep Jiang Xiaoxiang happy.

439
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,860
I don't need to find a part-time job anymore.

440
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,460
Really? What's the solution?

441
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,700
Just use the paper.

442
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,460
It's not easy to get the bonus.

443
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,540
I advise you not to be too optimistic.

444
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,060
I don't need you to worry about me.

445
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,060
Li Ouri,

446
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,300
I have something else to handle.

447
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,020
I'm leaving now.

448
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,140
Okay.

449
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,140
Method cream cake, byebye.

450
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,980
Your dishes are a little wireless.

451
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,840
Losing weight.

452
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,580
Good bye.

453
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,740
personelle?

454
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,300
Come with me.

455
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,660
Why?

456
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,300
Jindan.

457
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,500
This...

458
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,100
Don't bother Jindan.

459
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,620
She's writing a essay

460
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,740
for the scholarship.

461
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,700
Enjoy it.

462
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,700
Jindan is working too hard.

463
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,980
I have to help her.

464
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,500
What do you want to do?

465
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,300
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,900
Han.

467
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,380
Han.

468
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,900
I've been looking for you in the office.

469
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,780
I thought you were here.

470
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,500
What's up?

471
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,300
I've made a few

472
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,580
plans for the transfer.

473
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,180
Look, choose a place.

474
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,740
What transfer?

475
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,020
A former member of our swimming club.

476
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,060
She's about to be forced to drop out.

477
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,420
I want to hold a meeting for her.

478
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,540
Who?

479
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,460
Who?

480
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,820
Jindan.

481
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:20,980
What?

482
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,740
You don't know, do you?

483
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,180
Jindan got a C in the selection class.

484
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,180
She's destined to be disqualified.

485
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,700
Poor Jindan.

486
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm afraid she'll be forced to drop out

487
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
because she can't pay the tuition next semester.

488
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:39,940
But now,

489
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,220
I have a chance

490
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,460
to make her change her mind.

491
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,820
Has her been to laughs cabaret?

492
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,260
It's comeback time,

493
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,340
right?

494
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,580
What the heck do you want to talk about?

495
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
I've used these methods

496
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,660
to publish three papers

497
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,780
in the important period.

498
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,660
The summary is too good.

499
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,580
You have to use

500
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,580
any paper

501
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,580
you've seen before.

502
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,380
It's just a part of my mind.

503
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,260
If you want to publish a paper,

504
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,500
you still have a long way to go.

505
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,420
I haven't finished reading it yet.

506
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,780
If you want to learn,

507
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,060
you can go to the Western Cafe

508
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,020
at five o'clock every day.

509
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,380
I'll give you an hour.

510
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,340
Really?

511
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,060
Why did you help me?

512
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,820
I'm also responsible for the PVT.

513
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,620
I found that the data was wrong.

514
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,620
I shouldn't have sent you a WeChat message

515
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,060
and changed it myself.

516
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,380
Then, all these things wouldn't have happened.

517
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,740
Just take it as my compensation.

518
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,020
Did you send me WeChat messages?

519
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,420
I didn't receive any messages at all.

520
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,100
Look at it yourself.

521
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,020
How could I?

522
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,020
Then...

523
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,020
Why didn't I receive any messages?

524
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,560
Sincere Opinion

525
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:06,180
feather

526
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:16,180
How many times should I touch my heart from the beginning?

527
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Some look, some words, I still don't miss it.

528
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:31,180
My eyes are red like a poem.

529
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:38,180
Those young days, they are ordinary but interesting.

530
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:44,180
In the time, the wind blows and the birds fly.

531
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:51,180
Those broken pasts, the vague names.

532
00:30:51,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Fortunately, we once had each other.

533
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:08,180
Those young days, my heart is too slow.

534
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:14,180
But one day, the promise becomes a legend.

535
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:21,180
Those broken pasts, they are never forgotten.

536
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:30,180
The color of life is not worth it.
