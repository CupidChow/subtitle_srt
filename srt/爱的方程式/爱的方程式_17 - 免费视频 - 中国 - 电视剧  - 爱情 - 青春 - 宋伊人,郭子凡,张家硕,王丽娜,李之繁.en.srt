What did you just say?

Give me more booze!

16
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,060
I can still drink!

17
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,674
The restaurant closed.

18
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,860
There is no more booze.

19
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,980
SpongeBob!

20
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,540
Hey, madam,

21
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,100
why are you hugging a tree?

22
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,460
What are you? A monkey?

23
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:26,340
You're the monkey.

24
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,020
You.

25
00:03:29,285 --> 00:03:30,060
Climb up there!

26
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,540
No way.

27
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:34,780
If you don't climb up there,

28
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,020
I'll post your poker photos online.

29
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,434
Let the world see them.

30
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,862
I'll show the world

31
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,851
how you looked in a dress.

32
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:45,948
Jiang Zhishan, don't you dare!

33
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,260
Why wouldn't I dare?

34
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,860
Hey, tell me,

35
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,460
where did you hide the poker card?

36
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,260
Trying to trick me?

37
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,580
No way that's ever going to work.

38
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,020
I'm not telling you anything.

39
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,140
Especially not that I hid them

40
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,460
in the Rock Climbing Club's locker.

41
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,340
The locker?

42
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,325
- The locker.
- Let's go.

43
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,740
More booze!

44
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,548
- Sir!
- Taxi!

45
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,260
Taxi!

46
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,660
Sir!

47
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,540
Han, wake up!

48
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:44,840
It's already noon.

49
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:52,700
How long was I asleep?

50
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,222
You're the one who got so drunk.

51
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:56,700
You blacked out.

52
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,780
How did I get back last night?

53
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,820
I don't even remember.

54
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,460
Jian Dan brought you back.

55
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,860
Jian Dan?

56
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,020
Monkey.

57
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:12,540
Get me my clothes.

58
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:22,620
What is it?

59
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,955
Where's my necklace?

60
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:25,380
What necklace?

61
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,380
This is bad.

62
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,244
After I got drunk last night,

63
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:32,900
did I do anything strange?

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,691
How would I know?

65
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,940
After you got drunk,

66
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,220
you ran out of the restaurant.

67
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,620
Jian Dan ran after you.

68
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,220
No idea what happened afterwards.

69
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,500
Oh no.

70
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,580
Jian Dan, what time is it?

71
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,420
It's about 1 PM.

72
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,020
It's already 1 PM?

73
00:06:23,954 --> 00:06:24,820
My head hurts so bad.

74
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,062
I'm never drinking that much again.

75
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,548
Hang on.

76
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,274
I'll make you some honey water.

77
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,500
Thanks.

78
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,420
(Hopefully things just keep
getting better from now on.)

79
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,020
Who sent this?

80
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,660
I can't read a single word on it.

81
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,260
Jian Dan.

82
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,700
Can you tell what this is?

83
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,542
It's Greek.

84
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,300
Greek?

85
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,100
Wait, you actually know Greek?

86
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,900
Then what does it say?

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Hypatia.

88
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,420
She was a Greek mathematician.

89
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,540
I think the only person I know

90
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,140
who knows Greek is Han Yansheng.

91
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,940
It has to be from him.

92
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,100
Didn't I give him

93
00:07:19,131 --> 00:07:20,100
a gift list?

94
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,860
And this is what he picked?

95
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,660
I think it's pretty cool.

96
00:07:26,171 --> 00:07:26,780
If you like it,

97
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,300
you can have it.

98
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,500
No way.

99
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,488
That's your birthday gift
from Han Yansheng.

100
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,940
It's fine.

101
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Think of it as a thank you

102
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,580
for sticking up for me.

103
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,180
So you heard about that?

104
00:07:39,902 --> 00:07:41,580
Everything I said was true, though.

105
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,177
We all want what's best for the club.

106
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,260
Don't worry.

107
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,980
I won't take those comments personally.

108
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,931
I'll make adjustments
to the training plan

109
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:49,400
based on what's actually needed.

110
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,740
That's great.

111
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,800
Everyone's going to be
so happy to hear that.

112
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:54,920
Alright, I'm heading to class.

113
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,260
Okay, see you later.

114
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,900
I really like the necklace.

115
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,980
You waited here just for me?

116
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,700
Monkey told me

117
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,780
you brought me back last night.

118
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,300
Did I do anything...

119
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,060
out of the ordinary?

120
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,420
Yeah.

121
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,460
So that means...

122
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,100
you agreed?

123
00:09:03,028 --> 00:09:04,820
Like I even had a choice.

124
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,020
Let's grab lunch.

125
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,220
Let's go before the foods are gone.

126
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,628
The cafeteria's that way.

127
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,040
Alright.

128
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,948
Move!

129
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,940
Careful!

130
00:09:57,754 --> 00:09:59,100
Are you okay?

131
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:00,260
Yeah, I'm good.

132
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,100
Good thing I was fast.

133
00:10:07,022 --> 00:10:08,000
How's it going?

134
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
Got a boyfriend?

135
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,729
Of course.

136
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,955
When?

137
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:17,169
How come I didn't know?

138
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,333
Stop gossiping.

139
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,620
Is there something on my face?

140
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,700
No.

141
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:10,297
Ugh! What are you doing?

142
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,980
Wait, hold on!

143
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,340
I was...

144
00:11:12,777 --> 00:11:13,460
Wrong person!

145
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,500
It was a mistake.

146
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,955
Who were you trying to grab?

147
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,333
I'm kind of sick of this place's food.

148
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,377
Let's go somewhere else.

149
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,380
Young people these days...

150
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,755
No cutting in line.

151
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,020
I'm heading upstairs.

152
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,580
Do you need anything else?

153
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,300
Wait a second.

154
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,300
Hello?

155
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:33,420
Hello?

156
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
I got the bag

157
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,820
you ordered overseas.

158
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,780
I thought you were trying to fool me

159
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,911
with that random necklace.

160
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,900
Turns out you bought me
the bag I wanted.

161
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,820
Thanks.

162
00:12:42,634 --> 00:12:43,234
Necklace?

163
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,400
When did I give you a necklace?

164
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,540
You gave it to me yesterday at the club.

165
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,177
Anyway, I didn't really like it.

166
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,340
So, I gave it to Jian Dan.

167
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,020
So you're saying

168
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,620
that wasn't from me, it was from you?

169
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,980
What are you talking about?

170
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,620
That wasn't for you!

171
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,260
Forget it. I won't even explain it.

172
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,980
Bye.

173
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,260
What a weirdo.

174
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,820
So the necklace wasn't for me?

175
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,140
Then, who was it for?

176
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,860
Zhishan, we're heading to lunch.

177
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,466
Are you coming?

178
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,420
Sure.

179
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,010
Let's go.

180
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:23,960
- Let's go.
- Come on.

181
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,600
You looked like you had
something to say just now.

182
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,100
It's nothing.

183
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,660
Alright then, I'm heading off.

184
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,220
Anyone here?

185
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,460
Is anyone here?

186
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Where is it?

187
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,300
Let's see how you plan
to blackmail me now.

188
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,380
Hey, what are you doing?

189
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:19,660
I'm staking out

190
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,820
the Rock Climbing Club.

191
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:23,300
Listen.

192
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,708
My instincts are never wrong.

193
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,020
Something's going on
between Han Yansheng and Jian Dan.

194
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm sure I'll catch some juicy gossip.

195
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:32,940
Alright, I get it.

196
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,260
Stop calling for nothing. Bye.

197
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,620
Finally found it.

198
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:04,580
What are you doing?

199
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,580
Stop filming.

200
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,022
Give me the camera. Hand it over.

201
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,740
Give it!

202
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,180
You seriously want my camera?

203
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,660
It's broad daylight!

204
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,060
And you're stealing?

205
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:15,100
I wasn't stealing!

206
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,020
Stop making things up!

207
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,460
Is this a kite?

208
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,060
You perv!

209
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,160
What even is this?

210
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,500
I swear I didn't mean to steal it.

211
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,620
What is this? Seriously?

212
00:17:29,645 --> 00:17:30,340
I'm not a fool.

213
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,140
Wait here a second.

214
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,511
I'll go grab something real quick.

215
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:36,460
What are you two doing here?

216
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,180
Ask him.

217
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,340
Did you steal from my locker?

218
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,700
No, I didn't! I swear!

219
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,560
Still denying it?

220
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,177
Where did you hide it? Give it back!

221
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,940
I didn't do it!

222
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,710
It's in his jacket.

223
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,355
- I didn't take it!
- It's in his jacket!

224
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,088
You actually stole my underwear?

225
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,860
It wasn't on purpose, I...

226
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,420
You perv!

227
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,140
Total creep!

228
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,451
I'm not a creep!

229
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,020
I...

230
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,380
It's a gift

231
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,740
for my girlfriend's birthday.

232
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,100
Who's your girlfriend?

233
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,180
Do me a favor.

234
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,222
I'll do whatever you say.

235
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,220
For real?

236
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,340
Whatever I say?

237
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,220
Deal.

238
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,580
Babe.

239
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,220
I absolutely love the gift you got me!

240
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:42,777
It even fits perfectly.

241
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,994
You're just so thoughtful.

242
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,980
Sorry, Honey.

243
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,300
I wanted to surprise you,

244
00:18:49,348 --> 00:18:51,457
but it kind of got ruined too fast.

245
00:18:53,337 --> 00:18:54,340
Alright, that's enough.

246
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,420
This is too cringe.

247
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,620
You two are really dating?

248
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,780
Of course! He's my boyfriend.

249
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Is there a problem?

250
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,060
I don't buy it.

251
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,620
I'll be watching you two closely.

252
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,340
Don't let me catch anything shady.

253
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,020
Hey, have you seen
Han Yansheng and Jian Dan?

254
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,480
Scram.

255
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,380
Got it.

256
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,740
Did you steal
more than just my underwear?

257
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
I already tore it up.

258
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,300
How dare you?

259
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,340
Sneaking into the locker room to steal?

260
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
I didn't steal anything!

261
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:40,620
Wait a second.

262
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,180
How did you know the poker cards
were in the locker room?

263
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,580
You told me

264
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,500
last night.

265
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,620
No way I did.

266
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,100
You must've tricked me

267
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,020
with some shady tactic!

268
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,740
You're overthinking it.

269
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,300
Come on, tell me.

270
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,860
What else did you do to me last night?

271
00:20:02,697 --> 00:20:03,500
What else?

272
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:04,940
You're imagining things.

273
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,819
Totally overthinking.

274
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,620
- Just tell me the truth!
- You're overthinking.

275
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,511
Seriously, you are.

276
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,420
Come back here!

277
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,320
Didn't she already have her birthday?

278
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:20,060
Why are we giving her cake again?

279
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Your aunt loves
making things difficult for me.

280
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,380
Seriously.

281
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,260
Monkey!

282
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,980
What were you saying behind my back?

283
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,700
No, I didn't say anything.

284
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,620
Right, Han? I didn't say a word.

285
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,660
Why would I say anything?

286
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,451
So you can say it but not admit it?

287
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,940
Don't think I didn't hear you.

288
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,540
Take it easy!

289
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,940
Ouch!

290
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,500
It hurts! Take it easy!

291
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,540
Jian Dan.

292
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,140
I want to tell you something.

293
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,220
He is taking photos!

294
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,748
Honey!

295
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,500
You even got my favorite cake?

296
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,020
You're the best!

297
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,220
What's going on?

298
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,300
I was about to ask you.

299
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,660
It's even pink
with little piglets on it!

300
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,700
What the...

301
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,940
Babe, let me feed you some soup.

302
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,740
Careful, it's hot. I'll blow on it.

303
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,860
Here you go, babe.

304
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,940
Careful, it's hot.

305
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,844
That's really good.

306
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:30,900
Glad you like it.

307
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,354
Honey.

308
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,700
Have a taste of your favorite dish.

309
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,620
Sure!

310
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,020
So good!

311
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,540
Alright, drop the act. He is gone.

312
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:48,980
Hey, you two!
Check out some couple necklaces.

313
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,980
These are actually really well made.

314
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,340
No thanks. We're good.

315
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
I want that one.

316
00:21:58,748 --> 00:21:59,340
Here, take it.

317
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,660
I don't want it.

318
00:22:01,422 --> 00:22:03,100
Do you still
want your girlfriend or not?

319
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,860
Fine. Okay.

320
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,220
Aren't you guys the Sheng-Dan ship?

321
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,740
How about a pair for the two of you?

322
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
You got it wrong.

323
00:22:17,133 --> 00:22:18,666
We're not actually a couple.

324
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:20,860
Sorry to bother you.

325
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,740
Weren't you about to say something?

326
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:27,714
What was it?

327
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:30,885
Nothing.

328
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,340
Looks like that guy left this behind.

329
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:45,480
I'll go return it.

330
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,571
You still haven't told me

331
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,266
who the necklace

332
00:22:53,266 --> 00:22:55,100
with Hypatia's name in Greek letters

333
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,820
was really for.

334
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,260
Hypatia?

335
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,980
Isn't she your math goddess?

336
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,260
And even your pen pal!

337
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,131
So it's true...

338
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:09,834
Yeah.

339
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,580
That necklace was meant for Jian Dan.

340
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,940
And...

341
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,844
She's my pen pal.

342
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:24,988
Wow, Han.
You totally kept us in the dark!

343
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,780
You two are seriously meant to be.

344
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,340
But...

345
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,340
Jian Dan still

346
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,780
doesn't know it was from you, right?

347
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,020
Don't tell her yet.

348
00:23:35,102 --> 00:23:36,060
I'm waiting for

349
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,800
the right moment.

350
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,060
What's up?

351
00:23:40,022 --> 00:23:41,244
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

352
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,820
Let's head back to the dorm. Come on!

353
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,220
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

354
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:46,850
- Bye!
- Bye!

355
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,260
Not bad.

356
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,260
You've been acting weird today.

357
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,540
Are you hiding something from me?

358
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,340
Nope.

359
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,365
I was just looking for you two.

360
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,020
Look at this.

361
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,480
A new ceramic art studio
just opened near the campus.

362
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,300
They let you make pottery for free!

363
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,288
Let's go together!

364
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,444
I don't know how to make pottery.

365
00:24:15,511 --> 00:24:17,100
That's okay. They can teach you!

366
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,740
We can even make matching couple mugs.

367
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:22,062
And we get to take them home for free.

368
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,251
Come on, let's go!

369
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,340
- Ask Yuan Sen to go with you.
- No way.

370
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,422
I want to make it for Yuan Sen.

371
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,580
Got it. I'll go with you.

372
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,500
Sounds pretty fun. Count me in.

373
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,260
Let's go.

374
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,860
Come on, let's grab food first.

375
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,005
I'm starving.

376
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,700
This one looks nice.

377
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,900
This looks super cute.

378
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,537
Hi, your pieces are all packed up.

379
00:25:43,244 --> 00:25:43,780
Here's yours.

380
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,460
What about mine?

381
00:25:48,244 --> 00:25:49,380
It turned out so pretty!

382
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,325
Can't believe I actually pulled it off.

383
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,060
Told you I'm clever.

384
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:55,280
I couldn't make a mug,
so I made a plate instead.

385
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,100
Looks good and useful.

386
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,400
It doesn't really look like you though.

387
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,222
Who said it was supposed to be me?

388
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,620
Then, who is it?

389
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,060
- Yeah, who?
- Who?

390
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,714
So, who did you draw?

391
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,137
Isn't it obvious? It's two people.

392
00:26:15,205 --> 00:26:16,220
This must be Han Yansheng.

393
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,220
Nope, it's not.

394
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,491
Just a random doodle.

395
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,051
Random?

396
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,500
Why did you draw a couple?

397
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,160
You're giving it to Sheng, aren't you?

398
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,820
Spill it.

399
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,460
I'm keeping it for myself.

400
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,620
Whoa, why's there a huge crack?

401
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,740
Excuse me.

402
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,460
Can you help me fix this?

403
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:40,457
Sure.

404
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,711
Come back this afternoon.

405
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,900
(Jian Dan and Sheng
really have something going on.)

406
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,400
(Looks like I need to step in
with my dear nephew and Jian Dan.)

407
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,588
Zhishan, what do you need me for?

408
00:27:10,874 --> 00:27:12,100
Take this. It's for you.

409
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,500
This is your self-portrait?

410
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,300
A bit ugly, don't you think?

411
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,300
But hey,

412
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,540
you have that

413
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,340
raw artistic vibe.

414
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,466
That's actually you.

415
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:45,851
No thanks.

416
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,700
You sure about that?

417
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,860
This is a special gift to my boyfriend.

418
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,108
Alright!

419
00:27:53,133 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll take it!

420
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,897
I was wrong, alright?

421
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,708
So, what do you think
of my drawing skills?

422
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:58,900
Amazing.

423
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,180
Totally...

424
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,060
Masterful and full of flair.

425
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,020
I'll treasure it

426
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,420
and frame it in gold!

427
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,220
Glad you like it.

428
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,220
Thanks, really.

429
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,980
By the way,

430
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,660
I asked you here to talk about

431
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,020
Jian Dan and Sheng.

432
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,380
What about them?

433
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,062
Don't you think
they're dragging it out?

434
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,666
They like each other,
but neither of them says anything.

435
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:26,020
I'm getting anxious for them.

436
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
So what do we do?

437
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,540
This afternoon,

438
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,020
there is an event at school.

439
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,060
Jian Dan.

440
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,733
I was just looking for you.

441
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:48,820
Come with me.

442
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,711
Where are we going?

443
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,100
You'll know when we get there.

444
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,640
But I need to pick up
the mug from the pottery shop.

445
00:28:53,845 --> 00:28:55,540
I asked Monkey
to get it for you. Let's go.

446
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,100
Hurry up.

447
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,300
(Freshmen Mixer by the Baking Club)

448
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,660
Why did you bring me here?

449
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,780
To help you find a boyfriend.

450
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,051
A mixer?

451
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,468
No thanks. I'm heading back.

452
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,540
Wait, I meant I'm here
to find a boyfriend.

453
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,942
Don't you have Monkey?

454
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,540
That was just for show.

455
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,500
It wasn't real.

456
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,540
You don't need to rush
into getting a boyfriend.

457
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:34,220
I guess after pretending for so long,

458
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,466
having a boyfriend didn't
seem like a bad idea.

459
00:29:38,662 --> 00:29:39,948
We still have about an hour.

460
00:29:40,034 --> 00:29:41,220
Jian Dan, stay with me, okay?

461
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,220
Look over there, it's pretty.

462
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:46,380
Come on, let's go over.

463
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,380
Let's take a photo.

464
00:29:48,268 --> 00:29:48,862
Stand still.

465
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,300
Say cheese.

466
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,980
Jian Dan, turn your back to the camera.

467
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,380
It looks more artsy that way.

468
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,380
Now do a peace sign.

469
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,274
Raise your hand a little higher.

470
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,460
Han!

471
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:11,300
Do me a favor.

472
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:12,700
This belongs to Jian Dan.

473
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
Pass it to her for me.

474
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,620
Why do you have her stuff?

475
00:30:18,088 --> 00:30:19,060
It's a long story.

476
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,937
Anyway, just make sure
she gets it fast.

477
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,980
She needs it for the mixer tonight.

478
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:24,980
A mixer?

479
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,666
You didn't know?

480
00:30:27,851 --> 00:30:29,097
Jian Dan's going to the mixer.

481
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,740
It's at the lake on campus.

482
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,140
I've got a photo, too.

483
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:34,500
Look.

484
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,500
I heard from Jiang Zhishan

485
00:30:40,888 --> 00:30:42,690
that Jian Dan went
to the pottery shop today

486
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:44,285
and made a set of couple mugs.

487
00:30:44,777 --> 00:30:47,580
She said she's giving them
to someone she likes tonight.

488
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:51,220
Why don't you give it to her?

489
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:52,340
Why ask me?

490
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:54,860
Oh right!

491
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,100
Jiang Zhishan wanted to see me.

492
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,045
I better hurry over,

493
00:30:57,142 --> 00:30:58,060
or she'll kill me.

494
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,100
See you!

495
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,380
(Monkey: Han will be there
in ten minutes.)

496
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,460
Jian Dan, I need to use the restroom.

497
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:27,194
Wait here.

498
00:31:27,354 --> 00:31:28,660
Hold this. Don't go anywhere.

499
00:31:32,114 --> 00:31:33,571
What's with her?

500
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:35,220
Why so mysterious?

501
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,420
The event starts at 7 PM.

502
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:45,485
You're pretty early.

503
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,711
What are you doing here?

504
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,422
Did you come for the mixer?

505
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,900
Anyway...

506
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:54,340
Here.

507
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:56,200
Monkey asked me to give this to you.

508
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,600
Did you look inside the bag?

509
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:07,177
Do I seem like the kind of person
who would sneak a peek?

510
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,644
What do you take me for?

511
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,500
That's not what I meant.

512
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,422
Why are you so upset?

513
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,155
Are you that eager to get a boyfriend?

514
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,466
You even had the gift ready.

515
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,666
Can't even wait, huh?

516
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,888
I came to the mixer with Jiang Zhishan.

517
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:21,920
You got the wrong idea.

518
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,460
And that gift isn't for just anyone,

519
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,111
it's...

520
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,100
Forget it. Whatever.

521
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,088
You don't want it?

522
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,060
No, I don't.

523
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,220
Jian Dan!

524
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:25,980
Jian Dan.

525
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:32,540
Jian Dan.

526
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,088
I brought your stuff back.

527
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,133
This is for me, right?

528
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,000
Why didn't you say so?

529
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:48,220
Of course not! You're imagining things.

530
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,777
But it's clearly got you and me on it.

531
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,260
Don't come any closer!

532
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,460
I've got something else to do.

533
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,900
I need to go.

534
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:00,970
Are you still going to the mixer?

535
00:34:01,502 --> 00:34:02,217
Of course not!

536
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:03,340
Where are you going?

537
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,460
I...

538
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,820
Why should I tell you?

539
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,860
Who even are you to me?

540
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,140
I can do whatever I want.

541
00:34:10,222 --> 00:34:11,377
None of your business.

542
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,488
None of my business?

543
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,131
You're my girlfriend.

544
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,180
It is my business.
