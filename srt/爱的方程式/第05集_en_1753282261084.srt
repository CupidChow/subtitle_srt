1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one you love

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Love him or not

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Smile and answer

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Qin Dan, although I can't help you,

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I have a surprise for you.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Qin Dan, I'm sorry.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Qin Dan, I'm sorry.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Come on, Qin Dan.

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Han, Han, come on.

13
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Come on, come on.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Han, come on.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Come on, Han.

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Come on, Han.

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Come on, Han.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Come on, Han.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Qin Dan, come on.

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Why is he so good at shooting?

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Han used to play outdoor.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This height is too easy for him.

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Come on.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on, Han.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on, Han.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Han.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on, Han.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't let him come out.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
Wow we

30
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:45,040
I

31
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,160
Don't believe me either

32
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,060
Life's product

33
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:56,980
Congratulations. You've come

34
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Free to climb

35
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,980
Woohoo!

36
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,100
You can come to the Rock climbing club at any time

37
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,500
to experience the fun of rock climbing.

38
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,740
Done.

39
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,380
I've sent the rock climbing video

40
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,420
to the forum.

41
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,460
Everyone will see it

42
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,500
tomorrow afternoon.

43
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,300
Great.

44
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,220
Thank you, Yufeng.

45
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,420
Don't mention it.

46
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,700
Don't stop.

47
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,420
Here.

48
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,100
For your sake,

49
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,300
I'll help you a lot.

50
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,140
Wait.

51
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,900
I'll write more notes for you.

52
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,700
I'll write it in the right order.

53
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,300
Rock climbing club

54
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,180
Are you the president of the climbing club?

55
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,180
We read the post on the forum.

56
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,820
I heard that the climbing club is recruiting.

57
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,380
Can we join?

58
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,700
Of course.

59
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,820
You're very welcome.

60
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,180
Let's go.

61
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,620
Let me take you to have a look.

62
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,580
Rock climbing club

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,220
This way.

64
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,660
Old Han.

65
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,860
Old Han.

66
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,820
Take a break.

67
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,420
I can't move.

68
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,660
Take a break.

69
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,180
Take a break.

70
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,060
Monkey.

71
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,380
Xia Nan.

72
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,420
Thanks to you

73
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,300
for reminding me to recruit people

74
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,660
through online publicity.

75
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,940
Now there are more and more people

76
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,100
who are recruiting for climbing club.

77
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
You can be promoted.

78
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,860
It's nothing.

79
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,740
Actually, the idea...

80
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,860
You can't even think of the idea of recruiting people.

81
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,780
How can you open a new chapter for climbing club?

82
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,060
It's none of your business.

83
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,380
I'm the president of the climbing club.

84
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,300
I'll be responsible for climbing club.

85
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Do you need to be responsible with the old way of sending the leaflets?

86
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,380
You...

87
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,180
I asked you first.

88
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,300
You wanted to help her.

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,020
But you made her angry on purpose.

90
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
You misunderstood.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
I didn't want to help her.

92
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,580
But I signed the leaflets.

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,020
I have to be responsible.

94
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,060
If the climbing club can't be opened,

95
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,260
I'll be in a bad shape.

96
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,100
Wait a minute.

97
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,220
Guys.

98
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,940
From today,

99
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,060
we will do group work.

100
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,700
The result of this group work is very important.

101
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,260
It will directly record the final result.

102
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,740
Especially those who want to get the scholarship

103
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,660
must treat it seriously.

104
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,180
Teacher, how to divide the group?

105
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,180
It must be a group of free members.

106
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,180
How to divide the group of free members?

107
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
How can I divide the group of free members?

108
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,180
How can I divide the group of free members?

109
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
I'll sign it.

110
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
I'll sign it.

111
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,180
Come on.

112
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,740
Be quiet.

113
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,980
Write down the name of the person

114
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,660
you don't want to be a partner with on this paper.

115
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,540
After that, pass the leaflets to me.

116
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,980
This group work

117
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,460
is not only to test your professional knowledge,

118
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,780
but also to train you to cooperate with the team

119
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,980
in adversity.

120
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,180
If you can cooperate well

121
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,180
in adversity,

122
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,180
then you can face any situation

123
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,180
in the future.

124
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,180
So the way we divide the group this time

125
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,180
is to cooperate with the person

126
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
you don't want to be a partner with.

127
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,180
So the way we divide the group this time

128
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,180
is to cooperate with the person

129
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,180
you don't want to be a partner with.

130
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Why do I have to be in your group?

131
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,180
What?

132
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,180
You don't like it?

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,180
I don't want to be in your group.

134
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,180
What did you pick?

135
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Look.

136
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,180
College student relationship.

137
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
What does this have to do with the topic of the group homework?

138
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
You didn't hear it just now.

139
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
The topic of this homework is

140
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
the application in life

141
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
according to the probability statistics of mathematics.

142
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,180
What we are going to do is

143
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,180
to do a survey,

144
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,180
to do a survey,

145
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,180
and then make a statistical table and a statistical diagram.

146
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,180
The error should be less than 0.1.

147
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,180
We will do the final presentation in PPT and speech.

148
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,180
This is a part of the topic.

149
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,180
To avoid cheating,

150
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,180
the survey investigation process

151
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
requires full-time video and division of work.

152
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
So troublesome.

153
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
You can make a survey

154
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,180
based on this question.

155
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,180
Why should I do it?

156
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,180
It's up to you.

157
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
At 12 noon,

158
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,180
go to the gate and do the survey.

159
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,180
Time is running out.

160
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
You have to hurry.

161
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
No.

162
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Why did you decide it yourself?

163
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
Have you asked me for my opinion?

164
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
What's wrong with you?

165
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,180
Our club

166
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,180
is going to hold

167
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,180
a close show

168
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,180
with environmental protection as the theme.

169
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,180
We are going to hire a big star

170
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,180
to help us.

171
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,180
I told the president

172
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,180
that he could trust me

173
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,180
and I would help him

174
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,180
to find the fallen princess.

175
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,180
And the result...

176
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,180
Isn't it good?

177
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,180
The fallen princess is your idol.

178
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,180
You can get close to her

179
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,180
by hiring her as your stage.

180
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,180
Yeah.

181
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
The fallen princess

182
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,180
is so mysterious.

183
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Where can I find her?

184
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I feel so good.

185
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,180
You are right.

186
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,180
The fallen princess

187
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,180
held an event

188
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,180
in the cafe, right?

189
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Yes.

190
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,180
The cafe will have her contact information.

191
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Yeah.

192
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,180
Jian Tan,

193
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,180
you are my savior.

194
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Hello, senior.

195
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,180
Hello, student.

196
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,180
You are here, too.

197
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
What do you want to drink?

198
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,180
I am not here to drink.

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,180
I want to ask you about someone.

200
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,180
Who?

201
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,180
The fallen princess.

202
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,180
The fallen princess?

203
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Why do you want to know about her?

204
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,180
Well,

205
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,180
we have a close show at our school.

206
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
I want to invite her

207
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
as a special guest to join the show.

208
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,180
Do you have her contact information?

209
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,180
I'm afraid it's not convenient

210
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,180
to give you her contact information.

211
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,180
But you can try to contact her on Weibo.

212
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Maybe she will agree

213
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,180
if she is in a good mood.

214
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,180
But

215
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,180
the fallen princess is the god of Cosmo.

216
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,180
She will give me a little help.

217
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
How can you know if you don't try?

218
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
You are so sincere.

219
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,180
If she doesn't agree,

220
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
she will let you down.

221
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,180
Yuan Si, right?

222
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,180
Yes.

223
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,180
You are right.

224
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,180
If she agrees, I will be rich.

225
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,180
If she doesn't agree,

226
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
then forget it.

227
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
Thank you, senior.

228
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,180
You are welcome.

229
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,180
Sit down. I have a guest.

230
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,180
Okay.

231
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,180
Hello, please.

232
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,180
Hello.

233
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,180
Is the fallen princess

234
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,180
really that good?

235
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,180
Of course.

236
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,180
The fallen princess

237
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,180
is the best cosmo I have ever seen.

238
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Every character she creates

239
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,180
is unique and unique.

240
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,180
And let me tell you,

241
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,180
the most important thing about her

242
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,180
is to stick to her style.

243
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
She never changes her style

244
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
because of the public's aesthetic.

245
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
Anyway,

246
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
it's a coincidence.

247
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
I thought

248
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
you were just her fan.

249
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
Of course.

250
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
The fallen princess is so handsome.

251
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
Don't you like her?

252
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,180
And let me tell you,

253
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,180
she is the avatar of my Weibo.

254
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,180
She is the cover of the WeChat circle.

255
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,180
Everything about her

256
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
is in the WeChat circle.

257
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,180
The most important thing is

258
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,180
that I have everything

259
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,180
around her.

260
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,180
Done.

261
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
Okay, I won't talk to you anymore.

262
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,180
I have something to do.

263
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
I'm leaving.

264
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,180
Bye.

265
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,180
Hello, Your Highness.

266
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,180
I'm Mi Fen from the Haida Cosmo Club.

267
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,180
Our club wants to hold

268
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
a cosmo show with environmental protection.

269
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
I'll be your special guest.

270
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,180
I'm looking forward to it.

271
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
May I?

272
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
What's wrong?

273
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,180
Why are you sighing?

274
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,180
I sent a message to the fallen princess.

275
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
She hasn't replied to me yet.

276
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,180
It seems that I have no hope.

277
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
What's this?

278
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
Our president

279
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,180
asked me to go to the canteen

280
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,180
to do a garbage sorting activity

281
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
before noon tomorrow.

282
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
What a coincidence.

283
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
At noon tomorrow,

284
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,180
Han Yan and I will

285
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,180
do a survey in the canteen.

286
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
Let's go together.

287
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
Fen'er,

288
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,180
what did you

289
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,180
do today?

290
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,180
Can't you tell?

291
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,180
A garbage can.

292
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,180
You did it.

293
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Thank you.

294
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
I've done everything

295
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
to promote environmental protection.

296
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Good luck.

297
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Hello.

298
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,180
It's the president.

299
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,180
Hello, president.

300
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Where are you, Fen'er?

301
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Everyone is waiting for you.

302
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,180
Hurry up.

303
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
Okay.

304
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
You're on time.

305
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Let's get started.

306
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,180
You're exaggerating.

307
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,180
You can record it with your phone.

308
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I have a requirement for myself.

309
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
If I don't do it,

310
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,180
I'll do my best.

311
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
How about you?

312
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
Did you do it alone?

313
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Or else?

314
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Who else would help me?

315
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
I spent the whole night

316
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
checking the information

317
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,180
to answer these questions.

318
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,180
How about it?

319
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,180
It's useless.

320
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,180
Excuse me.

321
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,180
Can you give me two minutes

322
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,180
to fill in the survey paper?

323
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,180
Sorry, I'm busy.

324
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
Excuse me.

325
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,180
Can you give me a few minutes

326
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
to fill in the survey paper?

327
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
Sorry, I'm busy.

328
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
Excuse me.

329
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Can you give me two minutes

330
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,180
to fill in the survey paper?

331
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,180
I don't dare to go.

332
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
I don't dare to go.

333
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,180
Sorry.

334
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
Don't be a loser.

335
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
You're so stupid.

336
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Yan Sen.

337
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Can you give me two minutes

338
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,180
to fill in the survey paper?

339
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,180
No.

340
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,180
You're so stupid.

341
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
You're so stupid.

342
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
You can do it.

343
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,180
You can do it.

344
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,180
I'll do it.

345
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,180
Here you are.

346
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,180
No.

347
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,180
I can't do it.

348
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
You can't?

349
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,180
You're so stupid.

350
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,180
I'll teach you.

351
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
When you shoot,

352
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
press this red button.

353
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Otherwise, you can't record it.

354
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Now press the button.

355
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Press it.

356
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Come on.

357
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Be steady when you shoot.

358
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Stay steady.

359
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Don't move too much.

360
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Okay?

361
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Like this?

362
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
Don't shoot.

363
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,180
Don't shoot.

364
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Hello, sir.

365
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
Please check the garbage classification.

366
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Hello, sir.

367
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,180
Let's protect the earth together.

368
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
Please check the garbage classification.

369
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Hello, sir.

370
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Everyone has the responsibility to check the garbage classification.

371
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
Hello, sir.

372
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,180
Hello.

373
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Is Luo Shui joining the activity?

374
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,180
Not yet.

375
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
You can't do that.

376
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Although our activity is meaningful,

377
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
it has limited influence.

378
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,180
With Luo Shui joining,

379
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
our activity can be more than half-finished.

380
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
I'm with you.

381
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Time is running out.

382
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,180
You can do it.

383
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,180
Yes, I know, sir.

384
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Don't worry.

385
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
I'll do my best.

386
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
I'll do my best.

387
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,180
Bye.

388
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,180
Okay.

389
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,180
Your Highness,

390
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Xiaotong Ming has limited power.

391
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Only by joining a big company like yours

392
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,180
can more people realize the importance of environmental protection.

393
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,180
So I want to beg you again.

394
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,180
I hope you can accept our request.

395
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
Have you remembered what I said?

396
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,180
Yes.

397
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Really?

398
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,180
Okay.

399
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
From now on,

400
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,180
you'll be in charge of the camera.

401
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
For the characters,

402
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
we'll use Zhong Jing and Jingjing.

403
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,180
What are Zhong Jing and Jingjing?

404
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,180
Girls love selfies.

405
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,180
You don't even know this?

406
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,180
Selfies?

407
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,180
Then this is it.

408
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Is this right?

409
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Zhong Jing is above waist.

410
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Jingjing is above chest.

411
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,180
Finally, it's Zhong Jing.

412
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,180
Be careful.

413
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
What if you break the camera?

414
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
What if I break it?

415
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,180
Look at your brain.

416
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Let's go.

417
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Girls,

418
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,180
can you help me fill in the blanks?

419
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Okay.

420
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,180
Okay.

421
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Okay.

422
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
Can you help me fill in the blanks?

423
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Okay.

424
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,180
It's really a time to look at the face.

425
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Why are all the survey questions girls?

426
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,180
There's no way.

427
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,180
Girls born with one sex.

428
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,180
Right.

429
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,180
If the survey questions are all about girls and boys,

430
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,180
the data sample may be severely misused.

431
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,180
We still have to interview some boys.

432
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
But it's past lunchtime now.

433
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
It's the weekend.

434
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Where can I find someone?

435
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Monkey,

436
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
call everyone

437
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
to have a cup of yellow coffee.

438
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
Okay.

439
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,180
Jingjing.

440
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
Why is it you?

441
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,180
Come on.

442
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,180
Ernao.

443
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,180
Where's Anson?

444
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,180
Why hasn't he come?

445
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I've informed him.

446
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,180
He'll be here soon.

447
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
What are you doing in secret?

448
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
Look.

449
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,180
Student survey question?

450
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
This?

451
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
Leave it here.

452
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,180
Wait.

453
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
Can you fill it in for me?

454
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,180
This is the homework of our class.

455
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
There are so many girls in the survey questions.

456
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Let me do it.

457
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,180
Come on.

458
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Go.

459
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,180
It's really good to have a single dog fill in the questionnaire.

460
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,180
You're not studying applied mathematics.

461
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Why are you related to L.E.A.?

462
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Mathematics is the most important thing in life.

463
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,180
It's applied to life.

464
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,180
We chose applied mathematics.

465
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
It's the way of thinking in mathematics

466
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,180
to analyze life

467
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,180
and solve problems in life.

468
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
But

469
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
I got the wrong answer

470
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
for the love question.

471
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Fine.

472
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
I'll just do it for fun.

473
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,180
Let's see.

474
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,180
Do you have a pen?

475
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
What?

476
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Do you think a relationship will last for a long time?

477
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,180
You should be together if you like each other.

478
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Why separate?

479
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Why have a relationship?

480
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,180
What do you think is the biggest problem

481
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,180
in college love?

482
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,180
A. The gap between the two sides is huge.

483
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
B. It's hard to be together after graduation.

484
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
C. A huge economic pressure.

485
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
Other.

486
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:46,180
How could the problem of college love be A or C?

487
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
The biggest problem is

488
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
how to have a girlfriend.

489
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Just pick one.

490
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
What's the problem?

491
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
You're all here.

492
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
Senior.

493
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,180
This...

494
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
What are you doing?

495
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
Why do you add a camera?

496
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,180
This is the question of

497
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
Han and Zhe Han's temperature test

498
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
in the selection class.

499
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
Let me see.

500
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,180
What is the ideal love

501
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
that you expect from Han and Zhe Han?

502
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
A. Love at first sight.

503
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
B. Love day and night.

504
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
C. A perfect match.

505
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,180
D. A soul mate.

506
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
No need to guess.

507
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,180
You must choose the right one.

508
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,180
A perfect match.

509
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,180
Sit down.

510
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,180
I've picked it.

511
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Thank you.

512
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
So fast.

513
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Look at him.

514
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Here.

515
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
I'm late.

516
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,180
We're still missing a few.

517
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,180
Please help us to choose.

518
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Can I refuse?

519
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,180
Han Sen.

520
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
Please help me.

521
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,180
Here.

522
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,180
What is the ideal love that you expect from Han and Zhe Han?

523
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,180
Which one did you pick?

524
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,180
Me.

525
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
I chose a love at first sight.

526
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
Look.

527
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,180
If I can't fall in love with a man at first sight,

528
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
I can't get used to it no matter how long we've been together.

529
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
What about you?

530
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
You chose a love at first sight

531
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,180
or a perfect match?

532
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
You chose a love at first sight?

533
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,180
Do you have a crush on someone?

534
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Who? Do I know her?

535
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
Is she pretty?

536
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,180
No way.

537
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
You're so unlucky.

538
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
We're still missing a few.

539
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
Where's Sheng?

540
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
Did you choose?

541
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Here.

542
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
Help me to take the photo.

543
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Okay.

544
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,180
I've finished.

545
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Thank you.

546
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Soul mate?

547
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,180
Sheng.

548
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,180
What's your soul mate in your mind?

549
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,180
Yes. Tell me.

550
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,180
Soul mate?

551
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,180
It must be related to your heart.

552
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,180
One look

553
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,180
can make you think about your thoughts.

554
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,180
I know you best.

555
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,180
I know that besides your mom,

556
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
you must have a friend.

557
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,180
Not enough?

558
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,180
It's better to have the same hobby as me.

559
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,180
Like swimming.

560
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
Like math.

561
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,180
You know math.

562
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,180
You like swimming.

563
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
Isn't it simple?

564
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,180
I'll send you the material tonight.

565
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,180
You can do the survey as a PPT.

566
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,180
I'll give a speech on Monday.

567
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
Why don't you do PPT?

568
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,180
I'll give a speech.

569
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,180
Is your ability to express better than me?

570
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,180
I...

571
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,180
You're not even good at PPT.

572
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
You're not good at it.

573
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,180
Okay.

574
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
Send it to me after you're done.

575
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180
I'll make a modification.

576
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
Why do you always count?

577
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,180
We agreed to cooperate with the team.

578
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,180
Why do you always count me when you work hard?

579
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,180
What's wrong?

580
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,180
Come on. Eat.

581
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,180
Come on.

582
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
What's wrong?

583
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Is it going well?

584
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,180
It's going well.

585
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
What about you?

586
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Did the Lord of the Water ask you for a message?

587
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,180
I'm too self-righteous.

588
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,180
I think the God can accept my request.

589
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Maybe from the beginning,

590
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,180
I shouldn't have this suggestion.

591
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,180
Maybe.

592
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,180
Maybe a miracle will happen.

593
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
What miracle? It's not for you.

594
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
I'll go.

595
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Why don't you look?

596
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
Maybe it's the Lord of the Water.

597
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
What Lord of the Water?

598
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
It's a social group message.

599
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I'll look at it later.

600
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Take a look.

601
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,180
What if?

602
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
What if?

603
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,180
It's impossible.

604
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,180
The miracle happened.

605
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,180
What's going on?

606
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
The Lord of the Water is back to life.

607
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,180
I knew it.

608
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Great.

609
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,180
The Lord of the Water sent me a message.

610
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,180
I'm so happy.

611
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
It's simple.

612
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,180
The Lord of the Water will send me a message.

613
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I can invite him right away.

614
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:49,180
But how should I reply to him?

615
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I'll reply to him.

616
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
No, no, no.

617
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,180
What should I reply to him?

618
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,180
Reply to him.

619
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,180
Thank you, Lord of the Water.

620
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll wait for you.

621
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
A couple?

622
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,180
This is the one you like?

623
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,180
Don't guess.

624
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,180
I'm not a couple.

625
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
I'm a couple.

626
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,180
I'm a couple.

627
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,180
Great, Han.

628
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
You made a documentary into an idol drama.

629
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,180
Don't scare me.

630
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,180
I envy you.

631
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
