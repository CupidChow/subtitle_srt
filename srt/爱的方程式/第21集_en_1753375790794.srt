1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Love is complicated

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Have a smile to answer

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Press it 34 times like this.

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If the water is not recovered,

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
you need to do artificial respiration.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You don't want to pass the exam?

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Listen to me.

12
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You need to lift your chin

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
to keep your respiratory tract in place.

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Then, your hand

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
will touch his nose.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then,

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you need to exhale through your mouth.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's time for lunch!

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not easy.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're not easy.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We didn't see anything.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You guys continue.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Of course.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not what you see!

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You saved me.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm dead.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The first test is now going on.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Re-examination.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone, change your clothes.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Get ready to go into the water.

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Re-examination.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ready.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ready.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ready.

35
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ready.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ready.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The second test is coming.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's going on?

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry, sir.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's not feeling well.

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll help him rest.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Next one.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Han Yansheng didn't pass the test.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's not feeling well.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It seems

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
he's completely lost his confidence.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Seeing him like this,

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I feel bad.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I want to help him.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But I don't know what to do.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This cake looks good.

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's okay.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What's wrong, Jian Dan?

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The test of the volunteer is not going well?

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Han Yansheng didn't pass the test today.

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He must be in a bad mood.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know how to help him.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
At this time,

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
it's best to let him do something else.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
To distract him.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What can I do?

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What can you do?

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I want to invite you

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to attend the 199th day anniversary

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
of me and Yuan Sen being together.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
199 days?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've heard of 100 days and 200 days.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But I haven't heard of 199 days.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's the special meaning?

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
199 equals to 199.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It means Yuan Sen and I

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
will be together forever.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When is tomorrow?

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Where is it?

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
At the 9th day anniversary of me and Yuan Sen being together.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll wait for you at the 10th day anniversary of me and Yuan Sen being together.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thank you for your kind words.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you hot?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's okay.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're so good, Mi Ben!

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yufan!

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Here we are!

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You've done a good job!

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's so romantic!

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Of course.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You need a sense of ceremony to lead a life.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yufan,

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
how much money do you need to spend?

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's none of your business.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,480
Our fate is to love each other.

92
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,920
What is this?

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
It's done.

94
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,120
It's almost done.

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
It's done.

96
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,640
Come on.

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,280
Take it.

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,080
Sit down first.

99
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,560
Okay.

100
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,160
I'll go in.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,560
Okay.

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,200
Hot milk and chili sauce.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,800
Okay.

104
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,200
Okay.

105
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
I'll sit here first.

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,320
I'll go in.

107
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,080
Coming.

108
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
It's just done.

109
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Come on.

110
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
So much wine.

111
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,080
Let's have a drink.

112
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,280
Come on.

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:20,960
Come on.

114
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,920
Let me.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Let's have a toast.

116
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,440
To celebrate the 199 days of being with Yuan Sen and Mi Fen.

117
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,960
Wish them to be together forever.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,000
Long live.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,520
Thank you.

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
Cheers.

121
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
Drink less.

122
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,240
I'm drunk.

123
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
I don't need you to care.

124
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,440
Really?

125
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I don't know who

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,440
held the big tree and threw it away

127
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,720
when he was drunk last time.

128
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't do it either.

129
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,920
Okay.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,960
Everyone has finished drinking.

131
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
Now I'm going to announce

132
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,920
something very important.

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,960
Thank you for coming to our

134
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
199 days anniversary.

135
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
We have prepared a gift for you.

136
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,960
What gift?

137
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Before you came,

138
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,720
we have hidden them

139
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,640
under the beach

140
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,560
in front of us.

141
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,240
Do you want it?

142
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:11,960
You...

143
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,560
No.

144
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Where?

145
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
Go find it if you want it.

146
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,040
Let's go.

147
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,680
Wait for me.

148
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Let's go.

149
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,840
Let's go.

150
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,200
Let's go.

151
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,240
Can they find it?

152
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,920
Let's see if they find it.

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,720
Where is it?

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,440
Okay.

155
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,760
Where is it?

156
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,400
These two people

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,040
are trying to take us away.

158
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,800
Yes.

159
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
They are trying to be sweet.

160
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:58,860
adows

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,640
no...,

162
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,000
Give it to me from the store.

163
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,560
I've found it!

164
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
You can have a look.

165
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,080
Even if where I found it,

166
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,480
I don't give a damn.

167
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,840
Will you,

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Don't look at me.

169
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
What the...

170
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
What the heck?

171
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
I like you.

172
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
What about you?

173
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
I'm drunk.

174
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
You scared me.

175
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
You can't drink.

176
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Why are you so noisy?

177
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
You...

178
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
You can't drink.

179
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,920
Why are you so noisy?

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
I like you.

181
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
What happened?

182
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
What do you think?

183
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,880
It's so bad

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Take a break

185
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll dig it

186
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,280
I'll go to the bathroom

187
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,320
There's someone恩.

188
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,280
What?

189
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,040
Duan Después

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,960

Duanaison

194
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,360

Hurry up!

196
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
Hurry up!

197
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,040
Okay, I got it.

198
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
See you at the school's meeting tomorrow.

199
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,000
Dr. He!

200
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Dr. He!

201
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,960
Jin De!

202
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,480
Come back! I'm here!

203
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Jin De!

204
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,640
Dr. He!

205
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Jin De!

206
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,320
You're awake!

207
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Where are you going?

208
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Oh my god!

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,080
Han just went into the water!

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Dr. He!

211
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Jin De!

212
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Jin De!

213
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
Oh no! Han is in the water!

214
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Jin De!

215
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,160
Sit down!

216
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Be careful!

217
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What should I do?

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Be careful!

219
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Dr. He!

220
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Dr. He!

221
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Dr. He!

222
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Dr. He!

223
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Dr. He!

224
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Dr. He!

225
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Han!

226
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
What's wrong with you?

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
You were in the water just now.

228
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
It's the simple treatment.

229
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
Are you okay?

230
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
Are you feeling unwell?

231
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Do you want to go to the hospital?

232
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm fine.

233
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
I'll be fine after a rest.

234
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Let's go, Han.

235
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
I'll take you to the hospital.

236
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Hurry up!

237
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,960
Han Yang New Itís Life

238
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,320
I had a nightmare.

239
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,560
In my dream,

240
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Han Yansheng's illness

241
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,800
is getting worse.

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,880
He can't be cured no matter how.

243
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
He has lost his confidence

244
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,240
and started to self-revenge.

245
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,560
Luckily,

246
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
he found it was a dream after waking up.

247
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,160
I was a little shaken.

248
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
I don't know if it's right to force him

249
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,360
to face the past.

250
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,200
Is it right to force him to face the past?

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,400
I...

252
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,680
I like you.

253
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,120
What about you?

254
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,800
What am I thinking?

255
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
Jiang Zhishan said he likes me.

256
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,840
Is it true or not?

257
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,640
It's weird.

258
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,480
He didn't seem to drink yesterday.

259
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,280
He was drunk in one sip.

260
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,280
He drank a bottle of red wine last time.

261
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,840
Can you think of a way

262
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,000
to make me calm down?

263
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,320
I...

264
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,360
I like you.

265
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,040
I...

266
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,920
Hello.

267
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,440
What's wrong?

268
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,760
Did you have a nightmare?

269
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm fine.

270
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Go to sleep.

271
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,400
You're awake?

272
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,120
I admit not feeling well.

273
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,960
I will take a good rest.

274
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
I put this a few days ago after I came back

275
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
and Grade 10 revision environment priest.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,840
It's not a hard job.

277
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,600
I'm fine with all types of activities.

278
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,680
No.

279
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,920
I'm no scared of losing confidence

280
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,120
no matter what happens.

281
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,160
Goodness.

282
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
Don't think too much and try your best.

283
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,440
You should trust Dad and I

284
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
because you can learn a lot of things.

285
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,320
What do you mean, Dad and I?

286
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,800
It's not issue.

287
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm a self-conceited myself.

288
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,680
I think you don't look well.

290
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,800
You didn't sleep well last night?

291
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,440
I'm fine.

292
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,480
It's just that the hospitalization exam

293
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,520
hasn't started yet.

294
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,360
It's okay.

295
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,280
There will be another time

296
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,680
if we don't do well this time.

297
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,560
I believe you.

298
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,440
Doctor,

299
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,560
I've been sleeping and dreaming recently.

300
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,480
Is the situation not very bad?

301
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,720
Is there a chance to cure it?

302
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,040
Don't worry.

303
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,000
I understand your mood now.

304
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
But I suggest you

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,960
do a psychological assessment test first.

306
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,480
When the result comes out,

307
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,800
we'll talk about it.

308
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,120
When the result comes out,

309
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,360
we'll do another diagnosis.

310
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,040
Okay.

311
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,960
Wait for the news first.

312
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,480
The result will come out in a few days.

313
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,480
Remember.

314
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,640
Relax.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,720
Anxiety will only worsen your condition.

316
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,960
Thank you, doctor.

317
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,840
I'll wait for you at the canteen.

318
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,640
I have something to deal with.

319
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,920
You go and eat.

320
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,000
All right.

321
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,200
Remember to eat your lunch.

322
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
I'll wait for you at the canteen.

323
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,760
I'll wait for you at the canteen.

324
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I'll wait for you at the canteen.

325
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,720
By the way,

326
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,520
I have a psychological assessment this afternoon.

327
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,040
Why don't you go with me?

328
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,360
Sorry.

329
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm late.

330
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,040
It's okay.

331
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,360
As long as you're here, I'm happy.

332
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,920
Isn't this Han Yansheng?

333
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,360
I remember he's a math major.

334
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,560
Why did he come to our class?

335
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,640
Don't you know?

336
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,960
He's dating a student of our major,

337
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,920
Jian Dan.

338
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,520
He's here to accompany his girlfriend to class.

339
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,000
Jian...

340
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,360
Jian Dan.

341
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,920
Why did you bring your family here?

342
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,400
I should have asked Yuan Sen to come.

343
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Why didn't you come with me?

344
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,760
Guys,

345
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,400
in this class,

346
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,720
we'll continue to talk about

347
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,480
the case of emergency after injury.

348
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
This picture

349
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,000
is of an American soldier who participated in the war.

350
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,640
After he returned,

351
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
he was exposed to

352
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,160
the emergency after injury after the war.

353
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,800
His symptoms were

354
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,320
he often had nightmares

355
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,920
and often lost sleep.

356
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,120
Later,

357
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,640
he was successfully cured

358
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,400
by long-term medication.

359
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,280
There are many

360
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,280
successful cases like this.

361
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,240
For example, the pictures on the wall

362
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,120
are all cured

363
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,600
by medication and psychological double-treatment.

364
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,480
That's great.

365
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
There are so many successful cases.

366
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,200
You must have no problem.

367
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,080
Professor, are there cases of failure?

368
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
There are cases of failure.

369
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,280
The International Psychological Hospital

370
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,840
published a case.

371
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,800
There was a man

372
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,480
who swam in the river

373
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,280
when he was young.

374
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,040
His foot was stuck in the water grass

375
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,040
and almost fell into the water.

376
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,600
Since then,

377
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,560
he has a strong fear of water.

378
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,320
When he was being treated,

379
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,000
he was unable to overcome the psychological shadow.

380
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
He was also suffering from

381
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,160
a trigger-induced severe depression.

382
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,400
It seriously affected his life

383
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,120
and the life of his friends.

384
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,120
It's okay.

385
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,600
It's all isolated.

386
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,840
It's not that comfortable.

387
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,880
Use your arms.

388
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,200
Use your arms.

389
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,080
Be careful.

390
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,760
You must check this place carefully.

391
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,760
Do you understand?

392
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
Use your core, too.

393
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,880
Do you understand?

394
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,720
Okay.

395
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,160
Remember these things.

396
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
You must have no problem.

397
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,160
I didn't expect

398
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,320
that she had such a woman's face.

399
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,600
I almost didn't notice.

400
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,680
Should I ask or not?

401
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
Just ask.

402
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,520
It's not good.

403
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,880
Just ask.

404
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,360
You'll know the answer.

405
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,480
You're still not asking.

406
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,280
Just ask.

407
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,840
What do you want to ask?

408
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,960
Why are you eavesdropping?

409
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm listening.

410
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,800
Eavesdropping?

411
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,600
You're the one who's eavesdropping.

412
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,120
Tell me.

413
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,480
What do you want to ask?

414
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,280
You...

415
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,680
You drank too much yesterday.

416
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,960
Do you remember

417
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,200
what you said?

418
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,360
You...

419
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,840
You said I drank too much.

420
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,680
What else can I remember?

421
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,600
I...

422
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,280
Did I do anything special

423
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,160
or say anything special?

424
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,080
Well...

425
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,600
Jason.

426
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,240
You're here.

427
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,520
Okay.

428
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,280
I'll come down to you after changing.

429
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Okay.

430
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,880
Jason.

431
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,400
Shan, I miss you so much.

432
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,360
I miss you too.

433
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,640
Are you in a good mood today?

434
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
He's so handsome.

435
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,880
Is he chasing Jiang Shanshan?

436
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,480
If it were me,

437
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,960
I would definitely do it.

438
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,880
How handsome?

439
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,000
You have so many hair.

440
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,520
You're like a monkey.

441
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,760
You're like a monkey.

442
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
I've booked a place.

443
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,360
You'll definitely like it.

444
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
Let's go.

445
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Let's talk as we go.

446
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,320
Okay.

447
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Have some coffee.

448
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
Where are you putting your hand?

449
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,680
Monkey.

450
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
It's time for training.

451
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,600
Let's go.

452
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,400
Get ready.

453
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,800
One, two, three, four.

454
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,800
Two, two, three, four.

455
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,800
Three, two, three, four.

456
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,960
Put it aside.

457
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,160
One, two, three, four.

458
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Two, two, three, four.

459
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,440
Three, two, three.

460
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,120
It's your turn.

461
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,680
Okay.

462
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,680
Four.

463
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,800
Jiang Shanshan.

464
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,400
I'm your best boyfriend.

465
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,480
You're wearing a green hat.

466
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,240
You're not Jiang Shanshan.

467
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:00,880
Monkey.

468
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,240
Make it clear.

469
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
What do you mean by wearing a green hat?

470
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,480
I was wrong.

471
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
I have something to do.

472
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,800
I'll go first.

473
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,240
Your friend thought we were dating.

474
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,200
He's going to sue us.

475
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,880
What's up?

476
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,800
You look so happy.

477
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,080
Nothing.

478
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,480
By the way,

479
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,120
I have something to tell you.

480
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,160
I've received

481
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,560
the invitation of the international climbing competition.

482
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm going abroad to participate in the competition in two days.

483
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,880
Really?

484
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,760
That's great.

485
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,800
You have to do your best.

486
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,560
What's a good name?

487
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
I invited a climbing coach

488
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,000
who has been working with me

489
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,880
to give me special training.

490
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,800
I hope I can return to my best state as soon as possible.

491
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,240
But I'm a little worried about Dasheng.

492
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,720
Can you help me take good care of him

493
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,200
while I'm abroad?

494
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,240
Don't worry.

495
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,080
No problem.

496
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:30,880
Thanks.

497
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,200
Have you told everyone

498
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,360
that you're going abroad?

499
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,400
Not yet.

500
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,960
I only told you and Dasheng about this.

501
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,720
What about Monkey?

502
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,080
Aren't you going to tell him?

503
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,440
In Italy...

504
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,680
Bucket dog pasta...

505
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,560
Charger.

506
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,560
Nine-eleven,

507
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,520
una cl aisle.

508
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,680
This one over there.

509
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,880
Package boxes.

511
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,960
Convenient noodles.

512
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,080
Why did you write these?

513
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
To go abroad.

514
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,120
Didn't you just come back?

515
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,080
Why did you go abroad?

516
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,840
What for?

517
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,520
Are you back?

518
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,920
No.

519
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,760
I don't have anything

520
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,000
that I should be missing.

521
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,400
Why would I come back?

522
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,360
Why did you come here?

523
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,880
You were so rude to my friend yesterday.

524
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,240
I haven't even settled the score with you.

525
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,520
Yesterday...

526
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:11,920
Yesterday,

527
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,880
it was indeed my fault.

528
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,560
How could you forgive me?

529
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,840
You better be honest.

530
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,600
Take my stuff and move out.

531
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:41,560
Get out.

532
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,640
Please help me

533
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,000
Hello?

534
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,200
I've bought the stuff for you.

535
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,040
It's at the dormitory.

536
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,440
Remember to take it.

537
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:58,760
Okay.

538
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,240
Ma'am,

539
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,880
where's my stuff?

540
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,280
It's not here.

541
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Come in and take it.

542
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,720
What's going on?

543
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,000
Why did you just take it in?

544
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,320
The wheel is broken.

545
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
Where did you buy the luggage?

546
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,200
The quality is so poor.

547
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,400
Let's take a look at what's inside.

548
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,640
Why did you buy so many instant noodles?

549
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,800
You don't know, do you?

550
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,880
You don't know, do you?

551
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,160
Instant noodles are a must-have item when you go abroad.

552
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,040
You...

553
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,600
Did you get cheated?

554
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,960
Instant noodles are all broken.

555
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,840
I'm telling you.

556
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,680
I heard that there's a special kind of

557
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,880
instant noodle machine in the supermarket.

558
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,360
But this is too useless.

559
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,640
I just made so many instant noodles.

560
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,680
I'm done.

561
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,360
This...

562
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,640
I know who did it.

563
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,480
Who did it?

564
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,640
How much did he want me to laugh?

565
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,720
Who?

566
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,000
What's wrong?

567
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,160
Is Monkey still here?

568
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,200
Monkey.

569
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
What's wrong, Monkey?

570
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
When is Jiang Zhishan going abroad?

571
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,400
The day after tomorrow.

572
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,440
What's wrong with him?

573
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,480
I'm sorry.

574
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,080
You must take good care of yourself.

575
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,720
I will.

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
I'll leave the design to you.

577
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,000
I wish you a happy and happy life.

578
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,040
Why isn't Monkey here?

579
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,440
He asked you about the time you went abroad the day before yesterday.

580
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,800
You left early today.

581
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,320
I thought he would come to see you off.

582
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,720
He didn't come.

583
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,400
I'm leaving.

584
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:37,680
Bye.

585
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,760
Bye.

586
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,600
Monkey, I'm sorry.

587
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,160
Thank you.

588
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:46,060
So true, let me be your friend for ten days.

589
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,440
You are my girl.

590
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,320
Cool.

591
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,520
situation

592
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,000
Hello, Justin, where are you?

593
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,720
Jiang Zhizhen, where are you?

594
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,440
Hello?

595
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,960
I'm behind you.

596
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,960
Jeez!

597
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,640
W convulsively get closer seems to die

598
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,000
Too tired memory

599
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
It hurts and it hurts, but it's a few times.

600
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Where should I start?

601
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
When I first met you

602
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
One look, one word

603
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
I haven't thought about it yet, my eyes are already wet

604
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Like a poem

605
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Those young days

606
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
There is a sense of ordinary

607
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
In the gap of time

608
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I quietly didn't eat

609
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Those broken pasts

610
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
The vague name is okay

611
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
We once had each other

612
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Those young days

613
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
The action is unnecessary

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,000
But one day the promise becomes a luxury

615
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Those broken pasts

616
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Love never changes

617
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Life is colored
