1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There's a wind blowing through her curly hair and sweet face

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This love is a difficult one to untie, and it's expressed with sincerity

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Growing up slowly, she is a flower that has no fragrance

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Will it be too scary? She has also asked herself

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Tipatia, the one who is popular

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Only the sound of the flute will melt the sadness

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Tipatia, the one who is beautiful

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Love or hate, there is a smile to answer

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Love or hate, there is a smile to answer

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Tipatia, the one who is beautiful

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Only the sound of the flute will melt the sadness

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Tipatia, the one who is beautiful

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Love or hate, there is a smile to answer

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Love will not appear as you expect

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's more like the first snow, it suddenly disappears

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But it suddenly falls and grows

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No one learned to fall in love

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We fell in this process

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Learn, grow

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Finally, we untied this love equation

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Han Yansheng

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Han Yansheng

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is the cake I made for you personally

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't need it

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This student, you almost hit me just now

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
At least you should say sorry

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You are friends, right?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
First, I don't like sweets

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Secondly, I don't think I need to apologize

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You don't like cake

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can give you other things you like

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Do you know what I like?

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know you like math

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have read your paper on math

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The paper about the Pong family's guesswork

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How do you understand the Pong family's guesswork?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Do you agree with my opinion in the paper?

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Didn't you read my paper?

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you know the Pong family's guesswork, you are a man

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You mean you know

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Pong family's guesswork means

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A single closed triangle

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Must match a triangle

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,700
The meaning in the special

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ok, I will be there soon

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Han Yansheng, my phone

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I will wipe it for you

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't let me see you again

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will wipe it for you

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't let me see you again

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't let me see you again

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't let me see you again

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't let me see you again

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't let me see you again

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't let me see you again

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't let me see you again

58
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Don't let me see you again

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't let me see you again

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't let me see you again

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't let me see you again

62
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't let me see you again

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't let me see you again

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't let me see you again

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't let me see you again

66
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't let me see you again

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't let me see you again

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't let me see you again

69
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't let me see you again

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Don't let me see you again

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't let me see you again

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't let me see you again

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't let me see you again

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't let me see you again

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't let me see you again

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't let me see you again

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't let me see you again

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,420
Have you forgotten the ele abducted Juan

79
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,000
evicted her ceo vegetable

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
Evicted her ceo vegetable

81
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,360
apartment

82
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,260
the bar

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,100
the bar

84
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:45,800
The bar

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,380
the bar

86
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,680
The bar

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,920
is down

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,700
Come to me

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,420
Cu

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,520
There

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,100
there

92
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,640
come

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,500
There

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,180
Come

95
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,620
Listen

96
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,180
i

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,560
Why would you invite me

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,100
All right

99
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
It's a joke

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:36,380
I

101
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,380
Do you want to...

102
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,780
I'll eat it.

103
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,060
Jian Dan.

104
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,260
You're a treasure girl.

105
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,220
Grandma asked me to bring more specialties

106
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,740
and share it with the students.

107
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,540
I'll be polite then.

108
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,540
It's delicious.

109
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,020
Where are the roommates in the next room?

110
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,100
There are three people in our dorm.

111
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,260
Your dorm is a bed-rest.

112
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,620
The girl in my dorm

113
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,420
went out with a cake in the morning.

114
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,620
I don't know where she went either.

115
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,460
What's this? It stinks.

116
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,860
It's you.

117
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,500
Who was I?

118
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,780
What's wrong with you?

119
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,100
You know each other?

120
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,820
You can come and get your books.

121
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,460
The library is always open.

122
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I have an appointment.

123
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,220
I'll be late soon.

124
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Bye.

125
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,700
You're here, Huan.

126
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,820
You're so rude.

127
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,540
You didn't tell me you had a cake.

128
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,780
I'm a little hungry today.

129
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,340
I don't want to hear the word cake again.

130
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,860
Who made you unhappy?

131
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,420
Tell me now.

132
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,500
Make me happy.

133
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,100
If you're too lazy to eat,

134
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,780
let's use the new poster of the swimming club.

135
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,340
That's not within my capacity.

136
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,940
I've already handed it to Yuan Sen.

137
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,540
Don't worry.

138
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,900
Huan, are you going to swim?

139
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,980
Huan.

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Huan is going to swim.

141
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,780
He hasn't been in the water for a year.

142
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,340
You're not surprised at all?

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,260
I'm surprised.

144
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,900
I didn't see you surprised.

145
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,820
Huan is a fair and talented swimmer.

146
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,620
I knew it long ago.

147
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,140
He wouldn't admit it because of this.

148
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,100
Now,

149
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,380
as long as he takes a step back,

150
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,380
it's done.

151
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,220
Why is it you again?

152
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,700
Don't you know that the swimming club

153
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,300
is prohibited from entering the pool?

154
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,700
It's you who asked me to come.

155
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,020
Who told you to touch my book?

156
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,060
Put it down.

157
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,220
There's no nine stars here.

158
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,340
You're lying.

159
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
What does it have to do with you if my book is a star?

160
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,900
I've paid for it online.

161
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,020
This book is mine.

162
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Li Yue.

163
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,180
Oh my god.

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
How dare you push it?

165
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,860
Wait.

166
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,620
Let's take a look.

167
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,340
This may be a good chance for Han.

168
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,260
Stop acting.

169
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,540
You're all dressed like this.

170
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,260
Don't you know how to swim?

171
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Come on.

172
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,220
Han.

173
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,660
Han.

174
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,820
Han.

175
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
Wake up.

176
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,860
Han.

177
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Say something.

178
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,780
Han.

179
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,140
Han.

180
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,900
I...

181
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Han.

182
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,060
Han?

183
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Han.

184
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,140
Han.

185
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Han.

186
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,820
What do you want?

187
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I...

188
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,620
You finally woke up.

189
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
Monkey.

190
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Help me.

191
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,540
Let me take you to the infirmary.

192
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
Okay.

193
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
You're the monkey.

194
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,180
Then, who is he?

195
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,980
His name is Han Yansheng.

196
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,980
He's the president of the swimming club.

197
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
So,

198
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,340
it's you who asked me to come to the swimming club.

199
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I don't care if you're mistaken.

200
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,900
From now on,

201
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,980
please stay away from me.

202
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,260
I don't want to see you again.

203
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,060
You just drank water.

204
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,460
Your heart rate and other intestinal tests are fine.

205
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,860
But for safety reasons,

206
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,420
you still need to do a blood test

207
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
and take an X-ray.

208
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,940
After all, you're not the first time to be drowning.

209
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Don't forget to...

210
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Doctor.

211
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
Don't we still have tests?

212
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
We still have classes.

213
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Yes.

214
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,460
Please arrange it for us.

215
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,660
Okay.

216
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,660
Take a rest.

217
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,260
Han Yansheng

218
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:46,660
Han.

219
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,660
The report is out.

220
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,220
Wait.

221
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,220
It's here.

222
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
How is he?

223
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,940
The doctor said he just drank water.

224
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Nothing serious.

225
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,940
That's good.

226
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
I'll go and talk to him.

227
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Wait.

228
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,460
Wait for me here.

229
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I'll go in and ask him.

230
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
Monkey.

231
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,940
Who were you talking to outside?

232
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,180
I just wanted to come in and see you.

233
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,820
Who is that?

234
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,940
The person who pushed you down

235
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
and saved you.

236
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
I'm not going in.

237
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Okay.

238
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Come here. Come and take a look.

239
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,660
Okay.

240
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,260
That...

241
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
Get up.

242
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,140
Get up.

243
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,140
My stomach hurts.

244
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,140
It hurts so much.

245
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,140
No way.

246
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Wow.

247
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
100 likes.

248
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
150 likes.

249
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
200 likes.

250
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,140
Han.

251
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
You did such a big thing.

252
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Why didn't you respond at all?

253
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
Do you have the power of the mountain iron?

254
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
No.

255
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Do you have the ability to stop others from liking you?

256
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
No.

257
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Look.

258
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,940
The iron can't solve any problem.

259
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
What's the use of saving it?

260
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
That's what you said.

261
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,740
But it's related to Han's reputation.

262
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
What if Han knows about this post?

263
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
What post?

264
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Nothing.

265
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
Han.

266
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,740
Why don't you rest well and come here?

267
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I came out to relax.

268
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
What did you say?

269
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
What post can't I read?

270
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
You heard it wrong.

271
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,740
We're talking about

272
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
the post.

273
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
It's about a good brother.

274
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,740
The iron of human nature.

275
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Right?

276
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Han.

277
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,140
You didn't have breakfast, right?

278
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,140
I'll buy you breakfast.

279
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Stop.

280
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,340
I accidentally fell into the water.

281
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,340
I didn't fall into the water with my brain.

282
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,740
Lin Can.

283
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,140
Monkey didn't tell me.

284
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,140
You tell me.

285
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,140
You never hide it from me.

286
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,940
I didn't.

287
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
It's on.

288
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,740
The swimming club president accidentally fell into the water.

289
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,740
The girl from the explosion roll

290
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
made her breathe artificially.

291
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Han.

292
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,740
It's just gossip.

293
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,140
Don't take it seriously.

294
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Yuan Zai.

295
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,140
I'm still...

296
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm still lacking a few words.

297
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,940
Han, just be yourself.

298
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,020
Don't be a commentator.

299
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,900
Commentator?

300
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,380
Who's that guy?

301
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,580
He's so ugly and he's taking advantage of others.

302
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,660
Isn't Han Yansheng the president of the swimming club?

303
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,020
Why is he drowning?

304
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,780
The water in the swimming club is too deep.

305
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,820
Even the president of the swimming club can't float.

306
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Is he a swimmer or a champion?

307
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,420
How can a swimming champion drown in the water?

308
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,900
It's not an internal news.

309
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,300
Han Yansheng hasn't been in the water for a year.

310
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,500
It's said that he injured his shoulder joint.

311
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,660
But it doesn't seem to be the real reason.

312
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,180
I'm just being myself.

313
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,460
Han.

314
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,420
Don't be a commentator.

315
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,980
It's simple. I'm waiting for you in the canteen.

316
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,660
There's something delicious. Come on.

317
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,500
Is it delicious?

318
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,180
Next time, let's go to the canteen on the third floor to eat snail noodles.

319
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,420
When I left, I was supposed to close the door.

320
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,540
Did Yue Tang Tang come back?

321
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,140
She didn't close the door.

322
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,740
What if she's a thief?

323
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,620
I'm going to the swimming club.

324
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,660
Come on.

325
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,020
Come on.

326
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,500
Okay.

327
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,060
It's simple.

328
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,180
I guarantee that you'll win the game.

329
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,980
He's so kind.

330
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,300
Yes.

331
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,100
It's like he's never learned it.

332
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,660
It doesn't matter.

333
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,180
He has a new owner now.

334
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,780
He should be able to use it.

335
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,380
By the way,

336
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,940
can you do me a favor?

337
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,980
Go ahead.

338
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,260
Can you give these letters to Han Yan Sheng?

339
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,820
I like to do things that make me look mature.

340
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,860
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

341
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,100
Han.

342
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,460
I'll give you the simple one.

343
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,380
Please throw it away for me.

344
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,660
You don't want to open it?

345
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:33,940
Okay.

346
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,180
I'll open it for you.

347
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,900
You're not right.

348
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,660
What's wrong?

349
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,860
Is there a problem?

350
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,900
No problem.

351
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,100
Just do it. I'll help you.

352
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,500
Han.

353
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,700
I advise you not to open it.

354
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,380
You're cold.

355
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,220
Where's he?

356
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,620
He just left.

357
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,580
Han.

358
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,260
Stop driving.

359
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,460
This way, guys.

360
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,300
Come on.

361
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,500
Stay there, stay there!

362
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,740
You cut youreten!

363
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:45,820
看命 死 char� 死

364
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,420
Not wurden.

365
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:51,940
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,660
Tell me.

367
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,140
Did you tell the monkey to give me the letter?

368
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,780
You said so.

369
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,700
Did you read it?

370
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:14,980
Yes.

371
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,500
You put the letter in the envelope.

372
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,060
Yes.

373
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,340
I wrote it after a long time.

374
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,620
So,

375
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,780
that's what you want to say?

376
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,380
Yes.

377
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,740
I put all the words

378
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,100
I want to say in it.

379
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,020
Good.

380
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,540
Very good.

381
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,260
You accept it?

382
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,300
Yes.

383
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,940
Why not?

384
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,020
I'm relieved.

385
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,700
I have class later.

386
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
If there's nothing else,

387
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,540
I'll go to class first.

388
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,100
Aocao.

389
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,860
I'm dead.

390
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
You're so good.

391
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,500
Come on.

392
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,580
There are so many clubs in our school.

393
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,260
The K-sign is over there.

394
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,140
Zhendan,

395
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,380
do you want to join me to sign up for the club?

396
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,100
It's fun.

397
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,100
No.

398
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,020
I already have a club I want to sign up for.

399
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,140
What club?

400
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,020
Swimming Club.

401
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,580
You want to sign up for Swimming Club?

402
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,980
The review of Swimming Club

403
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,300
is very strict.

404
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
It's hard to pass.

405
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,140
I heard about it too.

406
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,860
But I did some research.

407
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,700
Swimming Club is the highest

408
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,860
among all clubs.

409
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,300
I need to learn.

410
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,380
Yes.

411
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,100
But,

412
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
you're so angry.

413
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,260
You forgot the task of the president of Swimming Club.

414
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,220
Don't worry.

415
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,540
I've already solved the problem with him.

416
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,980
And I believe

417
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,660
he won't take the credit.

418
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,740
I'm going to sign up.

419
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,420
I'll go to you later.

420
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Bye.

421
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,740
Is your President Zhao looking for me?

422
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,940
Okay.

423
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Ye Dadao.

424
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,860
You're really good at swimming.

425
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,380
It's in line with the golden eagle's request.

426
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,340
Thank you, Senior.

427
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:52,220
As for these students...

428
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,140
You don't have any prize.

429
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,540
How dare you sign up for the swimming club?

430
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,220
Who gave you the courage?

431
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,060
Who said I don't have a prize?

432
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,860
I won the champion of the swimming competition

433
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,340
in the God's Village every year.

434
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,300
What kind of prize is that?

435
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,420
I suggest you not to waste time.

436
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,860
After all, the swimming club is not a place

437
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,180
that anyone can see.

438
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,820
Look at the paper of the swimming club.

439
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,460
In order to enrich the life of the students,

440
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,180
they promote the swimming movement.

441
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,740
It allows more people to join the swimming training.

442
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,820
If the swimming club only calls for the golden eagle,

443
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,740
it will violate their own purpose.

444
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,620
What's the difference between the swimming club

445
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,980
that only calls for the golden eagle

446
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,420
and the club that only calls for the benefit?

447
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,100
Senior, just give me one chance.

448
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,860
I will prove to you that I'm good.

449
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,140
If you say so,

450
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,420
everyone should be given a chance.

451
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,900
Otherwise, it's not fair.

452
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,140
I'm sorry.

453
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,100
What you said may make sense.

454
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,820
But our swimming club has a threshold.

455
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,300
According to your situation...

456
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,540
According to his situation,

457
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,180
he's admitted.

458
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,820
Chief, what you just said is...

459
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,220
You're admitted.

460
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,340
But he doesn't have any bad grades.

461
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,420
I've seen his water quality.

462
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,780
I think he's qualified to join the swimming club.

463
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,100
Yes.

464
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,660
He saved you from drowning.

465
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,180
He even made you a dream.

466
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,140
I mean,

467
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,700
he's qualified to join the swimming club.

468
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm in the name of the vice president of the swimming club.

469
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,500
He's approved.

470
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,100
He's admitted to join our swimming club.

471
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,860
At eight o'clock on Monday night,

472
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,700
the swimming club will report to the newbies.

473
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
Don't be late.

474
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,220
Don't worry. I'll be on time.

475
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:54,900
Hello.

476
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:00,980
Hello, everyone.

477
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,500
I'm the vice president of the swimming club,

478
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,780
Xia Hou Ling.

479
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,620
Okay.

480
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,100
First of all, congratulations to everyone...

481
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,380
for becoming a new member of our swimming club.

482
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,260
This year is different from the past.

483
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,340
This year, our swimming club will adopt a new training model.

484
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,340
The old and new members...

485
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,980
will train in a one-on-one training group.

486
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,420
Most importantly,

487
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,460
this year,

488
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,300
our president will join us directly.

489
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,460
He'll choose a new member...

490
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,900
to train in a one-on-one training group.

491
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,900
Applause!

492
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,940
Hai, the newbies are here.

493
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,020
Choose one.

494
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,140
I choose random members.

495
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,580
I don't want to be angry...

496
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,700
for not being chosen.

497
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,940
Because all of our swimming clubs are elites.

498
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,300
I believe that with their help,

499
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:58,900
everyone will be able to get the best guidance...

500
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,580
and better results.

501
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,700
Applause!

502
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,740
It's you!

503
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,900
Me?

504
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,940
From today onwards,

505
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,620
I'll be giving you one-on-one guidance.

506
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,820
But don't be too happy too soon.

507
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,540
I'll be strict with you...

508
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,940
more than I would with others.

509
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,820
I'll be strict with you...

510
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,260
more than I would with others.

511
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,540
I'll be strict with you...

512
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,820
more than I would with others.

513
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,220
I'll do my best.

514
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,580
You're like a girl.

515
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,980
Jiang Dan, congratulations.

516
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,260
You were chosen by the president...

517
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,860
and got one-on-one guidance.

518
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,820
You were chosen.

519
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,540
Your strength should be above all of us.

520
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,180
Why don't we have a competition...

521
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,980
and let everyone know your real strength?

522
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,260
How about that?

523
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,500
Why should I compete with you?

524
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,740
Because I don't agree.

525
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,260
I believe that everyone here...

526
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,140
is the same as me.

527
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,580
They doubt your strength.

528
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,140
If you win,

529
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,980
that means you're really strong.

530
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,700
We have nothing to say.

531
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,980
But if you lose,

532
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,300
you must give up the quota...

533
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,740
to someone who's stronger.

534
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,060
I can compete with you.

535
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,420
But I don't accept unfair competitions.

536
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,140
What do you want?

537
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,780
It's simple.

538
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,660
I lost and gave up the quota.

539
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,140
If you lose, I'll...

540
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,820
If I lose,

541
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,660
I'll quit the swimming club.

542
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,980
Do I have to be so serious?

543
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,140
Of course.

544
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,940
You'd better show your full strength.

545
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,780
But...

546
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,180
you'll lose to me in the end.

547
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,620
Let's wait and see.

548
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,220
Dong Han, why did you choose him?

549
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,580
Don't you hate him?

550
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,100
Yes, I hate him.

551
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,820
That's why I chose him.

552
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,300
I'd rather exile him.

553
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,140
You're crazy.

554
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,580
Come on.

555
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,780
All right, everyone.

556
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:06,940
We should take this opportunity.

557
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,660
Be careful.

558
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,520
Please be careful.

559
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,040
Let's go.

560
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,420
Look, we're in a boiled water.

561
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,700
It's very funny.

562
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,060
So amazing!

563
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,760
Great job!

564
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,780
Why is there so much movement?

565
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,780
The waves are huge.

566
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,420
9, that's water!

567
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,940
Are you tickets down?

568
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,540
It's starting!

569
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,020
Together!

570
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,140
Go, Yan Guang!

571
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Go, Yan Guang!

572
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
Go, Yan Guang!

573
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,140
Go, Yan Guang!

574
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
It's so hard to see.

575
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:36,140
You're good.

576
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,140
You're good.

577
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,140
You're good.

578
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Yan Guang, you're good.

579
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
You learned a lot.

580
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm so happy.

581
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
You won.

582
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
I quit the swimming club.

583
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
It's just a bet.

584
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,140
You don't really have to quit the swimming club.

585
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,140
You can't be sorry for losing.

586
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
And don't be proud.

587
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
I was just being careless.

588
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,140
I'll definitely beat you next time.

589
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Yan Guang.

590
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
That's all for today's training.

591
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,780
You!

592
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:47,660
You!

593
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,340
You!

594
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:50,860
You!

595
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,420
Stay.

596
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,280
nos 뛰

597
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,400
şeyi

598
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,920
xie

599
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,800
Do you nits

600
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,140
both

601
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:48,100
Where should I start

602
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,500
To touch the heart

603
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,460
Some look, some words

604
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,660
I haven't missed it yet, my eyes are already solid

605
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,340
Like a poem

606
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,260
Those young days

607
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,700
There is a sense of balance

608
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:17,660
In the gap of time

609
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,620
Secretly

610
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:25,140
Those broken past

611
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,820
The vague name is okay

612
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:37,700
We used to have each other

613
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,340
Those young days

614
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,740
Heartache, I need to be honest

615
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:50,940
But one day the promise becomes a lie

616
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,700
Those broken past

617
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,660
It never changes

618
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:06,980
Life's colorful drawing
