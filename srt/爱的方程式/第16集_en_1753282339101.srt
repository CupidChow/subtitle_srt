1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Grow up slowly

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
She is a flower that has fallen into the incense

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Will it bloom?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Zipadia

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only the fragrance

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt into the heart

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Zipadia

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you love

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Love is complicated

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Love by Hypnotic

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 10

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
Zipadia, are you back?

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Can you get me a raincoat?

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,800
Hurry up, Fen.

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,000
The raincoat is on the quilt.

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
Fen, hurry up.

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you doing?

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,800
You...

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,800
If you don't give it to me,

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm going to dry it.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to dry it.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to dry it.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm going to dry it.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm going to dry it.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to dry it.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm going to dry it.

31
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,600
Thank you, Fen.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,400
I don't know how grandma is doing recently.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,200
I'm quite worried about her.

34
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
When she left, grandma told me

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,200
that I must be nice to her.

36
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
But I'm always nice to her.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't go anywhere.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
Who said I don't eat anything?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,800
The group evaluation will be held in a week.

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
Please get ready, president.

41
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Group evaluation?

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Han Yisheng.

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I just want to ask you

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
about the group evaluation.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The group evaluation

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,400
is based on the group's award.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
The group's award

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,600
and the total strength of the members

49
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
are a mechanism to evaluate the ground.

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,000
High-level groups

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
will have more funds.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Low-level groups

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
will have no funds.

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
If the group is evaluated for a long time,

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
the group will be forced to cancel.

56
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,800
What kind of group is evaluated low?

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,600
Xing Chengli,

58
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,800
zero award.

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
The members are average.

60
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,400
Xing Chengli,

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
zero award.

62
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,400
The members are average?

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
Isn't that our rock climbing club?

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
President,

65
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,400
why are you so sad?

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
The group evaluation is about to begin.

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,800
It's too late to give an award.

68
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,800
The members' strength

69
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
is average.

70
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
I guess

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,400
we can't apply

72
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
for the group's funding.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If only we can

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,400
add a god at this time.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That makes sense.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
But where can we find

77
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,800
a god of rock climbing?

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,400
No.

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Your entrance procedure

80
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
is fine.

81
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
By the way,

82
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
you can add a school score

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,200
to the group.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Think about it.

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm begging you. Please let me go.

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,240
Okay?

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,600
Who's asking for you?

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,880
Don't be so self-willed.

90
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
You're not here to see me.

91
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,560
Then why are you here?

92
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm here to see the climbing club.

93
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,240
Is the climbing club here?

94
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,400
Yes, you know how to climb.

95
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,600
Do you always come to the climbing club?

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,120
Let's talk about it later.

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll go and have a look.

98
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,280
The climbing club is on the second floor.

99
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,760
I...

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,840
Aren't you coming with me?

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,000
I have something to do.

102
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,040
I'll go first.

103
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,200
Dayou.

104
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,880
Be careful.

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,440
Find a good police station.

106
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Are you okay?

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,520
I'm fine.

108
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
Where's your president?

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,040
Zhang Zhishan?

110
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,120
Why are you here again?

111
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm looking for your president.

112
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm...

113
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,360
This is my resume.

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,640
I want to join the climbing club.

115
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,280
The first place in the Youth Women's Team

116
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,000
in the International Climbing Competition.

117
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,280
The first place in the American Youth Climbing Ceremony.

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,000
The gold medal of the National Climbing Competition.

119
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,720
So you really are a god.

120
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,440
Your resume is so good.

121
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,560
Welcome to join our climbing club.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,840
I think it's going to be helpful.

123
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
The ground is so old.

124
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
The rope is not old either.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,720
The old equipment is about to break.

126
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,480
Your climbing club is too weak.

127
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:05,840
President.

128
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,840
President.

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,360
President.

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,240
Why is he leaving?

131
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
If he comes,

132
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
our club will be in a bad shape.

133
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,160
Yeah.

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,200
He can't leave.

135
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah.

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
I didn't expect Han Yansheng's aunt

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,960
to be so good at climbing.

138
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,640
Since she went to the climbing club,

139
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,520
it means she intends to join.

140
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,760
Why don't you fight for it?

141
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
I want to fight for it too.

142
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,960
But she's too fast.

143
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,080
I don't know where to find her.

144
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Why are you here?

145
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,440
You two know each other?

146
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,160
She's Han Yansheng's aunt.

147
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,680
What a coincidence.

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,720
It's not a coincidence.

149
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,840
Jiang Zhishan.

150
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,960
I want you to apply for a new job.

151
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,200
If you can join the climbing club,

152
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
we can get good grades

153
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
in the club's ranking.

154
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,240
We can also get sufficient funds.

155
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,680
As long as you solve the problem you said.

156
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,200
Why should I help you?

157
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,400
You applied to join the climbing club

158
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
because you love climbing too.

159
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,960
We love it too.

160
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,560
Please give us a chance.

161
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,840
Fine.

162
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,400
You'll have a match with me in three days.

163
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,000
If you win,

164
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,360
I'll join the climbing club.

165
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,520
Okay.

166
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,240
It's a deal.

167
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll go first.

168
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,000
Bye.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,600
Bye.

170
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,120
Bye.

171
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Senior.

172
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,920
Can you give this letter

173
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
to Senior Su Lishi?

174
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
No problem.

175
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,440
Give it to me.

176
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Thank you, Senior.

177
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,800
You're so kind.

178
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,320
I...

179
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,600
If there's nothing else,

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,600
I'll go first.

181
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,320
Bye.

182
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,840
Bye.

183
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,520
You're still the same as before.

184
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,920
So vain.

185
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,640
Zhishan.

186
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Long time no see.

187
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Zhishan, you're back.

188
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,520
What did you drink?

189
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,000
Tappuccino. Thank you.

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,560
Young Master.

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,240
Here's your love letter.

192
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,640
Young Master.

193
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,040
You're so welcome.

194
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,440
You're jealous?

195
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,560
I...

196
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,800
Why would I be jealous?

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,720
No one sent me a love letter.

198
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,960
I was just trying to be quiet.

199
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,720
But you...

200
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,600
I heard you and簡單 are going to climb a mountain.

201
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,640
Are you bullying me?

202
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,640
A professional is better than a professional.

203
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,040
You know better than others.

204
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,400
What?

205
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,920
You're here to be his tutor?

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Of course not.

207
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,920
I just can't stand it.

208
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,400
簡單 has put a lot of effort

209
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,480
to set up the climbing club.

210
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,840
If the grade is at the bottom,

211
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,480
the climbing club will be in the top.

212
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,960
It's his ability.

213
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
It has nothing to do with me.

214
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,640
Zhishan has been talented in sports since he was a kid.

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,200
Actually, he doesn't have to climb the climbing club.

216
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,760
The swimming club is good too.

217
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,640
The swimming club's tea is too bad.

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,320
I'm not going.

219
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,120
Zhishan, your coffee.

220
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,120
We don't have tea in the swimming club.

221
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,120
You're so good at this.

222
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,520
You've been learning climbing for years.

223
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,120
You've only been learning for a few months.

224
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,280
This is clearly a professional

225
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,640
bullying our Ye Yu.

226
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,040
If you're afraid and can't win,

227
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,280
just admit defeat.

228
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,920
I won't give up.

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
Outinक

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
How did you miss me?

231
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,240
I was looking for an opponent.

232
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,600
You know him.

233
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
But I found out that the opponent was too weak.

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,840
I won.

235
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,040
Why did you have to compete with Jian Dan?

236
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,720
Because he lived in your house?

237
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,800
It was my fault.

238
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,520
I didn't let you allow it.

239
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,040
So he lived in my house.

240
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,360
But he didn't know the truth.

241
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,480
If you are against Jian Dan

242
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
because of this,

243
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,760
I think it's unfair to him.

244
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,680
It's a matter of life and death.

245
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,600
Although I joined the club

246
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,520
for the sake of my grades,

247
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,080
I don't want to waste my time

248
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,560
on unprofessional clubs.

249
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,680
There are indeed many shortcomings

250
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
in the current climbing club.

251
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,800
But I believe in time.

252
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,120
With Jian Dan's guidance,

253
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
the climbing club can definitely become

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,320
an excellent and professional club.

255
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,720
You believe him that way?

256
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,480
You know that.

257
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm clear about the company.

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,720
If he can't bring the climbing club well,

259
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,080
I wouldn't have agreed to lend him the venue.

260
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
The climbing club has been established

261
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,520
and Jian Dan has really put a lot of effort into it.

262
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,440
So I believe in him.

263
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,120
I also hope you can give him a chance.

264
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,360
As long as he can win me,

265
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
I'll join the climbing club.

266
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,200
Here.

267
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,280
Thank you.

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,160
Why are you here?

269
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,600
Let's go.

270
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's go to have dinner.

271
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I haven't finished my training.

272
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Mom.

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,240
Didn't you say

274
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,080
you wanted to be nice to me?

275
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
When did I say that?

276
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,480
I'll give you ten minutes.

277
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Change my clothes quickly.

278
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,040
I'll wait for you downstairs.

279
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,040
I'll wait for you downstairs.

280
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,240
Didn't you say you wanted to take me to the canteen for dinner?

281
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,240
Why are you here?

282
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,600
The food will be here in a while.

283
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,920
Have some fruit first.

284
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,400
Slow down.

285
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,240
Slow down.

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,280
Take a rest.

287
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
You'll have energy to train after you've rested.

288
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,840
So you didn't come to me for dinner.

289
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,840
You want me to have a rest?

290
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,840
You can't win anyway.

291
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,840
You don't have to be in such a hurry to train.

292
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
How do you know I can't win?

293
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,040
Let's see.

294
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,480
I'll definitely let Jiang Zhishan join the climbing club.

295
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,080
I'm not sure.

296
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,880
I'm not sure.

297
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,680
There's no hope.

298
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,400
The president is not a good leader.

299
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,200
He's a tough guy.

300
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't see him.

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He's a tough guy.

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't see him.

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He's a tough guy.

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I can't see him.

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He's a tough guy.

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He's a tough guy.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I can't see him.

308
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I can't see him.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He's a tough guy.

310
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,600
Han

311
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
went to a meeting

312
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
when he received the notice from the club.

313
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,800
He said it's about the group's ranking.

314
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:28,840
But

315
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,680
he asked me to give him a live broadcast.

316
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,000
You must work hard.

317
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,440
I didn't ask him.

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
I didn't ask him.

319
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,840
Zhikai

320
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,840
Before our crowded club

321
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,600
How is it, Jiang Zhishan?

322
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,320
I believe you.

323
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,000
you can do it.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,500
Come on.

325
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,120
Come on.

326
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,640
Come on.

327
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,080
Come on.

328
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,880
Come on.

329
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,440
Come on.

330
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,800
Come on.

331
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,240
How serious?

332
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
I hope you don't fall behind you.

333
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,840
The winner may not always be the winner.

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,760
That's right.

335
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,120
Come on, Jiang Zhishan.

336
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Come on.

337
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,800
The scalper is safe!

338
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,040
Come on.

339
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,520
Come on.

340
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,480
Come on.

341
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,360
Come on.

342
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,160
Come on, High-five.

343
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,760
Come on, High-five all the way.

344
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,040
Come on.

345
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,960
Come on.

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,180
multiply by 12

347
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:15,980
from all over, right?

348
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Ready, go!

349
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
Go!

350
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,980
Go!

351
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Go!

352
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Go!

353
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,980
Go!

354
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Go!

355
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Go, Jinzhen!

356
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Go, Jinzhen!

357
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
They are so professional.

358
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
It's hard to win with a simple game.

359
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
What are you talking about?

360
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Simple!

361
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Go, Jinzhen!

362
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Go, Jinzhen!

363
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
Go, Jinzhen!

364
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Go, Jinzhen!

365
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Go, Jinzhen!

366
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Go, Jinzhen!

367
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
Go, Jinzhen!

368
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Go, Jinzhen!

369
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Go, Jinzhen!

370
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
Go, Jinzhen!

371
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Go, Jinzhen!

372
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Go, Jinzhen!

373
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Go, Jinzhen!

374
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Go, Jinzhen!

375
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
Old Han, the game has started.

376
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,980
It's easy to lose now.

377
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Go, Jinzhen!

378
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,980
Go, Jinzhen!

379
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Go, Jinzhen!

380
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Go, Jinzhen!

381
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
Go, Jinzhen!

382
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Jinzhen is going to catch up!

383
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
Jinzhen is going to catch up!

384
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Go, Jinzhen!

385
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,980
Go, Jinzhen!

386
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,980
Go, Jinzhen!

387
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
They are almost tied.

388
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Go, Jinzhen!

389
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Go, Jinzhen!

390
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Jinzhen, be careful!

391
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,980
What should I do?

392
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Jinzhen's leg is injured.

393
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
Can you hold on?

394
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
Jinzhen, be careful!

395
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Hold on!

396
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,980
Jinzhen is injured.

397
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Go, Jinzhen!

398
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
Go, Jinzhen!

399
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
Go, Jinzhen!

400
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Hold on, Jinzhen!

401
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,980
There is a bridge on the right!

402
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
There is a bridge on the left!

403
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
Go for it!

404
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
Go for it!

405
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Hold on!

406
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
Hold on!

407
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
Go for it!

408
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,980
Hold on, Jinzhen!

409
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,660
Go for it!

410
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,220
Go for it!

411
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,660
Let's go!

412
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,540
Their first competition began!

413
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,980
This must be great!

414
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,860
Well, no one had woken up

415
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,420
before, so it was the Christmas spirit victory it is!

416
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,700
Great!

417
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Go for it!

418
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,060
ricing!

419
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,980
It is so amazing, it is been hard.

420
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,100
Are you fine?

421
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,820
You can do it.

422
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,740
I knew you could do it.

423
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,060
I didn't win against you.

424
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,020
Even if I lose,

425
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,580
I'll join the rock climbing club.

426
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,660
That's great.

427
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,220
With your participation,

428
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,460
the rating will be fine.

429
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,820
I hope you're not only a member of the club,

430
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,980
but also a coach

431
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,220
who can teach us more climbing knowledge and skills

432
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,700
and help us train harder.

433
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,340
You're too old-fashioned.

434
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,780
Gather at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning.

435
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,140
I'm very strict.

436
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,420
We won!

437
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,620
We won!

438
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,380
We won!

439
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,420
We won!

440
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,980
We won!

441
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
We won!

442
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
We won!

443
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
We won!

444
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
We won!

445
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
We won!

446
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
We won!

447
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
We won!

448
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
We won!

449
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
We won!

450
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,980
Jin Nan, have a sip.

451
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,580
How's your foot?

452
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,620
It's a minor injury.

453
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,620
It'll be fine after I get on the second floor.

454
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,980
Go to the bathroom.

455
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Put me down.

456
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
I can walk on my own.

457
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
I'm responsible for

458
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,380
the climbing team.

459
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
Don't think too much.

460
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,380
This is so romantic.

461
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,380
Don't you think they're so single?

462
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Han is so good at this.

463
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
Jin Nan, Jian Dan and Zhishan are competing in the climbing club.

464
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Why don't you go?

465
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,580
I wanted to go.

466
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
But you said

467
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Jian Dan and Zhishan are my good friends.

468
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,980
Who will I cheer for after I go?

469
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,980
I'll think about it. I won't go.

470
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
Thank you.

471
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,180
Jian Dan and Zhishan are even.

472
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,180
That's great.

473
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,180
Really?

474
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,780
Let me see.

475
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,980
No.

476
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,380
Why do you want to win over me?

477
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,540
Youilia

478
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,060
WeNER

479
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,240
Lay Me.

480
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,580
We are standing in the middle of the finish line

481
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:59,760
Your

482
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,340
thrusts still can not make it

483
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,620
What did you say?

484
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,020
Didn't I tell you

485
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,940
to be nice to me?

486
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
How do you know?

487
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,900
I didn't tell anyone.

488
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,220
So,

489
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,300
the one who gave me the gift

490
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:26,860
was you?

491
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,700
How can you give me the gift?

492
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,060
I went to help Qiangu to pack her luggage.

493
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,660
Mr. Song agreed.

494
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,580
Sit tight.

495
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,100
Hurry up.

496
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,140
Run.

497
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,620
Don't leave any of them behind.

498
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,460
Physical training is good for

499
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,820
improving your endurance.

500
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:03,900
Hurry up.

501
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,140
I'm so tired.

502
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,180
I'm not training anymore.

503
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,380
You're tired after just a few laps.

504
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,260
With your physical strength,

505
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,460
how can you compete with others?

506
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,260
How can you be a professional patissier?

507
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,820
I can't do it anymore.

508
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,820
I really can't do it anymore.

509
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,860
I'm so tired.

510
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,540
That's all for today's training.

511
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
That's all for today's training.

512
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,140
Today's training is over.

513
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,340
You're here at the right time, Mr. Song.

514
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,860
The vice president's training plan

515
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,940
is unreasonable.

516
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,580
If I follow this plan again,

517
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,540
I won't train anymore.

518
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,180
Yeah, you won't train anymore.

519
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,180
Who can take the medicine?

520
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,620
Yeah, I'm so tired.

521
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,460
Calm down.

522
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,860
One by one.

523
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,780
The vice president's training is too strong.

524
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,700
Ordinary people can't eat it.

525
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,100
Mr. Song, I'm telling you.

526
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,300
Our training today

527
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,980
has been over six hours in a row.

528
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,420
Who can take the medicine?

529
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,420
Yeah.

530
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,020
Who can take the medicine?

531
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,940
I'm so tired.

532
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,660
I know what you're talking about.

533
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,500
But the vice president

534
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,220
won a lot of awards for patissier.

535
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,020
We all know his strength.

536
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,340
So his training direction

537
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
must be right.

538
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,220
I will respond to

539
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,660
the questions you asked.

540
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,740
He may not have considered

541
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,100
everyone's physical quality.

542
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,220
The strength of training

543
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,460
will be adjusted.

544
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,220
But I still hope

545
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,620
you can understand him more

546
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:31,900
and communicate with him more.

547
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,260
I believe the vice president's purpose

548
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,620
must be the same as ours.

549
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,180
We all hope that the patissier

550
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,140
can get better and better.

551
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,060
Yes, sir.

552
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,060
The incident of Luego's depression

553
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:09,540
happened seven days ago

554
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,860
during the fight during the red carpet boat.

555
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,380
I was too obsessed with feeling

556
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,300
so I could accept hishad~!

557
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,380
I thought he was contagious?

558
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,260
But my sense of smell

559
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,100
Mr. Fu, happy birthday.

560
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,300
Mr. Fu, happy birthday.

561
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Happy birthday, Mr. Fu.

562
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,220
How did you know it's my birthday today?

563
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,060
It's written on your resume.

564
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,100
I remember it.

565
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,260
Make a wish.

566
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,980
That's too old-fashioned.

567
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,380
Mr. Fu,

568
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,740
this is my birthday gift for you.

569
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,540
This is mine.

570
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,220
Mr. Fu,

571
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,620
this is my birthday gift for you.

572
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,540
This is for you.

573
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,860
This is mine.

574
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
This is for you.

575
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,980
Mr. Fu, this is for me.

576
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,540
Happy birthday, Mr. Fu.

577
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,100
Thank you.

578
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,180
Hi.

579
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,540
It's Jiang Zhishan's birthday today.

580
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,140
Did you prepare a birthday gift for him?

581
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,340
The one just now...

582
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,260
No.

583
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,660
Oh.

584
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,060
I've never seen anyone

585
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,340
write a gift list on their birthday.

586
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,420
They have to make people

587
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,780
prepare a birthday gift for him

588
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,180
according to the list.

589
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,260
You don't know

590
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,500
how hard it is to make an appointment

591
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,700
for a restaurant.

592
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,780
It's hard to get the first one.

593
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,020
I don't know how hard it is

594
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,420
to make an appointment for him.

595
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm sorry.

596
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,180
You're so strong.

597
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,020
What's wrong with him?

598
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,180
Look.

599
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,460
God, you're so lucky today.

600
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:15,340
Monkey.

601
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,980
Happy birthday to you.

602
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,780
Please eat cake.

603
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
Jiang Zhishan.

604
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,940
My girlfriend.

605
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,420
Don't run.

606
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,540
Did we disturb you?

607
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,980
What do you think?

608
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm sorry.

609
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,460
It's Jiang Zhishan's birthday today.

610
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,940
We want to celebrate it with him.

611
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,780
Let me wipe it for you.

612
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,540
No need.

613
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,180
I'll do it myself.

614
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,580
You're so cute.

615
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,140
Happy birthday to me.

616
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,980
Cheers.

617
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,900
It's easy.

618
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,620
You're so rude

619
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,940
to drink so little.

620
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,020
I'm not a good drinker.

621
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,460
I'll be a joke if I drink too much.

622
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,260
What's wrong?

623
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,900
Today is my birthday.

624
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,180
We must drink.

625
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,100
Okay. Go.

626
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Too much.

627
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,380
I'll drink to my heart's content.

628
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,420
Come on.

629
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,540
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

630
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,860
This is red wine.

631
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,380
Okay.

632
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,700
We must drink it all.

633
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,220
Go.

634
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,820
Come on.

635
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,500
Drink it.

636
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,220
Cheers.

637
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,900
Happy birthday to you.

638
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,580
Hurry.

639
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:00,700
I want to know

640
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,340
how to give you a headshot.

641
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:01,820
Okay.

642
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,060
Let's dont' tell lele to drink.

643
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,980
I'll teach you how to drink.

644
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,300
Drink or not?

645
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,420
Drink.

646
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,060
Don't make a scene.

647
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,060
Didn't you say you can't drink?

648
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,940
They said it's white wine.

649
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,500
I can drink it.

650
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,060
Drink up.

651
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,060
Be obedient.

652
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,660
Do you hear me?

653
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,980
I... I'll listen.

654
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,740
I'll drink it.

655
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,660
I'll drink it.

656
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,460
I'll drink it.

657
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,460
I'll drink it.

658
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,460
I'll drink it.

659
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
I'll drink it.

660
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,460
I'll drink it.

661
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
I'll drink it.

662
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,460
I'll drink it.

663
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,460
I'll drink it.

664
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,460
I'll drink it.

665
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,860
Boss.

666
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,660
One more bottle of wine.

667
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,460
No.

668
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,460
Boss.

669
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Ignore him.

670
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,060
He's drunk.

671
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,060
My son.

672
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,660
I have something to do.

673
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,860
I'll deal with it.

674
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,860
Where am I?

675
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,460
You can have the wine.

676
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,460
I'll go and have a look.

677
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,460
Boss.

678
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Boss, one more bottle of wine.

679
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
You...

680
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,660
Boss.

681
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You're wrong.

682
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,860
You...

683
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,660
You're drunk.

684
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
Are you crazy?

685
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,060
Sorry.

686
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I'll take him away.

687
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,860
A man's kindness is a man's kindness.

688
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,060
Don't be a fool.

689
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,060
You...

690
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,260
You're drunk.

691
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Boss.

692
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,260
You're drunk.

693
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,660
Someone's helping over there.

694
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,060
Where?

695
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,460
Okay.

696
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
Boss, thank you.

697
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,460
It is okay.

698
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
I'll see you tomorrow.

699
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,660
So five of us can go today.

700
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,260
I have to take a trip to the hospital to get free private effects.

701
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
What are you waiting for?

702
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,140
Wait!

703
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Do you know how it feels to be a cat?

704
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
It's interesting

705
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,460
In the time

706
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,460
In the gap

707
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,460
Secretly

708
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,460
Those broken pasts

709
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Blurred name

710
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:57,460
We used to have each other

711
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,460
In the time

712
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,460
In the gap

713
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,460
In the gap

714
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,460
In the gap

715
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,460
In the gap

716
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,460
In the gap

717
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,460
Master, Haida

718
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,460
OK

719
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,460
Suddenly the wind is quiet

720
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Smiling in the eye

721
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,460
Prince, Han Yansheng is drunk

722
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
He is drunk

723
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
I'll pick him up later

724
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
The rain falls

725
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,460
Should go from that address

726
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,460
To find the time

727
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,460
Love passion

728
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,460
Dream persistence

729
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,460
My future

730
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,460
Has your shadow

731
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:59,460
Like a song

732
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Those young hours

733
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,460
The way he is drunk

734
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,460
Is so cute

735
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,460
In the time

736
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,460
In the gap

737
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,460
Secretly

738
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Those broken pasts

739
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,460
Blurred name

740
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:25,460
We used to have each other

741
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Each other

742
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Those young hours

743
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,460
The way he is drunk

744
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,460
Suddenly the wind is quiet

745
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
Smiling in the eye

746
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Prince, Han Yansheng is drunk

747
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,460
He is drunk

748
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,460
In the time

749
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
In the gap

750
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,460

In the time

759
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Some look

760
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,460
Some words

761
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,460
I haven't missed

762
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
The eyes have been closed

763
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,460
Like a song

764
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Those young hours

765
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460

768
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,460
In the blur

769
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Blurred name

770
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,460
We used to have each other

771
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,460
own each other

772
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Those youth

773
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Butterflies

774
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
And stars

775
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,460
Melt with the ice

776
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,260
Presentation

777
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
All the time

778
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,260
The promise has become a luxury

779
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,260
The broken past

780
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,260
It has never been forgotten

781
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:40,260
The ignorance of life

782
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,260
The promise has become a luxury
