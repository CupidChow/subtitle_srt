You're here.

16
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,440
Entong, why did you ask for me?

17
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:10,880
What happened?

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,640
Jian Dan, I want to ask you something.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,520
Do you have someone you like?

20
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,080
Well, I'm just asking.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
Right.

22
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,266
You're always busy with
the club activities and your studies.

23
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,090
You probably don't have time
for a relationship.

24
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,520
Well,

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,720
I've been having
some relationship issues lately.

26
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,080
And I don't know what to do.

27
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,120
There's this guy.

28
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:48,240
He said he likes me.

29
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,200
And I

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,880
kind of like him, too.

31
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:54,840
But

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,520
we've been friends for years.

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,880
So I just

34
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,920
don't know how to do.

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:02,960
Jian Dan,

36
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,840
you know him, too.

37
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,131
It's Sheng.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,040
Do you know why everyone calls him Han,

39
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,080
but I'm the only one
who calls him Sheng?

40
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:21,080
It's because I saved his life once.

41
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,160
And ever since then,

42
00:03:24,885 --> 00:03:26,674
he's been really good to me.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,880
He only allows me to call him that.

44
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,120
Jian Dan, you study psychology.

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,222
Can you analyze this for me?

46
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,765
Do you think

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,640
I should make the first move?

48
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,080
I'm only a freshman.

49
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,845
We haven't studied that part yet.

50
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:54,280
You told me before

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
that I could always come to you

52
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,320
no matter what, right?

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,668
But

54
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:08,600
I don't really have experience
with these things.

55
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,720
It's okay. Never mind.

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,520
Jian Dan,

57
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:17,880
if Sheng and I get together,

58
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:20,400
you'll give us your blessing, won't you?

59
00:04:26,988 --> 00:04:27,760
That's great.

60
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm so happy

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,333
to have your blessing.

62
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:33,937
I feel so much better

63
00:04:34,028 --> 00:04:35,360
after talking to you.

64
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:36,708
Thank you, Jian Dan.

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
Jian Dan, you're back.

66
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,200
Jian Dan,

67
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,720
your clothes aren't dry yet.

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,133
Why are you taking them down?

69
00:05:10,588 --> 00:05:12,400
I'll hang them back up.

70
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Are you okay?

71
00:05:19,771 --> 00:05:20,600
I'm good.

72
00:05:22,445 --> 00:05:24,680
But I won't be able to
eat with you later.

73
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,920
I've got plans.

74
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm off.

your Theory of Numbers.)

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
I've checked this section.

77
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,760
You need to work on this more...

78
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,866
Arrange the rest.

79
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:01,577
Next, I think we should focus
on improving breathing techniques...

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,777

82
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,360
Why are you following me like a creep?

83
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,444
You scared me.

84
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
Says the real creep.

85
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:40,680
You saw me just now.

86
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,777
Why didn't you just hand the book to me?

87
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,022
Why aren't you saying anything?

88
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,480
Don't tell me

89
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,155
you're doing something behind my back?

90

91
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,320
Hurry up. Everyone's waiting
to start practice.

92
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,088
You're here, Jian Dan.

93
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,291
Entong.

94
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,480
I've got you the book now.
I should get going.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,066
What's wrong with her?

96
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,440

98
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:09,720

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,640
No, that's not you.

100
00:08:23,394 --> 00:08:23,960

102
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,155
One hundred points for creativity.

103
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:45,400

104
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,840

112

113
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,266

in my past life.

Worst, the final question!

125
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,360
Look.

126
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,000
Yuan Sen studies art.

127
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,897
He turns knowledge into comics.

128

Shi studies IT.

129
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,760
He probably can turn knowledge
into a game.

130
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,560
If it's a game,

131
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:36,840
it'll definitely ignite
my soul to study!

132
00:10:39,622 --> 00:10:41,400
Shi is already
juggling school and work.

133
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,110
He doesn't have time
to make games for you.

134

going on.

- Come on.
- Go.

171
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,720
Did you have a fight with Han Yansheng?

172

No.

173
00:14:09,611 --> 00:14:11,640
Then why did you run off like that?

174
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:16,640
It's fine
if you don't want to talk about it.

175

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,680
I ripped off Shi's cuff button,

184
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,280
so I want to buy him a new shirt.

185
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
You two are about the same size.

186
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,200
Can you try it for him?

187
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,000
Why not just ask him directly?

188
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,000
I want to surprise him.

189
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:47,977
Are you coming?

190
00:14:48,251 --> 00:14:48,965
All right.

191
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,760
Good. Let's meet at the mall.

192
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,040
Hurry over once you're done.

193
00:15:06,314 --> 00:15:06,920
Entong.

194
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,640
Shi,

195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,680
you're here, too.

196
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,640
Han,

197
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,440
is this the surprise you talked about?

198
00:15:16,817 --> 00:15:18,040
There are more.

199
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,942
Entong's got an even bigger surprise
for you.

200
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,488
I'll leave you two to it. I'm off.

201
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,268
Bye.

202
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,360
Shi,

203
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
I picked out two shirts

204
00:15:28,755 --> 00:15:30,000
that I think really suit you.

205
00:15:30,288 --> 00:15:31,400
Why don't you try them on?

206
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,560
It's a gift from me.

207
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,120
Here.

208
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,120
Try them on.

209
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,000
Sure.

210
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,680
Entong.

211
00:15:49,511 --> 00:15:50,666
What do you think?

212
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,120
He's so handsome.

213
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,377
I'm jealous.

214
00:15:53,428 --> 00:15:54,400
If only I had

215
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,045
such a good-looking boyfriend...

216
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:56,897
Miss,

217
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,920
your boyfriend is handsome.

218
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,160
He has a model built

219
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,560
perfectly for clothes.

220
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
That shirt

221
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,840
is just perfect for him.

222
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,480
I'm not...

223
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,280
This color looks nice, too.

224
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:08,560
Try this one.

225
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,120
Shopping really helps me unwind.

226
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,200
Jian Dan, why aren't you
buying anything?

227
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,960
It's pricey here.

228
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,330
I'd rather find the styles I like

229
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,160
and buy them online.

230
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,040
That's smart.

231
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,955
- I'll try that next time.
- Miss, you have great taste.

232
00:16:25,955 --> 00:16:27,000
Everything you picked out

233
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,560
suits your boyfriend perfectly.

234
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,440
Hide.

235
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,160
Please come again.

236
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,933
When did they start dating?

237
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,480
(Didn't Entong say
she liked Han Yansheng?)

238
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,320
(What's going on?)

239
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,840
(Why is he crying so sadly?)

240
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,240
(Did he get dumped?)

241
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,360
(Forget it. Not my business.)

242
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,440
(Poor guy.)

243
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,120
Are you okay?

244
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,840
Did you want something?

245
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
Nothing.

246
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,954
I just wanted to say,

247
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,640
if you're upset,

248
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,514
you can talk to me anytime.

249
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,680
I promise I won't tell anyone.

250
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,560
All right.

251
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,960
But

252
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,280
I don't think I need that for now.

253
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,320
If something's bothering you,

254
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,040
you can share it with me.

255
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,680
Let's face it together.

256
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
It's not a big deal.

257
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
Why are you suddenly so concerned?

258
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,400
We're good friends.

259
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,120
Friends should care about each other.

260
00:18:17,657 --> 00:18:18,560
Have some.

261
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,760
That's wasabi inside.

262
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,280
Monkey bought it.

263
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,880
I don't want to waste it.

264
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
So you weren't crying

265
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
because of a breakup?

266
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,800
Breakup?

267
00:18:51,777 --> 00:18:53,000
I've never dated anyone,

268
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:54,022
let alone had a breakup.

269
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,600
You and Entong...

270
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,920
That's out of the question.

271
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,240
How could I possibly be dating Entong?

272
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
So you don't like her?

273
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
We're just friends.

274
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,725
As long as you didn't get dumped.

275
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,840
Forget what I said.

276
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,880
Enjoy your food.

277
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm off.

278
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
I'm back.

279
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,840
Mi Fen.

280
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,440
Let me ask you something.

281
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
I just met with Han Yansheng.

282
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,440
He told me

283
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
he and Gu Entong are just friends.

284
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,360
But why did Gu Entong tell me

285
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,400
Han Yansheng likes her?

286
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,280
It's obvious.

287
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,840
She's jealous of you.

288
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
That's why she said that.

289
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,160
Then what about her and Shi?

290
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,480
No clue.

291
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,440
But

292
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,200
some people

293
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,840
are dating experts.

294
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,120
Unlike us rookies,

295
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,600
who can't figure out even a thing.

296
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
Think about this.

297
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,960
So handsome.

298
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,320
I'm also pretty.

299
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:39,400
Yuan Sen?

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,240
I thought you liked Luo Shui.

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
Yuan Sen is Luo Shui.

302
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,720
Luo Shui is Yuan Sen.

303
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,920
Jian Dan,

304
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,120
there's something serious
I need to tell you.

305
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,480
Go on.

306
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,320
I want to confess to him.

307
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,080
Can I pick your brain?

308
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:19,160
Sir.

309
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:19,880
Hello.

310
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,794
I'd like to book the coffee shop

311
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
for Saturday night.

312
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,880
Is it for a birthday

313
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:26,480
or a club event?

314
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,155
It's for a surprise confession.

315
00:21:29,142 --> 00:21:29,760
Confession?

316
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,931
You young people really are romantic.

317
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:35,320
But

318
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,360
I've only seen boys rent this place

319
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,560
to confess to girls.

320
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,880
Girls renting it

321
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,080
for a guy

322
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,160
is rare.

323
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,640
Girl, you're brave.

324
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,440
It's not for me.

325
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,680
It's for a friend.

326
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,988
I know.

327
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
That's what they always say.

328
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,000
All right. I'll book it for Saturday.

329
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,360
That day is available.

330
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,120
What's your name?

331
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:58,120
Jian Dan.

332
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
Jian Dan.

333
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
Saturday.

334
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,640
Right.

335
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,080
What does the guy like?

336
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,120
We can customize the setup theme

337
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,120
based on that.

338
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,920
He's Shi's dormmate.

339
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,760
But my friend wants to do

340
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,040
all the decorating herself.

341
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,840
That's fine.

342
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,560
He's Shi's friend?

343
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,720
Then I'll give you a discount.

344
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,680
How much is it after the discount?

345
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,000
The original price is 1,000 yuan.

346
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,680
With the discount, 800 yuan.

347
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:30,600
That's expensive.

348
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,531
I'm giving you the biggest discount

349
00:22:33,571 --> 00:22:34,960
because you're a student.

350
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,480
Well, I'll reserve it then.

351
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,666
I'll try to pull the money together
soon.

352
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,720
Okay. Don't take too long.

353
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,680
Thank you, Sir.

354
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,080
Bye.

355
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,320
Sir.

356
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,760
Su, you're back.

357
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,066
Oh, one of your friends came

358
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,560
to rent the space just now.

359
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,777
Said it was for a confession.

360
00:23:02,822 --> 00:23:03,577
Friend?

361
00:23:06,097 --> 00:23:07,340
(Jian Dan)

362
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
She's confessing to whom?

363
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Your dormmate.

364
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,440
My dormmate?

365
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,440
Han,

366
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,720
how's your relationship
with Jian Dan lately?

367
00:23:28,844 --> 00:23:30,511
Why are you asking all of a sudden?

368
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:32,960
I heard something today.

369
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,080
It's about you.

370
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,960
What's it?

371
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,120
Eight hundred? That's expensive.

372
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,680
Forget it, then.

373
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,120
Call the confession party off.

374
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,520
No way.

375
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,280
You finally worked up the courage.

376
00:23:45,555 --> 00:23:47,880
Besides, didn't you say
that with Yuan Sen's personality,

377
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,770
you'll have to wait
till your hair turns white

378
00:23:49,777 --> 00:23:50,680
for him to confess?

379
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,160
But where am I supposed
to get that money?

380
00:23:57,517 --> 00:23:58,120
I got it.

381
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,080
Did I hear it right?

382
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,760
Jian Dan is going to confess to Han?

383
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,640
It's true.

384
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,266
My boss personally took her booking.

385
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,800
I even saw the reservation book.
It's Jian Dan's name on it.

386
00:24:10,314 --> 00:24:11,771
What's so strange about that?

387
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,480
Many girls like me.

388
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,622
She's not the only one.

389
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,120
But Jian Dan's different.

390
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,520
She isn't the type
who confesses to a guy easily.

391
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,080
Plus,

392
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,360
you two don't seem close either lately.

393
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,560
Says who?

394
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
She came to my office
earlier this morning,

395
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,880
showing great concern.

396
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
My boss said

397
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:32,120
the guy being confessed to

398
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
is someone from our dorm.

399
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,480
I thought about it,

400
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,640
and it can only be Han.

401
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,840
You can't be sure of that.

402
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,280
What if... Right, Han?

403
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,880
If Jian Dan confesses to me,

404
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,320
should I say yes

405
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,280
or no?

406
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,120
Fine.

407
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,240
- It's you.
- Yeah, me.

408
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,440
She likes you.

409
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,280
(Lucky Draw Spin Wheel)

410
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,680
Spin the lucky draw wheel!

411
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,960
Whatever discount you land on
is the price you pay.

412
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,920
All kinds of stuff, big discounts!

413
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,080
Don't miss out on a good chance.

414
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,080
Come and have a look.

415
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,160
Super cheap!

416
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,440
Take one home.

417
00:25:20,466 --> 00:25:21,440
Come on and check it out.

418
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,800
Come check out our stall.

419
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
Hi. Please have a look.

420
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,560
Spin the lucky draw wheel.

421
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,480
Browse around

422
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,800
and see if anything you like.

423
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,000
Hello. Please come and have a look.

424
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,377
- Buy something for your girlfriend.
- Jian Dan.

425
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,111
Didn't expect that from you.

426
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,422
You've got a knack for business.

427
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,640
Of course.

428
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,068
I'm majoring in psychology.

429
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,480
Are you interested?

430
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,280
Give it a try.

431
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,200
Sure. I'll give it a try

432
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
and show support.

433
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,600
Pick something you like,

434
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
and then spin the wheel.

435
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,040
Look around.

436
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,560
They all suit you.

437
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,600
I'll go with this one.

438
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm going to spin it.

439
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,380
(Men's Underwear)

440
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,840
Congratulations.

441
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Buy one, get one free
on men's underwear.

442
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:25,466
Thank you for your support.

443
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,960
Han!

444
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,680
Han, perfect timing.

445
00:26:39,888 --> 00:26:40,960
Here's a gift for you.

446
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,080
Why are you giving me this?

447
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,720
Jian Dan didn't have my size,

448
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:48,977
so I'm giving it to you.

449
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,000
This is from Jian Dan?

450
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,320
She has a stall at the stadium.

451
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,560
I dropped by to support her.

452
00:26:54,733 --> 00:26:56,600
I bought one and got another
in a lucky draw,

453
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
but I only realized the size was wrong
after paying.

454
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,400
(Does she need money?)

455
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,880
(Is it because of her grandma?)

456
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,400
Jian Dan's really going all out
to confess to Han.

457
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:08,933
What does this have to do
with her confession?

458
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,360
The venue rental is 800 yuan.

459
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,333
My boss said Jian Dan
didn't have enough money,

460
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:14,600
so she's trying to gather money.

461
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,022
She's really going all in for this.

462
00:27:28,644 --> 00:27:30,200
Entong, aren't you going to the class?

463
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,466
Thank you for your support.

464
00:27:38,466 --> 00:27:39,840
- How much is this?
- Eight yuan.

465
00:27:40,555 --> 00:27:41,680
The money is transferred.

466
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,640
You're all sold out?

467
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,840
Me too.

468
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,520
Jian Dan, I'll go restock.

469
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,520
I'll go.

470
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,560
It's fine. I got it.

471
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,920
Not bad.

472
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,760
This is nice.

473
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,720
I think this looks good.

474
00:27:56,302 --> 00:27:58,400
Jian Dan, can I spin the wheel

475
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,674
after picking something I want?

476
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,090
Entong. Take a look and see
if there's anything you like.

477
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,320
This one.

478
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll take this.

479
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,580
(90 percent off)

480
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,920
Wow.

481
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,640
I'm lucky.

482
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
Entong, you're so lucky.

483
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,800
You're the first one today
to get 90 percent off.

484
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:37,908
Right?

485
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
If you're busy,

486
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,560
don't let me keep you.

487
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:41,688
Don't worry about me.

488
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:42,622
I'll just browse.

489
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,360
You still need to pay.

490
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,800
Oh, right.

491
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
Okay. The money is transferred.

492
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,911
Excuse me, how do you use this?

493
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,640
Let me show you.

494
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,880
Do you want one?

495
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,680
This is your so-called grand prize?

496
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
It's broken.

497
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,068
Who knows who used it before?

498
00:29:29,165 --> 00:29:30,720
You're scamming people

499
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,840
with broken lipsticks.

500
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,800
What a scam.

501
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,600
Refund me.

502
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,850
I'm not buying anything from you!

503
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,666
- Ridiculous.
- You're playing us for fools.

504
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,080
Exactly. How could you do that?

505
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:39,382
- Yeah.
- Tell me about it.

506
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,960
- How are we supposed to buy from you?
- Business is about trust.

507
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,660
No, it's not that.

508
00:29:42,711 --> 00:29:44,044
There must be a misunderstanding.

509
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:45,600
We checked everything before selling.

510
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,640
They're all new.

511
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,555
Are you saying
that I'm faking it to scam you?

512
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,080
I saw her get the lipstick just now.

513
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,169
That's the one she picked.

514
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,244
I was jealous at that time.

515
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,960
Scamming you for a mere lipstick?

516
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,977
Is that even necessary?

517
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
Your prizes have quality issues.

518
00:29:57,466 --> 00:29:58,720
Everyone, check what you bought.

519
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,988
See if it's fake or defective.

520
00:30:00,377 --> 00:30:02,200
How are we supposed to buy from you
like this?

521
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,880
- Yeah.
- Refund us now.

522
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,280
What's going on here?

523
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:06,840
How could you do that?

524
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,280
You have to be honest.

525
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,600
Refund me now.

526
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,240
Refund me now.

527
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,066
They were all brand new
when I bought them.

528
00:30:13,066 --> 00:30:14,170
How could this have happened?

529
00:30:14,177 --> 00:30:14,640
Quiet, all!

530
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,340
The discipline dean is here.

531
00:30:23,017 --> 00:30:24,240
Who set up this stall?

532
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,720
Who?

533
00:30:30,682 --> 00:30:31,802
Hello, Sir.

534
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,880
Since this is your first time,

535
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,080
I'll let you off this time.

536
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,666
If it ever happens again,

537
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,022
you'll get a demerit.

538
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:50,240
Understood, Sir.

539
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,520
What bad luck.

540
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,680
We were just about to hit 800 yuan.

541
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,320
How did we end up like that?

542
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,880
All messed up.

543
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
The money's gone.

544
00:31:07,222 --> 00:31:08,688
Our stuff got confiscated, too.

545
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,480
So frustrating.

546
00:31:13,177 --> 00:31:14,480
Are you two rich or something?

547
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,440
Can someone's sincerity

548
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,080
be measured in money?

549
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,840
If you really need to make money,

550
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,160
I can introduce a job to you.

551
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,280
It's quick and pays well,

552
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,400
but it's a bit intense

553
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,320
and tiring.

554
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,333
That's fine.
We're not afraid of hard work.

555
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,360
Sure, we'll do it.

556
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,280
Follow me.

557
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,560
You got us a job at the natatorium?

558
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,280
How come I didn't know
it was hiring part-timers?

559
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
No, they're not.

560
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,360
Then why are we here?

561
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,259
They don't look for part-timers.

562
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,630
They're looking for hourly workers.

563
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,800
The pool hasn't been cleaned
in a while.

564
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,720
Your job

565
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,160
is to clean the whole place

566
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,680
before tomorrow morning.

567
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,480
Remember, spick and span.

568
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,811
Jian Dan,

569
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,388
the pool is huge.

570
00:32:25,417 --> 00:32:27,720
Can we finish it in half a day?

571
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,844
It's 800 yuan for half a day's work.

572
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,040
That's a great deal.

573
00:32:31,354 --> 00:32:32,200
Stop complaining.

574
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,857
Yeah.

575
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,000
But still,

576
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,240
why would Han Yansheng

577
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,600
give us this job?

578
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,880
Maybe the pool really needs cleaning.

579
00:32:43,468 --> 00:32:45,000
Look how dirty the floor is.

580
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,440
No one's cleaned in it for ages.

581
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,640
Exactly.

582
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,160
I told you.

583
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,297
With this workload,

584
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,109
Han Yansheng is definitely
not losing out.

585
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,200
He's too smart

586
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:57,160
to do something so dumb.

587
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,017
Enough chatting.

588
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,040
Hurry and work.

589
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,760
If he catches us slacking,

590
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,466
we'll be in trouble.

591
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,417
Here's your payment.

592
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,800
Let me be clear.

593
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,577
If you didn't urgently need the money,

594
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,720
I would've hired professionals instead.

595
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,840
I believe they're faster

596
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,240
and probably do a better job.

597
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Thanks.

598
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,200
Great.

599
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,560
We've got money for the rent.

600
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,160
Let's go.

601
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,880
Thank you, President.

602
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,680
Sheng,

603
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,280
I heard you had Jian Dan and Mi Fen

604
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,560
clean the pool.

605
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,160
I'll deduct the cleaning fee

606
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,800
from our club budget.

607
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,800
No need.

608
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,640
I paid for it personally.

609
00:34:08,688 --> 00:34:10,155
It has nothing to do with the club.

610
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,520
Come. This is done. Hang it up.

611
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,080
Here you go.

612
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,160
Okay.

613
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,800
Look at this.

614
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,800
What do I do with this?

615
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'll pull it.

616
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm heading off.

617
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Dismissed.

618
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,680
(Shi, is there an event
at the coffee shop today?)

619
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,640
(Shi: Jian Dan is confessing there.)

620
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,800
(Why did Shi send the photo
to Sheng?)

621
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,520
(Is Sheng the one she's confessing to?)

622
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,800
Everything's set up, right?

623
00:35:29,088 --> 00:35:29,960
I'll get going then.

624
00:35:30,088 --> 00:35:31,400
Good luck with your confession.

625
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,400
Thank you, Shi.

626
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,120
He was talking to me, right?

627
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,311
Jian Dan, it's almost time.

628
00:35:44,311 --> 00:35:46,000
I need to go back to the dorm
and change.

629
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I'll leave this to you.

630
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,150
Don't worry. I've got this...

631
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,960
Jian Dan.

632
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,960
You're back already?

633
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,920
I came early?

634
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,244
What are you doing here?

635
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,180
Who did you think it would be?

636
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,720
Since you're here,

637
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,760
give me a hand.

638
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,800
(Did she write her confession)

639
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
(inside the paper crane?)

640
00:36:34,377 --> 00:36:35,720
(That's so cliche.)

641
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,555
Why is there nothing inside?

642
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,200
Maybe this one?

643
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,440
I just folded them.

644
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,880
Why did you open them all?

645
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,400
You.

646
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:57,511
Go rest over there.
