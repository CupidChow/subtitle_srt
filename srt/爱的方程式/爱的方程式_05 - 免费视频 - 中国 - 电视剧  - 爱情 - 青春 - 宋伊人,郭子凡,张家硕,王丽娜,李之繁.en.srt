16

I didn't know
President Han could do rock climbing.

You can do it, Han!

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,985
Go, President Han!

22
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,934
- Go!
- You got this!

23
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,240
You can do it!

How is he so good at rock climbing?

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,120
Han's into outdoor sports.

28

- Go!

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,778

with a recruitment idea.

How are you supposed to build
and expand the Rock Climbing Club?

85

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
I'm the club president.

87
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,840
I'll take responsibility for it.

I signed the authorization form,

95
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,488
so I have to take responsibility.

96
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,400
If the club can't launch,

97
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,160

115

This assignment won't just

116
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,680
test your academic skills.

117
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,043
It's also practice
for working effectively

as a team under pressure.

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080

120
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,240
in tough situations,

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,080

you least want to team up with.

What? Not happy about it?

127
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,466

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,003
We're supposed

138
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,960
to conduct a survey, gather the data,

139
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,200
and make charts and graphs.

140
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,880

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,560

148
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,600

Isn't that great?

165
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,222
Prince Luo Shui is your idol.

166
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,160
If he shows up,

167
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,120
you'll get to meet him in person.

168
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,360

True that.

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,520

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,280

his contact information.

00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,280
Here's the thing.

189
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,440
My university is hosting a cosplay show,

190
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,640
and I want to invite him

191
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,560
as a special guest.

192
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
Do you have his contact information?

193
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm afraid I can't give you that.

194
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,466
But you can try messaging him on Weibo.

195
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,400
Maybe he'll say yes
if he's in a good mood.

196
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
But Prince Luo Shui's

197
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,680
a cosplay legend.

198
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,740
Would someone like him
notice a nobody like me?

199
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,022
You never know until you try.

200
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,600
You're sincere.

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,960
If he turns you down,

202
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,880
he'd be letting down a devoted fan.

203
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Right, Yuan Sen?

204
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,440
Right.

205
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,720
You're right.

206
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,760
If he says yes, awesome.

207
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
If not, oh well.

208
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,480
Thanks a lot.

209
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,660
No problem. Sit down.
I've got other customers to serve.

210
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,155
Okay.

211
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,120
Welcome. This way, please.

212
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,160
Is Prince Luo Shui really that great?

213
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,080
Of course.

214
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,840
He's the best cosplayer

215
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
I've ever seen.

216
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,880
Every character he plays

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,120
is unique and memorable.

218
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,480
Most importantly,

219
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,120
he sticks to his own style.

220
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,880
He never changes

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,280
just to match the crowd's tastes.

222
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,080
Anyway,

223
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,720
he's way better than you.

224
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,280
I thought
you only liked him for his looks.

225
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,480
That too, obviously.

226
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,960
Prince Luo Shui is gorgeous.

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,280
You don't like him?

228
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,800
I have him

229
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,560
as my Weibo profile picture.

230
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,080
He's my Moments cover photo.

231
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,240
Everything in my notes is about him.

232
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,040
And most importantly,

233
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,720
I've got all his merchandise.

234
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,720
Done.

235
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,840
All right, I'm out.

236
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,520
Got stuff to do.

237
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,440
Later.

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,000
See you.

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,240
(Lucky Koi Girl: Hello, Prince Luo Shui.)

240
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,622
(I'm Mi Fen from
Ocean University's Cosplay Club.)

241
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,000
(Our club is planning)

242
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,800
(an eco-themed cosplay event.)

243
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,480
(We'd like to invite you
to appear as a special guest.)

244
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,880
(Would that be possible?)

245
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
Why do you keep sighing?

246
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,720
I messaged Prince Luo Shui,

247
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,520
but he still hasn't replied.

248
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,560
Looks like I'm out of luck.

249
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:30,280
What?

250
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,120
Our club president told me

251
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,280
I have to go to the cafeteria

252
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,480
before noon tomorrow
to do a waste-sorting campaign.

253
00:14:36,214 --> 00:14:37,160
What a coincidence.

254
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,600
Han Yansheng and I
are also going to the cafeteria

255
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,890
at noon tomorrow for our survey.

256
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,222
Let's go together.

257
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,570
(Apartment Buildings No. 15, 16)

258
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,480
Fen,

259
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
who are you cosplaying as today?

260
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,000
Can't you tell?

261
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,280
A trash can.

262
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,400
That's convincing.

263
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Thanks.

264
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,200
All in for the sake
of environmental awareness.

265
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,644
You can do this.

266
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,622
It's the president.

267
00:15:07,276 --> 00:15:08,280
Hello? President?

268
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,440
Mi Fen, where are you?

269
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,043
Everyone's waiting. Hurry up.

270
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,760
Okay.

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,560
At least you're on time.

272
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,266
Let's get started.

273
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,920
Isn't this a bit much?

274
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:28,480
Can't you just record on your phone?

275
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,320
I have standards.

276
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,244
If I'm going to do it,

277
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm going to do it right.

278
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,760
How's the questionnaire?

279
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,992
(Survey on University Students' Views
on Romantic Relationships)

280
00:15:45,555 --> 00:15:47,080
You made this whole thing by yourself?

281
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,000
Who else

282
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
would've helped me?

283
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I stayed up all night researching

284
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,044
just to come up with these questions.

285
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,040
Not bad, right?

286
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,444
It's usable, I guess.

287
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,880
Miss,

288
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,920
could I take two minutes
of your time to fill out...

289
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,200
Sorry, I don't have time.

290
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,960
Miss,

291
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,720
could you spare a few minutes

292
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,960
to fill out a quick survey?

293
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,920
Sorry, I'm busy.

294
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,080
Okay.

295
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,760
Miss, would you mind taking two minutes

296
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,240
to fill...

297
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,955
Not interested.

298
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:25,880
Not interested.

299
00:16:27,311 --> 00:16:28,200
Sorry to disturb you.

300
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,680
No one wants to...

301
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,480
Yuan Sen!

302
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:36,680
Can you spare two minutes

303
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,000
to fill out our survey?

304
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,360
No.

305
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:50,360
Why won't anyone take our survey?

306
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,840
Why are you so bad at this?

307
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,080
Fine.

308
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,280
You do it then.

309
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,360
I will. Hold this.

310
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,120
I don't know how to operate that.

311
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,400
Ugh, you're hopeless.

312
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,377
I'll teach you.

313
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Press the red button
when you start recording.

314
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,760
Don't press it yet.

315
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:20,400
Put it on your shoulder. There.

316
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,440
Try to keep the camera steady

317
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
while filming.

318
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,280
Don't shake it too much, okay?

319
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,160
Okay.

320
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,480
Like this?

321
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,280
Don't film me.

322
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,044
Film other people.

323
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:41,480
Hello.

324
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,280
Please take a look at waste sorting.

325
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,560
Hello.

326
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
Let's protect the Earth together!

327
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,120
Waste sorting. Check it out!

328
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,160
Hello.

329
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,870
Everyone's responsible
for waste sorting...

330
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,440
Yes, President?

331
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,160
Mi Fen,

332
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,577
did Prince Luo Shui agree
to join the event?

333
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,640
Not yet.

334
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,280
That's not good enough.

335
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,920
This is a meaningful event,

336
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,680
but it doesn't have much reach.

337
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,920
We need someone like Prince Luo Shui

338
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
to boost the impact.

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,360
We're running out of time.
Mi Fen, you've got to step it up.

340
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,800
Got it, President.

341
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

342
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,200
I promise.

343
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,160
Bye.

344
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,929
(Lucky Koi Girl: Prince Luo Shui,)

345
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,120
(a small-time club like ours
doesn't have much influence.)

346
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,920
(We really need someone
as well-known as you)

347
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,280
(to help raise awareness)

348
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:56,911
(about environmental protection.)

349
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,360
(I sincerely ask once more)

350
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,222
(that you consider joining our event.)

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,080
Did you remember everything

352
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,120
I told you?

353
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,400
Yes.

354
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Really?

355
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,040
All right. From now on,

356
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,076
the camera is in your hands.

357
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,680
When filming people,

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,760
use medium and close shots.

359
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,880
What's a medium or close shot?

360
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,466
You girls are always taking selfies.
But you don't know this?

361
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,200
Selfies?

362
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,800
You mean like this?

363
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,920
Is this about right?

364
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,440
From the waist up is a medium shot.

365
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,560
Chest up is a close-up.

366
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,200
So this counts as a medium shot, right?

367
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,422
Watch yourself!

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,480
You could've broken the camera.

369
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,200
You mean your brain is broken.

370
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:22,960
Let's go.

371
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,160
Ladies,

372
00:20:24,822 --> 00:20:26,822
would you be willing
to help us fill out a survey?

373
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,720
Sure.

374
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,733
Pretty privilege works, all right.

375
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:47,880
Wait.

376
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,760
Why are all the surveys with girls?

377
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,320
Can't help it. The ladies just love me.

378
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,680
If our respondents are mostly girls
and barely any guys,

379
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,000
our data's going to be skewed.

380
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,400
We need to survey some guys too.

381
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,520
But it's past lunch rush

382
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
and it's the weekend.

383
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:09,560
Where are we going to find anyone?

384
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,022
Monkey, call everyone.

385
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,755
Let's meet at Yangfang Coffee.

386
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,280
Thanks.

387
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, it's you.

388
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:01,880
Over here!

389
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,560
Where's Yuan Sen? I don't see him.

390
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,000
I already told him.

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,888
He'll be here soon.

392
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,280
By the way, Han,

393
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,422
what's with all the mystery?

394
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,680
Look.

395
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:16,333
"Survey on University Students' Views
on Romantic Relationships"?

396
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:17,600
This is why we're here?

397
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,880
I'm out of here.

398
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,800
Wait!

399
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,560
Just fill one out for me.

400
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,280
It's for a group project in an elective.

401
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,680
Right now
we've got way more girls than guys.

402
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,560
Help us out.

403
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,422
Please? Pretty please?

404
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,600
Come on.

405
00:22:31,777 --> 00:22:34,200
You're making a single guy
fill out a relationship survey?

406
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:34,920
You sure?

407
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,040
Aren't you guys majoring
in Applied Mathematics?

408
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,911
What's that got to do
with relationship views?

409
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
Math comes

410
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,360
from life

411
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,000
and is meant to be applied to life.

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,120
We're studying applied math.

413
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,160
So we use math

414
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,390
to analyze real-world problems

415
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
and solve them.

416
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,920
I just happened

417
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,320
to draw this topic.

418
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,760
Fine.

419
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,800
I'll do it for you two.

420
00:23:12,422 --> 00:23:13,488
Got a pen for me too?

421
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,400
Here.

422
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,840
What's this?

423
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,222
Do you think long-distance relationships
can last?

424
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,977
If you like each other,
you should be together.

425
00:23:25,977 --> 00:23:26,600
Why separate?

426
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,545
Why go long-distance?

427
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,200
Sheesh.

428
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,120
What do you think

429
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,977
is the biggest issue
university couples face?

430
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,640
A. Differences and incompatibility.

431
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,400
B. Can't stay together after graduation.

432
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,440
C. Financial pressure.

433
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,240
Other.

434
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,560
Are you kidding me?

435
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,120
How can those be the only issues?

436
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,577
The biggest problem is how

437
00:23:47,577 --> 00:23:49,320
to get a girlfriend in the first place!

438
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:51,920
Just pick one already.

439
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,280
What's with these questions?

440
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,760
You're all here.

441
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,600
Entong.

442
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,720
What are you guys doing?

443
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,840
And the camera too?

444
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,080
Jian Dan and Han

445
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,240
are doing a survey project
for their elective.

446
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,280
Let me take a look.

447
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,280
"What's your idea of ideal love?"

448
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,280
Love at first sight.

449
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,840
Growing feelings over time.

450
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,560
Childhood sweethearts.

451
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,760
Soulmates.

452
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,480
Shi's answer
is definitely childhood sweethearts.

453
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,420
(Childhood sweethearts)

454
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,880
You guys can sit down. I'm done.

455
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,640
Thanks.

456
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,520
That was fast.

457
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,200
See? That's efficiency.

458
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,200
Over here!

459
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:41,080
Sorry, I'm late.

460
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,320
We still need a few more.

461
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,640
Can you help us fill one out?

462
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,480
Can I say no?

463
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,640
Come on, Yuan Sen. Just help me out.

464
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,400
Have a seat.

465
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,000
What's your idea of ideal love?

466
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:09,480
Which one did you pick?

467
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,640
Me? I chose love at first sight.

468
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,080
If someone can't catch my eye

469
00:25:14,155 --> 00:25:15,479
from the beginning,

470
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,177
I know I'll never fall for them
no matter how long we spend together.

471
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:19,560
What about you?

472
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,577
Love at first sight
or growing feelings over time?

473
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:26,449
(Love at first sight)

474
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,920
You picked love at first sight?

475
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,000
You like someone, don't you?

476
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,080
Who is it?

477
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
Do I know her? Is she cute?

478
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,320
No comment.

479
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
Boring.

480
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,160
We still need one more.

481
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,200
Sheng, did you fill it out yet?

482
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
All right. Monkey, record me.

483
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,320
You got it.

484
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,360
Done.

485
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,000
Thanks.

486
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,980
(Soulmates)

487
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,240
Soulmates?

488
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,880
Sheng,

489
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,440
what's your idea

490
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
of a soulmate?

491
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
Let's hear it.

492
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,000
A soulmate should be someone

493
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,680
who really gets you.

494
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,200
Just one look

495
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,160
and they know what you're thinking.

496
00:26:23,044 --> 00:26:24,240
The person who knows you best?

497
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,360
Besides your mom,

498
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,133
it's probably just Entong, right?

499
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,466
That's nowhere near enough.

500
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,555
A true soulmate should
share your hobbies too.

501
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,560
Like swimming and math.

502
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,960
Likes math and swimming?

503
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,760
You just described Jian Dan!

504
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,240
I'll send you the footage tonight.

505
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,000
You make the slides.

506
00:26:59,022 --> 00:27:00,390
I'll do the presentation on Monday.

507
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,520
Why don't you make the slideshow

508
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,840
and I do the talking?

509
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,080
Are you better
at public speaking than me?

510
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:06,760
I...

511
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
Or can you not even make a slideshow?

512
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:12,890
You're the one who can't!

513
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,490
It's settled then.
Send it to me when you're done.

514
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,088
I'll revise and add to it.

515
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,040
Why is it always your way or no way?

516
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,080
We're supposed to work as a team.

517
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,680
Why is it always me
doing all the heavy lifting?

518
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,240
What now?

519
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,520
Here, eat something with me.

520
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,160
What's wrong?

521
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
Is it not going well?

522
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
It's going okay, I guess.

523
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,920
What about you?
Did Prince Luo Shui reply yet?

524
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,200
I was way too full of myself.

525
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,520
I really thought he would say yes.

526
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,440
Maybe I should never have

527
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,960
suggested it to begin with.

528
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,760
You never know.
Maybe a miracle will happen.

529
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,240
There's no such thing as miracles.

530
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,320
Why don't you check?

531
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,555
It might be Prince Luo Shui.

532
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,160
Prince Luo Shui? No way.

533
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,133
I bet it's from the club chat.
I'll check later.

534
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,600
Just look at it. What if it is?

535
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
What if what?

536
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,880
Not happening.

537
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,080
(Prince Luo Shui: I'll join the event.)

538
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,400
A miracle just happened.

539
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,600
What?

540
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,786
Prince Luo Shui replied!

541
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,600
That's amazing! I knew it!

542
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,520
This is awesome!

543
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,920
He actually replied!

544
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm so happy, Jian Dan!

545
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,880
As soon as he replied,

546
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,200
I knew I could get him to come!

547
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,800
But what should I say back?

548
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,440
I'll reply with...

549
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,240
No.

550
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,640
What do I write back?

551
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,280
I'll say...

552
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,440
(Lucky Koi Girl: Thank you!
We'll be expecting you!)

553
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,788
Lucky Koi Girl?

554
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,560
Is that your crush?

555
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:33,400
Don't jump to conclusions.

556
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,400
Way to go, Han!

557
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:45,511
You turned your documentary
into a rom-com, huh?

558
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,520
Quit it.

559
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,880
Jealous.

560
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:25,666
(Han Yansheng:
