1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I love you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love you

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I love you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Love by Hypnotic

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 10

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
One more group

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been in two groups

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who said that you should stay in the swimming club on a regular basis?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can't stand it from the beginning

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're so capable

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Where is this training?

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's obviously deliberately provoking me

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're so mean

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Of course

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This training plan is designed for the elite of the swimming club

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's normal for a newcomer like you to not be able to stand it

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you want to quit, I will not force you

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, I need to get a degree

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Otherwise, I can't get the full scholarship for the summer semester

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If I want to quit, I will never quit

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Three, two, one

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You can't do it

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Little girl, let's see how long you can hold on

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who did this?

36
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,000
Who did this?

37
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,000
How...

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
How did it end up like this?

39
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,360
Peng Teng.

40
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Did you do this?

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,000
You're already

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
putting the wild ambition of the mountain chicken on the top.

43
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
You're here to blame me?

44
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
Don't blame me.

45
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
I'm reading.

46
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,000
You've never read

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,400
in your life.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,680
And...

49
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,120
I got the book.

50
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,800
I can read it

51
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
however I want.

52
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
I can't do it.

53
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Since I entered school,

54
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,720
you've been targeting me everywhere.

55
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Except you.

56
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
I really can't think of

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,240
anyone else who can do such a boring thing.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,600
Yue Tang Tang.

59
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,040
Are you a fool?

60
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,160
Do you have any evidence?

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,520
The pigment on your hand is the evidence.

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,360
I got it when I was drawing.

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
What is this?

64
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,600
I got hair dye

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
to prove that I did it.

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
You're so weird.

67
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's compare the colors.

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's see the brightest yellow.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm kidding.

70
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,840
I didn't put yellow on my hair.

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,480
Yue Tang Tang.

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
You're so boring.

73
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,400
Since you want to

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
change my hairstyle,

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,480
I'll send you a message

76
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,880
at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow.

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I can do all that I want.

78
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,680
I can be a Necromancer.

79
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,280
He's...

80
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,240
No.

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,360
I can't let him recognize me even if I beat him to death.

82
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,080
I'll give you a hand.

83
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,120
How... how do you ride a bike?

84
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
Can't you see the road?

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm sorry.

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,880
I can't let you go right away.

87
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,000
Are you crazy?

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,120
I'll walk on the road.

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,440
You pretend to be like this.

90
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,360
Don't. Don't. Don't.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
Don't. Don't.

92
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,160
You're too far.

93
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,080
I can't get you out.

94
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,160
Hurry up. Hurry up.

95
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,880
Are you done?

96
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Right away. Right away.

97
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,960
Come on.

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,480
What's this sound?

99
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Hurry up.

100
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,960
Come on.

101
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,520
Come on.

102
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,800
I'm not eating the ice cream,

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,280
I want to eat ice cream now.

104
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,640
I'll go now.

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,440
We still have a long way to go to por】

106
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Get off the bus.

108
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,680
Why are you...

109
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
Get off and drive.

110
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,320
Mr. Yuan's coffee.

111
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
valikkuz horizontally.

112
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,720
Please make it my order.

113
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm going to the bathroom.

114
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Okay.

115
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,440
Han.

116
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,600
What are you holding in your hand?

117
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,240
Han,

118
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,560
why are you so different?

119
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
You like Bao Kemeng,

120
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,400
but you are Pikachu.

121
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
Don't mention it.

122
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,240
I met a strange woman.

123
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,160
She had a gray hair.

124
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,160
She ran away when she met me.

125
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,240
I didn't dare to touch her face.

126
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
You are so popular recently.

127
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
You are the head of the explosion

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,000
and you have a colorful phoenix head.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,840
Head of the explosion?

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,760
You mean the girl who

131
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,560
went to the news with Han?

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,240
Don't mention her.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,920
Beautiful.

134
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,040
Isn't that a simple one?

135
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,920
Isn't she the head of the explosion?

136
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
Her hair is changed.

137
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,320
Don't mention it.

138
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,240
It looks good.

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,400
Fan, I'm here.

140
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Where are you?

141
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,800
She is cute.

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, she is.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,680
You are so different.

144
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,960
How is she cute?

145
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,440
I'm on the second floor. Come up.

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,320
Fan.

147
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,080
Simple.

148
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,440
The new hairstyle suits you.

149
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,000
It's cute.

150
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,320
I think I'm getting smaller.

151
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,080
Look.

152
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,160
This is the new hair style of the Prince of Luo.

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,840
One person can only get one set.

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,320
One fan and one key chain.

155
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
So now

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,200
we two change a position.

157
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,360
I can get one more set.

158
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:28,800
How is it?

159
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,720
Isn't it smart?

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,760
Why is she here?

161
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Who?

162
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,320
She is coming up.

163
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
She can't find me here.

164
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,200
But she is coming up.

165
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,200
Are you hiding from me?

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,720
Hi.

167
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
What a coincidence.

168
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Did you do anything wrong?

169
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,000
No.

170
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,360
You still have time to cut your hair and get a new set.

171
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,040
It seems that you have a lot of energy.

172
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,200
Did I give you less tasks?

173
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,120
Not me.

174
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,400
It's...

175
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
You will practice more tomorrow.

176
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't be late.

177
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,120
Simple.

178
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
This hairstyle is good.

179
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,560
I won't be your hair dryer anymore.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,400
I'm not the one who fell into the water.

181
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,560
You are making a mess.

182
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,320
Give it to me.

183
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,800
Continue.

184
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,400
Hurry up.

185
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Move.

186
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,680
Take a break.

187
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,800
Don't say that.

188
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,760
You don't have to come up.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,440
I think your energy is quite vigorous.

190
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
You don't need to take a break.

191
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,040
Practice for another hour.

192
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,720
It was a misunderstanding yesterday.

193
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,680
Actually, I am...

194
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,000
After one hour of practice,

195
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,120
do a set of squats on the shore.

196
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Bring out your new energy.

197
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I believe you can do it.

198
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:10,920
Start.

199
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm not the one who is really new.

200
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,560
Count.

201
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Silence.

202
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,120
Chinese?

203
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,080
İns��.

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,600
Are you too strict with her?

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,880
Very?

206
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,160
Quite cruel.

207
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Han Yansheng

208
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
You're too much

209
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,160
I have something to do

210
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,320
I'm leaving

211
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,600
Why did you do that?

212
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,400
You asked for it

213
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,040
What do you mean?

214
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,720
You're still asking for it?

215
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,840
When you sent me the photo

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,320
you were bold enough

217
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,320
What photo?

218
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,000
When did I send you the photo?

219
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,040
Look at it yourself

220
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,840
Did I ask the monkey to give you the letter of apology?

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,840
What?

222
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,720
You have nothing to say now?

223
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,560
You misunderstood

224
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,560
I gave it to you

225
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,320
You caused me so much trouble

226
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,080
You still think it's a misunderstanding?

227
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,880
It's my fault to make you water

228
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,640
But I really don't know about the photo

229
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,480
I asked the monkey to give you the letter of apology

230
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Stop lying

231
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,880
I won't believe you anymore

232
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,360
Fine

233
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,600
Fine

234
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,680
You won't believe me even if I know what I'm saying

235
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,280
Tell me

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,120
What should I do to make up for you?

237
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,280
Fine

238
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,600
From now on

239
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,040
you're my personal assistant for ten days

240
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,680
I'll do whatever you want

241
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,400
Personal assistant?

242
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,640
Of course

243
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,160
You can say no

244
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,400
I'll keep on training you

245
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,200
until I'm satisfied

246
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,240
Fine

247
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,760
I promise you

248
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,320
But don't go too far

249
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,160
Of course

250
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Give me your phone

251
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,640
From now on

252
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,320
you must answer my phone

253
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,640
and keep me posted

254
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,840
Go to the training first

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,680
After training

256
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,320
go to the canteen to buy me lunch

257
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,480
I want rice on the first floor

258
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,240
soup on the second floor

259
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,920
spicy chicken on the third floor

260
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
fried eggs with scallions on the fourth floor

261
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,200
steamed crab on the fifth floor

262
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Say it again

263
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,120
I never repeat my words

264
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,920
Go ahead

265
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,480
I'm sorry

266
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,560
I'm sorry

267
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,520
I'm sorry

268
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm sorry

269
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,640
I'm sorry

270
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,720
Rice on the first floor

271
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
soup on the second floor

272
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,040
spicy chicken on the third floor

273
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,120
spicy chicken on the third floor

274
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,400
Mr. Han

275
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Can I add your WeChat?

276
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,280
It's inconvenient

277
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
I won't disturb you

278
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,440
It's just that there are some words

279
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,480
that are inconvenient to say in person

280
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,360
I want to tell you through WeChat

281
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,720
Then you can call me assistant

282
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,960
I'll answer you later

283
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
Sister Xiao, I'll scan you

284
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,600
I want to change my class

285
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,560
I want to change my taste

286
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
for today's lunch

287
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,480
I want fried noodles on the first floor

288
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,320
braised pork on the second floor

289
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,840
pork ribs soup on the third floor

290
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,160
Okay

291
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,120
Why don't you go?

292
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Don't worry

293
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,600
Your food will be here soon

294
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Your takeout

295
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,200
Thank you

296
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,600
Here's your Mercedes

297
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,680
What's the point of this?

298
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,580
® School Arable Delivery Platform

299
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,840
disponibles for free

300
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,840
You're clever

301
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,360
You didn't say you weren't allowed to order takeaway

302
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,400
There is also a file delivery service

303
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Wait a minute.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,600
There's one more thing I haven't finished.

305
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
Han Yan Sheng,

306
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,040
since the first time I met you at the campus,

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,240
I've been deeply attracted to you.

308
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I didn't say it.

309
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,480
It's the girl I like who said it to you.

310
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,600
I wanted to send it to you directly,

311
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
but you're too precious.

312
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,840
You're so

313
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,840
beautiful.

314
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm afraid you won't read it.

315
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,840
So I read it for you.

316
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Beautiful skin,

317
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
don't read it anymore.

318
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Interesting soul,

319
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,840
you're so different from the rest.

320
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,840
I haven't finished.

321
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,840
I'll miss you tomorrow morning.

322
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll miss you in the afternoon.

323
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,840
I'll miss you in the evening

324
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
when I'm affected by this.

325
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:21,840
Han Yan Sheng, I like you.

326
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,840
I don't want results, I don't want to be with you,

327
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,840
I don't want to have,

328
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,840
I just want to meet you in my most beautiful years.

329
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,840
I'm not interested in you.

331
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm going to have a meeting.

332
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,840
Please go out.

333
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Okay.

334
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,840
You look in a good mood today.

335
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm in a good mood.

336
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Who's bothering you?

337
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Let's not talk about this first.

338
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
Let's read.

339
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Are you reading your female mathematician's book again?

340
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Xi Fa Di,

341
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
the lowest female mathematician in human history,

342
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
is called the goddess of women.

343
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,840
She's the queen of women.

344
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
Isn't this the most recent issue

345
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
published in the Mathematics magazine?

346
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,840
What's wrong?

347
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,840
Do you want to challenge it?

348
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
It's difficult in the first chapter.

349
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
I can do it if I have time.

350
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Spend some time.

351
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Take your time.

352
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,840
I have to go to work.

353
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,840
Let's do it together.

354
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
I'll return the book.

355
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Okay, I'll wait for you at the door.

356
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
Okay.

357
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
Find a place to sit first.

358
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
I'll take two books first.

359
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Okay.

360
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
alien

361
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Eggman

362
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,480
Okay.

363
00:19:59,320 --> 00:19:59,960
Yandan,

364
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,280
why did you take so long to finish?

365
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,760
I found interesting math questions.

366
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
I can't even figure out

367
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,640
where you are studying.

368
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,560
Where is it?

369
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,560
I'll teach you the professional knowledge

370
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,640
after I finish this question.

371
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,560
It's easy.

372
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,360
You're the only one in this world

373
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,160
who takes the whole scholarship.

374
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
It's easy for you, of course.

375
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,240
But for a scholar like me,

376
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,240
it's too difficult.

377
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,040
By the way, Jiang Dan.

378
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,520
You're so good at math.

379
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,040
Why don't you major in math?

380
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,920
Math is my hobby.

381
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,160
But I want to help more people.

382
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,520
Who can believe me?

383
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,040
I see.

384
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,240
Okay.

385
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,120
Take your time.

386
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,880
I'll take a nap.

387
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,960
Remember to teach me after you finish.

388
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,480
Done.

389
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400

Don't peek.

392
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,640
You're too old.

393
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,960
Happy birthday.

394
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,640
equation of power.

395
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,480
Even if everything eventually went smooth,

396
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,880
it'd still be fine if

397
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,600
Temple of définitive supply is Heraus withdrew.

398
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,920
Yes.

399
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,860
We still have so much

400
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:54,280

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,560

402
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,280
or in the end she stayed

403
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,040

What a waste of your self-confidence now

408
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,140
I thought the solution

409
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,860
is to concentrate more

410
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,480
and mind your little useful

411
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,640
Can you pay this back to me

412
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,160
before I give it back to you?

413
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,980
Of course

414
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,480
I heard about your

415
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,180
Cai Ning Haixing

416
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,240
You're him

417
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,420
You're so nervous

418
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,820
Fine, I'll go.

419
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,660
You're indeed here.

420
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,020
Who are you?

421
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,380
My crimson.

422
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,700
It's written by a girl.

423
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,020
Could it be that

424
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,900
your hip-hop girl has appeared?

425
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,540
Bao Han,

426
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,700
are you sure your girl will come back for the test?

427
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,540
Are you sure?

428
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,260
The previous one

429
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,700
was just a normal competition question.

430
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,700
The impact is considered difficult.

431
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,100
And this one

432
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,700
is difficult in level S.

433
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,500
Ordinary people can't answer it.

434
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,180
They can't even understand the question.

435
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,260
Only real math enthusiasts

436
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,700
can answer correctly.

437
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,620
I hope it won't disappoint me.

438
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,540
What's wrong?

439
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,580
You're really a good girl.

440
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,100
You can fall asleep anywhere.

441
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,300
You mean I'm simple?

442
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,140
You're a little self-confident.

443
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,180
The past

444
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,700
is now clear.

445
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,420
Tomorrow,

446
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,660
you'll be a good girl.

447
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
I'm not a good girl.

448
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I'm not a good girl.

449
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
I'm not a good girl.

450
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,380
I'm not a good girl.

451
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,380
I'm not a good girl.

452
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
I'm not a good girl.

453
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,380
I'm not a good girl.

454
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,740
Come to my office tomorrow.

455
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,620
Handle the work.

456
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,820
Embroidery

457
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,700
Embroidery

458
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,860
The cup is broken.

459
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,660
It needs to be repaired.

460
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,460
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,060
What's in your hand?

462
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,700
Your plate.

463
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,940
Come on, Dacheng!

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,600

468

through

469
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,100
I'll take a picture for you.

470
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:01,940
Look here.

471
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,180
Smile.

472
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,980
Who allowed you to touch my senior?

473
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,980
It's not me. You misunderstood.

474
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,060
You're holding the senior.

475
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:15,900
You're still making excuses.

476
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,980
He was like this when I came in.

477
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,900
Is there anyone else

478
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,180
in this room except you and me?

479
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,300
I didn't fall.

480
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,580
I was taking pictures just now.

481
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,460
I was thinking of a way to fix it.

482
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,740
You don't have to do this.

483
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,420
I'll pay you back.

484
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:47,780
No need.

485
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,180
I'll admit it if I did it.

486
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,940
I'll never admit it if I didn't do it.

487
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,620
I have nothing to do with the trophy.

488
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:00,620
Believe it or not, you have it.

489
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,420
What's wrong with you?

490
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,460
Simple?

491
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Han,

492
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,820
the training plan of the swimming club

493
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,700
is sent to you.

494
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,780
Why is the trophy broken?

495
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,740
Who did it?

496
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,540
Is anyone else okay?

497
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,220
Han,

498
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,620
why is there no ticket to the concert?

499
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,260
It must be the person who left the trophy

500
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,580
in the mess.

501
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,140
Who could it be?

502
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,620
Whoever fell

503
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,140
will be found out tonight.

504
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,780
The memory is too temporary

505
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,780
that it suddenly feels like death

506
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
The memory is too temporary

507
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,780
It doesn't hurt or it doesn't heal

508
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,780
but it's repeated

509
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Where should I start

510
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,780
to touch the past

511
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,780
In a certain way

512
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
in a certain period

513
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,780
I haven't forgotten you

514
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,780
I haven't forgotten you

515
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,780
In a certain period

516
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,780
I haven't forgotten you

517
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,780
My eyes are already red

518
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Red as a poem

519
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,780
Those young days

520
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:13,780
are ordinary but interesting

521
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
In the time

522
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,780
I quietly didn't know

523
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,780
Those broken pasts

524
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,780
The vague names

525
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,780
are fine

526
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:36,780
We once had each other

527
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,780
Those young days

528
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,780
are not to be forgotten

529
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,780
But one day

530
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,780
The promise has become a luxury

531
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,780
Those broken pasts

532
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,780
It never changes

533
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:05,780
The color of life
