You're my girlfriend.

Of course that's my business.

16
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,880
I...

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,960
I'm not your girlfriend.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,480
You've accepted this token of love.

19
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,800
Still trying to deny it?

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
A token of love?

21
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,440
Isn't this your gift for Jiang Zhishan?

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,200
Did you know

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
what those letters on the necklace mean?

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,000
Hypatia?

25
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,440
That's right. It's Hypatia.

26
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,920
My math goddess.

27
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:42,880
Does that mean

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,600
this necklace
has always meant to be mine?

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,160
Why did you give this necklace to me?

30
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,160
Why did you give the mug to me?

31
00:03:08,311 --> 00:03:09,733
What's it with your backside?

32
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,320
Don't you look at it.

You're no longer a kid.
How could you fall?

34
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:19,240
Didn't you watch your step?

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Hold my hand.

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,800

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
What was with that look?

58
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:42,714
People would think

59
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:44,720
it's a gift from your boyfriend.

60
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,160
Isn't it a gift from Jiang?

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
(It's indeed from my boyfriend.)

62
00:05:52,805 --> 00:05:54,880
Actually, tonight...

63
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm back!

64
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,280
Dating is tiring.

65
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,000
Right, Jian Dan?

66
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,480
Indeed.

67
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,880
You're always all clingy with Monkey.

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Of course you're tired.

69
00:06:11,051 --> 00:06:12,994
I'm clingy with Monkey?

70
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,120
You're way clingier with Yuan Sen.

71
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,760
How am I clingy with Yuan Sen?

72
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
How are you not clingy with Yuan Sen?

73
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
Not as clingy as you and Monkey.

74
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,920
When did you ever see

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,066
me being clingy with Monkey?

76
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:27,560

for the elective tomorrow.)

79
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,311
Really?

80
00:07:18,777 --> 00:07:19,937
Let me do yours too.

81
00:07:23,782 --> 00:07:24,680
Here I go.

82
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Let's do it.

83
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,600
Perfect, right?

84
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:44,560
Alright, all done.

85
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:47,925
Take a look.

86
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,400
How is it? Pretty good, huh?

87
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,880
Three, two...

88
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Looks good.

89
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,000
This one...

90
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,760
Yeah. Here.

91
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,720
Hold on a second.

92
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,360
Hello? Yuan Sen?

93
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,480
Mi Fen, the movie starts in ten minutes.

94
00:08:11,788 --> 00:08:12,554
Come down now.

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,440
I totally forgot.

96
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,880
Okay, okay! I'm coming, bye!

97
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,480
Jian Dan, I need to...

98
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,080
It's okay, go on.

99
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,760
You already did one for me.

100
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,680
I'll just use that

101
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,177
as reference for the other side.

102
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,480
Sure, I have faith in you.

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,760
Don't worry.

104
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,600
I'm off, then.

105
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,240
Jian Dan.

106
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,480
What's wrong?

107
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,280
Here's your jacket.

108
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:11,680
What happened?

109
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:13,800
It's nothing.

110
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,920
Turn around. Let me see.

111
00:09:18,697 --> 00:09:19,337
Let me see.

112
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,466
The class starts now.

113
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,920
(I didn't mean to do that.)

114
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:47,560
(Are you mad?)

115
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,440
"You're really cute when you're angry."

116
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,390
Use your core body parts for propulsion.

117
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,840
Back heel, front hand...

118
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,550
Use your shoulder first,
and then the front foot.

119
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:43,080
Make sure you get the basics.

120
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,560
Okay? Get a feel for it.

121
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,268
The President and Jian Dan are here.

122
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,480
They're holding hands!

123
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,777
Wait, what's going on?

124
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,422
They're holding hands!

125
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,920
You two...

126
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,445
If they're holding hands,
that means they're dating!

127
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:58,760
If this gets out,

128
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,748
won't the whole campus be talking?

129
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:02,240
Exactly!

130
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,920
That's right.

131
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,360
Jian Dan and I are seeing each other.

132
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,560
The Sheng-Dan ship is real!

133
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,040
What a sweet moment!

134
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,440
Even Han Yansheng

135
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,920
has fallen in love!

136
00:12:18,182 --> 00:12:18,760
Jian Dan.

137
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
Why are you covering your face? Shy?

138
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,000
It's fine.

139
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,200
I think it's pretty cute.

140
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
Why are your brows so thick?

141
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,533
You look like Shin-chan.

142
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,920
I'm going to find some makeup remover.

143
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
Nice, Han!

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
You're into this now?

145
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,960
- President! President! President!
- President! President! President!

146
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
Here's your fried chicken.

147
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,360
And this one.

148
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,920
What took you so long?

149
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,640
I tried my best, okay?

150
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,360
You have no idea
how jammed Ningda Road was.

151
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,560
I was stuck for a whole hour.

152
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,160
Besides,

153
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
this café serves fried chicken too.

154
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,040
Why insist on trendy fried chicken?

155
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,200
It's not the same.

156
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,400
I came across Binsjoy Chicken

157
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,488
on Douyin.

158
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,800
It's super popular.

159
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,680
You should really delete that app.

160
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,320
Do you want one?

161
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,640
No thanks.

162
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,520
Suit yourself.

163
00:13:51,594 --> 00:13:52,851
You're a grown adult,

164
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,888
and you still can't
eat fried chicken properly.

165
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,160
What are you spacing out for?

166
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,960
Slow down. Don't choke on it.

167
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,560
I... I'm going to use the restroom.

168
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,920
What on earth?

169
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,422
Watch where you're going!

170
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
I'm talking to you.

171
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,040
Playing dumb won't work.

172
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,000
You owe me a coffee.

173
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
It's just a coffee.

174
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:54,960
No need to be so rude.

175
00:14:55,266 --> 00:14:57,200
Who are you?
This has nothing to do with you.

176
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,280
I'm her boyfriend.

177
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,320
It's just a coffee.

178
00:15:01,051 --> 00:15:01,760
I'll buy you two.

179
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:05,520
Excuse me, two coffees
for this gentleman, please.

180
00:15:06,674 --> 00:15:07,440
They're on me.

181
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,311
Wait for me.

182
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,360
You and Han Yansheng
are really together?

183
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,474
If Yuan Sen hadn't told me,
I wouldn't even know.

184
00:15:36,542 --> 00:15:37,560
When did it happen?

185
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,680
Just recently.

186
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,360
Just recently?

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,960
See? What did I tell you?

188
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,000
You and Han Yansheng
are such a good match.

189
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Now you're finally together.

190
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,011
Hang on a second.

191
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,240
Here, let me read your fortune.

192
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,440
No, it's fine.

193
00:15:56,466 --> 00:15:57,888
Han Yansheng and I are doing great.

194
00:15:57,933 --> 00:15:59,200
Let me read your future.

195
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,097
It's not about the present.

196
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:04,120
Just let me do it.

197
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:05,800
Mi Fen.

198
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,360
Why don't you read mine?

199
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
I just want to see

200
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,680
if you're actually any good.

201
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,440
See? Since you don't want it,
I'll read hers.

202
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Here.

203
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,400
Give it back to me.

204
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,040
Draw one.

205
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,480
This one.

206
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,600
The Lovers card, upright.

207
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
That means your true love

208
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,320
is right beside you.

209
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,880
No way!

210
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:45,120
That's not accurate at all.

211
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,288
What are you talking about?

212
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:47,560
I'm spot on.

213
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
Aren't you and Monkey
pretending to be a couple?

214
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,560
Maybe he's the one...

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,200
No way...

216
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,160
Absolutely not.

217
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,520
I don't like him at all.

218
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,200
Ma'am, two egg pancakes, please.

219
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
One with two eggs and scallions.

220
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,169
One with pork, no scallions.

221
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,644
Got it.

222
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:16,550
I get to see you two being lovey-dovey
this early morning.

223
00:17:16,555 --> 00:17:17,866
Now I'm too full for breakfast.

224
00:17:18,533 --> 00:17:20,266
You're buying breakfast
for your boyfriend.

225
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,560
It's nothing to be shy about.

226
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,280
Thanks.

227
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,560
What do you want?

228
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,960
What are you having?

229
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,880
Ma'am, I'll have
an Orleans chicken burger.

230
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,533
No, make that two.

231
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,480
Two, huh?

232
00:17:41,933 --> 00:17:43,177
That should be good.

233
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,080
Okay.

234
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
Morning, Jian Dan.

235
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,560
You're looking for Sheng?

236
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
He's not here yet.

237
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,760
It's fine. I'll just leave this here.

238
00:17:55,782 --> 00:17:56,800
I brought him breakfast.

239
00:17:57,434 --> 00:18:00,080
You truly are a sweet
and thoughtful girlfriend.

240
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,555
Sure, I'll let him know when he's here.

241
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,840
Thanks, Entong.

242
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,280
Bye.

243
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,200
- Morning, President.
- Morning.

244
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,680
Remind them about the membership fee.

245
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,640
Han's always too shy to ask.

246
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
But I'm not. Right?

247
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,360
Well,

248
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:27,555
you'll deal with that.

249
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,960
Remember. It's 30.

250
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,044
Thirty yuan for the year.

251
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,080
Stay on top of it.

252
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,320
Got it.

253
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,120
It's just thirty yuan.

254
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,160
Why is it always so hard?

255
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
I got you breakfast.

256
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,800
What's this?

257
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:54,711
Are you addicted to roleplaying now?

258
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
I bought you breakfast
and you're not even happy?

259
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,520
You've never bought me breakfast.

260
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,920
And you never once

261
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
talked to me this nicely.

262
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,680
I get it now.

263
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,200
Tell me. Did you poison the food?

264
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,400
You evil woman.

265
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:11,640
Stupid Monkey!

266
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,640
Have you got a persecution complex?

267
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,640
See, that's more like it.

268
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm used to you being like this.

269
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,080
Why were you suddenly so nice?

270
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,040
That gave me a fright.

271
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,760
I thought I'd done something wrong.

272
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Suit yourself!

273
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,520
Have you all had breakfast yet?

274
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,600
No thanks.

275
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,680
You can have it.

276
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,240
I knew it. It's definitely poisoned.

277
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,480
Entong.

278
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,840
I want to talk to you.

279
00:21:00,897 --> 00:21:01,600
What's up?

280
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,920
I won't beat around the bush, then.

281
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,074
Why did you throw

282
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,360
my breakfast in the trash?

283
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,200
I didn't.

284
00:21:08,828 --> 00:21:09,920
I'm rushing to class.

285
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,960
I'm off now.

286
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,120
What about the video?

287
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:15,860
You knew Han Yansheng would lose control

288
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,000
after watching that video,

289
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,560
but you still gave it to me

290
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,755
and told me to calm him down?

291
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:21,133
You did that on purpose, right?

292
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,080
Jian Dan,

293
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,800
you really got me wrong.

294
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,440
I just wanted Sheng
to pull himself together.

295
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,680
I had no idea
how he'd react to the video...

296
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,720
Stop pretending.

297
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm telling Han Yansheng everything.

298
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,880
But where is your evidence?

299
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,200
Do you really think Sheng

300
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,840
would believe your baseless guesswork?

301
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,600
He'll find out soon enough.

302
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:44,400
Hello?

303
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:45,400
Han Yansheng...

304
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,320
Sorry, Jian Dan.

305
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,120
I'm in a meeting.

306
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,320
I'll call you later.

307
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,440
Either way, he'll find out eventually.

308
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,040
Entong, you're here early today.

309
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,400
I had nothing else to do,
so I came early.

310
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:18,160
Alright, I'll get back to work.

311
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,520
(Ocean University)

312
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
Someone's drowning!

313
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,360
Hurry!

314
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,400
Quick!

315
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:37,320
Careful!

316
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:41,880
Quick!

317
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,240
Here.

318
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
Slowly...

319
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,640
Entong! Entong!

320
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,040
Entong, wake up!

321
00:22:53,417 --> 00:22:55,560
Quick, call 120! Hurry!

322
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,000
Entong, don't scare me!

323
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,840
Entong!

324
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,280
Entong! Entong! Wake up!

325
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,640
The form's good.

326
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,066
Remember to send it to the council.

327
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,020
Got it, President.

328
00:23:11,888 --> 00:23:12,933
(Han Yansheng: Jian Dan.)

329
00:23:13,044 --> 00:23:14,177
(I'm done with the meeting.)

330
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,120
(I'm coming now.)

331
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,160
Hello?

332
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,440
What?

333
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,600
Entong drowned?

334
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:23,240
Okay.

335
00:23:24,044 --> 00:23:25,555
I'm going to the hospital now.

336
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:30,733
(Han Yansheng: Jian Dan.)

337
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,620
(Entong drowned.
I'm heading to the hospital.)

338
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:33,866
(Let's talk face-to-face later.)

339
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,940
(Emergency)

340
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,280
Entong, you're awake!

341
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,640
Want some water?

342
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,040
Where's Sheng?

343
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,080
He's on his way.

344
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,960
What's the matter?

345
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,680
Should I call the doctor?

346
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,680
No, no.

347
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,440
There's medicine in my bag.

348
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,160
Can you get it for me?

349
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,180
(Fluoxetine)

350
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,440
Entong, why are you taking
this antidepressant?

351
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:39,920
Do you suffer from depression?

352
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,680
What depression?

353
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,466
How long have you been taking it?

354
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,360
Over a year, I guess.

355
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,920
Did the patient go through
any major trauma before?

356
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,240
From now on, be cautious.

357
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,840
Try to avoid stressing her.

358
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,880
Spend more time with her too.

359
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,640
Help her get through it.

360
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,080
Okay, Sir.

361
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
Is there anything else we should know?

362
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,520
We'll need more observation

363
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,377
to fully understand
the patient's condition.

364
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:27,933
That way, we can make the right call.

365
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,160
I'll arrange

366
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,320
a psychological assessment soon.

367
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,880
Thank you, Sir.

368
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,160
Sorry for the trouble.

369
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,720
What I fear the most now

370
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
is caring people

371
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,120
like you.

372
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,960
Why didn't you ever tell me?

373
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,160
Actually, I'm the same as you.

374
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
I never really got over

375
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,480
what happened to Nan Yuan.

376
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,480
I still have nightmares often.

377
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,480
I dream about Nan Yuan.

378
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,080
He's underwater, looking at me.

379
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,160
He asks me for help.

380
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,680
He even questions me

381
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,840
about the reason why I didn't save him.

382
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,160
It was because at the time,

383
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
I could only save one of you.

384
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,320
And I saved you.

385
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,680
But I had to watch Nan Yuan

386
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,440
sink deeper and deeper

387
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,040
into the water

388
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,840
right in front of me.

389
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,640
I was the one who killed him.

390
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,400
It's my fault...

391
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,480
Are you alright, Sheng?

392
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,520
You okay?

393
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Are you okay?

394
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:23,880
Sit.

395
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:31,320
It's all my fault.

396
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,880
If it weren't for me

397
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,720
insisting on diving that day,

398
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,840
none of that would've happened.

399
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,520
Anyone here?

400
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,160
I've got some major gossip to share!

401
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,280
What's it?

402
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,680
Jian Dan, guess what?

403
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,680
Gu Entong is in the hospital.

404
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,720
What happened?

405
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,960
They said she drowned.

406
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,860
I heard from Yuan Sen
that she has depression.

407
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,800
She's been on the medicine
for over a year.

408
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,440
She has depression?

409
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,240
Han Yansheng is still at the hospital.

410
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,711
You better call him and ask about it.

411
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:28,400
Jian Dan.

412
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,720
Han Yansheng.

413
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:36,200
How's Entong doing?

414
00:28:36,525 --> 00:28:37,240
She's awake,

415
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,800
but she still needs further tests.

416
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,320
By the way,
what was that important thing

417
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,066
you wanted to tell me?

418
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,280
We'll talk about it after this.

419
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,760
When are you coming back?

420
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,560
I'm almost done here.

421
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,160
I'll meet you
once I get back to campus.

422
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:16,333
Are you feeling unwell?

423
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm okay.

424
00:29:20,331 --> 00:29:23,440
If you've got something to do, go ahead.

425
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
I'll be fine.

426
00:29:25,582 --> 00:29:26,520
I'll get the doctor.

427
00:29:32,102 --> 00:29:34,600
I just want someone to talk to.

428
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,880
Especially someone

429
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,880
who went through all that with me.

430
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,960
Someone who understands how I feel.

431
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,280
Entong's assessment report is ready.

432
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,680
There's still stuff to do at the café.

433
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,600
I'll head back first.

434
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,720
- Stay here with Entong.
- Got it.

435
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,360
Get some rest, Entong.

436
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
Sure.

437
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,111
(Jian Dan, I'll be at the hospital
a bit longer.)

438
00:30:27,177 --> 00:30:28,222
(Don't wait for me.)

439
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,560
Jian Dan.

440
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,960
How's Gu Entong doing?

441
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,080
She's awake now.

442
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,400
Han Yansheng's with her at the hospital.

443
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,760
Seriously?

444
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,182
Gu Entong's depression

445
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,680
really flared up at the perfect time.

446
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,749
Why this sudden relapse

447
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,270
right after you and Sheng got together?

448
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,720
Zhishan.

449
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,040
Why haven't I heard

450
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,360
any juicy updates
on you and Xiahou Ling lately?

451
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,240
Don't even bring him up.

452
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,390
You went with Entong
to her evaluation yesterday.

453
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,360
What did the doctor say?

454
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,080
The results come out today.

455
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,160
The report is out?

456
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,240
What's the result?

457
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,360
It's mild depression.

458
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,880
The doctor suggested
I stay for observation.

459
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,600
But I think I'm fine now.

460
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,760
I want to be discharged.

461
00:31:32,244 --> 00:31:33,040
Let me take a look.

462
00:31:34,417 --> 00:31:36,880
I know my body best.

463
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,280
Can you all stop treating me
like a patient?

464
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
Calm down, Entong.

465
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,520
We're not treating you like one.

466
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,800
If you want to leave, just do it.

467
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,240
I'll handle the paperwork.

468
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,240
I'll come with you.

469
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,480
Han.

470
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:59,960
I'm still worried
about Entong's condition.

471
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,120
Can you ask your dad

472
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,755
to get a foreign specialist?

473
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,040
Sure, I'll take care of that.

474
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,540
(Diagnosis normal.
Discharge recommended.)

475
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,880
Good news, Shi.

476
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,040
My dad found

477
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,800
one of the top global experts
on depression,

478
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,960
Professor Wilson.

479
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,440
He's in the country now.

480
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,720
He's giving a lecture
at Qingnian University soon.

481
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:45,720
That's awesome!

482
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,844
I'll buy the ticket now.

483
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,110
(Apartment 17)

484
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,840
(Shi: Han, I've arrived in the Jing City.)

485
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:08,280
(Don't worry, everything's good.)

486
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,920
(I'm just a little worried
about Entong.)

487
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,920
(Han Yansheng: Don't worry. I'm here.)

488
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,960
Hello? Entong?

489
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,200
Hello?

490
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:38,360
Entong?

491
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,800
I just heard you shouting on the phone.

492
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
It sounded off.

493
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,320
I couldn't reach you,

494
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:45,720
so I came to check on you.

495
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,120
Did... Did I call you?

496
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,640
Maybe I accidentally pressed something.

497
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,840
The battery died.
It shut off on its own.

498
00:33:59,868 --> 00:34:00,880
As long as you're okay.

499
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,640
What's wrong?

500
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,320
I just suddenly felt

501
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,920
a little anxious.

502
00:34:21,577 --> 00:34:22,640
Let me help you with that.

503
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,840
Where are you? At the library?

504
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,880
Well... Something came up.

505
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,280
I can't make it today.

506
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,680
I'll go with you another day, okay?

507
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,320
Alright, then.

508
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:55,840
Sheng.

509
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Want some coffee? I can go get it.

510
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,520
No need.

511
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:03,960
Hello?

512
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,240
Jian Dan, are you done?

513
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,120
Yeah.

514
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Yue Tangtang, what's wrong?

515
00:35:32,851 --> 00:35:34,451
My tummy hurts. I feel like throwing up.

516
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,600
Should we go to the hospital?

517
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,560
No need.

518
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,160
I probably just had
too many cold drinks last night.

519
00:35:46,057 --> 00:35:47,640
I'll take you to the hospital.

520
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,440
It's okay.

521
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:52,480
Take care of yourself, then.

522
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,155
I need to stop by
the Rock Climbing Club.

523
00:35:54,244 --> 00:35:55,800
Call me if you need anything.

524
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:56,800
Got it.

525
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,960
Stop nagging already.

526
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
There's no training today.

527
00:36:10,457 --> 00:36:11,720
Why are you here at the club?

528
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,450
You're here too, aren't you?

529
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,760
I've got nothing to do.

530
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,088
We might as well train together.

531
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,720
Unlike you, I'm single.

532
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,977
You've got a boyfriend,
and you're still here training?

533
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,440
Look at Mi Fen and Yuan Sen.

534
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:23,866
They're glued together every day.

535
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,120
Well, I suspect
your relationship's totally fake.

536
00:36:27,377 --> 00:36:29,580
I'm starting to wonder
if I've got a fake boyfriend too.

537
00:36:31,044 --> 00:36:33,240
Han Yansheng
is keeping Gu Entong's company again?

538
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,240
Let's have a match?

539
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,480
Bring it on. I'm not scared.

540
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,760
Miss.

541
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,760
Yue Tangtang?

542
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
Are you feeling unwell?

543
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,640
Good timing.

544
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
This is

545
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,640
the event proposal for a joint activity

546
00:37:25,937 --> 00:37:28,200
between our Tennis Club
and the Swimming Club.

547
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,000
Could you please

548
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,640
pass it along to Han Yansheng?

549
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
You joined the Tennis Club?

550
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:43,120
Yue Tangtang.

551
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,360
Let me help you to have a rest.

552
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:48,160
Hang in there.

553
00:37:51,211 --> 00:37:51,960
It's still early.

554
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,444
Do you want to go catch a movie?

555
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,600
I'm heading back to the dorm to rest.

556
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,070
♪Suddenly the street view feels familiar♪

557
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,280
♪Memories come too abruptly♪

558
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,130
♪It feels nothing,
