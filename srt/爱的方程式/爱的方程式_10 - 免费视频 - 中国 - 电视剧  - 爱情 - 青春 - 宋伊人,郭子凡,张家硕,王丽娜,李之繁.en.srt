00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,080
The Dean asked me to tell you

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,480
that two student tour groups
are arriving soon.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,960
One is a high school group,

20
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,666
and the other is an elementary school.

21
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,550
Your club will be responsible
for hosting them.

22
00:01:57,555 --> 00:01:58,560
Get ready.

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
Got it.

24
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,120
Elementary school kids?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
Oh god.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
I can't deal with little monsters.

27
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,720
Han, I'm begging you.

28
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,200
Don't make me handle them.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,040
Please!

30
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
I can handle the elementary group.

31
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:16,066
But you're already
in charge of the parents.

32
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,000
Oh, I totally forgot.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,360
What now?

34
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,920
Jian Dan.

35
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,720
The elementary school group
is almost here.

36
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,560
Could you handle them for us?

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,320
Sure.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
You're the best. Thank you.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:06,880
Hello.

41
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,440
Hello.

42
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm Jian Dan, a first-year psych major.

43
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,422
I'll be your guide today.

44
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,960
Hi, I'm Ms. Yuan.

45
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,080
There are only two of us teachers today.

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,280
So we might need

47
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,560
a little extra help.

48
00:03:17,828 --> 00:03:18,920
Sure, no problem.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,840
Thank you so much.

50
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:22,044
All right, kids.
Time to get off the bus.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Stick together, everyone.

52
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,120
- Careful now.
- Let's line up.

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,160
Get off the bus.

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
Watch your steps.

55
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
(These kids seem)

56
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,240
(really cute and well-behaved.)

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,840
(They are nothing like the chaos
they warned me about.)

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
(Monkey was clearly exaggerating.)

59
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,320
Hey! Stop!

60
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,311
You can't climb up there!

61
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,640
Get back inside!

62
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,280
You'll fall!

63
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,720
Get back inside!

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,880
Stop!

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,320
Stop fighting!

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,480
Kids!

67
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:06,240
Are you okay?

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,680
Stop fighting, okay?

69
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,800
Here, want something tasty?

70
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,088
Here you go.

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,560
Hey! You can't pee here!

72
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Ms. Yuan,
he needs to go to the bathroom!

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,960
Coming!

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,200
No, stop!

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,333
That's dirty!

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,302
No climbing, okay?

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,200
Watch it!

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
All right, kids. Back in line.

79
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,640
Ms. Yuan,

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,040
can you do a headcount?

81
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,480
Sure.

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,600
See if everyone is here.

83
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,800
Twenty kids.

84
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,920
Ms. Yuan, Pan Yujiang is missing!

85
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
What?

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,480
Did anyone see where she went?

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,280
No.

88
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,920
Jian Dan, let's go look for her.

89
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,680
I'll check around.

90
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,244
- You stay and watch the rest.
- Okay.

91
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,040
Be careful!

92
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
Kids, stand still.

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Pan Yujiang!

94
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Pan Yujiang!

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,480
Pan Yujiang!

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Pan Yujiang!

97
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
Pan Yujiang!

98
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,760
Pan Yujiang!

99
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Pan Yujiang!

100
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
Jian Dan, were you looking for me?

101
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,640
Sweetheart!

102
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,760
What are you doing here alone?

103
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Let's go back.

104
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,520
Don't step on the ants.

105
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,600
What...

106
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,160
What are you doing out here?

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,640
I'm taking pictures.

108
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,640
Of the ants? Why?

109
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,840
Don't you think they're cute?

110
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,280
They're so small.

111
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,480
But they can carry crumbs
ten times their size.

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,040
But they're also pitiful.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,137
One wrong step
and someone might crush them.

114
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,200
Yeah, that is sad.

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,280
We heard you've been swamped,

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,560
so we came to help.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Perfect timing.

118
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,000
Here,

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,600
help me hand out these fliers.

120
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,560
Entong,

121
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,120
can you take the parents on a tour?

122
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,240
Can you come with me?

123
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't handle

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
all the parents alone.

125
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,440
Shi,

126
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,720
go with Entong.

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,080
Okay.

128
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Monkey.

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,640
Yuan Sen.

130
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
You two take over here.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,680
I'll go and check on Jian Dan.

132
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,920
Okay.

133
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:43,960
Jian Dan!

134
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,155
Come here, sweetie.

135
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,360
Sit and wait here for me, okay?

136
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,600
Don't go anywhere.

137
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,044
Weren't you
with the elementary school kids?

138
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,040
One of the girls wandered off.

139
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,240
I just found her.

140
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,777
Let's head back.

141
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,560
Okay.

142
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Help!

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,160
Help! Help!

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,320
Pan Yujiang, are you okay?

145
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,720
Ms. Yuan, I'm okay.

146
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,360
But not this thing.

147
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm glad you're fine.

148
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,720
You scared me!

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,040
No more running off, okay?

150
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,080
(What happened)

151
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,720
(to him just now?)

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,520
(Why did he suddenly stop mid-run?)

153
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:25,800
(Last time at the pool,)

154
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,560
(he almost drowned too.)

155
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,360
Jian Dan,

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,240
thank you so much.

157
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
How is

158
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,520
your ankle?

159
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,000
It's fine.

160
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,777
I'll take her back now.

161
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,320
Let's go.

162
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,840
What happened to your foot?

163
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,520
I twisted it when getting in the water.

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,977
Let me take you to the nurse's office.

165
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,111
It's okay, really.

166
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Look, I can walk fine.

167
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,977
I was the one
who asked you to come help.

168
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,120
Whatever happens,

169
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,533
I'll take full responsibility.

170
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:30,177
Does it hurt here?

171
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,222
What about here?

172
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:33,560
Does it hurt?

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,280
- Doctor...
- Got it.

174
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,560
How is it?

175
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:40,822
She shouldn't put weight on it
for at least a week.

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
A whole week?

177
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,240
If you don't rest

178
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,040
and keep walking on it,

179
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,755
it could take more than two weeks.

180
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,440
Let me treat it first.

181
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Hang in there.

182
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:51,640
It's okay now.

183
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,840
He said
he would take full responsibility.

184
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,955
But he's nowhere to be seen.

185
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,600
Hop on.

00:11:50,531 --> 00:11:51,400
Look at this.

208
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,360
Jian Dan.

209
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,080
Yiyi?

210
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,333
What brings you here?

211
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,000
Someone asked me to pass this to you.

212
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,720
Don't drop it.

213
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,480
Who?

214
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,960
He told me not to tell you.

215
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
So,

216
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,920
is all that gossip online actually true?

217
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,160
Not bad.

218
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,320
Hiding true strength.

219
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,680
If there's nothing else,
I'm heading off.

220
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,160
Bye-bye.

221
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,600
Bye-bye.

222
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,066
Thanks for bringing this over.

223
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,280
No problem!

224
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,000
Do you like the food?

225
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,888
You sent this?

226
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:42,533
It is strictly prepared
based on nutritional science,

227
00:12:42,555 --> 00:12:43,555
tailored just for you.

228
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,560
But it's way too bland.

229
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,000
That's because you like heavy flavors.

230
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,160
If you follow my meal plan,

231
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,755
you will recover more quickly.

232
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,040
But...

233
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,440
Or are you trying to delay recovery

234
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,160
to stay close to me?

235
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,720
Why?

236
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,622
Did you fall or something?

237
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:04,880
Oh, no.

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,933
I dropped the lid.

239
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,520
Turn your camera on. Let me see.

240
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,822
There's no need for that.

241
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,600
Do you want me to come check in person?

242
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,800
Fine, stay where you are.

243
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,177
I'm switching to video.

244
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,120
See? I'm totally fine.

245
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,480
What are you wearing?

246
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,288
It looks childish.

247
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,971
How is this childish?

248
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,355
I fought hard to grab this
during the 11.11 sales!

249
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,680
It actually suits you.

250
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,880
Silly

251
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,920
and childish.

252
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,480
You're the silly one.

253
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,800
If you're only calling me to tease me,

254
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:46,555
I'm hanging up.

255
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,285
Why is your dorm such a mess?

256
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,800
Yue Tangtang is in the shower.

257
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,120
Those are her clothes.

258
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,360
She is actually super tidy.

259
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,520
Jian Dan, who are you talking to?

260
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,177
Why are you throwing me under the bus?

261
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,200
See for yourself.

262
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,600
Jian Dan, you did that on purpose!

263
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,200
Yue Tangtang!

264
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,942
Stop bullying Jian Dan!

265
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,560
Excuse me? She's bullying me!

266
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
I don't believe you!

267
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,080
Jian Dan, what happened to your foot?

268
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:38,302
It's nothing.

269
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,720
Just a sprain.

270
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,844
I'll be fine in a week.

271
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,742
You scared me.

272
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
You were out helping

273
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,520
Han Yansheng this morning, right?

274
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,680
This counts as a work injury.

275
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,200
He has to take full responsibility!

276
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:51,955
I'll come to pick you up
tomorrow morning.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,720
Who's talking?

278
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,360
Jian Dan!

279
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,308
Han Yansheng is here.

280
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,840
Where are you going?

281
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:13,800
He's already here to pick you up.

282
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,000
You don't have to pick me up.

283
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,280
Hop on.

284
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:36,511
Enjoy the ride.

285
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,355
(Join the Swim Club. We're Recruiting)

286
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,440
Jian Dan,

287
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,080
how is your foot?

288
00:15:50,244 --> 00:15:51,800
I made you pork trotters for lunch.

289
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,850
It's perfect for recovery.

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,040
Oh, yummy!

291
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,666
Hey, be careful.

292
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,400
I have already prepared
your custom meal.

293
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,880
A Han-special nutrition lunch?

294
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,920
Meet me at the back door

295
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,355
of the Rock Climbing Club at noon.

296
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:10,960
Monkey,

297
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,400
our pool water

298
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,733
hasn't been changed in ages.

299
00:16:13,888 --> 00:16:14,720
Maybe you could...

300
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,666
I have things to do.

301
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,080
I have to go now! Bye!

302
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,520
He's gone.

303
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,911
The club president's here!

304
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:29,888
President, you're here!

305
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:38,840
President,

306
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,760
why are you here
with your foot still hurt?

307
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:42,840
Yeah, you should be resting.

308
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,200
You're all still new to climbing.

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,755
I'm just making sure everyone's safe.

310
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,520
While she's away for recovery,

311
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,885
I'll take over

312
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,880
the club's training.

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,360
Han Yansheng is going to train us?

314
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,360
Seriously?

315
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,240
Welcome! Welcome!

316
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,097
Welcome!

317
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,200
Welcome to the club!

318
00:16:56,834 --> 00:16:57,897
Oh, I get it.

319
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,080
You guys were looking forward
to a new president, huh?

320
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,280
- Oh, no.
- Why would we think that?

321
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:03,888
Let's go.

322
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:29,840
First drill!

323
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
High knees in place!

324
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,480
One minute!

325
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,920
Ready!

326
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,560
Knees higher!

327
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,520
Faster!

328
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:45,760
Let's go!

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,680
Faster!

330
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
Keep it moving!

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,520
Faster!

332
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,880
Ugh, I'm dying.

333
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,600
Next drill!

334
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,920
Push-ups!

335
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,480
Ready!

336
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:20,377
You, in that lane! You're slowing down!

337
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:21,400
Watch your treading!

338
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,320
Your timing! Timing!

339
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:25,960
Monkey,

340
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,160
have you seen Sheng?

341
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,468
He is helping Jian Dan
with the team training.

342
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,600
Move! Move! Move it!

343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,280
Keep kicking!

344
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,160
No stopping!

345
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,165
Such terrible stamina.

346
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,754
If it were my swimming team,

347
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,400
they would still be doing laps.

348
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,440
They're beginners,

349
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,000
so it's better to hold it back.

350
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,880
Maybe we should continue another day?

351
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,120
Dismissed!

352
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,844
What kind of training was that?

353
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,711
It's pure torture.

354
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm exhausted.

355
00:19:03,177 --> 00:19:04,244
Where are you going?

356
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:06,885
Nowhere.

357
00:19:07,777 --> 00:19:08,822
I'll come with you.

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,840
It's not convenient.

359
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,640
You're just going to the bathroom.

360
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,840
What's the big deal?

361
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:16,760
Let's go.

362
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,720
Hey, why is Han Yansheng standing
outside the girls' restroom?

363
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,760
Who is he waiting for?

364
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:39,760
I have no idea.

365
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,600
Let's go.

366
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,844
What took you so long?

367
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,851
Why are you still here?

368
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,244
I said I'd take full responsibility.

369
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:03,933
Did you think I was just being polite?

370
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,244
Don't just stand there.

371
00:20:06,617 --> 00:20:07,137
Let's go.

372
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,000
Entong?

373
00:20:17,355 --> 00:20:19,177
- What are you doing here?
- You're back.

374
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,080
My laptop died.

375
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,666
So I'm using your power supply.

376
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,111
Go ahead.

377
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,302
I'll leave in a bit.

378
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,333
Oh no, this is bad.

379
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:52,222
What happened?

380
00:20:55,111 --> 00:20:56,311
The screen just went black.

381
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,600
What now?

382
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,320
Looks like

383
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
you have to get it fixed.

384
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,600
Do you know anyone who can repair it?

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,280
There's a guy I know

386
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,320
at the digital mall.
He can probably help.

387
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,800
But...

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,480
If you've got stuff to do,

389
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,022
you can go ahead.

390
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:18,285
I'll figure it out.

391
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,022
I'm halfway through this paper.

392
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:22,622
If I can't submit it tomorrow morning,

393
00:21:22,644 --> 00:21:23,850
I'll lose the credits.

394
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
Shi is working
another part-time job today.

395
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:29,355
Otherwise,
I could've asked him for help.

396
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,891
We're covering
two major psychological theories,

397
00:21:36,114 --> 00:21:39,748
represented by Freud and Skinner.

398
00:21:40,468 --> 00:21:41,742
So, the two theories

399
00:21:42,091 --> 00:21:46,040
are psychoanalytic theory
and behaviorism.

400
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:49,354
One reason they get so much attention is

401
00:21:49,457 --> 00:21:52,468
that they can be used in many areas.

402
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:53,765
We are...

403
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,200
(Han Yansheng:
Something came up.)

404
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,160
(I can't pick you up.)

405
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,200
(Can you manage on your own?)

406
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,840
I didn't expect fixing a laptop
would take this long.

407
00:22:13,422 --> 00:22:15,111
Good thing I have you to wait with me.

408
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,040
As long as the motherboard is undamaged,
it's fine.

409
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,066
We can pick it up soon.

410
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,444
What do you want to eat?

411
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,180
(Influencer Pick)

412
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,760
That one.

413
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:30,720
Okay.

414
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,920
Find a seat.

415
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:32,960
I'll go pay.

416
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:33,920
Okay.

417
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,200
I want these two.

418
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:33,525
Hi, Grandma.

419
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,560
Jian Dan, how are you?

420
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,880
I have good news.

421
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,965
My thesis has passed the review.

422
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,200
It's getting published soon!

423
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,765
That's great!

424
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,800
You're amazing.

425
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,040
I'm so proud of you.

426
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:49,040
I'm super happy too!

427
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,280
What was that sound?

428
00:23:50,657 --> 00:23:51,880
Oh, it's just my crutches...

429
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:54,440
You're hurt?

430
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,080
Let me see where it hurts.

431
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,114
It's fine, really.

432
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,851
I just twisted my ankle.

433
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,525
The bandage comes off tomorrow.

434
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,800
Let me show you.

435
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,480
My foot moves just fine now.

436
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,308
You're always like this.

437
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,737
You never tell me
when bad things happen.

438
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,800
Why are you so careless?

439
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,160
I plan to visit you

440
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,040
with the supervisor next weekend.

441
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,440
I guess I should just go tomorrow.

442
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,160
No, Grandma.

443
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,400
It's really not serious.

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,840
But why the sudden trip into the city?

445
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,760
Something wrong?

446
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,320
Nothing is wrong.

447
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
I want to see you

448
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,200
because I miss you.

449
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,885
Since you want to visit me,

450
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,091
you can come next weekend

451
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,502
with the supervisor.

452
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,674
That way I won't worry.

453
00:24:51,834 --> 00:24:52,680
All right, then.

454
00:24:53,668 --> 00:24:55,640
Just take good care of yourself, okay?

455
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,000
Be good, okay?

456
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,280
I'll let you get back to it.

457
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,800
Don't worry about me, Grandma.

458
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,555
(Han Yansheng:
I'll pick you up at 8 AM tomorrow.)

459
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
Let me carry your bag.

460
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,680
After this,

461
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:53,777
you don't need to pick me up anymore.

462
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,680
Why?

463
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,000
You seem really busy.

464
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,960
I don't want to trouble you.

465
00:26:01,466 --> 00:26:03,333
You think you haven't caused me
enough trouble?

466
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,133
Come on,

467
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,160
or we'll be late.

468
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,240
My foot is fine now.

469
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:09,888
I don't even need the crutches anymore.

470
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,160
You don't have to pick me up anymore.

471
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,266
How is it feeling? Not hurting anymore?

472
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Let me see.

473
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,600
It's recovering nicely.

474
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,950
You can walk without the crutches now.

475
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,088
But you need to take it easy

476
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,288
and avoid intense activities.

477
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,960
Thank you, Miss.

478
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,920
Han Yansheng is unbelievable.

479
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,600
He said
he would take full responsibility,

480
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,160
but he bailed at the last minute.

481
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,080
He has his own things going on.

482
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,200
I don't want to bother him.

483
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Jeez!

484
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,440
The midterms!

485
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:58,400
I drew

486
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,680
my lucky koi card this morning.

487
00:26:59,742 --> 00:27:00,600
Guess what?

488
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,844
It's a total disaster omen.

489
00:27:01,888 --> 00:27:03,050
I'm failing this semester.

490
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,880
Jian Dan,

491
00:27:04,034 --> 00:27:05,360
please help me.

492
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,840
Save me, please.

493
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,600
Help me.

494
00:27:12,266 --> 00:27:13,866
Okay, I'll go to the library with you.

495
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:14,560
Really?

496
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,640
That's great!

497
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,320
You're the best!

498
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,577
I want to kiss you. Come here!

499
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,360
Oh, I'm sorry!

500
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,000
Let me help you put your shoes on.

501
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,488
Get your bag.

502
00:27:30,111 --> 00:27:31,320
One, two, three! Let's go!

503
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,760
You're so heavy!

504
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,360
Hello?

505
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,000
Hello.

506
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
The book you reserved,

507
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,600
"Hypatia," has been returned.

508
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Please come to the library to borrow it.

509
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,520
I'll be right there.

510
00:27:44,154 --> 00:27:44,737
Excuse me.

511
00:27:44,755 --> 00:27:45,280
Yes?

512
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,990
I'm here to pick up
Hypatia's autobiography.

513
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,240

Why does this number look so familiar?

531
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:01,760
Jian Dan, here's your coffee...

532
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm so sorry.

533
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,520
It's okay.

534
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,800
Just grab some napkins.

535
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,320
I didn't mean to spill it.

536
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,222
Don't worry about it.

537
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,085
Did someone ask to meet you?

538
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,520
Who is it?

539
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,108
My pen pal.

540
00:29:21,782 --> 00:29:23,240
The one who stood you up last time?

541
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,788
You should call him.

542
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,222
That won't be possible.

543
00:29:31,297 --> 00:29:32,531
I can tell.

544
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,880
I'm so sorry.

545
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,680
Just leave him your number.

546
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
Let him call you instead.

547
00:29:47,302 --> 00:29:50,900
(This is my number.)

548
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,280
I hate exams!

549
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:00,800
You should have studied

550
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,466
instead of gaming all day.

551
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:06,760
Han,

552
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,920
is it too late
for a last-minute miracle?

553
00:30:09,377 --> 00:30:11,040
The only miracle you'll get is a kick.

554
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:13,880
How about this?

555
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
I'll book a study room
at the library tomorrow.

556
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,800
After class,

557
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,920
we'll prepare for midterms together.

558
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,651
Han, you're way more reliable
than any miracles.

559
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,288
Say that again, and I will kick you.

560
00:30:28,288 --> 00:30:29,200
Look at you.

561
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,200
I'll ask Entong

562
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,288
to join us tomorrow too.

563
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,066
Sounds good.

564
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,800
Yes.

565
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,440
I've already marked
all the key points in red.

566
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,040
As long as you master those,

567
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,400
you'll definitely pass.

568
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,640
Jian Dan,

569
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,920
are we even taking the same course?

570
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,240
Why do these questions

571
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,880
look unfamiliar to me?

572
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,468
Don't panic.

573
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,885
I have a secret memory trick.

574
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,920
You'll score for sure.

575
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,080
Jian Dan?

576
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,840
Hey, guys.

577
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,588
You're here too?

578
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:33,920
Monkey?

579
00:31:34,337 --> 00:31:36,040
- You actually study?
- You actually study?

580
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,840
What do you mean by that?

581
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,440
It's exam season!

582
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,834
Han dragged me here.

583
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,680
The rest are here too.

584
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,280
Why don't we study together?

585
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,955
The more, the merrier.

586
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,760
He's right, Jian Dan.

587
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,622
The more, the merrier.

588
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,560
Let's study together.

589
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,280
Let's go.

590
00:31:52,422 --> 00:31:53,320
Come on.

591
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,291
Please go with me.

592
00:32:07,348 --> 00:32:08,360
I'm here.

593
00:32:10,644 --> 00:32:12,200
What took you so long, Monkey?

594
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,800
I may be late,

595
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,417
but look who is here to join?

596
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,120
Jian Dan and Mi Fen?

597
00:32:19,555 --> 00:32:20,511
Take a seat.

598
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,000
Hello.

599
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,160
You guys are here too.

600
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,240
