Han Yansheng!

15
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,560
I've read

16
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:33,422
your psychological assessment report.

17
00:02:36,444 --> 00:02:38,333
Are you worried about
being a burden to me?

18
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:42,480
So you know everything?

19
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,880
But there are still many treatments
we haven't tried yet.

20
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,480
How can you be sure it's hopeless?

21
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
Even if it is,

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,520
I won't give up.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,511
I can swim.

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,240
I'll protect you from now on.

25
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,266
I listened to the voice recording

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
you sent me.

27
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,000
The past...

28
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
The past is in the past.

29
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,360
From now on,

30
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,222
don't hide things from me anymore.

31
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:25,400
Okay.

32
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,023
This is your birthday gift.

33
00:03:29,211 --> 00:03:30,943
I borrowed Zishan's kitchen

34
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:31,920
to make this...

35
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,400
I messed it up.

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,040
It's fine.

37
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,466
I like it.

38
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,400
But...

39
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:55,044
I have a second gift for you.

Come on.

51
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,133
Let's raise our glasses

52
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,760
for Han to complete the competition.

53
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,520
No doubt about it.

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,330
He's definitely taking first place
this time.

55
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,720
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,840
Jian Dan,

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,280
it's a good thing you and Han

58
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,040
made up.

59
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,066
Otherwise, we'd have to
survive this summer

60
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:30,600
without air-conditioning in the dorm.

61
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,720
Han himself is a human freezer

62
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
that can freeze us to death.

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
Speaking of which, who was it

64
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,488
that deliberately left
the edited recorder

65
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,480
on Sheng's desk

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,160
and made them fight?

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,400
What a shame.

68
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,520
I asked around the club.

69
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,080
No one noticed who put it there.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,520
Is there no other clue?

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
All right.

72
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:56,320
Enough about that.

73
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,866
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

74
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:58,400
Let's eat.

75
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,840
Cheers, Entong.

76
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,911
Cheers.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,560
Can I have your phone?

78
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,755
Sure. Here you go.

79
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,960
There's something on it.

80
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,080
What is it?

81
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,320
Paint.

82
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,750
All right. Thank you all

83
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:42,280
for helping me and Han Yansheng
clear up the misunderstanding.

84
00:06:42,844 --> 00:06:44,160
This meal is on me.

85
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,120
I'll pay.

86
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,360
Stop that, please.

87
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,200
Shi, I'm going to the restroom.
You eat first.

88
00:06:57,244 --> 00:06:57,880
Okay.

89
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,200
Xizang.

90
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,444
Me too.

91
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:05,444
What did you say?

92
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,440
Gu Entong.

93
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,320
You took the recorder, didn't you?

94
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,600
What are you talking about?

95
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,640
You suspect me?

96
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes, I did do a lot of things

97
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,520
to get between you and Sheng,

98
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,320
but I've given up on him.

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,160
I have no reason to do this.

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,960
It's not a suspicion.

101
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,880
It's confirmation.

102
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,800
You did a good job

103
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,080
pretending.

104
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,600
Until I noticed

105
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,040
the paint on your phone.

106
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,360
I'm heading off, Jian Dan.

107
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:06,760
Bye.

108
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,520
Bye, Entong.

109
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,080
What does this prove?

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,920
The paint is exactly the same

111
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,533
as the one on the climbing wall.

112
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,960
Even if you don't admit it,

113
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,520
your face already gave me the answer.

114
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
Still, I want to tell you.

115
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,640
Stop doing these silly things.

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
No matter what you do,

117
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,177
Han Yansheng and I will never
leave each other again.

118
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,360
Yes, I did that.

119
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,040
So what?

120
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,265
I was the one who knew Sheng first.

121
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,440
I was the one who grew up with him.

122
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,120
If it weren't for you...

123
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,320
Even without Jian Dan,

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,800
I still wouldn't have liked you.

125
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,320
I've only seen you as a friend.

126
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,480
Nothing more.

127
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,680
Sheng...

128
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,720
Shi...

129
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,280
You're leaving me, too?

130
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,880
Do you also think

131
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,244
I'll never compare to Jian Dan?

132
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,288
You've done so many silly things
over and over again.

133
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,840
You're not the same person
I used to know.

134
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,880
I was scared someone
would take Sheng away from me.

135
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
Is that so wrong?

136
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,155
You went about it the wrong way.

137
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,866
It's fine if you don't like me,

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,600
but you shouldn't have used me

139
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,360
and pretended to get close to me,

140
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,560
making everyone think
you were over Han.

141
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,520
I was wrong.

142
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
I really was.

143
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,960
You're the only one I have now.

144
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,777
Please don't go.

145
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,720
After doing all of this,

146
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,200
what did you get in the end?

147
00:12:17,315 --> 00:12:19,280
I went to the coffee shop
and didn't see Shi.

148
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,480
Where is he?

149
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,200
(Shi: Guys, I'm leaving for
the volunteer teacher program.)

150
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,800
(I'm already on my way.)

151
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,330
(Don't blame me for leaving
without telling you.)

152
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:37,080
(I really didn't want to go through
a farewell scene.)

153
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,777
(Until we meet again.)

154
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,844
(Ocean University)

155
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,823
(Shi: Guys, I'm leaving for
the volunteer teacher program.)

156
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:33,992
(I really didn't want to go through
the farewell scene.)

157
00:13:33,992 --> 00:13:34,860
(Until we meet again.)

158
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:41,240
(That was all done by Shi alone.)

159
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,666
(We don't want to steal his credit.)

160
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
Where do you want to go?

161
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,080
Where? What about you?
I'll go wherever you go.

162
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,960
Will it be too humid and stuffy
this season?

163
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,280
You just said you'd go wherever I go.

164
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:33,822
Let's check the flights first.

165
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm transferring abroad soon.

166
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
Perhaps

167
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,120
we'll never meet again.

168
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,080
Sheng,

169
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,400
before I go,

170
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,240
there's something

171
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,840
I must tell you.

172
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,200
Nan Yuan's death

173
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,680
wasn't entirely your fault.

174
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,600
What do you mean?

175
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,370
Excuse me, Sir.

176
00:16:19,485 --> 00:16:20,760
I rented three tanks.

177
00:16:20,975 --> 00:16:22,080
They're all ready.

178
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,880
Give me a moment.

179
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,320
I'll show you once I'm done here.

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,080
Okay.

181
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,440
Sir, maybe you can carry on with it.

182
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,644
I'll take them myself.

183
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:42,360
Hello?

184
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,360
How's it going, Entong?

185
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm at the tank rental place now.

186
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Come quickly.

(To Be Repaired)

190
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:08,533
I didn't know that of the three tanks
I rented that day,

191
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:09,400
two were defective.

192
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,000
One was with you,

193
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,200
and the other

194
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
was with Nan Yuan.

195
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,840
So Nan Yuan...

196
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,320
I bear a lot of responsibility
for that.

197
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
I kept this secret all along.

198
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,400
I even selfishly

199
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,240
dragged you into sharing the blame.

200
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,480
I'm sorry, Sheng.

201
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:37,800
So,

202
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:40,800
on Nan Yuan's death anniversary,

203
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,360
the one who left yellow roses was you.

204
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes.

205
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,560
I've held it in for far too long.

206
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,080
I finally said it today.

207
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,480
I can finally free myself
from this pain,

208
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,880
and set you free, too.

209
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,320
I've made so many mistakes in the past.

210
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,200
At least, I didn't make one more.

211
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,440
It's been so long.

212
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,280
There's no point

213
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,120
in pointing the finger now.

214
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,120
We should look ahead.

215
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,280
Nan Yuan wouldn't want to see you

216
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
so down either.

217
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
You're right.

218
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,120
I should pick myself up.

219
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,960

you were kind, optimistic,

He can't come out now.

292

- Please let us in.
- Just let us through for now.

in my life.

304
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,200

305
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,640
meeting you

306
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,840

watched fireworks together,

310
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:11,000
and joined the volunteer evaluation.

311
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,920
You were there for me

312
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,080
during the darkest time of my life.

313

shining into my heart

317

I became braver.

00:28:32,135 --> 00:28:33,000
Three, two, one.

374
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,760
Take one of me.

375
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,280
Please. I'm the one graduating.

376
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,560
I want memories of my college life.

377
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,290
But why am I taking your pictures
instead?

378
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,660
The most memorable part
of your college life

379
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,520
is me.

380
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,260
Of course, you need to
take pictures of me.

381
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:47,040
Hurry.

382
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,440
All right.

383
00:28:56,605 --> 00:28:57,600
Done.

384
00:28:57,672 --> 00:28:59,000
Next photo spot. Let's go.

385
00:28:59,385 --> 00:28:59,880
Slow down.

386
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,760
Keep going.

387
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,960
Why's with the secrecy?

388
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,000
Just wait. Watch your step.

389
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,480
Good. Sit down.

390
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,800
Don't open your eyes yet.

391
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,160
Three, two, one.

392
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,600
Happy graduation, my Prince Luo Shui.

393
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,960
Perfect score for creativity.

394
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,280
And your art skills...

395
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:32,760
Full marks.

396
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:34,800
You scared me.

397
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,000
I've got you a gift, too.

398
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm not the one graduating.

399
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,320
Why would you get me a gift?

400
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,240
Because today

401
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,160
is our 520-day anniversary.

402
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,400
I thought you forgot.

403
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,560
They're so pretty.

404
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,200
Do you like it?

405
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,400
I do.

406
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,160
Then,

407
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:59,466
how should we celebrate

408
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:01,000
the next 521-day anniversary?

409
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,022
However you say.

410
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
Then,

411
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,640
let's do this.

412
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:21,582
(Happy graduation)

413
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,240
How time flies.

414
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,160
In the blink of an eye,

415
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,160
this is my second year here.

416
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,680
Do you remember when you first enrolled?

417
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,955
You were a curly-haired girl.

418
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,800
You were rushing around clumsily.

419
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:44,688
You also always stood up for others.

420
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,520
You're the one who was rushing around.

421
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,640
You hit me on the first day I came

422
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,844
and didn't even apologize.

423
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,640
Of course, I had to confront you.

424
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,280
Many beautiful love stories

425
00:30:56,505 --> 00:30:57,720
start off on the wrong foot

426
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
like ours did.

427
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,640
Look,

428
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,120
we've seen each other at our lowest

429
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,320
and watched each other

430
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,000
grow,

431
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,400
right?

432
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,120
Let's make a promise.

433
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,080
No matter what happens in the future,

434
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,280
we'll never let go of
each other's hands.

435
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,933
You're going to be busy again

436
00:31:26,955 --> 00:31:28,320
this summer break, right?

437
00:31:31,444 --> 00:31:33,688
I got an offer from a company
I interviewed with.

438
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,040
HR called me

439
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
to start working.

440
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,880
Grandma wanted to invite you
to Shenmu Village.

441
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,577
Looks like you won't make it again.

442
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:16,260
(August)

443
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Eleven days without seeing Han Yansheng.

444
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,040
Jian Dan,

445
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,355
we have a guest today.

446
00:32:32,405 --> 00:32:33,480
There's not much to cook.

447
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,200
Go catch some fish. Quick.

448
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,200
Who's coming?

449
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,480
You'll see.

450
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,240
I caught a koi!

451
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,760
Can I make a wish on you?

452
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,400
I wish I could see Han Yansheng today.

453
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,080
Jian Dan!

454
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,040
