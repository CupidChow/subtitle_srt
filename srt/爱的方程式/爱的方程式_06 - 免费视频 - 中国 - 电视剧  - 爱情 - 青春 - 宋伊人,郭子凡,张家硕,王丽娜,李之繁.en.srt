14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,520
Next.

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,680
Professor Wang,
I've got all the content memorized.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
I'd like to do
an off-script presentation.

17
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,080
We all know

18
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:09,680
applied math
differs from traditional math.

19
00:02:10,857 --> 00:02:12,120
This assignment's topic

20
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:15,022
is the practical application
of mathematical probability

21
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:16,355
and statistics in real life.

22
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,240
That's all from our team.

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,880
Group 2 gets C. Next.

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
Professor Wang, I don't get it.

25
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
He presented so well.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,555
Why did we still get a C?

27
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,480
This is a team project.

28
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,440
It requires
both slides and a presentation.

29
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Even if he presented well,

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
it only reflects his skills.

31
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Turning off the slides

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,720
undermined not only you,

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,960
but your whole team.

34
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,000
A team without collaboration

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
will never get more than a C.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,520
But...

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
No buts. Next.

38
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,600
Why did you close the slides?

39
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,160
Do you know what this C

40
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,960
means to me?

41
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,066
We'll talk after class.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,080
Explain.

43
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,880
There were errors in the slides.

44
00:03:29,555 --> 00:03:30,600
Didn't you know?

45
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,800
Impossible.

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
See for yourself.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,160
If I hadn't closed the slides,

48
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
you wouldn't even score a C.

49
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:13,480
How could Han Yansheng

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,200
put all the blame on you?

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,800
That's just over the line.

52
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,111
Still, I did mess up the data.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
He knew

54
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,640
the slides were problematic.

55
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,760
He should've fixed it.

56
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Even if he didn't,

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,560
he should've reminded you.

58
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,280
So it's ultimately

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
his fault.

60
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,120
Forget it.

61
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
There's no point

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,840
arguing over who's at fault.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,200
I should think about

64
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
next semester's tuition.

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,680
Tuition?

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm on a full scholarship.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,520
They're super strict about grades.

68
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,160
If you can't pay,

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,320
will you get expelled?

70
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,160
It's fine.

71
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,933
I'll think of something.

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,280
I'll help you too.

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,240
I'll sell some of my stuff.

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,320
Can you pull the curtain?

75
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm brushing my teeth.

76
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
Careful.

77
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:31,560
Make way.

78
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,800
Jian Dan, what's with you today?

79
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,520
Does our café still need part-timers?

80
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,000
We've filled all the positions.

81
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:51,560
But if you want to do work-study,

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
try asking Han.

83
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:54,911
I think Swimming Club
offers something like this.

84
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,120
Jian Dan.

85
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,480
On-campus jobs pay very little.

86
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,800
If you need money urgently,

87
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,320
I can refer you to one off-campus.

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,760
Awesome.

89
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,360
You're a lifesaver.

90
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,520
No need to be so formal.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,720
Boss.

92
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,760
I'm counting on you
to take care of my friend.

93
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,840
Sorry for the trouble.

94
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
Don't worry. Say hi to your dad for me.

95
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,440
Sure. Thanks.

96
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
I'm off. Bye.

97
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Jian Dan.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,120
How'd it go?

99
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,440
I spoke to Mr. Chen.

100
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,177
He agreed to hire you as a part-timer.

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,520
But you have a one-month probation.

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,988
I'm fine with that.

103
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,840
Mr. Chen is my dad's good friend,

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,120
so don't worry.

105
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,080
He'll take good care of you.

106
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,120
Thanks, Entong.

107
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,960
If you ever need help,

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,120
just let me know.

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Don't be so formal.

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,160
You're Sheng's friend,

111
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,320
so you're my friend too.

112
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,880
No matter what happens,

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
come to me anytime.

114
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,844
We haven't added each other
on WeChat yet.

115
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
Let me add you.

116
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:17,020
(Add Contact, Jian Dan)

117
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,560
What are you looking at?

118
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:50,000
Well, I haven't seen Jian Dan in days.

119
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,280
Is that so?

120
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:55,600
I heard from Rock Climbing Club

121
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,266
that Jian Dan leaves

122
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:59,680
after cleaning and assigning tasks
early in the morning.

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,840
Wait...

124
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,155
You keep glancing
toward Rock Climbing Club.

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,640
You want to see her?

126
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,720
Why else
would you keep asking about Jian Dan?

127
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,640
Have I ever mentioned Jian Dan?

128
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't think you did,

129
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,680
but maybe you did.

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,520
Anyway,

131
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
Cosplay Club's president came by,

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,051
inviting you to give a speech.

133
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,400
After all, Swimming Club

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,880
is the most influential club.

135
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,680
Alright.

136
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:51,960
Jian Dan.

137
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:53,560
Jian Dan.

138
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:55,000
An Ocean University club

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,422
is hosting an event here tomorrow.

140
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:58,000
Their representative will be here soon.

141
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:58,760
Receive them.

142
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
Which club is it?

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,560
What's the name again?

144
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:04,600
I think...

145
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,440
Jian Dan.

146
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,120
Mi Fen?

147
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:38,880
Jian Dan.

148
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,240
You can recognize me?

149
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
Isn't it obvious?

150
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
Looks great. Let me see.

151
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,828
Turn around. Let me see.

152
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:50,440
What's so great?

153
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,005
How is it not?

154
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
I didn't expect my boss

155
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
to be a hardcore cosplay fan.

156
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,000
Just consider it an employee benefit.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,200
You're so cute. It suits you.

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,000
I'd rather turn this benefit into cash.

159
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,600
You're such a money-lover. I like...

160
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Jian Dan.

161
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,291
Tables 7 and 12

162
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,931
want Cokes.

163
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:10,640
Deliver to them.

164
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm on it.

165
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,360
Pretty lady, enjoy yourself.

166
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,800
Where's the makeup room?

167
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,000
Straight ahead.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,080
Okay, thanks.

169
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,440
What did he ask you?

170
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,800
He said he's Luo Shui's assistant

171
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
and asked where the makeup room is.

172
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,040
Luo Shui's assistant?

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,400
Yuan Sen?

174
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,640
Thanks.

175
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:35,680
No problem.

176
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,900
(Luo Shui's Exclusive Makeup Room)

177
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:51,060
(Luo Shui's Exclusive Makeup Room)

178
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,240
(Lucky Koi Girl: You in the makeup room,
Prince Luo Shui?)

179
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,120
(Prince Luo Shui: I'm here.)

180
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,600
(Remember.
Don't let anyone else come in.)

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,200
(Lucky Koi Girl: Okay.)

182
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,000
Yuan Sen became
Prince Luo Shui's assistant?

183
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,468
Hello, here's your Coke.

184
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:04,200
Thank you.

185
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,600
Excuse me, Sir.

186
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,920
What would you like to drink?

187
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,560
Tell me and I'll get it for you.

188
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,080
No need. Let her do it.

189
00:12:22,725 --> 00:12:23,800
Let her deliver it.

190
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:26,555
Alright.

191
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,080
Jian Dan.

192
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,160
What was that service?

193
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,080
Sir, let me explain.

194
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
No need.

195
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,920
Immediately

196
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,760
pour him a drink

197
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
and apologize in person.

198
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,760
You... Go.

199
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,880
Alright.

200
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:50,600
Go.

201
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,120
One Coke.

202
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:28,400
Jian Dan.

203
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,880
My stomach hurts.

204
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,000
Help me deliver this drink
to the customer over there.

205
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,080
Thanks.

206
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,977
My stomach hurts.

207
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,920
Thanks.

208
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:06,960
Jian Dan!

209
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:08,600
What are you doing?

210
00:14:08,955 --> 00:14:10,490
Stealing a sip of the customer's drink?

211
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,880
Sir, I didn't drink it.

212
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,760
You didn't?
The straw's still in your mouth.

213
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,280
What are you doing?

214
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:16,480
- Is the Coke ready?
- Yes.

215
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:17,280
Quick, take them.

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,560
Faster. Go.

217
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,222
Stop right there.

218
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,760
Listen, this is your last warning.

219
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,720
One more time,

220
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and you're fired.

221
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
You're really pissing me off. Jeez.

222
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,480
Who is it?

223
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,240
Gosh.

224
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,800
Prince Luo Shui?

225
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,200
Stop it.

226
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Prince!

227
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,288
Did I let you take photos?

228
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Please leave.

229
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,520
Just one pic. Just one.

230
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,320
Please leave.

231
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,680
Prince Luo Shui, what's wrong?

232
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
Who are you? Get out!

233
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
Well, Prince Luo Shui,
don't misunderstand.

234
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
I just want an exclusive.

235
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,640
One more photo.

236
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,240
No.

237
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,760
No?

238
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,880
You'll damage it.

239
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,680
Delete the photos,

240
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,755
or I'll delete them.

241
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,200
No thanks. Off I go!

242
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,320
Stop right there!

243
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,000
Let him go.

244
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,880
Prince Luo Shui, I'm so sorry.

245
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
I didn't see him come in.

246
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,200
Sorry.

247
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,960
It's our mistake. Sorry.

248
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,280
It's fine.

249
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,320
Your voice sounds familiar.

250
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,400
Have we met before?

251
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,955
You got the wrong guy.

252
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,480
But it sounds familiar.

253
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,360
(Isn't that the bag)

254
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,080
(Yuan Sen was holding earlier?)

255
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,560
(Could it be...)

256
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,160
(But what if he's not?)

257
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,640
(What if I just offended my idol?)

258
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,000
If there's nothing else,

259
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,200
I'll continue getting ready.

260
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,320
Okay, I'll wait for you outside.

261
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:04,560
Yuan Sen!

262
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:21,640
Mi Fen.

263
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,880
Please keep this secret for me.

264
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
Who took that Coke?

265
00:18:06,914 --> 00:18:08,920
No wonder the waitress was so rude.

266
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
It was really you.

267
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:24,400
Gosh, turns out
Yuan Sen is Prince Luo Shui.

268
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,840
I met him

269
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,097
and even talked to him before.

270
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Gosh...

271
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,960
I can do this.

272
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,480
Prince Luo Shui, don't worry.

273
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,520
Your secret is safe with me.

274
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:46,600
I swear.

275
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,520
Thanks.

276
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,280
I like cosplay,

277
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,080
but I don't like attention.

278
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,280
I understand.

279
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,200
Am I not what you imagined?

280
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:00,200
Did I disappoint you?

281
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,200
Not at all.

282
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,800
You're way more handsome

283
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,211
than I ever imagined.

284
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,400
No, I mean...

285
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,480
You usually look cold

286
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,508
and hard to approach,

287
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:17,240
so I couldn't

288
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,560
link you to Luo Shui.

289
00:19:21,782 --> 00:19:22,440
No.

290
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,920
I mean...

291
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,491
You're already cool

292
00:19:27,514 --> 00:19:28,640
as Yuan Sen.

293
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,960
And now

294
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,840
that you've become Prince Luo Shui,

295
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,800
I couldn't process it all of a sudden.

296
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,600
So I just...

297
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,400
None of that made sense, right?

298
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,880
The show's starting.
I should get prepared.

299
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,200
I'll wait for you outside.

300
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
Prince Luo Shui. Yuan Sen...

301
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,160
Okay. Sorry.

302
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:02,333
(Luo Shui's Exclusive Makeup Room)

303
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,920
Are you that broke?

304
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,600
Just to make money,

305
00:20:16,844 --> 00:20:18,600
you dress like that to please guests.

306
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
I need money because of you.

307
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,440
Because of me?

308
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,640
If only you had checked...

309
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,760
Who added wasabi to Coke?

310
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,400
Who did it?

311
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,820
(Unrivaled Hero Show)

312
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

313
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,160
Let's welcome today's star.

314
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,640
Prince Luo Shui!

315
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,360
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

316
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,360
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

317
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,400
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

318
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,640
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

319
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:01,651
Prince Luo Shui!

320
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:02,920
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

321
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,508
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

322
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,680
- Luo Shui!
- Luo Shui!

323
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,460
(Luo Shui)

324
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,355
(Luo Shui, I Love You!)

325
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:58,710
(Luo Shui)

326
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,600
Was the Coke earlier for me?

327
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,000
You deserve it.

328
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,933
If you hadn't complained to the manager,

329
00:23:23,955 --> 00:23:25,660
I wouldn't have added wasabi to the Coke

330
00:23:25,666 --> 00:23:26,360
and lost my job.

331
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,400
That job wasn't worth keeping.

332
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,480
It means nothing to you, but...

333
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,480
Forget it. It's not worth explaining.

334
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,960
You said

335
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,080
I didn't check the slides in advance.

336
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
What do you mean?

337
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
I meant...

338
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,880
Never mind.

339
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,360
Just stay away from me.

340
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,920
Who should stay away from whom?

341
00:24:32,011 --> 00:24:33,600
Hey, class is starting.

342
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,960
Where are you going?

343
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,240
I have great news for everyone.

344
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,080
The country's most authoritative

345
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,640
academic journal,

346
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,080
The Mystery of Mathematics,

347
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,440
is launching

348
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,548
a quarterly paper submission campaign
for university students.

349
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
Any paper that gets published

350
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,440
will earn bonus credit this semester.

351
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,160
Here.

352
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,160
Quiet.

353
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,000
Spots are limited.

354
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,800
Please submit your paper

355
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,920
within one month to my mailbox.

356
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,720
If your paper passes review,

357
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,760
the school will nominate it.

358
00:25:16,262 --> 00:25:17,280
Got it?

359
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,800
Entong.

360
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:31,480
Jian Dan.

361
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,302
Mr. Chen told me

362
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,760
about your job incident.

363
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
Sorry, I let you down.

364
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,360
Don't dwell on it
just because you lost it.

365
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,160
This café

366
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,320
happens to be hiring.

367
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,200
I think you should try it.

368
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,640
No need. I've already found

369
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,839
a way to keep my scholarship.

370
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,360
I don't need to work part-time anymore.

371
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,840
Really? What way?

372
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:53,182
By writing a paper...

373
00:25:53,211 --> 00:25:55,760
Getting bonus points
from writing a paper isn't that easy.

374
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,840
Don't be overly optimistic.

375
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,560
None of your concern!

376
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,982
Entong, I've got something to do.

377
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I'll go now.

378
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,160
Sure.

379
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,200
Go ahead. Bye-bye.

380
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,960
Your dish has too little meat.

381
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,088
I'm on a diet lately.

382
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:32,760
Jian Dan?

383
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,333
Let's head over.

384
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,520
Jian Dan. Jian...

385
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,320
Don't bother Jian Dan.

386
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,022
She's writing a paper

387
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:45,160
for her scholarship.

388
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,840
Enjoy your meal.

389
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,960
Jian Dan is working so hard.

390
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:55,320
I must help her.

391
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:56,888
How do you plan to help?

392
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,760
Han!

393
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,360
Han!

394
00:27:18,422 --> 00:27:19,880
I was looking for you in the office.

395
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,822
Turns out you're here.

396
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,794
What's up?

397
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,600
I made a few farewell party proposals.

398
00:27:24,911 --> 00:27:26,260
Take a look and pick one you like.

399
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,760
Farewell party?

400
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,840
(Farewell Party Proposals)

401
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,040
One of Swimming Club's members

402
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,880
is about to be forced to drop out.

403
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,400
I want to throw her a farewell party.

404
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,200
Drop out? Who?

405
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:38,960
Jian Dan.

406
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,120
What?

407
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
You don't know?

408
00:27:43,325 --> 00:27:45,200
Jian Dan got a C in an elective class,

409
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,444
disqualifying her
from receiving the scholarship.

410
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,622
Poor Jian Dan might have to

411
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,280
drop out next semester

412
00:27:52,311 --> 00:27:53,933
for being unable
to afford tuition money.

413
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,440
But now there's a chance

414
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,560
to turn things around.

415
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,320
What exactly are you saying?

416
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,880
Don't you want to write a paper?

417
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,000
These are my writing tips.

418
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,680
With these methods,

419
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,120
I've already published three papers

420
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,080
in prominent journals.

421
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,040
You summarized it perfectly.

422
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,560
Better

423
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:42,880
than any research paper guide

424
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,080
I've seen.

425
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,680
This is just part of it.

426
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,600
If you want to get published,

427
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,920
there's much more to know.

428
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,720
I haven't finished reading.

429
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,120
If you want to learn,

430
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,360
come to Yangfang Coffee
at 5 PM every day.

431
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,880
I'll coach you for an hour.

432
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,960
Really?

433
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,560
Why are you helping me?

434
00:29:03,022 --> 00:29:04,840
I'm also responsible
for the slides issue.

435
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,560
When I noticed the data error,

436
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,480
I shouldn't have only texted you.

437
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,160
I should have fixed it myself.

438
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,360
And all this wouldn't have happened.

439
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,977
So this is my way to make it up.

440
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,960
You texted me?

441
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,560
I never got any notification.

442
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,400
See for yourself.

443
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,960
How could this be?

444
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:30,960
Then...

445
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,720
Why didn't I receive anything?
