29.

17
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,500
One more set.

18
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,580
I've already done two sets in a row.

19
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,580
Who's the one who wants
to earn her place in the Swimming Club?

20
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,380
You just started,
yet you're already giving up?

21
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,422
Is that all you've got?

22
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,780
(He's not training me.)

23
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,500
(He's clearly messing with me.)

24
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,940
Of course.

25
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,300
This training plan

26
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,780
was made
for the Swimming Club's talents.

27
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:30,820
It's normal that a rookie like you
can't handle it.

28
00:02:31,188 --> 00:02:32,700
If you want to quit,

29
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:33,820
I won't stop you.

30
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,660
(No, I need the credits.)

31
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,020
(Or I won't qualify)

32
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,820
(for next semester's full scholarship.)

33
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:43,700
Who said I'm quitting?

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm never quitting.

35
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,180
30!

36
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,420
(Well, let's see how long you last.)

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,780
(Apartment Buildings No. 15, 16)

38
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:55,700
Who did this?

39
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,300
How did you end up like this?

40
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,380
Tangtang, this was you, right?

41
00:04:04,463 --> 00:04:07,100
Your hair is showing
your ambition to succeed.

42
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,303
So you admit it?

43
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:11,220
Don't accuse me. I was reading.

44
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,980
You never read in the dorm.

45
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,700
Also, the book is upside down.

46
00:04:19,141 --> 00:04:21,300
I'll read however I want.

47
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,580
It's none of your business.

48
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:25,500
You've been picking on me
since I started here.

49
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:26,620
Aside from you,

50
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,060
I can't think of anyone else
who'd do something this childish.

51
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,820
Yue Tangtang,
you've got nothing better to do?

52
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:34,980
Do you have proof?

53
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
The paint on your hand is proof.

54
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,060
I got it from painting.

55
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,380
Then what's this?

56
00:04:49,338 --> 00:04:50,369
Does having hair dye

57
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,060
make me guilty?

58
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,020
Excuses.

59
00:04:55,564 --> 00:04:57,677
Let's compare the color shades.

60
00:04:57,832 --> 00:04:59,658
See that bright yellow...

61
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,740
Ridiculous, I didn't use yellow...

62
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,380
Yue Tangtang, you're really childish.

63
00:05:08,124 --> 00:05:10,940
Since you want to give me
a new hairstyle,

64
00:05:12,105 --> 00:05:14,300
let's meet at the salon at 10:30 AM

65
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,740
tomorrow morning.

66
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,820
Who is it?

67
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,577
(No way. It's Han Yansheng!)

68
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,060
(Why am I so unlucky?)

69
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:50,340
(First I pushed him into water,
now I crash into him.)

70
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:50,980
(No.)

71
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,155
(No way I'm letting him recognize me. )

72
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:54,900
Let me help you.

73
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,900
Do you even know how to ride a bike?

74
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:58,220
Can't you watch the road?

75
00:05:59,174 --> 00:06:01,780
Sorry, I'll untangle you now.

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Are you nuts?

77
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:04,860
I was walking just fine.

78
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,140
And you just crashed into me.

79
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,039
Don't yell.

80
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,150
The more you yell,
the harder it is to untangle you.

81
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:10,940
Hurry up!

82
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:12,740
Are you done?

83
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:14,980
Almost.

84
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,180
What's with that accent?

85
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,740
Hurry up.

86
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,940
Done!

87
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:09,500
Your coffee.

88
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,860
Shi, what's today?

89
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,866
There are so many people.

90
00:07:13,776 --> 00:07:14,900
Thanks to Luo Shui.

91
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:16,460
They're all his fans.

92
00:07:19,174 --> 00:07:20,020
Where's Han?

93
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,180
Han.

94
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:28,300
What are you holding?

95
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:34,327
Han, has your taste changed?

96
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,310
You like Pokémon now?

97
00:07:35,343 --> 00:07:36,380
Pikachu.

98
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:39,060
Don't ask. I met a weird girl

99
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,940
with rainbow-colored hair.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,266
She hit me and ran off.
She didn't even show her face.

101
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:45,100
You're on a love streak lately.

102
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:46,200
First, a curly-haired girl.

103
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,820
Now, a colorful phoenix.

104
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:50,060
(Curly-haired?)

105
00:07:50,143 --> 00:07:50,957
(You mean that girl)

106
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,820
(who made the forum news with Han?)

107
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,733
(I told you to stop mentioning her.)

108
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:10,460
(Cosplay Master
Prince Luo Shui Fan Club)

109
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,940
A beauty arrived.

110
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,420
Isn't that Jian Dan?

111
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,249
Didn't she have curly hair?

112
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,420
She changed her hair?

113
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,229
I must admit, she looks good.

114
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,580
(Jian Dan: Fen, I'm here. Where are you?)

115
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,100
She's cute.

116
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,220
She's not bad.

117
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,260
Did all of you lose your taste?

118
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,380
What's cute about her?

119
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,120
(Mi Fen: I'm on the 2nd floor. Come upstairs.)

120
00:09:09,903 --> 00:09:10,380
Fen.

121
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,340
Jian Dan.

122
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:15,540
This new hairstyle suits you. It's cute.

123
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,666
I think my head looks smaller now.

124
00:09:18,614 --> 00:09:21,380
Look, it's Prince Luo Shui's new merch.

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,910
Each person only gets one set.

126
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,500
One fan and one keychain.

127
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,465
So now,

128
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,300
you and I switch places.

129
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,444
And I can grab a second set.

130
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,020
What do you think? Good idea?

131
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,140
Why is he here?

132
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,767
Who?

133
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,580
Han Yansheng.
He can never find out I'm here.

134
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,540
But he's already here...

135
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,460
Are you hiding from me?

136
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,300
What a coincidence.

137
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,340
Are you guilty about something?

138
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,933
(Prince Luo Shui)

139
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,380
No.

140
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,940
You even have time
for a hairdo and chasing idols.

141
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,380
Looks like you have plenty of energy.

142
00:10:04,901 --> 00:10:06,820
Did I give you too little work?

143
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:08,684
It wasn't me. It was...

144
00:10:08,712 --> 00:10:09,860
Extra training tomorrow.

145
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:11,380
Don't be late.

146
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,614
Jian Dan, nice hairstyle.

147
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,400
I'll stop calling you curly-haired girl.

148
00:10:19,288 --> 00:10:20,860
It really wasn't me chasing idols.

149
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:23,020
You broke my fan. Hand it over.

150
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,980
Keep lining up. Hurry.

151
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:39,580
Halftime break.

152
00:10:44,703 --> 00:10:46,580
Not you. You don't need to come up.

153
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,620
You seem full of energy.

154
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,990
You probably don't need to rest.

155
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,380
Add one more hour of training.

156
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,860
Yesterday was a mistake.

157
00:11:00,896 --> 00:11:01,720
It was my roommate...

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,100
After that one hour of training,

159
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,220
come out of the pool
and do a set of squats.

160
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,700
Bring the same energy
you use to chase your idol.

161
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,740
I know you can do it.

162
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,060
Start.

163
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm not the one chasing idols!

164
00:11:30,374 --> 00:11:31,340
Han.

165
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,940
Aren't you being too harsh on Jian Dan?

166
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:36,140
Harsh?

167
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,460
Harsh enough.

168
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:41,340
Why else would I let her join the team?

169
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,220
I want her to pay for the dumb thing

170
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,220
she did.

171
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,180
Han Yansheng!

172
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:52,820
You've gone too far.

173
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,220
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

174
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,460
Why are you doing this?

175
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,500
You brought this on yourself.

176
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,940
What do you mean?

177
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:11,668
Still pretending?

178
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:13,780
When you sent me the photo,

179
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,300
weren't you quite bold?

180
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,454
What photo?

181
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,020
I never sent you a photo.

182
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:20,200
(To: Han Yansheng)

183
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:21,180
Look for yourself.

184
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,955
Isn't this the apology letter
I asked Monkey to give you?

185
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,500
(Serves you right.)

186
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,740
What? Speechless now?

187
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,623
You misunderstood. I gave...

188
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,260
You caused me so much trouble

189
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,180
and still call them misunderstandings?

190
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,940
Letting you drown was my fault,

191
00:12:45,844 --> 00:12:47,740
but I truly knew nothing
about the photo.

192
00:12:47,771 --> 00:12:48,938
I told Monkey to give you

193
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:49,720
an apology letter...

194
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:50,580
Enough.

195
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,700
I'll never trust you again.

196
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,580
Fine. Okay.

197
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,500
I know you won't believe anything I say.

198
00:13:00,388 --> 00:13:01,220
Tell me

199
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,100
what I can do to make it up to you then.

200
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,180
Alright.

201
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,540
Starting today,

202
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:13,140
be my assistant for ten days.

203
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,711
Do everything I say. No complaints.

204
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,260
Personal assistant?

205
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:20,180
Of course, you can refuse.

206
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,380
But I'll keep training you hard

207
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,380
until I'm no longer angry.

208
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Fine. I agree.

209
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:34,180
But don't go overboard.

210
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,500
Of course. Hand me your phone.

211
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,820
(Name: Han Yansheng, Phone:1853036)

212
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,540
From now on,

213
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,204
you must answer my calls instantly

214
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,733
and come whenever I call.

215
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:57,809
Go train first.

216
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,140
After that,
get lunch for me from the canteen.

217
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:02,109
Rice from the first floor,
soup from the second,

218
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,370
spicy chicken from the third,
scallion omelet from the fourth,

219
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,622
and steamed crab from the fifth.

220
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,340
Repeat it.

221
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:10,140
I never repeat myself.

222
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,660
Go now.

223
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:17,420
Rice from the first floor,
soup from second...

224
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,140
Third floor...

225
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,260
Han Yansheng, can I add your WeChat?

226
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,420
It's inconvenient.

227
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:36,740
I won't bother you.

228
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,660
I just have things
I can't say in person.

229
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,540
I want to tell you on WeChat.

230
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
Add my assistant, then.

231
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,780
She'll pass it on to me.

232
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,300
Miss, I'll add you then.

233
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,340
I want something different
for today's lunch.

234
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,140
Get me noodles from the first floor,

235
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,844
braised pork from the second,
and lotus rib soup from the third.

236
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,660
Okay.

237
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,620
Why are you still here?

238
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:28,220
Relax. Your food will be here soon.

239
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,100
Your delivery.

240
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,740
Thanks.

241
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,740
Your food's here.

242
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,020
How'd you get it?

243
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,740
Campus delivery app.

244
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,020
First order is free.

245
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,380
That's cheating.

246
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,780
You never said
I couldn't order food delivery.

247
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,900
They also offer document delivery.

248
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:06,660
I want you to disappear immediately.

249
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Wait.

250
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,620
One more thing to do.

251
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,220
Han Yansheng.

252
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,940
Ever since I first saw you on campus,

253
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:29,500
I've been deeply drawn to you.

254
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,974
Not my words.

255
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,260
It's from that girl who likes you.

256
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,460
I wanted to just send it to you,

257
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,820
but you're a busy man.

258
00:16:43,098 --> 00:16:45,020
I figured you might not read it,

259
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,769
so I took the trouble

260
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:48,220
to read it out loud for you.

261
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,962
Pretty faces

262
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,466
- are all the same.
- Alright, stop.

263
00:16:54,511 --> 00:16:56,420
- But an interesting soul
- Stop it.

264
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,997
is one in a million.

265
00:16:58,021 --> 00:17:02,260
You're so unique.

266
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,580
I'm not done.

267
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:06,237
The writing is good.

268
00:17:07,475 --> 00:17:09,409
The forecast said it might rain tonight.

269
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:10,957
I heard, "You're mine tonight."

270
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:13,188
I'll miss you a bit tomorrow morning.

271
00:17:13,277 --> 00:17:15,150
I'll miss you more in the afternoon.

272
00:17:15,207 --> 00:17:16,820
Affected by the low mood,

273
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,980
I'll miss you the most in the evening.

274
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,100
Han Yansheng, I like you.

275
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,100
I ask for no outcome, no future,

276
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,470
and no memories together.

277
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,460
All I ask is to meet you
in the best years...

278
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,100
Sorry.

279
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm not interested in you.

280
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,780
I have a meeting. Please leave.

281
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,700
(Mathematician and Martyr, Hypatia)

282
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,260
You seem to be in a good mood today.

283
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,340
Silence brings peace of mind.

284
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,900
Who annoyed you?

285
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:02,140
Forget it. Let's just read.

286
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,460
Still reading
your math goddess's biography?

287
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,700
Hypatia.

288
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,465
The first female mathematician
in history.

289
00:18:09,536 --> 00:18:11,500
She deserves to be called a goddess.

290
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,562
Isn't that the latest problem

291
00:18:20,609 --> 00:18:22,220
from Math Magazine?

292
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,940
What? Want to challenge it?

293
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,665
A-level difficulty.
Do it when you're free.

294
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,020
You can kill some time.

295
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Take your time. I have to work.

296
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,980
I'll come with you.
I'll return the book.

297
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,660
Sure, I'll wait at the door.

298
00:18:58,392 --> 00:18:59,560
Find a seat first.

299
00:18:59,644 --> 00:19:00,680
I'll grab some books.

300
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:01,380
Sure.

301
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,644
(Mathematician and Martyr, Hypatia)

302
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,060
Hypatia.

303
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,300
(Mathematician and Martyr, Hypatia)

304
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:00,340
Jian Dan, what are you writing? A novel?

305
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,900
I found an interesting math problem.

306
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,962
I seriously don't get you top students.

307
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:09,420
What's fun about math anyway?

308
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,420
Let me solve this first.

309
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,463
Then I'll teach you.

310
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,420
It's really easy.

311
00:20:14,689 --> 00:20:16,214
You're the only one in our year

312
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,938
who got a full scholarship.

313
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,900
Of course it's easy for you.

314
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:22,820
But for someone like me,

315
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,380
it's impossible.

316
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:27,860
Speaking of, Jian Dan,

317
00:20:28,222 --> 00:20:29,240
you're so good at math.

318
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:30,820
Why not major in math?

319
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,380
Math is just a hobby.

320
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,580
I want to help more people.

321
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,460
That's why I chose psychology.

322
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,940
I see.

323
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,300
Alright, keep studying.

324
00:20:45,654 --> 00:20:47,180
I'll take a nap.

325
00:20:47,701 --> 00:20:49,420
Wake me when you're done.

326
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:06,540
Solved it.

327
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,419
(Han Yansheng: Clean the second floor)

328
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,000
(of the Swimming Club at 9 AM tomorrow.)

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,777
(No slacking.)

330
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,060
(Jian Dan: Got it.)

331
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,500
That's a lot of stuff.

332
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,420
He expects me to finish before dark?

333
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,460
How come I never knew

334
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,580
the school had such a huge climbing gym?

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,955
The applied math class is starting soon.

336
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,660
Are you ready?

337
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,660
Professor Wang's a known demon.

338
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:20,420
I already got

339
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,500
his recommended book list.

340
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,780
I'll be fine.

341
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
I knew it'd be here.

342
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:53,220
What's this?

343
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,380
My problem's

344
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,100
been solved!

345
00:24:00,477 --> 00:24:01,672
Such neat handwriting.

346
00:24:01,795 --> 00:24:03,220
It's definitely a girl.

347
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:04,340
Could it be

348
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,460
your math goddess, Hypatia?

349
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,860
Han.

350
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,220
Are you sure she'll solve it again?

351
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,420
That last one was just a normal problem.

352
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,460
At most, it was A-level.

353
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,380
But this one's S-level.

354
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,300
Most people can't solve it.

355
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,860
Some don't even understand it.

356
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,900
Only true math lovers

357
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,420
can get the right answer.

358
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,220
I hope she doesn't disappoint me.

359
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,660

(No Diving. No Crossing.)

361
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,540
You really live up to your name.

362
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,020
You can sleep anywhere.

363
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:50,980
Are you calling me simple?

364
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,940
At least you're self-aware.

365
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,660
Let's call it even.

366
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,780
Come to my office tomorrow.

367
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,540
We'll do the handover.

00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,420
(I'd better fix it.)

372
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:08,420
What are you holding?

373
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:16,740
Your trophy's broken.

374
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,500
(Good luck, Sheng!)

375
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,660
Awesome, Sheng!

376
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,140
Champion, Sheng!

377
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,420
Champion, Sheng!

378
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,580
(First Place)

379
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,100
Nan Yuan.

380
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,060
Hurry over.

381
00:27:58,044 --> 00:27:59,120
(First Place)

382
00:27:59,122 --> 00:28:00,300
Let me take your photo.

383
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,140
Here. Look this way.

384
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,340
Okay, smile!

385
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,555
(Certificate of Honor)

386
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,140
Who let you touch my trophy?

387
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:14,021
No, you've got it wrong.

388
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:16,020
It's in your hands. Don't deny it.

389
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,020
It was already like this
when I got here.

390
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,980
Besides you and me,

391
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,340
who else is here?

392
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,317
I really didn't break it.

393
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:25,820
I even took a photo.

394
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,580
I'm finding a way to fix it.

395
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:29,100
- See for yourself...
- No need.

396
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,700
I'll compensate you.

397
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,820
No need.

398
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,500
If I did it, I'd admit it.

399
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,260
If I didn't, I never will.

400
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:58,780
I didn't break the trophy.

401
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,820
Think what you want.

402
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:07,500
What's wrong with you?

403
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:11,580
Jian Dan?

404
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,460
Hey, Han.

405
00:29:20,644 --> 00:29:21,740
Here's the new training plan

406
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,800
for the Swimming Club.

407
00:29:25,324 --> 00:29:27,860
Why is the trophy broken? Who did it?

408
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:32,700
Are the others okay?

409
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,220
Han.

410
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,700
Why is there a concert ticket here?

411
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,100
(The Voice of Heaven:
Aiyue Symphony Concert)

412
00:29:48,976 --> 00:29:50,260
It must've been left in a panic

413
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,620
by whoever broke the trophy.

414
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,180
Who could it be?

415
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,660
About that...

416
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,340
We'll find out tonight.
