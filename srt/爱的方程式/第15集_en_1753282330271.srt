1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,600
Grow up gently

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
She is a flower that is fragrant

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
For her parents

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
T-PARDIYAH

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is passionate

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only the sound

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt like a melt

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,600
T-PARDIYAH

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you are beautiful

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,000
Love her

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800
And smile back

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
The one you are beautiful

15
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,000
Love her

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,800
And smile back

17
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Episode 2

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,800
T-PARDIYAH

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,800
The one you are beautiful

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Love her

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,200
And smile back

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
The one you are beautiful

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
Love her

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
And smile back

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
The one you are beautiful

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,600
When we first met

27
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Some look, some words

28
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
I still can't forget

29
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,600
My eyes are already wet

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Like a poem

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,600
Those young days

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,800
It's ordinary but interesting

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,000
In the gap of time

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The wind quietly blows

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,600
Have you waited for me for a long time?

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,000
Those broken memories

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,600
Otherwise?

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,400
The room is not even in place

39
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,400
We used to be

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Take us home to eat

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
T-PARDIYAH

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The one you are beautiful

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Love her

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And smile back

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The one you are beautiful

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Love her

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And smile back

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The one you are beautiful

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Love her

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When we first met

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Some look, some words

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I still can't forget

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The one you are beautiful

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Love her

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And smile back

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The one you are beautiful

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Love her

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
When we first met

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Some look, some words

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I still can't forget

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The one you are beautiful

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Love her

63
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
When we first met

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Some look, some words

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I still can't forget

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The one you are beautiful

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Love her

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When we first met

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Some look, some words

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Come on

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Cheers

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I just read Yuan Cen's circle

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He is dating Mi Fen

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm full

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm full

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yuan Cen used to send his circle

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After dating

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He often sent some photos

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
To spread the dog food

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
So this is only soil

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No words

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He just asked randomly

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In this photo, you, the crown prince, Yuan Cen, monkey

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is this person?

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He looks familiar

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He is my best friend

87
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nan Yuan

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why didn't I hear you mention him before?

89
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He passed away

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sorry, I don't know

91
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I should say sorry

92
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I didn't mean to make you angry

93
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
At the last party

94
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I just read the short film you prepared

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And I lost control

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I remember

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I met Nan Yuan in the short film

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You lost control because of him?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Nan Yuan grew up with me

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But he died because of me

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Since then

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I dare not go into the water

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Master

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm here

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm here

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm here

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Master

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's too windy today

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Not suitable for diving

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How about another day?

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm here

112
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's play

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Master, you want to dive so much today

114
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll go with you

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go

116
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It was very windy that day

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I insisted on diving

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Nan Yuan and En Tong

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
had to go with me

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Like always

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We keep going deeper

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The scenery around us is getting more beautiful

123
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
After we reach the bottom of the sea

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We separate

125
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
To watch the sea

126
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I don't know why

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There was still an accident

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Nan Yuan suddenly found his own bottle

129
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Losing compressed air

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The air supply was also broken

131
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He struggled in the water

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He struggled in the water

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He struggled in the water

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He struggled in the water

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He struggled in the water

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He struggled in the water

137
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He struggled in the water

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
After I saw

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I swam towards him

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I wanted to give him my breath

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But I found

142
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There was something wrong with my breath

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I had to hold Nan Yuan

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I struggled to swim

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I didn't want to save him

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I also went into a state of lack of oxygen

147
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I also went into a state of lack of oxygen

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
My consciousness was getting more and more blurred

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then Shan Tong gave me his breathing

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then Shan Tong gave me his breathing

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let me regain consciousness

152
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I wanted to save Nan Yuan

153
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But I was completely unreasonable

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I wanted to save Nan Yuan

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I could only watch Nan Yuan's body

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Keep falling

157
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Far and far

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Until it disappears

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And I

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But I can't do anything

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Sorry

162
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know these

163
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You didn't mean it

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's not your fault

166
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Weird

167
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why did sister tell me

168
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not the same

169
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not the same

170
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,320
I should rest for a while.

171
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,360
Are you sure offered to live here in прост remittance?

172
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,840
Yes, nothing wrong with that.

173
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,040
This is a house of Master Han's young aunt.

174
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
He didn't have an easy residence.

175
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,880
You want to live here?

176
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,660
No shadows forests

177
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,880
No thoughts

178
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,720
Let me open the door.

179
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,260
It's you, Respectful Third Officer.

180
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,980
You... You should hide somewhere.

181
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,420
Why should I hide?

182
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,900
You must have misunderstood it.

183
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,660
Misunderstood what?

184
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,340
Let's go.

185
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,580
Let's go to the kitchen.

186
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,700
Jian Dan.

187
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,500
Open the door. I'm Mi Fen.

188
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,660
Jian Dan.

189
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,500
Why should I hide?

190
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,100
I didn't do anything wrong.

191
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,340
No.

192
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,100
They can't explain it clearly.

193
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm going to hide.

194
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,460
Let's go.

195
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,860
Why do you have the key?

196
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,860
I used to come here with Han.

197
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,020
This is the spare key.

198
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,980
I always put it here.

199
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,300
Jian Dan.

200
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,900
It's not what you see.

201
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,900
I usually live here alone.

202
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,860
Last night...

203
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,900
Last night...

204
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,100
It was an accident.

205
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,140
It was an accident.

206
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,500
As I said, last night,

207
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,660
you two had a situation.

208
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,860
No. No. No.

209
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,300
We were drunk last night.

210
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,020
Nothing...

211
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,780
Nothing happened.

212
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,020
So you are the nine-tailed fox.

213
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,940
There's nothing in the nine-tailed fox.

214
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,300
Han.

215
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,220
What happened last night?

216
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,100
What did you see?

217
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,540
What is it?

218
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,740
Don't talk nonsense.

219
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,940
Mi Fen.

220
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,260
Have you eaten?

221
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,020
No.

222
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,020
I'll cook for you.

223
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,780
Why is Jian Dan with Dasheng?

224
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,260
Isn't this Jiang Zhishan's house?

225
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,620
Hello, sir.

226
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,620
We're not going.

227
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,900
We'll go to the repair factory.

228
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,580
Okay.

229
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Okay. Thank you.

230
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,100
Jian Dan.

231
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,340
Senior.

232
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Why are you here?

233
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,700
I just want to come and see you.

234
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,540
How is it?

235
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,500
Are you used to living in the repair factory?

236
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,500
I've moved out.

237
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm living in the aunt's house in Hanyuan.

238
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,700
Okay.

239
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,500
I'm sorry.

240
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,380
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm sorry.

243
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,220
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,140
I'm sorry.

245
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,220
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,100
I'm sorry.

247
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,020
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,100
I'm sorry.

249
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,140
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,140
I'm sorry.

251
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,100
Oh.

252
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,260
Dasheng is thoughtful.

253
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,140
Senior.

254
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,300
About Hanyuan,

255
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,540
Yisheng told me everything.

256
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,180
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

257
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,580
It's really because of Hanyuan.

258
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,580
She has caused me a lot of trouble.

259
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,500
Not only is she Dasheng's friend,

260
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,100
she's also my friend.

261
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,460
After that incident,

262
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,300
I chose to be a exchange student.

263
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,700
I thought it would be over soon.

264
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,980
But she should have let go of it.

265
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,220
I didn't expect...

266
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,740
Police!

267
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,620
Come and help me!

268
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,500
Hurry up!

269
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,020
Senior, I'll go first.

270
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,420
Okay.

271
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,740
You can go ahead.

272
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,260
Hello, President Li.

273
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,940
We're interested in your proposal.

274
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,700
We'll come to Qingzhou soon.

275
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay.

276
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,900
Listen.

277
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,340
Gu Wentong must have done it on purpose.

278
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,100
Don't be fooled by him.

279
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
But he looks very sad.

280
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,580
Why is he sad?

281
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,780
If he's sad,

282
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
he can't be fooled by him.

283
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,540
He's not a fool.

284
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,820
He's not a fool.

285
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
He's not a fool.

286
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
He's not a fool.

287
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,100
He's not a fool.

288
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,900
If he's sad,

289
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,180
can he send you the wrong message on purpose?

290
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,580
Can you prepare a mirror and video

291
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,780
for Han Yansheng at the Yuan Dan Party?

292
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,980
He's obviously upset about Nan Yuan.

293
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,780
He even told you on purpose.

294
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,980
Tell me about him.

295
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,860
He's so...

296
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,620
How could he do that?

297
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,140
Okay, I'll stop talking.

298
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,020
Someone's here.

299
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,140
No, I...

300
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,740
Why are you here so early today?

301
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,360
The Association of

302
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,940
the Volunteers of Qingzhou

303
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,060
invites volunteers from Haida

304
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
to attend the meeting.

305
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm not here this week.

306
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I see.

307
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,580
I'll come and tell you.

308
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,020
I have to go now.

309
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,500
Be careful.

310
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,900
I bought these for you.

311
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,100
These are the dishes I bought for you.

312
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,700
So many?

313
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,860
When will I be able to finish them?

314
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,460
Eat slowly.

315
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,860
Go back.

316
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Be careful.

317
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,580
Monkey,

318
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,140
I'm going to Qingzhou today.

319
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,460
I won't be back this week.

320
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,740
Take care of Jian Dan for me.

321
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,580
I can take care of Jian Dan.

322
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,740
But

323
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,300
he's at Jiang Zhishan's house.

324
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,580
I don't dare.

325
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,620
Do me a favor.

326
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,020
I'll give you the game skin you wanted last time.

327
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,660
Really?

328
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,900
I can buy the skin myself.

329
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,620
Jiang Zhishan's house?

330
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,340
Forget it.

331
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,540
Jian Dan is your friend.

332
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,460
It's not worth it for a friend.

333
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,260
I'll think about it.

334
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,300
But he's abroad.

335
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,660
He won't be back after a meal.

336
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,740
What are you afraid of?

337
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,540
I'm afraid too.

338
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,140
Okay.

339
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
I'll go now.

340
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,500
Buy me the skin.

341
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,140
Dinner's ready.

342
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,540
I think I cooked too much.

343
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,780
Jian Dan.

344
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Monkey,

345
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
why are you here?

346
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,820
Han, I'm worried about you.

347
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Let me have a look.

348
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,540
The meal is ready.

349
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
I'll enjoy it.

350
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,020
Okay.

351
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,140
Thank you.

352
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,980
I haven't eaten for a day. I'm starving.

353
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,140
Han Yisheng has left?

354
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,580
He and En Tong are on their way to Qingzhou.

355
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,460
Shi Jie is there too?

356
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,860
They went to be a nurse

357
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,580
after the Han family.

358
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,660
I see.

359
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,500
Well.

360
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,460
Han cares about you.

361
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,740
He knows you work in the car factory.

362
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,620
He arranged you to be a nurse

363
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,700
in the car factory.

364
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,660
He's going to Qingzhou.

365
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,140
He asked me to come and see you.

366
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,500
He cares about you.

367
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,420
Han Yisheng has left for so long.

368
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,780
When will he come back?

369
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,940
He must not come back.

370
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,780
Why?

371
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,860
You don't know.

372
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,020
He's a bad person.

373
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,020
He's my childhood hero.

374
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,740
He's a bad person.

375
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,420
Wait. I'll get you some water.

376
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,780
Eat slowly.

377
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,460
Or you'll get robbed.

378
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,140
Here.

379
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,900
Mr. Chen.

380
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,260
You can't call me that.

381
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,020
You can call me that.

382
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,740
I hate him.

383
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,780
I feel cold when I see him.

384
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,100
I think he's not a good person.

385
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,100
A good person?

386
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
He's not a good person.

387
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,740
Does Han Yisheng have a daughter

388
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,180
who's about the same age as us?

389
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,100
A daughter?

390
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,140
She's not a girl.

391
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,300
What daughter?

392
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,580
What do you know about him?

393
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,300
A person?

394
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,620
Do you have an educated daughter?

395
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,820
You should know.

396
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,180
She makes it clear that

397
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,060
she's not a good person.

398
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,220
How could they do that?

399
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,260
You two should look at her.

400
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,540
I'm not coming back.

401
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,060
How can I hear someone behind me

402
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,940
talking bad about me?

403
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,740
That's not what he meant.

404
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,780
Who are you?

405
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,620
Jiang Xiaochuan.

406
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,340
I'm a friend of Han.

407
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,900
Did I ask you?

408
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Jiang Xiaochuan.

409
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,900
Don't go too far.

410
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm not the one who said you were bad.

411
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,380
Jiang Xiaochuan.

412
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,380
What's the matter?

413
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,380
You're hitting me.

414
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
You're getting fat.

415
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,580
You dare to talk back to me?

416
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,740
Don't forget that I have your card in my hand.

417
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,420
You're so mean.

418
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,380
I don't want to see you now.

419
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,780
Get lost now.

420
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,780
You...

421
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
Jiang Xiaochuan.

422
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,780
I'll go first.

423
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,780
Take care.

424
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Let go.

425
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Wait.

426
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,460
Who lives here?

427
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,420
Don't you know that I don't like it?

428
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,780
I live here because I don't want to be seen by others.

429
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,780
It's Dasheng who let you live here, right?

430
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,460
What's your relationship with Dasheng?

431
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,380
We...

432
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,860
We're just friends.

433
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,860
Just friends.

434
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,980
I'm sorry.

435
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,380
I didn't know you don't like it when others live in your house.

436
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,100
I'll go and get something to eat now.

437
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
Dasheng.

438
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,420
I didn't want to agree to the meeting this time.

439
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,900
But the president is too enthusiastic.

440
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,100
I'm sorry to push him.

441
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,140
But now,

442
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,660
we can't go back to the New Year.

443
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,180
Will you blame me?

444
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,060
The president also told me about the meeting.

445
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,060
You did the right thing.

446
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,740
If you agree with me,

447
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,060
I'm relieved.

448
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,860
Hello?

449
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,620
Han, I can't reach Jiang Dan.

450
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,540
If you can reach her,

451
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,140
let her come to the hospital.

452
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Grandma Jiang is in the hospital.

453
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,460
Don't worry.

454
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,060
I'll come to the hospital right away.

455
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,580
Master, stop the car.

456
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,700
What's wrong, Dasheng? What happened?

457
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,180
Grandma Jiang is in the hospital.

458
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,300
I have to go and check.

459
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,580
What about the meeting?

460
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,060
You're experienced in the volunteer activity.

461
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,740
You're right this time.

462
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
Hey.

463
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,460
Master, the hospital in the center is getting better.

464
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,380
Monkey, did you see Jiang Dan at the house of the little aunt?

465
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,300
Jiang Dan?

466
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,620
She should still be at the house of Jiang Zhishan.

467
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,740
Hey, let me tell you.

468
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,900
Today, Jiang Zhishan suddenly came back.

469
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,220
She scared me.

470
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,980
Let me tell you.

471
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,260
Hello?

472
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
Han?

473
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,540
Hello, Dasheng?

474
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,820
Is Jiang Dan here?

475
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,700
Let her answer the phone.

476
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,620
She's not here.

477
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,140
Where did she go?

478
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Why don't you care about her?

479
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,820
You're just a little aunt.

480
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,020
You only care about others.

481
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,740
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,220
The number you have dialed is power off.

483
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Please redial later.

484
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,220
Is she angry because of the simple thing?

485
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Forget it.

486
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,220
I don't care.

487
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,220
Let's go to the hospital.

488
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,740
Miss Xiao, can you lend me your charger?

489
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,140
My phone is out of battery.

490
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
Okay.

491
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,860
Thank you.

492
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,740
Grandma fainted and is in the hospital.

493
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,740
I saw the message and came to the hospital.

494
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm sorry.

496
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,740
I'm sorry.

497
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,740
I'm sorry.

498
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,740
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,740
I'm sorry.

501
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
I'm sorry.

502
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,740
I saw the message and came to the hospital.

503
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,740
My charger.

504
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,740
I'm sorry.

505
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
Thank you.

506
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,740
Are you okay?

507
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,740
The doctor said it was a timely delivery.

508
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,740
She's safe for now.

509
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,740
Don't worry.

510
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,140
When is our sentence request?

511
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,740
Today at seven o'clock.

512
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,740
Start the break.

513
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Stop.

514
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,740
I want to drink.

515
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Yes.

516
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,540
Give me five minutes to pass out.

517
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Is she 세ел to be treated?

518
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,740
Is she hot?

519
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,540
Li Yan successfully recovered last year

520
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,660
and he'sth почему

521
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,500
being hospitalized for another few days.

522
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,540
You see,

523
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,100
he is still recovering.

524
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,700
Three years?!

525
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:28,780
You have three more years.

526
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,860
Winter!

527
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,580
Why did the baby grow this big?

528
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,860
Because I think

529
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,500
it's a sign that

530
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,140
he can't be hospitalized for the next 3 to 6 months.

531
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,460
Let me just ask for your advice.

532
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,580
After what?

533
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,300
Ask your family to pay the hospital bill.

534
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,820
I'll go.

535
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,580
Stay with Grandma.

536
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,020
No need.

537
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,780
After she wakes up,

538
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,420
she'll want to see you first.

539
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,620
Your boyfriend is so nice.

540
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,500
He's not my boyfriend.

541
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,980
He's here to chase you.

542
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,940
This handsome and considerate boy

543
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,020
has already agreed with me.

544
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,080
Don't worry about the hospital bill.

545
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,940
I'll get more money from you.

546
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,700
Okay.

547
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,460
I showed you my weapons.

548
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,220
How could you do that?

549
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,620
When we met today,

550
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,340
I'll pay you back the extra money.

551
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,860
Did my aunt

552
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,460
make it hard for you?

553
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,180
It's simple.

554
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,340
Grandma is awake.

555
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,620
Grandma,

556
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,100
are you feeling unwell?

557
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,380
I'll call the doctor.

558
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,500
I'm fine.

559
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
I'm glad you're worried, my child.

560
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
Where's Han?

561
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,140
You're here too.

562
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,260
Grandma,

563
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,940
are you okay?

564
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,460
Thanks to Dr. Han.

565
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
Otherwise, I don't know

566
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
what to do.

567
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,260
Sorry to trouble you again.

568
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,940
It's okay.

569
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,020
It's important that you're well.

570
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,380
I'll answer the phone.

571
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:43,580
Han is a good boy.

572
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:44,940
What?

573
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,540
Today...

574
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,220
is my election?

575
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,580
My son is there

576
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,500
at the hospital

577
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,980
to accompany us.

578
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,660
It must be very hard for him.

579
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:00,900
I'll let him

580
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,420
go home.

581
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,820
I'll spend the year with you.

582
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,220
We spent permeable years

583
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,380
in Shenmu Village in the past.

584
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,380
to make a big table

585
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,740
and many dishes

586
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,740
are all your favorites.

587
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,860
But this year,

588
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,460
we have to stay in the hospital

589
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,740
to celebrate the new year with Grandma.

590
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,220
I'm sorry for you, my child.

591
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,220
As long as I'm with Grandma,

592
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,140
I'll be happy wherever I go.

593
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,540
Good girl.

594
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,500
We can't

595
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,100
see fireworks for more than a decade.

596
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,100
It's okay.

597
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,100
When Grandma is better,

598
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,420
I'll buy you the best fireworks.

599
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,380
When the time comes,

600
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,140
call that kid here.

601
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,860
Okay.

602
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,780
You have no time to chat with kids?

603
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,300
I want to check out.

604
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:37,900
It's him.

605
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,580
You look better than yesterday

606
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,340
Say,

607
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,940
drainage

608
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,260
Drafting

609
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,020
you

610
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,080
ran away

611
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,540
When did I cry all day

612
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,740
I didn't want to die

613
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,580
Ran away

614
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,340
ask me out

615
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,140
Because you have costs

616
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
It's just the right time.

617
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Thank you.

618
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,140
Happy New Year.

619
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Happy New Year.

620
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,140
The sun is too bright.

621
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,140
The world is lost in the waves.

622
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Suddenly the sky is clear.

623
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Come in.

624
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Mi Fen.

625
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,140
Yes?

626
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
The empty bed inside.

627
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,140
Clean it up.

628
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
This semester,

629
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
new students will move in.

630
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Which professional auntie?

631
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
Is she also from our university?

632
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
No.

633
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,140
She is a fashion designer.

634
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
She is a senior than you.

635
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
She is a foreign student.

636
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
You guys clean it up quickly.

637
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
Leave a good impression to the new roommate.

638
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
I know, auntie.

639
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Bye bye.

640
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Who was that?

641
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
The dorm auntie downstairs.

642
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
She said there was a student

643
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
who was studying fashion design.

644
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
She wanted to help us clean up.

645
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
She wanted to help us clean up.

646
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,140
But...

647
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
But...

648
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
But...

649
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
I have an appointment with Yuan Sen.

650
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
I have an appointment with Yuan Sen.

651
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,140
We are going to have dinner together.

652
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
We are going to have dinner together.

653
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
I know.

654
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,140
I'll tell him.

655
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay.

656
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,140
The best one.

657
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
Bye bye.

658
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,140
I told Monkey to get my luggage for me.

659
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
Why are you here?

660
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
You don't know why?

661
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:45,140
I'm just curious what you did to Monkey.

662
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
Why is he so afraid of you?

663
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,140
This is the secret between me and him.

664
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
I have to report to him.

665
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
I'll leave the luggage to you.

666
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
So, Jiang Dan also lives here.

667
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,140
Ran Ran.

668
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
Are you back?

669
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Can you get me a jade bier?

670
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
I miss you.

671
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,140
Memories are too temporary.

672
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,140
It doesn't hurt or it doesn't heal.

673
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,140
But it's repeated over and over.

674
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Where should I start?

675
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,140
When we first met.

676
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
One look,

677
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,140
one word.

678
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
I haven't missed it.

679
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:37,140
My eyes are already wet.

680
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Red as a poem.

681
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,140
Those young days.

682
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:49,140
They are ordinary but interesting.

683
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
In the time,

684
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,140
the wind blows and the plum blossoms fall.

685
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Those broken pasts.

686
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,140
The vague names.

687
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
It's okay.

688
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,140
We once had each other.

689
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,140
Those young days.

690
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,140
They are ordinary but interesting.

691
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
In the time,

692
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,140
the promise becomes a lie.

693
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Those broken pasts.

694
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,140
They are ordinary but interesting.

695
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
In the time,

696
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:38,140
the wind blows and the plum blossoms fall.

697
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,140
Those broken pasts.

698
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,140
They are ordinary but interesting.

699
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,140
In the time,

700
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,140
the promise becomes a lie.

701
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,140
Those broken pasts.

702
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,140
They are ordinary but interesting.

703
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
In the time,
