00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,680
So it was all prepared for me.

15

Han Yansheng!

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,520
Say no more.

17
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,360
My answer is yes.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,131
What...

19
00:02:15,182 --> 00:02:16,640
Why has everything already started?

20
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:18,080
What if Yuan Sen shows up?

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,600
Help me redo everything now!

22
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,240
What do I do?

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
Jian Dan, hurry.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Help me stop the video!

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,840
We have to redo this place

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
before Yuan Sen gets here!

27
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:31,200
What does this have to do with Yuan Sen?

28
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:45,120
Did I come at a bad time?

29
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,240
What were you saying yes to just now?

30
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:57,040
Uh... yes to...

31
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
To help you redo the venue, of course.

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,320
But now that Yuan Sen's here,

33
00:03:01,377 --> 00:03:02,622
there's no need anymore, right?

34
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,160
Caught you!

35
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,200
Prince Luo Shui.

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,880
Should I call you Prince Luo Shui
or Yuan Sen?

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,400
I can't believe
Luo Shui is actually Yuan Sen.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
This is a huge scoop!

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,280
In any case,

40
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,680
you've always been my idol.

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,000
I feel so lucky

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,160
to be friends with you

43
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,480
in real life.

44
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,760
When I'm with you,

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,720
I'm really,

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,440
truly happy.

47
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,840
Me...

48
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,480
Don't say it.

49
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,400
No, let me finish.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,880
We might not have anything

51
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,440
in common

52
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,920
beyond cosplay.

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,040
But I really,

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
really like you.

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:01,760
Will...

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,560
Will you be my boyfriend?

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,520
I...

58
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:13,720
No pictures!

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,851
Oh, no. He spotted me!

60
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:18,600
Stop right there!

61
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,422
Darn it!

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,240
Stop! Don't run!

63
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:22,360
What happened?

64
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,360
It's Huo Zuyang.

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,149
He was secretly taking pictures
of Yuan Sen.

66
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,977
Quick, go after him!

67
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,240
(Yuan Sen?)

68
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,411
(Wasn't it Jian Dan
who confessed to Sheng?)

69
00:04:53,474 --> 00:04:55,497
I can't believe

70
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,200
that chubby Huo Zuyang runs so fast.

71
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,205
He vanished in seconds.

72
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,320
No wonder he's always the first

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,800
to know campus gossip.

74
00:05:04,382 --> 00:05:05,840
I worked so hard

75
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,817
to prepare for this moment.

76
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,360
It's all ruined

77
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,680
by that jerk Huo Zuyang.

78
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,114
I didn't even get
to hear Yuan Sen's answer.

79
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,960
Well then, just perform a divination

80
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,560
and see

81
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,800
if he said yes.

82
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,600
Seriously? You're joking now?

83
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,800
He's way out of your league.

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
Do you think you're good enough
for Luo Shui?

85
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,840
Is Luo Shui someone you can have?

86
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:39,605
Yue Tangtang, that is harsh.

87
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
I didn't say that.

88
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,160
I'm just reading

89
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:43,640
what the netizens said.

90
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,880
Unbelievable.

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,200
If this gets out,

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
Han is going to be a laughingstock.

93
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,360
It's already out.

94
00:06:15,634 --> 00:06:18,000
Only, people think it was Mi Fen
who confessed to Yuan Sen.

95
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,028
(Prince Luo Shui is actually Yuan Sen?)

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,914
(He kept that hidden so well!)

97
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
(I knew he didn't show his face)

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,844
(because he's too good-looking.)

99
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,468
(But who's that girl?)

100
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:33,377
(She's nowhere near good enough
for him!)

101
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,440
(She looks so ordinary.)

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,320
(No way she's his girlfriend.)

103
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,600
(I don't buy it.)

104
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,760
These keyboard warriors are the worst.

105
00:06:41,244 --> 00:06:43,020
It's bad enough to leak
Yuan Sen's identity.

106
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,390
But they're attacking Mi Fen too?

107
00:06:44,422 --> 00:06:45,311
Way over the line.

108
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
So, what are you going to do?

109
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,111
Clear things up.

110
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
(She's so ugly.)

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,822
(She dared to confess to Luo Shui?)

112
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,720
(Take a look at yourself in a mirror.)

113
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,040
(Seriously, stay away from Luo Shui.)

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,000
(You don't deserve him!)

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,844
(Totally unworthy!)

116
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,520
How did it come to this?

117
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:14,800
You think that's bad?

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,440
There's more.

119
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,400
Let me read.

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,457
"Some people just need a reality check.

121
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,280
Spare our Luo Shui, please.

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,160
Getting exposed
because of some ugly girl's confession."

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Stop reading!

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,311
You're just stirring the pot
at this point!

125
00:07:30,691 --> 00:07:31,485
Give it back.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
Luo Shui posted something online.

127
00:07:43,502 --> 00:07:45,040
Hi everyone, I'm Luo Shui.

128
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,400
I would like to clarify some
of the rumors and photos

129
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,311
that are circulating online.

130
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,851
My real name is Yuan Sen.

131
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,720
I'm an art student
at Ocean University.

132
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,680
I wore a mask all this time...

133
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,970
Because I didn't want too much attention

134
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,000
on my private life.

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,920
But now

136
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
that everyone knows

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,560
my identity,

138
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,600
I won't be hiding

139
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,600
behind this mask anymore.

140
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,440
As for the girl in the photo,

141
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,800
she's not my girlfriend.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,640
Because

143
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,933
I haven't been able
to confess to her yet.

144
00:08:33,942 --> 00:08:34,600
Lucky Koi Girl,

145
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,720
if you're watching this,

146
00:08:37,365 --> 00:08:38,325
come downstairs.

147
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm waiting outside your dorm

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,080
for your reply.

149
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
What are you waiting for?

150
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,000
Go! Go now!

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
Go downstairs now!

152
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,333
Mi Fen.

153
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,377
Will you be my girlfriend?

154
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,080
I do!

155
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,680
You're all here?

156
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,160
What's this?

157
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,066
The boss got inspired by Mi Fen

158
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:35,910
and came up with this confession promo.

159
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,680
Here's the flyer.

160
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,120
(Sweet Confession Day)

161
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Only 1314,

162
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
and you'll find true love?

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
You mean 1314 as in forever?

164
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,619
Your boss should have launched
this earlier.

165
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,590
Otherwise, Han wouldn't have had
to spend 800 yuan

166
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,840
to help Yuan Sen.

167
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,240
This only cost him 1314.

168
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:56,711
I'll pay you back the money.

169
00:10:59,131 --> 00:10:59,640
It's okay.

170
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:01,488
Just think of it as a gift from me.

171
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:04,160
Han, you're so stingy.

172
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,680
That's all you gave as a gift?

173
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:08,320
Yuan Sen, maybe you should just keep

174
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,280
that 800 yuan

175
00:11:09,822 --> 00:11:12,560
and use it to fund
Han's future confession instead.

176
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,360
I... I don't even have anyone
to confess to.

177
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,931
Didn't everyone say

178
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,444
Jian Dan was going to confess to you?

179
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,422
What? Are you not even a little tempted?

180
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,051
If she won't confess,

181
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,200
why don't you do it first?

182
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,240
Keep the flyer

183
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,280
and study it.

184
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:28,520
No, thanks.

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,240
Fine. If you won't read it,

186
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,288
I'll read it to you.

187
00:11:32,354 --> 00:11:33,920
Confessing your love is a sacred act.

188
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,133
There is a lot to consider.

189
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,000
First, choose a special day.

190
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,200
Before confessing,

191
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,933
test if the person likes you back.

192
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,520
Rule number one.

193
00:11:43,194 --> 00:11:44,337
If they pick up

194
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,600
your call right away,

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,960
that's a good sign.

196
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,640
Other people give gifts
in relationships.

197
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,720
You two only know
how to give fried chicken?

198
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,422
Isn't he afraid
of making you overweight?

199
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
Yuan Sen said

200
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:02,680
he likes me just the way I am.

201
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,160
Cute and chubby.

202
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,066
Ugh, I'm full just from that.

203
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:12,777
Hello?

204
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,160
Come to my office.

205
00:12:15,337 --> 00:12:16,320
Do you need something?

206
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,440
Yeah, a small favor.

207
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,644
I'm headed to the Swimming Club.

208
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,088
How did you get ketchup

209
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,240
on your pants?

210
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:35,066
I was supposed to wear this for a shoot.

211
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:36,066
Take this and change.

212
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,200
What do you need help with?

213
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:56,920
(Every time before they see you,)

214
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,800
(they will always change
into something nice.)

215
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,390
(Something that's not
their usual style.)

216
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,971
I ordered an extra box.

217
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,377
Can you help me finish it?

218
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,108
If you don't eat it,

219
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:09,782
I'll have to throw it away.

220
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,360
Don't throw it out.

221
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:13,502
It's wasteful.

222
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:38,960
(Rule number three.)

223
00:13:39,022 --> 00:13:40,711
(When they are around
someone they like,)

224
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,680
(they will be extra careful
of their appearance)

225
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:43,955
(and even how they move.)

226
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,685
Mi Fen hasn't eaten yet.

227
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:57,880
Can I pack this up
and share it with her?

228
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,600
Up to you.

229
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Here, take it.

230
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:19,440
No, thanks.

231
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,133
No, you eat it.

232
00:14:20,155 --> 00:14:20,822
I've had enough.

233
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,244
I'm off fried chicken for a week.

234
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,040
I had too much today.

235
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,742
First, your treat.

236
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,240
Then Han Yansheng's treat.

237
00:14:27,355 --> 00:14:29,040
I definitely need
to walk this off later.

238
00:14:30,594 --> 00:14:31,240
Jian Dan,

239
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,800
that skirt looks great on you.

240
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:35,040
If I hadn't spilled ketchup on my pants

241
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,900
while eating chicken,
I wouldn't be wearing it.

242
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,822
I let you wear it,
and you're being picky? I...

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,920
Jian Dan.

244
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
You left your phone in my office.

245
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,800
Thanks.

246
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,720
Excuse me!

247
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,822
This isn't a sports field!

248
00:14:58,822 --> 00:15:00,466
It's dangerous to play volleyball here!

249
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:01,511
(The last)

250
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,194
(and most important rule.)

251
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,800
(Someone who truly likes you)

252
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,888
(will always put you before themselves.)

253
00:15:19,488 --> 00:15:21,839
(What kind of gift
do you give someone you like?)

254
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,909
(Little Turtle)

255
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,679
(Roses)

256
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,644
(Lipsticks)

257
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,240
A little turtle

258
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,480
to symbolize a love that lasts forever.

259
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,560
Rose tea made

260
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,280
from 999 roses.

261
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,560
They are pretty and practical.

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
Lipstick is irresistible

263
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,880
to most girls.

264
00:15:41,914 --> 00:15:44,200
And if she's a studious type,

265
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,520
a lipstick-shaped USB drive
is perfect...

266
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,720
What's up?

267
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,342
New Year's Day is coming.

268
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,080
You remember our annual party, right?

269
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:02,354
Of course.

270
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,480
Let's invite more people this year.

271
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,480
Who do you have in mind?

272
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Yuan Sen's girlfriend, Mi Fen,

273
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,640
and her roommates.

274
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:16,160
You mean Jian Dan?

275
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,288
The more, the merrier.

276
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,440
Okay, I'll ask them.

277
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,565
Han, registration

278
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,320
for this year's
city swimming competition is now open.

279
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,040
Are you in?

280
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,668
No.

281
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,280
Come on, give it a shot.

282
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:34,066
Stop pushing.

283
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,688
I'm not doing it.

284
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
It looks like

285
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
Sheng still hasn't gotten over

286
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,640
Nan Yuan.

287
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,320
Yeah.

288
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
They used to win

289
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,520
every swim competition together.

290
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,000
Now, every time he competes,

291
00:16:50,044 --> 00:16:51,266
he's reminded of Nan Yuan.

292
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,080
It must be hard on him.

293
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,720
Hi, is this the silver workshop?

294
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,560
I would like to have
a custom-made pendant.

295
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:10,257
Okay.

296
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,920
I'll head over now.

297
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,600
Jian Dan, come with me.

298
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,320
Fine, I'll go.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,022
Jian Dan.

300
00:17:21,828 --> 00:17:23,200
- Entong.
- Hi, Entong.

301
00:17:23,822 --> 00:17:24,960
Sheng wants to invite you

302
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,400
to join us for the New Year's party.

303
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,520
Are you free?

304
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,680
Of course!
Yuan Sen has already invited me.

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,520
We'll go together.

306
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:34,782
Come on, just go!

307
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,160
Okay, okay.

308
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,480
By the way,

309
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,200
what are you getting
Han Yansheng for New Year's?

310
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
Last time, he covered the 800 yuan

311
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,560
at the café.

312
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,466
Now, he's inviting you to the party.

313
00:17:45,466 --> 00:17:47,177
Shouldn't you give him
something in return?

314
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,200
That 800 yuan

315
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:49,862
was for helping clean the pool.

316
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,680
No, it wasn't.

317
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,160
Yuan Sen already told me the truth.

318
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,457
He said the club members

319
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:54,560
take turns cleaning.

320
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,840
There's no need to hire anyone.

321
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
Han Yansheng paid for that himself.

322
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,200
Trust me.

323
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,417
He definitely likes...

324
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't talk nonsense.

325
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,440
It's Yuan Sen.

326
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,742
Hello. Okay.

327
00:18:11,234 --> 00:18:12,800
Okay, I'll see you later.

328
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:17,800
Sheng has always been the type
to help others.

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
Besides, this matter

330
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,885
concerns Yuan Sen's happiness.

331
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:22,760
So of course, he stepped up.

332
00:18:26,782 --> 00:18:28,600
But he spends so much time worrying

333
00:18:28,811 --> 00:18:30,280
about other people.

334
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,080
But he never bothers

335
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,080
about himself.

336
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:38,640
What do you mean?

337
00:18:39,622 --> 00:18:40,840
The city's swimming competition

338
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,880
is coming up.

339
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:44,360
But Sheng hasn't signed up.

340
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,160
He was a star swimmer.

341
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:50,680
After

342
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,022
what happened last year,

343
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:56,720
he no longer swims

344
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,291
or participates in any competitions.

345
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:05,291
What exactly happened

346
00:19:05,948 --> 00:19:07,680
back then?

347
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
That day,

348
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
it was windy

349
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:15,480
and the waves were rough.

350
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,840
But for some reason,

351
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,788
Sheng insisted on getting in the water.

352
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:22,537
Then he almost drowned.

353
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:24,480
I was the one who saved him.

354
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:28,200
Since that time,

355
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,017
he appears

356
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,965
to be traumatized by water.

357
00:19:37,337 --> 00:19:39,920
You're a psychology major, right?

358
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:42,171
Maybe you'll know what to do.

359
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,880
Besides, you're close with Sheng.

360
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,280
If you talk to him,

361
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
he might actually listen to you.

362
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,000
Entong,

363
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,000
why don't you talk to him?

364
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:54,760
Didn't you say

365
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:57,840
you were the most important person
in his life?

366
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,920
I've tried everything

367
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,000
I could think of.

368
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,040
Nothing worked.

369
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,720
He might not listen to me either.

370
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,600
Besides,

371
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:22,240
I don't even know what to say.

372
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,440
Well, I've got an idea.

373
00:20:25,497 --> 00:20:26,377
Maybe

374
00:20:26,457 --> 00:20:27,411

of his past competitions,

376
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,333
it'll remind him of his passion.

377
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,308
I've put together a video

378
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,422
of all the times he won.

379
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,000
Everything is in here.

380
00:20:55,022 --> 00:20:56,320
- See you, President.
- Bye-bye.

381
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,377
Bye-bye, President.

382
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,920
Bye-bye.

Don't drop it.

405
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,320
I know. Stop nagging.

406
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Can I put it here?

407
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,920
Yeah, put it here.

408
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,640
I'll put it here.

409
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,680
Let me help you with that.

410
00:23:37,688 --> 00:23:38,288
Hello!

411
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,320
You're here.

412
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,840
Sit here.

413
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,480
Take a seat.

414
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,320
Okay, everyone. Sit down!

415
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Before we eat,

416
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,880
let's play a little game.

417
00:23:54,888 --> 00:23:55,911
- Sounds good.
- I'm in.

418
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:57,266
What game are we playing?

419
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,131
I bought some New Year's gifts

420
00:24:01,171 --> 00:24:02,222
for everyone online.

421
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,320
There's a little card

422
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
inside each one.

423
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,720
Just follow the instructions

424
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,960
on your card

425
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,955
to complete the task.

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,755
Pass them out.

427
00:24:10,555 --> 00:24:11,311
Here you go.

428
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,040
I'll go first!

429
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,160
Okay, I'll read mine.

430
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,600
Okay.

431
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:26,866
"Be princess-carried by someone
of the opposite sex and do five squats."

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,000
I didn't realize it would be this kind
of game when I bought them.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,200
How about we forget about it?

434
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:34,920
- No way!
- No skipping!

435
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,960
Come on!

436
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,737
No excuses!

437
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,200
Yuan Sen! Go, Yuan Sen!

438
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:46,994
One, two, three,

439
00:24:47,188 --> 00:24:49,120
four, and five!

440
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,960
Unreal.

441
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:53,880
If you ask me,

442
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,188
these aren't gifts

443
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,000
or cards.

444
00:24:56,044 --> 00:24:57,390
These are classic couple missions.

445
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,817
Let's see mine.

446
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,680
See? More classic couple mission.

447
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,933
What does it say? Let me see.

448
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,520
"Perform a girl group dance."

449
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,266
I don't know any girl group dances!

450
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,333
- Come on, dance.
- It's okay if you don't know any.

451
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,710
You can watch a video as you dance.

452
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:22,120
That's right! Music, please!

453
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:24,988
Help!

454
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,188
Help me!

455
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Come on, dance!

456
00:25:29,844 --> 00:25:31,280
You can watch this and follow along.

457
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:33,280
Jian Dan, if your mission
ends up being too much,

458
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,490
I'm definitely getting revenge.

459
00:25:34,628 --> 00:25:36,040
Dance first, then we'll talk.

460
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,800
Dance! Dance!

461
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,000
Dance!

462
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,800
Music.

463
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,440
- Way to go, Xiahou Ling!
- Xiahou Ling, awesome!

464
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,280
Monkey! Monkey!

465
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,240
- You're awesome, Xiahou Ling!
- Xiahou Ling!

466
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,000
Stop!

467
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,680
It is Jian Dan's turn now!

468
00:26:37,933 --> 00:26:38,920
Come here. Let me see it.

469
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,400
No way!

470
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,480
Give it to me! Let me see!

471
00:26:42,188 --> 00:26:43,040
Mi Fen, check it!

472
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,200
Have you had your first kiss yet?

473
00:26:52,555 --> 00:26:54,000
Jian Dan, don't tell me your first

474
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,862
kiss was that upside-down one

475
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,657
with Han.

476
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,320
Why do I have to answer two questions?

477
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:03,360
That's not fair.

478
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,520
Could it be...

479
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,400
Let me check yours, Han.

480
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,220
(Kiss the person on your left or right.)

481
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:20,320
Kiss the person on your left or right?

482
00:27:22,811 --> 00:27:23,651
Whoa!

483
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,840
That's wild, Han!

484
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,680
Take your pick! Take your pick!

485
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,222
I choose Jian Dan.

486
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,440
- Kiss! Kiss!
- Come on, kiss!

487
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,560
But

488
00:27:48,594 --> 00:27:50,548
if I wanted to kiss,
it wouldn't be here!

489
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,777
Han, are you chickening out?

490
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,200
What a killjoy!

491
00:28:06,525 --> 00:28:07,417
Wait for a moment.

492
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:22,600
Jian Dan,

493
00:28:23,891 --> 00:28:24,640
there's something

494
00:28:25,244 --> 00:28:26,511
I've been meaning to say

495
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:28,400
for a long time.

496
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,840
(Is he seriously going to kiss me?)

497
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:40,000
(I'm not ready for this!)

498
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,680
Jian Dan.

499
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,074
I prepared this as a gift for you
for the New Year.

500
00:29:10,554 --> 00:29:11,742
Do you remember the day

501
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,266
you broke your goggles by the pool?

502
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:14,788
I bought you a new pair.

503
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,268
No matter

504
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,466
why you gave up swimming,

505
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,125
I hope you can find your dream

506
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,200
and continue swimming.

507
00:29:39,634 --> 00:29:40,840
Who do you think you are?

508
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:46,111
Who are you to talk about my dreams?

509
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:50,800
Stay out of my business.

510
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,440
Han Yansheng!

511
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,268
