1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Grow up gently

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,800
She is a flower that has fallen into the incense

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Will you be afraid?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Tipadiya

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is popular

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only imagination

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt into the heart

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Tipadiya

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you are beautiful

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Love is not complicated

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Love by Hypnotic

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 10

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,600
Hello, Jiang Zhizhen, where are you?

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,400
Hello?

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm behind you.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,400
Jiang Zhizhen

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Shan Shan, can you not leave?

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
I can't.

22
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I promised to participate in the climbing competition.

23
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I can't break the promise.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Climbing competition?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
Yes, I have received the invitation

26
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
of the international climbing competition.

27
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,000
This time, I went out to participate in the competition.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,840
the coach I hired

30
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,040
was the one you met Jason last time.

31
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
What's in your hand?

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,960
Nothing.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,840
Nothing.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,600
Nothing.

35
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,560
Well...

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,720
When did you go to shoot?

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,640
Well...

38
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,520
Sorry.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,840
Take a group photo for me.

40
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,640
The faster, the better.

41
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,360
It hurts.

42
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm ready.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,080
Let's start.

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,600
Let's start.

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,840
Let me show you some poses.

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,760
Is it enough?

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,960
Say something.

48
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
It's enough.

49
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,080
Let's start.

50
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,840
Hurry up.

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,120
One, two, three.

52
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,560
One, two, three.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
One, two, three.

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
One, two, three.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
One, two, three.

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,880
Leave these cards to you.

57
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,320
You've been in charge for a long time.

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,800
How about

59
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,840
I leave

60
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,760
these cards to you?

61
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
You said

62
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,760
you were not allowed to go back on your word.

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,600
I won't go back on my word.

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
So boring...

65
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,280
Sang twitched,

66
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,160
Porter is in the back.

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,280
I'm a little Maybelline.

68
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,640
It is called Baby hippo.

69
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
Since the old Jiang left,

70
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,080
Masik's Backup single has become more free,

71
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
so boring.

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:12,760
water.

73
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,120
Han Ansheng's situation.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,280
I want to recommend Han Ansheng

75
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,400
to see if there's any help for him.

76
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
I can help him regain his confidence.

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,960
Believe in yourself.

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,960
You can do it.

79
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
What are you doing?

81
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,320
Come and watch it with me.

82
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,480
Then tell me how you feel.

83
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Okay.

84
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,120
Let's see.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,520
Just the two of us.

86
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
Go and skip the question.

87
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,440
Okay.

88
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
Xia Hong Lin, are you a pig?

89
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm almost out of blood.

90
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Why don't you help me?

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,120
Coming.

92
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,520
Han Ansheng,

93
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,920
I've prepared a very nice movie for you.

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
It suits you.

95
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,960
Remember to watch it.

96
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,400
Okay.

97
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Han,

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,040
come back tomorrow.

99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll pick him up.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,640
Okay.

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,040
I recommended you a movie last night.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,840
Did you watch it?

103
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,960
I was a little tired last night.

104
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
I fell asleep early.

105
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,960
I didn't have time to watch it.

106
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,040
That movie is really nice.

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,960
You must watch it.

108
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,320
Monkey,

109
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,600
I've prepared a gift for you.

110
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,960
Thank you, An Tong.

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,960
You'll definitely need it.

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,000
Really? Let me see.

113
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
You're so considerate.

114
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,240
An Tong is back.

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,960
Qi Tian just came back.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,400
The Crown Prince went to pick him up.

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,880
I brought you a gift.

118
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
It's just a normal handwritten letter.

119
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
I brought it to everyone.

120
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Take it.

121
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,480
Thank you, Senior.

122
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,560
Your Highness,

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,800
this is a gift for you.

124
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,200
I know you like coffee cups,

125
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,360
so I picked it for you.

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,760
You'll definitely like it.

127
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,840
I like everything you sent me.

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,480
What's going on between you two?

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,240
You're not getting married behind my back, are you?

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,520
Don't talk nonsense.

131
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,680
Don't talk nonsense.

132
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I'm going to the studio.

133
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,960
Bye.

134
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,760
I recommend Han Yan Sheng to watch a movie

135
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,120
called Heart-Restorers.

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,840
The male lead in it

137
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,120
is also a seriously ill patient after being injured.

138
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,960
He was abandoned and tortured since he was a child.

139
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,080
So he became

140
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,760
selfish and inferior.

141
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,640
He thought his girlfriend didn't love him

142
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,680
and wanted to leave him and break up with him.

143
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,200
Eventually, he was cured by a university professor

144
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,400
and then he went back to his girlfriend

145
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,040
and started a new life.

146
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,240
I want to encourage Han Yan Sheng

147
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,680
through this movie.

148
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,960
But he didn't watch it at all.

149
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,480
He was also very emotional.

150
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Should I stop making things difficult for him?

151
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,800
Just give up on the treatment.

152
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,120
Jiang Dan,

153
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,040
did you see Sheng?

154
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,400
I went to the swimming club to find him,

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,320
but he wasn't there.

156
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,960
Do you know where he went?

157
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,040
I didn't see him.

158
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,520
I wanted to give him my resignation letter.

159
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

160
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,760
I decided to resign from the position of swimming club manager

161
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,680
and put more time and energy

162
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,240
into my own profession.

163
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,680
It's simple.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,960
I've made a lot of mistakes in the past

165
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
and caused a lot of misunderstandings

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,760
between you and Sheng.

167
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,480
I think it's necessary to officially apologize to you.

168
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,120
I hope you can forgive me.

170
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Of course,

171
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,160
it doesn't matter if you don't forgive me.

172
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,760
My only wish now

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
is that you can help Sheng

174
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,120
get out of that thing that's so hard for him.

175
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,240
So that I can feel a little less guilty.

176
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,560
Don't worry.

177
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,600
I will.

178
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,960
I'll go find him somewhere else.

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,640
Bye.

180
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
Maybe

181
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,600
I should give up on him.

182
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,680
I don't care if he can swim.

183
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,080
I don't mind.

184
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,200
As long as he can live happily,

185
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,280
I don't care what he does.

186
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,040
Girls, I'm back.

187
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
Come on.

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Come on.

189
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,680
I'm so happy for you.

190
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,160
Come on.

191
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,920
I brought you all a gift.

192
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,280
Ye Dan, this is for you.

193
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,160
This is for you.

194
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,480
Rice cake, little princess.

195
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,040
This is for you.

196
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Moon Soup.

197
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
This is for you.

198
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,840
I have it too.

199
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,480
Thank you.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,120
How is it? Do you like it?

201
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
I love it.

202
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,520
I'll take it for free.

203
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
By the way, Jindan.

204
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,240
When the monkey came to pick me up at the airport,

205
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,400
he said that Gu Wentong is back.

206
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,360
He told me to stay away from him.

207
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,520
He's not going to be angry again.

208
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,600
I found that he was different

209
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
from the previous time he came back.

210
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,160
The country is different, the heart is different.

211
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
You'd better be careful.

212
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,200
By the way, how is Dasheng doing?

213
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
He's not doing well lately.

214
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,000
He seems to be a bit resistant to treatment.

215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,120
It's okay.

216
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,840
Take your time.

217
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
He'll get better.

218
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,760
I'll pack up my luggage.

219
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,120
I'll go.

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Han.

221
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,000
Han went to the music classroom.

222
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,640
Wait.

223
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,000
What's in your hand?

224
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Breakfast.

225
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
I forgot to tell you.

226
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
Han has a habit.

227
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,640
He likes to study in an empty house.

228
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
I think you should...

229
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,480
Haisheng,

230
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,360
no MS.

231
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,800
.

232
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,860
A while ago,

233
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,980
we are in a music conference.

234
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,000
We met the master

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,580
of psychological therapy

236
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,660
and research on music.

237
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,560
This is the song that sheוםed

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,520
that hesch in particular for you.

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
I wonder

240
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,640
whether it will help you if you get sleep.

241
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,200
This song

242
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
rooms you in peace of mind.

243
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,240
But I'm in a special situation.

244
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,360
I'm not that effective.

245
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
But thank you all.

246
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,240
I guess my music is not good enough.

247
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,200
The master will have a music exhibition in a few days.

248
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,800
How about we go to the venue and listen to it?

249
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Just take it as a relief.

250
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,240
It's simple.

251
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's go together, okay?

252
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,520
Okay, let's start.

253
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,240
Can you do it, Shao Tong?

254
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,280
It's simple.

255
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,520
The rock wall of our troupe is too old.

256
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's have a look at it next week.

257
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
What are you thinking about?

258
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,400
Are you calling Han Yansheng?

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,360
No.

260
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,040
You still say no?

261
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,440
You've been watching your phone for a day

262
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,000
after a day of training.

263
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,000
What's wrong?

264
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,080
Did you have a fight?

265
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,760
No.

266
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,280
Maybe I'm overthinking.

267
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,680
If you have any misunderstanding, ask him.

268
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,320
Don't think too much.

269
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,120
I'll call him for you.

270
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,600
Jin Dan, come to my office.

271
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,520
ceğiz

272
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,680
Han.

273
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,000
You love it, don't you?

274
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,840
You daily give me breakfast.

275
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,900
Breakfast?

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,080
I gave it to you in the Clinic room.

277
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,280
Haven't you seen it?

278
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,920
No.

279
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
You're talking to him體

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm leaving.

281
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,080
The monkey said

282
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,560
you sent me breakfast

283
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,520
in the music classroom this morning.

284
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,800
Where's the breakfast?

285
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
You're already full after listening to the music.

286
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,160
What breakfast are you eating?

287
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,800
You saw it?

288
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,280
Why didn't you call me?

289
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,760
I don't want to disturb

290
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,040
your two-man world.

291
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,160
The piano that En Tong prepared for me

292
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,120
is really good.

293
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,600
You studied psychology.

294
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,840
You should know

295
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,120
music therapy.

296
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,960
You think it's good?

297
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,720
Then you'll find someone to treat you.

298
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,840
Fine.

299
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,240
Don't be jealous.

300
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,680
In the morning,

301
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
the lion called me.

302
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,120
He's also at the scene.

303
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,160
It's not the two-man world you think it is.

304
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,280
The lion is also there?

305
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,720
If you don't believe me,

306
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,320
call him to confirm it.

307
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,560
Then it's not necessary.

308
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,120
Anyway, it's not necessary.

309
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,000
It's for you.

310
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,440
What's this?

311
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,480
A dress.

312
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Let's see it when we get back to the dorm.

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,160
Why did you give me a dress?

314
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:32,920
En Tong said

315
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
she invited us to go to the concert

316
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,520
on the weekend.

317
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,680
The three of us together?

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,680
The lion also went.

319
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,400
I remember.

320
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,960
I didn't lock the door of the dorm.

321
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,800
I'll go and have a look.

322
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,040
I've been looking forward to

323
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,360
this concert for a long time.

324
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,480
It will be very exciting later.

325
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,640
Where's the lion?

326
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,640
Why hasn't he come yet?

327
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,680
The lion just called

328
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,920
and said he would arrive later.

329
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,200
Let's go in first.

330
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,440
Go.

331
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,040
Senior.

332
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,520
Your hairpin.

333
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,920
How did it get here?

334
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,640
I don't know.

335
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
I just got it.

336
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,480
What's wrong with your hairpin?

337
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,320
It's broken.

338
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,680
Yan Er, you're really...

339
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,680
It's okay.

340
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,840
Take mine.

341
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,120
No, no.

342
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:25,800
It's simple.

343
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,680
It's okay.

344
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,200
Okay.

345
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:32,920
Thank you.

346
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,960
Okay. Let's go in.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,440
Go.

348
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
The sun is going to rise.

349
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,400
Be careful not to catch a cold.

350
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,920
You too.

351
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,400
Let's go.

352
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm not cold.

353
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,880
Let's go together.

354
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,640
Hello.

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,600
Hello.

356
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,280
We have a seat in the front row.

357
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,200
May I change the seat with you?

358
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,680
I want to sit with my boyfriend.

359
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,280
But I also want to sit with my boyfriend.

360
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,960
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,680
I'm sorry.

362
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,280
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,800
I'm sorry.

364
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm sorry.

365
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm sorry.

368
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm sorry.

369
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,400
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm sorry.

371
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,920
Okay.

372
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Sorry, I'm late.

374
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,320
Come on.

375
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,120
It's about to start.

376
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,560
I'll get it for you.

377
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,920
I'm sorry.

378
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm sorry.

379
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm sorry.

380
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I'm sorry.

382
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
I'm sorry.

383
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
I'm sorry.

384
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I'm sorry.

386
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
I'm sorry.

388
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm sorry.

389
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
I'm sorry.

390
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
I'm sorry.

391
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
I'm sorry.

392
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,520
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
I'm sorry.

394
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
I'm sorry.

395
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
I'm sorry.

396
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I'm sorry.

399
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
I'm sorry.

403
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm sorry.

405
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,520
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
Thank you.

412
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,040
Have they allowed you to search your phone?

413
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,800
How would you know?

414
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,980
W idioms.

415
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,540
To get the sound to your sender.

416
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,840
Only an hour?

417
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,020
Where does the sound come from?

418
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Shifu,

419
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,680
is this the don't-so-larger-sassy moment

420
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,480
that you felt

421
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
for her realm in the beginning?

422
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,880
It's a miracle.

423
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,240
You have her in you all along.

424
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,340
No, you're wrong.

425
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
and the beautiful and peaceful atmosphere in the middle.

426
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,760
In the end,

427
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
it's cheerful and cheerful.

428
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,600
It's a great song.

429
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,760
Right?

430
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,080
That composer

431
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
is definitely a genius of music.

432
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,520
When did you start to

433
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,640
study music so much?

434
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,800
Isn't music

435
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,480
useful for your illness?

436
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
As your girlfriend,

437
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,600
I should make up for it.

438
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,880
Mr. Han and I will leave now.

439
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,120
I won't bother you two.

440
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,600
Okay.

441
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,920
I'll send you back.

442
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,240
Let's go.

443
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,720
Mr. Han and I will leave now.

444
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
I'll send you back.

445
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,080
Okay.

446
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,560
The work is almost done.

447
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's go to have dinner.

448
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,920
Let's go.

449
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
Let's go.

450
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,120
Jiannan, let's go.

451
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,720
Okay.

452
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,640
Wait.

453
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I forgot to take my phone.

454
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,640
You go first.

455
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,200
Okay.

456
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,480
Jiannan.

457
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,560
I'm here to pay you back.

458
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
It's all thanks to you.

459
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,960
It's nothing.

460
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,520
You're just waiting for me to have dinner.

461
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,840
If there's nothing else,

462
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,960
I'll go first.

463
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,240
I'm leaving too.

464
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,120
Let's go together.

465
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll go first, Jiannan.

466
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,560
Bye.

467
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,200
Bye, Jiannan.

468
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,400
Your psychological assessment result is not ideal.

469
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,520
But don't be too sad.

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,080
After all, there are still many cases to cure.

471
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,280
Thank you, Doctor.

472
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,080
Is it good?

473
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,080
Today's dinner is so delicious.

474
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,480
Okay, next time, I'll change it.

475
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,520
Okay.

476
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,960
All of you, go to have dinner.

477
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,560
Okay.

478
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,080
Okay.

479
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,640
Okay.

480
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,240
Okay.

481
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:08,800
Okay.

482
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,400
Okay.

483
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,960
Okay.

484
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,960
Everyone, go to prepare for the afternoon training.

485
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,040
Go change your clothes first.

486
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,160
Okay.

487
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,880
It's really delicious to have dinner together.

488
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,480
Okay.

489
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,200
Why is it not like before?

490
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,160
The illness has become worse.

491
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Maybe it won't get better.

492
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,920
I feel the so-called confusion and helplessness.

493
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,840
Maybe I should give up.

494
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,960
Tell him I don't love him.

495
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,680
Break up with him.

496
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,760
The illness has become worse.

497
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,680
Maybe it won't get better.

498
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,920
I feel the so-called confusion and helplessness.

499
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,920
Maybe I should give up.

500
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,000
Tell him I don't love him.

501
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,720
Break up with him.

502
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm waiting for my friend's birthday.

503
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:10,840
Come on, let's go.

504
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,680
And drink, too.

505
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,840
My video log.

506
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,680
Actually I thought it was gone.

507
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,560
The illness has become worse.

508
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,400
Maybe it won't get better.

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I'm not going to let you go.

510
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
You said

511
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,280
what happened inside.

512
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,920
Yes.

513
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
I see.

514
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,080
So that's what you think.

515
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
What do you mean?

516
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,880
Why are you so angry?

517
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,960
Did I misunderstand everything?

518
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,200
Han Shang.

519
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,280
I want to talk to you about the recording.

520
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
I knew you cared about me.

521
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,320
Please stop following me.

522
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,880
Drive.

523
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,520
Okay, let's start the class.

524
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,480
Get ready.

525
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,160
One.

526
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,840
Two.

527
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,680
One.

528
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,440
Two.

529
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,160
One.

530
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:01,880
Two.

531
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,280
One.

532
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,240
Han, the list is here.

533
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,720
The swimming club has rules

534
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,480
that no one is allowed to enter or leave the swimming pool.

535
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Monkey,

536
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,800
ask him out.

537
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,160
It's different from the list.

538
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,400
He...

539
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,000
You're not following the rules.

540
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,320
You'll be punished too.

541
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,360
Continue.

542
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,120
One.

543
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,440
One.

544
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,600
Two.

545
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,200
One.

546
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,080
Two.

547
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,440
One.

548
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,120
Two.

549
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,360
One.

550
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,120
Two.

551
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,040
Han.

552
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
What's going on between you and Han?

553
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,960
I want to know what's going on.

554
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,600
He's been hiding from me.

555
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,760
He didn't even give me a chance to talk.

556
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,400
Han is like that.

557
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,960
He made the decision.

558
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,840
No one can persuade him.

559
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,560
But I think

560
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,800
you don't have to worry.

561
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,760
The so-called three bad guys are the best.

562
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,720
I'll call the big knife over

563
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
and find a way for you.

564
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,000
Han.

565
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,320
Jin Dan,

566
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,560
think about it.

567
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,960
When did Han suddenly become like this?

568
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,160
He...

569
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,680
He was very angry after hearing the recording.

570
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,520
I think it's because he didn't like the recording.

571
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,960
I want to explain it to him.

572
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,880
But he didn't want to see me.

573
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,360
What recording?

574
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
The recording that recorded his condition.

575
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,440
The recording pen is still here.

576
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
The pen is broken.

577
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,200
Broken?

578
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,800
Can you fix it?

579
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,280
I'll try.

580
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,440
I need some time.

581
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,640
What should I do now?

582
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,000
I want to explain it to him.

583
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,400
But he didn't give me a chance.

584
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,840
I hate it when two people fight

585
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,840
and one of them explains something

586
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,760
that I can't hear.

587
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,840
What era is this?

588
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,440
You're playing with this kind of old idol.

589
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
You're playing with this kind of old idol.

590
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,400
You're playing with this kind of old idol.

591
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,840
In my opinion,

592
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,920
Han Yansheng can explain it to you

593
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,720
in the simplest way.

594
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,920
I have an idea.

595
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,880
Shizi, Yuan San,

596
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,600
let's bring Old Han here.

597
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,440
It's not good.

598
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
Isn't it too simple?

599
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,440
It's too simple.

600
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,200
You can think of it.

601
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Then you tell me.

602
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
I have an idea.

603
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,040
You can think of it.

604
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,840
You can think of it.

605
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,880
But you tell me on a sl clamp buddy.

606
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,680
Dr. Li Meng,

607
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,160
are you a expert in PTSD that always searches for answers?

608
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,400
With your judgement,

609
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,480
how high is my rec Patient-review?

610
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Alright,

611
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
thank you.

612
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,200

613
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,720
Did you see called by his teacher's phone

614
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,880
or your boss' phone call?

615
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,480
Or did he send you a letter via text?

616
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,560
Dade,

617
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,520
I've checked all the Pak哇 Line websites online.

618
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,480
You're doing this yourself.

619
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,520
Wait a minute.

620
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:47,840
Was it him?

621
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,400
Your dad.

622
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,520

623
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,240

624
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,480
Monkey

625
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,840
Where are you is everyone

626
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,000
We'll be there soon.

627
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,920
Wait for a while.

628
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,800
Jin Dan,

629
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,680
Han is inside.

630
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,320
Go in.

631
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,200
Hurry up, Jin Dan.

632
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,760
Take this opportunity

633
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,840
to talk to him.

634
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,720
Go.

635
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,240
Go for it.

636
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,960
Go.

637
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,280
According to your report,

638
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,880
the situation is not optimistic.

639
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,280
To heal the emergency after a injury,

640
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,400
you must rely on your willpower.

641
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,560
First,

642
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,640
you have to overcome the psychological obstacles.

643
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,800
You have to let yourself go.

644
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,680
Otherwise,

645
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,600
during the treatment,

646
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,320
you may be anxious,

647
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,160
irritable

648
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,640
or even depressed.

649
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,040
In extreme cases,

650
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,360
you may have a suicide or a life-threatening condition.

651
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,840
Your Hospital Area

652
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,640
My name is still good

653
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:03,640
We used to have each other

654
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Those young days are gone

655
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Heartache is not needed to be delayed

656
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:16,640
But one day the promise becomes a luxury

657
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,640
Those broken pasts

658
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,640
Love never changes for a lifetime

659
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Life is colored with paint
