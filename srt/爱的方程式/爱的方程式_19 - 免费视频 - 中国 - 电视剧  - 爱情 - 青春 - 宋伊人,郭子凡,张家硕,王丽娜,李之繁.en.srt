Want to catch a movie?

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,640
I'm heading back to the dorm to rest.

17
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,320
Are you not feeling well again?

18
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,640
I...

19
00:01:59,088 --> 00:02:00,980
I suddenly lost
my vision completely just now.

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,960
I feel dizzy.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,600
Take me to the office
so I can rest for a bit.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,320
All right.

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
Is it really that bad

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,960
that she needs someone to help her walk?

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,520
Come on.

26
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,960
I'm fine, Sheng.

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,480
Go do your thing.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
I'll be fine once I take my pills.

29
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:44,965
- Entong. See you.
- Goodbye.

(Vitamin C Tablets)

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,320
Well?

32
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:52,560
Feel much better after a bath?

33
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,400
You're back.

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Yue Tangtang slept early today.

35
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,360
She wasn't feeling well during the day.

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,200
Yeah.

37
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:02,080
I just got back from a club activity.

38
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,844
She was already lying down
when I came back.

39
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,120
Yue Tangtang has a fever.

40
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,520
We have to take her to the hospital.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll go with you.

42
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:14,520
Me too.

43
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:16,440
Come on. We'll get you to the hospital.

44
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,644
Appendicitis is a routine surgery.

45
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:29,840
We'll monitor her for a while.

46
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,582
If nothing unusual happens,

47
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,360
she'll be fine with a few days' rest.

48
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:41,520
I'll stay with her tonight.

49
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,360
You guys go get some rest.

50
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,640
Are you sure you'll be okay by yourself?

51
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,920
Go back and get some rest.

52
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,960
You have class tomorrow.

53
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:51,565
Call us if anything comes up.

54
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
Got it.

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,000
Get going. Bye.

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,680
Jian Dan?

57
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,520
You stayed up with me all night?

58
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:57,891
Anywhere else that still feels off?

59
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:04,777
Your fever's gone down.

60
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,240
That's great.

61
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:08,620
Don't expect me to thank you

62
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,840
just because you helped me.

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,040
I never said you had to.

64
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,120
Besides,

65
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,760
I'm sure you'd do the same for me

66
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,066
if our roles were switched.

67
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,160
I got to go.

68
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,880
Wait.

69
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,044
Buy me a bottle of vitamin C.

70
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,920
Yes, ma'am.

71
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,720
Where are you?

72
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,000
Why didn't you show up
at Rock Climbing Club today?

73
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm at the hospital.

74
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,000
The hospital? Send me the address.

75
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm coming right now.

76
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:55,954
Sheng,

77
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,680
did I just hear you say hospital?

78
00:06:57,822 --> 00:06:58,711
What happened?

79
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,840
It's Jian Dan.

80
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,000
She might be sick.

81
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,320
You've got appendicitis.

82
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Why are you taking vitamin C?

83
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,879
I can take these even if I'm healthy.

84
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,160
These are just supplements.

85
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,320
Pills all look the same these days.

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,800
I'd definitely get them mixed up

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,511
(VC)
without the engraving on the tablets.

88
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,880
Want one?

89
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,200
I'm good.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,720
Get some rest.

91
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,600
Call me if you need anything.

92
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,560
Jian Dan!

93
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,200
Are you okay?

94
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:58,044
Are you hurt anywhere?

95
00:07:58,755 --> 00:07:59,577
Let me look at you.

96
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,333
What are you grinning about, dummy?

97
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:04,244
You're sick!

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,600
What's going on?

99
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm not the one who's sick.

100
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,040
It's Yue Tangtang.

101
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm here with her.

102
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,080
As long as you're okay.

103
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,400
Don't tell me you rushed here

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,920
just because you were worried about me?

105
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,160
Of course. I'm not sick.

106
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,222
Why else would I come here?

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,080
Well, you didn't let me finish talking

108
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,280
before charging over.

109
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,080
Because that's what

110
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,480
a qualified boyfriend does.

111
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,520
Mi Fen and Yuan Sen
are all over each other every day.

112
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,622
We barely even get to see each other.

113
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,866
You're hardly a qualified boyfriend
by that standard.

114
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,200
It was just a special case
the other day.

115
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:49,955
I happen to be free today.

116
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:51,288
Where do you want to go?

117
00:08:52,154 --> 00:08:53,640
Well...

118
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,500
(Gu Entong)

119
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,960
Hello?

120
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,840
Sheng,

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,680
I really don't feel well.

122
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,400
Shi and Monkey aren't around.

123
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,080
Can you come over?

124
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:11,920
Sure.

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,840
Entong's not feeling well.

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,222
I need to head back
to the Swimming Club.

127
00:09:20,645 --> 00:09:23,280
I'll go with you.

128
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:32,000
Entong, are you okay?

129
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:36,160
You're here too, Jian Dan.

130
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:37,760
I've just got

131
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,680
a bad headache.

132
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,160
Did you forget to take your medicine?

133
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:46,200
Now that you mention it, I think I did.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Could you get me a glass of water?

135
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,240
Sure.

136
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,420
(VC)

137
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,940
(VC)

138
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
(Entong's tablets look a lot)

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,120
(like the vitamin C
Yue Tangtang's taking.)

140
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,102
(Am I mistaken?)

141
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,240
Sorry, Sheng,

142
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,640
I broke your cup.

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,480
Don't move.

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,800
I'll go get a band-aid.

145
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,760
Sit down.

146
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,800
Take care of Entong.

147
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,000
I have to leave.

148
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,280
Jian Dan!

149
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:08,120
What, you just walked out like that?

150
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,645
Something's fishy

151
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,920
about Gu Entong's "depression."

152
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,480
Of all times,

153
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:17,688
why would it flare up right after
you and Han Yansheng

154
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:18,555
started dating?

155
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,022
I saw

156
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
the antidepressants she took just now.

157
00:11:23,288 --> 00:11:25,360
They look exactly
like Yue Tangtang's vitamin C.

158
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,600
So Gu Entong faked her depression?

159
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760
Maybe I just saw it wrong.

160
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:34,400
That's easy to find out.

161
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll call her and ask to meet up.

162
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,000
We'll see if her pills are real or not.

163
00:11:38,754 --> 00:11:41,600
(Still, this is too much of a coincidence.)

164
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,480
(I was just about to tell Han Yansheng
about the video,)

165
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,040
(and then she suddenly gets sick?)

166
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,800
(Something's not right.)

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:50,960
Done.

168
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,680
Gu Entong has another class.

169
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,560
She'll meet us at the café
after her class.

170
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,120
Our club president, seriously.

171
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
Could've asked me anytime,

172
00:11:58,388 --> 00:11:59,520
but picks now?

173
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,760
I've been summoned.

174
00:12:00,817 --> 00:12:01,880
I have to go.

175
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:03,155
See you later.

176
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,760
Lishi.

177
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,920
Shi.

178
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,720
You're back.

179
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,240
Did you see Entong?

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,760
She's in Han Yansheng's office.

181
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll go find her.

182
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's go.

183
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,560
I'm back.

184
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,920
Did you see Professor Wilson?

185
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah, we talked.

186
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,560
He said he needs

187
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,390
to review Entong's
psychological evaluation

188
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,200
before offering a solution.

189
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,400
Entong, send me the report.

190
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,488
I'll forward it to him.

191
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,360
The report?

192
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
I forgot where I put it.

193
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,960
That's okay.

194
00:12:56,222 --> 00:12:58,311
You can get a new copy printed
at the hospital.

195
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,480
I really don't think that's necessary.

196
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm feeling a lot better.

197
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,360
I don't need to see another specialist.

198
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,640
Entong,

199
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,400
Professor Wilson
is an expert in PTSD...

200
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,520
I said I don't need to see another...

201
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,640
Sorry.

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,040
I know you're just trying to help.

203
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:28,920
I just feel really overwhelmed.

204
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,720
I still have class.

205
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,040
I'll get going.

206
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,680
It's okay.

207
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:43,960
We'll take it slow.

208
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,780
(Sulpiride Tablets)

209
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,120
I forgot to give her this.

210
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,640
Sorry, class ran late.

211
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,440
Zhishan, did you need something?

212
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,160
Not really.

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,331
Just wanted to check

214
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:11,800
how you've been feeling.

215
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,320
Much better.

216
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,320
Why the sudden concern?

217
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,600
We're friends.

218
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,200
It's only polite to ask.

219
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,711
Hasn't it been a while
since we ordered that coffee?

220
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,080
Entong,

221
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,480
could you go check on it for us?

222
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,440
Sure.

223
00:14:49,377 --> 00:14:51,140
It's not right
to go through someone's bag.

224
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,420
We should just wait for her
to take the medicine out herself.

225
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:54,440
Gu Entong is sly.

226
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:56,479
If we let her handle it,
who knows what she'll pull.

227
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,711
I'm not going through her stuff.

228
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,730
I just want to see
if the medicine is real.

229
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,880
If I'm wrong, I'll apologize.

230
00:15:05,844 --> 00:15:07,400
Knew it. Vitamin C tablets.

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,880
I'm telling Sheng the truth.

232
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,866
This can't be explained over the phone.

233
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:19,040
Get Sheng to come here.

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,511
Only confronting her in person

235
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:21,955
will stop her from lying her way out.

236
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,680
Okay.

237
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:25,760
She's back.

238
00:15:32,251 --> 00:15:33,800
Zhishan, what are you doing with my bag?

239
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,120
Nice bag you have there.

240
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,080
I might get one too.

241
00:15:40,908 --> 00:15:42,600
You can't get this in China right now.

242
00:15:43,148 --> 00:15:44,360
If you want one,

243
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,355
I can ask a friend overseas
to bring you one.

244
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,440
Sure. Thanks.

245
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,782
Your coffee will be ready soon.

246
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,680
Just wait a little.

247
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,120
Zhishan,

248
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,440
you didn't ask me out here

249
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,240
just to check on my health,

250
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,400
did you?

251
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,440
There is something.

252
00:16:04,788 --> 00:16:07,400
But we're waiting
for someone else to arrive.

253
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Who?

254
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Here's your coffee.

255
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm so sorry.

256
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,400
I got your bag dirty.

257
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,960
It's fine. Just needs a wipe.

258
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,960
There's a dry cloth at the counter.

259
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,111
Let me help clean it for you.

260
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,240
Sure.

261
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,240
- Thanks.
- No problem.

262
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,720
There he is.

263
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,720
What's the emergency?

264
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,640
You're all here.

265
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,360
Have a seat.

266
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,040
I have something to tell you.

267
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,971
So what's this big reason

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,120
you called Sheng over?

269
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,080
What's the rush?

270
00:16:39,088 --> 00:16:41,088
It's not time for you
to get worked up just yet.

271
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,320
What's with all the mystery?

272
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:44,960
Your bag, Miss.

273
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,440
Thank you.

274
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,160
Shows us your medicine.

275
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,960
What?

276
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,880
Cut the act.

277
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,320
Jian Dan and I both saw it.

278
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,960
The pills in your bag
aren't antidepressants.

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,111
They're just vitamin C.

280
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:03,311
You're not sick at all.

281
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,120
You can't just throw out accusations.

282
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,560
We'll know if I'm wrong or not

283
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,520
once we look in your bag.

284
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,440
If it's real,

285
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,600
I'll apologize to you.

286
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,840
If it's fake,

287
00:17:16,111 --> 00:17:17,560
then you've been lying to everyone,

288
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,160
and you owe us all an apology.

289
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:21,720
This is defamation, you know?

290
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:24,760
Why are you trying to leave?

291
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,560
Afraid to show it, or feeling guilty?

292
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,320
What would I be guilty about?

293
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,160
I won't let you insult me.

294
00:17:30,222 --> 00:17:32,555
The more you try to hide,
the more suspicious it looks.

295
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,320
If you won't do it,

296
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,920
don't blame me for taking action.

297
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,880
Stop it!

298
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,160
If there's nothing to hide,

299
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,360
then there's no harm

300
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,680
in showing everyone.

301
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,800
Sheng, you be the judge.

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,520
See whether the pills are real or not.

303
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,800
Sheng,

304
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,720
you believe me, don't you?

305
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,560
I don't know

306
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,000
why they're ganging up on me.

307
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,400
See for yourselves.

308
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,520
How could this be?

309
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,640
Told you.

310
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,120
No one would joke about being sick.

311
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,400
You two never liked me.

312
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,840
I get it.

313
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't blame you.

314
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
My chest feels tight.

315
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,280
I'm going to get some air.

316
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,720
I'll check on her.

317
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,400
We'll talk another time.

318
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,560
But...

319
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,680
I swear those were vitamin C tablets.

320
00:19:06,988 --> 00:19:08,400
How did they suddenly change?

321
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,640
What went wrong?

322
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,360
Something definitely happened.

323
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,080
I'll find out what she's really up to.

324
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,920
Entong,

325
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,640
are you all right?

326
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,200
Sheng,

327
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160
you believe me, right?

328
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,720
I know whether I'm struggling

329
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,360
with depression or not is my problem.

330
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:38,640
I shouldn't have involved anyone else.

331
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Don't overthink it.

332
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,720
I just feel this tightness in my chest.

333
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,560
Can you go somewhere with me?

334
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,600
Getting some fresh air is a good idea.

335
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,280
A little sun

336
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
can really lift your mood.

337
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Sorry about earlier.

338
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
I didn't think it through.

339
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,080
You've always helped me.

340
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,280
Now it's my turn.

341
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,000
After all, I'm a psychology major.

342
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,040
I'd be happy to use what little I know

343
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,200
to help you.

344
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,280
Look, Sheng.

345
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,920
Isn't this view beautiful?

346
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,800
Let's take a photo together.

347
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
Jian Dan, can you take

348
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
a picture of us?

349
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:45,920
Sure.

350
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,880
Come on.

351
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,920
Done.

352
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,760
Why are all the pictures separate?

353
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:04,555
Where's the one of us together?

354
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:07,040
Oh, sorry.

355
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,520
You only said "take a photo,"
not a group one.

356
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,880
Can you take one of us together?

357
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
Make sure we're both in it.

358
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,840
Done.

359
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:33,680
Entong,

360
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,160
you wanted to relax a bit, right?

361
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,080
I rented camping gear
from the Camping Club.

362
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,560
This is all for you.

363
00:21:43,548 --> 00:21:44,840
Thanks, Jian Dan.

364
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,160
Sheng, I can't open this bottle.

365
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
Can you help me?

366
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,120
I'll do it.

367
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,080
- Thanks.
- Here's the cap.

368
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,280
I could go for some alcohol too.

369
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,960
Let me have that.

370
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,040
Entong, you really
shouldn't be drinking right now.

371
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,280
What you need is more sweets

372
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,400
to boost your dopamine.

373
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,400
I'm not really into sweets.

374
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,520
They're too sugary.
Just leave them there.

375
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,560
Sheng,

376
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,560
I remember

377
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,200
the summer before we started college.

378
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,640
We went camping just like this.

379
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
After that,

380
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,320
we went to see an opera together.

381
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:51,440
"Othello".

382
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,840
Do you remember?

383
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,960
I do.

384
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,200
Yuan Sen,

385
00:22:56,217 --> 00:22:58,360
Shi, and Monkey were with us too.

386
00:23:01,737 --> 00:23:02,902
I still remember

387
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:04,240
how intense it was

388
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,160
when we saw Othello take his own life

389
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
on stage.

390
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,560
I thought, if it were me,

391
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,200
I'd never push away

392
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,634
the person I love like that.

393
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
I have that clip saved on my phone.

394
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,960
Let's watch it again.

395
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,360
Here it is.

396
00:23:27,177 --> 00:23:27,960
Entong,

397
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,240
you shouldn't be watching tragedies
right now.

398
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,600
They can trigger depression.

399
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,822
You should listen

400
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:35,480
to something funny.

401
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:36,640
Like...

402
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:37,880
this.

403
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,570
(Crosstalk)

404
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,285
(You keep talking in code.
How can I understand?)

405
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,466
(Oh, that's code?)

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,040
Jian Dan,

407
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:56,555
Sheng has never liked crosstalk,

408
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,040
not even as a kid.

409
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,640
Sorry, I'm late.

410
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,800
What's Shi doing here?

411
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,560
I called him.

412
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,280
Jian Dan and I have
something to take care of.

413
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,120
I'll leave Entong to you, Shi.

414
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
We'll get going.

415
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,560
Come on.

416
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,920
See you guys around.

417
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,520
Shi...

418
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,897
I feel like I can't breathe.

419
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,311
I want to go back and get some rest.

420
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:43,320
Entong.

421
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:46,520
It's time to stop.

422
00:24:47,177 --> 00:24:48,888
You can't keep making the same mistake.

423
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:51,640
What do you mean?

424
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:56,120
I know...

425
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,520
You faked your depression.

426
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,240
(Something's fishy
about Gu Entong's "depression.")

427
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:05,333
Of all times,
why would it flare up right after

428
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,870
you and Han Yansheng

429
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:07,840
started dating?

430
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:11,182
I saw

431
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,960
the antidepressants she took just now.

432
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,560
They look exactly
like Yue Tangtang's vitamin C.

433
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,960
So Gu Entong faked her depression?

434
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,120
Maybe I just saw it wrong.

435
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,240
I'll call her and ask to meet up.

436
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,960
We'll see if her pills are real or not.

437
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,540
I overheard Zhishan and the girls

438
00:25:32,542 --> 00:25:33,920
saying your depression wasn't real.

439
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,600
I was shocked,

440
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,160
but I didn't believe it.

441
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,840
I asked you for
your psychological evaluation report.

442
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
You said you lost it,

443
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:45,711
and then refused to get a new copy
from the hospital.

444
00:25:45,866 --> 00:25:47,560
That's when I started to get suspicious.

445
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,120
But I still didn't want to believe it.

446
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,400
So I went to the café

447
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:54,760
to see for myself

448
00:25:56,142 --> 00:25:57,240
whether it was true.

449
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:02,200
So you were the one
who switched my medicine?

450
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,040
Deliver the coffee

451
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,360
and find a way to get her bag.

452
00:26:14,257 --> 00:26:15,091
Here's your coffee.

453
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm so sorry.

454
00:26:27,657 --> 00:26:29,180
(VC)

455
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,540
(Sulpiride Tablets)

456
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:38,720
Shi...

457
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,040
Shi, listen to me.

458
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
I panicked.

459
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,480
I really didn't know what else to do.

460
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,320
I'm just asking for one thing.

461
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,800
Please don't tell Sheng, all right?

462
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,040
Shi...

463
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,760
Entong, listen to me.

464
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,760
Tell the truth yourself.

465
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,440
Shi!

466
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Han Yansheng.

467
00:27:15,211 --> 00:27:16,680
Do you believe me?

468
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:19,040
About Entong's depression?

469
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,817
I wasn't trying to frame her.

470
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,444
I saw with my own eyes that the bottle

471
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,680
didn't contain antidepressants.
It was vitamin C.

472
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,880
- That's why...
- I know.

473
00:27:30,555 --> 00:27:32,600
You wouldn't have
done all that for no reason.

474
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
So,

475
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,120
you believe me?

476
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,120
You're my girlfriend.

477
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,222
If I don't believe you,
then who would I believe?

478
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,400
Shi.

479
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,320
Where are you?

480
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,760
I'm at the café. I don't see you.

481
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,440
What's the emergency?

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,440
I want to talk to you
about Entong's depression.

483
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,120
She doesn't want to continue
with professional treatment.

484
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,840
I think

485
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
we should respect her decision.

486
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,600
Okay.

487
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,640
I understand.

488
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,320
Mr. Gu, it's me, Han Yansheng.

489
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,120
I'd like to talk to you
about Entong's condition.

490
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:48,880
Hello?

491
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Dad?

492
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
Why are you calling me?

493
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,880
Entong,

494
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,640
I've already spoken to the university.

495
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,040
You'll be taking
a leave of absence for now.

496
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
What are you talking about?

497
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,360
Why would you make that decision

498
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,160
without even telling me?

499
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,640
Entong,

500
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,040
I know

501
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,880
about your depression.

502
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,520
I neglected you

503
00:29:15,711 --> 00:29:17,600
and didn't give you the care you needed.

504
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,040
That was my fault.

505
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:21,219
Mr. Han has already reached out

506
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,850
to one of the best specialists abroad.

507
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,750
He'll personally
arrange a consultation for you.

508
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:25,577
Wait. Dad...

509
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,280
Did Sheng tell you about this?

510
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,200
No.

511
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,640
I can't leave him right now.

512
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,760
Then what about your illness?

513
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm not sick.

514
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,840
It's hard to explain

515
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,200
over the phone.

516
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,120
What did you say?

517
00:29:43,222 --> 00:29:46,040
- You're not lying to me, are you?
- No, I'm not lying.

518
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:46,800
I'll send you

519
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,600
my psychological evaluation report.

520
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,800
Okay? I'm hanging up.

521
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,711
All right.

522
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,920
So, you don't have depression.

523
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,880
