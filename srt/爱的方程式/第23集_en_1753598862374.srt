1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I love you

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I love you

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I love you

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I love you

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I love you

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love you

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I love you

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I love you

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I love you

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I love you

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I love you

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I love you

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,100
dialect

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Tang Sheng, wait.

17
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,600
It's not a special day today.

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,040
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
They didn't mean to lie to you.

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
They just wanted to help me.

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,440
Don't be mad.

22
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
Can you hear me out?

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,680
But I don't want to hear it.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,120
Why didn't you give me

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
a chance to explain?

26
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,640
I'm that kind of person.

27
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,680
You've known it now.

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
And...

29
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's break up.

30
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,480
Say it again.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
You've heard it clearly.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,720
Suddenly, I feel like dying.

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,920
Memories are too temporary.

34
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,600
It hurts and it hurts, but it's not the end.

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,840
Where should I start?

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,040
When we first met.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,280
I don't know what to do.

38
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,880
Wan.

39
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,160
I still miss you.

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,920
What's going on?

41
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,960
Did they not make up?

42
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,600
No, I have to see it.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Mi Fen.

44
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,400
Love is a matter of two people.

45
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,840
Although they're friends,

46
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,720
don't interfere with them too much.

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
Leave some space for them.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,040
Suddenly, the wind becomes clear.

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,640
Smiling is delayed.

50
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
The weather is good.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,280
The rain is falling.

52
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,520
Which address should I go?

53
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,200
Who will find the answer?

54
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,920
The passion of love, the persistence of dreams.

55
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,160
My future is because of you.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,760
Like a poem.

57
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,920
Those young days.

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
They're ordinary but meaningful.

59
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,120
In the gap of time.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,800
We're still beautiful.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,920
Those broken past.

62
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,880
The vague name.

63
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:39,880
Fortunately, we once had each other.

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,640
Those broken past.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,680
It's never been the same.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,680
The life is endless.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,360
What are you looking for?

68
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,080
If it's something simple,

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,720
then forget it.

70
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
I'm your aunt.

71
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,240
Can't I care about you?

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm afraid you're not drunk enough.

73
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,920
So I brought you something.

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,040
I know you're in a bad mood.

75
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,480
So I came to drink with you and chat.

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,560
You need to be careful.

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't chat and have a drink.

78
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,160
It's a deal.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
Comp chap when you're drunk.

80
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
Just a break-up, alright?

81
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,240
It's no big deal.

82
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Let's have another one.

83
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
Have it.

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,620
I prophetize.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,260
Thank you.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,060
There will be leaves in winter for many years.

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,140
My mouth is watering.

88
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,660
Two years later

89
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,780
Why did you break up

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,180
with Jian Dan?

91
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,340
Dr. Han.

92
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
I remember you used to tell me

93
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,280
that generations of wine 24 الإل

94
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,160
will pay the price.

95
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,020
Such a lie.

96
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,580
Drunk like a city.

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,860
I'm not going to ask him.

98
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,620
Forget it.

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,100
It's no use asking him.

100
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,500
Let's go and check the list.

101
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,540
Why did you drink so much?

102
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,340
Dasheng.

103
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,660
It hurts so much.

104
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,500
Can you hear me?

105
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,580
Dasheng.

106
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,580
Where are you?

107
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,180
Alright.

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,300
I'll send you back first.

109
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:57,980
Okay?

110
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,220
Here.

111
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,460
Be careful.

112
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,980
Why did you get all the way here?

113
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,980
Female dodgers

114
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,540
may have slept already.

115
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:25,660
Landing

116
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,860
I came back

117
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,100
to the pillow room.

118
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,840
I saw the

119
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,420
fan is off.

120
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,080
That's

121
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,740
a surprise to me.

122
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,660
I may already be

123
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,700
taken to my room.

124
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,400
Let's go, Jia제 boost his spirit.

125
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,320
Seeing that he Remove Jin might have land anguish.

126
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,400
Time must go by.

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,000
I guess I don't have to worry about his health.

128
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,100
I'll go find someone

129
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
to visit her again.

130
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
I made some tea.

131
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,700
It's good?

132
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
Sure.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,920
I'll take care of her.

134
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,080
everyone May contain

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:25,880
information that may cause Conometimes

136
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,540
Master Y16

137
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,580
Come on

138
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,820
Jintai

139
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,740
Jintai

140
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,220
You're finally back

141
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:40,980
Fried chicken?

142
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,180
I saw a new restaurant with good noodles.

143
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,180
It's very good.

144
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,500
Let's go.

145
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,180
I think it's good.

146
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:45,780
Let's go.

147
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,100
Come on.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,460
Try this lamb skewer.

149
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,900
The grilled squid tastes good.

150
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,460
Come on, Jinta.

151
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,820
The prawn tastes good too.

152
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,180
Right?

153
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:52,860
I think so.

154
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,020
I'm telling you, the fish tofu

155
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,060
is very delicious.

156
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,460
Right.

157
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,420
Look at the sausage.

158
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,620
Right.

159
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,620
The potato chips.

160
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,100
It's really good.

161
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,300
The onion is too spicy.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,860
I'm about to cry.

163
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,500
Right.

164
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,260
Boss.

165
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,180
Can you not

166
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,740
put so much chili next time?

167
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,420
Look at it.

168
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,980
It's really...

169
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,460
Come on.

170
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,220
Let's eat a little bun.

171
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,980
It's a little sweet.

172
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,580
Try it.

173
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,380
Bite it.

174
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,540
Drink some water.

175
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,180
Is it good?

176
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,940
Look at the way she's showing off.

177
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,820
It's really...

178
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,540
An.

179
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,300
Where are you going?

180
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,220
I'm going to the math competition

181
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,540
for Xiuchuan City.

182
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,900
I might not be there

183
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,620
for this period of time.

184
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,660
If you're leaving,

185
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,180
what about you and Jian Dan?

186
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,540
I've put the president's seal

187
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,780
in the drawer.

188
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,460
After I leave,

189
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,340
I'll go to the competition

190
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
to get the seal.

191
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,540
I'll go to the competition

192
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,540
to get the seal.

193
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,580
I'll go to the competition

194
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
to get the seal.

195
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I'll go to the competition

196
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
to get the seal.

197
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,580
I'll go to the competition

198
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,820
to get the seal.

199
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,140
I'll walk you out.

200
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,780
No need.

201
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,220
Jian Dan.

202
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,420
Why did you just answer the phone?

203
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,420
Han is going to

204
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,620
the math competition.

205
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,060
He should be in the car now.

206
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,260
Hello?

207
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,580
Jian Dan.

208
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,580
Hello?

209
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,540
Why did you leave?

210
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,820
Are you closely following flown?

211
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,180
I wish you had waited a little longer.

212
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,060
Pen,

213
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:59,040
the Nation's first

214
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,580
galaxy monoc Rare wait Chicago

215
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,900
Just wait for dreams

216
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,540
What's wrong?

217
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,620
I don't know.

218
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,860
Can you stop talking nonsense?

219
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,780
What's wrong with you?

220
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,060
Huo Zeyang is so annoying.

221
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,460
He always makes things up.

222
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,380
So annoying.

223
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,620
You guys eat first.

224
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,420
I'll leave first.

225
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,740
Take the bag back to him.

226
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,980
ş prz

227
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:50,740

228
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,300

00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,340

231
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,100
it sold

232
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,500
you to open and listen to

233
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,340
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,500
His illness is getting worse.

235
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,500
He may not be able to cure it.

236
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,500
I feel so confused and helpless.

237
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,620
Maybe I should give up.

238
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,620
I said I didn't love him

239
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,380
and broke up with him.

240
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:24,500
This...

241
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,380
This is my voice.

242
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,860
But it was edited.

243
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,300
Why is Ansheng so angry?

244
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,100
The editing of the original is not obvious.

245
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,540
But we can still use professional software

246
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,220
to identify the original sound.

247
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,660
I tried to fix it,

248
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,060
but it didn't work.

249
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,740
I can't find the original sound.

250
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,420
It's okay.

251
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,820
I have the original sound in my computer.

252
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,540
How do you do this?

253
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,700
Use this and add this

254
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,780
and edit it.

255
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,180
And then do this.

256
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,660
Easy.

257
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,020
That's too easy.

258
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,340
Let me show you the刷 Haddan used.

259
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,900
Ansheng is doing very well today.

260
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,620
Do you AmericaREACTEd?

261
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
He's doing well.

262
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,020
He's cooperating with me.

263
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm confident

264
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,820
that I can help him

265
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,180
overcome the psychological obstacles.

266
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,580
He hasn't taken the exam today.

267
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,180
He's not in a good state.

268
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,860
He seems to have lost confidence in himself.

269
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,380
I feel bad when I see him like this.

270
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,260
I want to help him.

271
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,460
But I really don't know what to do.

272
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,980
I just had a nightmare.

273
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,660
In the dream,

274
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
Han Sheng's condition

275
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,580
became worse.

276
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,420
He may not be able to cure it again.

277
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,580
He lost confidence

278
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,500
and began to give up on himself.

279
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,180
Fortunately, after waking up,

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,460
I found it was just a dream.

281
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm a little shaken.

282
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,460
I don't know if it's right or wrong

283
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,980
to force him to face the past.

284
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,620
Is it right or wrong?

285
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,660
Yesterday, I recommended Han Sheng

286
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,820
to watch a movie

287
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,820
called The Soul Reconciliation.

288
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,900
The male lead in it

289
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,260
is a patient with a serious injury.

290
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,180
He was abandoned since childhood

291
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,700
and abused by the beast.

292
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,660
It caused him to be extremely selfish and inferior.

293
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,340
He was afraid of being abandoned by his girlfriend

294
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,340
and told her that he didn't love her

295
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,460
and broke up with her.

296
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,940
Finally,

297
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,900
with the help of the professor,

298
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,140
he finally got out of the shadow of his heart

299
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,780
and found his girlfriend

300
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,820
and started a new life.

301
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,300
I originally wanted to encourage Han Sheng

302
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,860
through this movie.

303
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,460
But he didn't watch it.

304
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,740
He was very emotional.

305
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,980
I don't know

306
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,300
how to help him.

307
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,180
I feel so confused and helpless.

308
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,220
Maybe

309
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,860
I should give up

310
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
the treatment method now

311
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,340
and let Han Sheng live his life.

312
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,460
Actually, I don't mind at all.

313
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,460
Whether he can swim or not

314
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,100
is enough as long as he can be happy.

315
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,660
Even if the movie was edited,

316
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,820
what's the point?

317
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,980
I still can't cure my illness.

318
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,620
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed

319
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,140
cannot be connected for the moment.

320
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,900
Please redial later.

321
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,780
Sorry.

322
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,380
Your Highness,

323
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,980
he still doesn't answer my call.

324
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't know if he saw the email.

325
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,900
Can you help me ask him?

326
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,180
Maybe it's not convenient for him to answer the phone now.

327
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,900
How about I send you a message?

328
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,940
Han,

329
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,860
did you see the simple email?

330
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,260
I thought he would ignore me after the recording.

331
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,780
Don't be angry.

332
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,460
How about you tell him in person after Han comes back?

333
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,100
It's easier to tell him in person.

334
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,460
Try this sword so hard.

335
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,980
Ah Xu An.

336
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,220
When am I done?

337
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,420
Give it to me.

338
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,420
Pick up the sword.

339
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,180
Does he take all the deep matters?

340
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,740
Fantastic.

341
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,340
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

342
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,140
Jianan, why are you still awake?

343
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,620
My head hurts.

344
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,380
Headache?

345
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,500
Let me see.

346
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,380
Your body temperature is low.

347
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,460
You probably don't have a fever.

348
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,340
You are just overworking recently.

349
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,620
Your body is too tired.

350
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,220
Get up and have a meal.

351
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,780
Don't tell him.

352
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,780
Just leave him alone.

353
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,980
I don't believe he will ignore you.

354
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,980
What's up?

355
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,860
Jianan is sick.

356
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,900
He doesn't eat well.

357
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,100
Do you want to talk to him?

358
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,540
Why doesn't he tell me?

359
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,860
I have something to do.

360
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,940
I'll hang up.

361
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,460
Hello, Dr. Han.

362
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,380
Hello.

363
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,060
I want to order.

364
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,140
Jianan,

365
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,500
well,

366
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,660
Monkey told me yesterday

367
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,180
that there are too many things in the swimming club.

368
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,260
He is too busy.

369
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
I'll go help him.

370
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
Have a good rest at home.

371
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,300
Hello.

372
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,060
You got a copy of the father-of-the-pea porridge

373
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,460
from Nan Shan Restaurant.

374
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,940
It's a gift from the deliveryman.

375
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,900
Please check it.

376
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,500
I didn't take part in the lottery.

377
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,340
As long as you have been to our restaurant,

378
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,060
you will automatically participate in the lottery.

379
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,780
Thank you.

380
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,620
Perfume

381
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,420
fake smile

382
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:27,020
I'm afraid you want the one you love

383
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:33,420
If he answers with a smile

384
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,820
I'm afraid you want the one you love

385
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:46,220
If he answers with a smile

386
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:52,620
If he answers with a smile

387
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:59,020
If he answers with a smile

388
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm afraid he is a simple flower

389
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,820
He has also asked himself

390
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,220
I'm afraid he is the most passionate

391
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,620
If he answers with a smile

392
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:31,020
I'm afraid you want the one you love

393
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:37,420
If he answers with a smile

394
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:01,020
If he answers with a smile

395
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:07,420
I'm afraid you want the one you love

396
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,820
If he answers with a smile

397
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,220
I'm afraid you want the one you love

398
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,620
Before leaving, Han said he was in the drawer

399
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,220
But I sent him a little note and didn't see it

400
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,420
Then have you ever thought about the drawer he said

401
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,420
It's the drawer in the office

402
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,420
Is this possible

403
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,020
Then help me find it

404
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,820
Found it

405
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,020
Great

406
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,220
Wait for me, I'll go over now

407
00:24:50,220 --> 00:25:03,020
Qingtan, come to the swimming pool office

408
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,220
I have something important to tell you

409
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,620
Ok, I'll be there right away

410
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,220
Qingtan

411
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Qingtan, look at this

412
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Is this possible

413
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm too careless

414
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:38,220
I didn't even find his state was wrong

415
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,220
Xiao Miao

416
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,220
What are you doing

417
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,220
What else can I do

418
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
What else can I do

419
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
Find Han Yanshan

420
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Sister

421
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
Sister

422
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
Sister, are you looking for this

423
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,220
Thank you

424
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
You're welcome, sister

425
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,220
No matter how sad you are in the future

426
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,220
Don't throw things away

427
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,220
Goodbye sister

428
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Zishan, come in your kitchen

429
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Come

430
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
Students, tomorrow is the official exam

431
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,220
Everyone goes back today

432
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Rest early, do your best

433
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,220
Take the final test tomorrow

434
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
You are not a student of this school

435
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,220
Can't enter

436
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,220
Today is my boyfriend's birthday

437
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
I want to give him a surprise

438
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,220
Entering the school district must be approved by an emergency student

439
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Call your boyfriend

440
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,220
But he came to approve it

441
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,220
It's not a surprise

442
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,220
Handsome, please be kind

443
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,220
I'm sorry

444
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,220
I'm sorry

445
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
I'm sorry

446
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,220
I'm sorry

447
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,220
I'm sorry

448
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,220
Handsome, please be kind

449
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
The school has its rules

450
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
No one can break the rules

451
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm sorry

452
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,220
I'm sorry

453
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
I'm sorry

454
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,220
I'm sorry

455
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,220
I'm sorry

456
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,220
I'm sorry

457
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,220
I'm sorry

458
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
I'm sorry

459
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
I'm sorry

460
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,220
I'm sorry

461
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
I'm sorry

462
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
I'm sorry

463
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm sorry

464
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,220
I'm sorry

465
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
I'm sorry

466
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
I'm sorry

467
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
I'm sorry

468
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,220
I'm sorry

469
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm sorry

470
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I'm sorry

471
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,220
I'm sorry

472
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
I'm sorry

473
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,220
I'm sorry

474
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:04,220
I'm sorry

475
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,220
I'm sorry

476
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,220
I'm sorry

477
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,220
I'm sorry

478
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,220
I'm sorry

479
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
I'm sorry

480
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
I'm sorry

481
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
I'm sorry

482
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,220
I'm sorry

483
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,220
I'm sorry

484
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,220
I'm sorry

485
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,220
I'm sorry

486
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,220
I'm sorry

487
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,220
I'm sorry

488
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,220
I'm sorry

489
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,220
I'm sorry

490
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
I'm sorry

491
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
I'm sorry

492
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,220
I'm sorry

493
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,220
I'm sorry

494
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
Suddenly I feel like dying

495
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,620
Come on, Wu Xie, where are you going?

496
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Don't run.

497
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Stand there.

498
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,620
Wu Xie,

499
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,820
where are you going?

500
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,220
There's a sign on the table.

501
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:46,020
The song is about the young days.

502
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,420
It's ordinary but interesting.

503
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,420
In the gap of time,

504
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,620
we secretly cry.

505
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,820
Those broken pasts,

506
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,420
the vague names.

507
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
It's okay.

508
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,620
We once had a...

509
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Excuse me, could you check again?

510
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
No need.

511
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
Han Yansheng!

512
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
Han Yansheng!

513
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Subbers Alina, Sophia, Sophia

514
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,560
Proofreading, Translation,

515
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Timing and Rehabilitation

The Legend of Princess Miaoshan

517
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Suddenly we get close and miss each other.

518
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Memories are too temporary.

519
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,560
It's ordinary but interesting.

520
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Where should we start?

521
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,500
When we first met,

522
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I didn't miss any of the words.

523
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:52,500
My eyes are red like a poem.

524
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,500
The young days are ordinary but interesting.

525
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,440
In the gap of time,

526
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,440
we secretly cry.

527
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,440
Those broken pasts,

528
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
the vague names.

529
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
It's okay.

530
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,440
We once had a...

531
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,440
Excuse me, could you check again?

532
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,440
The young days are ordinary but interesting.

533
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
When we first met,

534
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,380
our promise was lost.

535
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:38,380
Those broken pasts,

536
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,380
the vague names.

537
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:51,380
The vague names.

538
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,380
