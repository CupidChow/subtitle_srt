1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Grow up gently

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
She is a flower that has fallen into the incense

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Will it be afraid?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Zipadiya

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is the most popular

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only the sound

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt with a smile

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Zipadiya

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you are beautiful

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Love is not complicated

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,800
It's still early. Do you want to watch a movie together?

17
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,000
I want to go back to the dorm and rest.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
Are you feeling unwell again?

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
I just couldn't see anything in front of me.

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,400
I was dizzy.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,800
Go to the dorm with me and rest for a while.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
Okay.

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Is it that serious?

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,000
You have to be careful when you walk.

25
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm fine.

26
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,200
I'm fine.

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
I'm fine.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
Sit.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm fine.

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
Go do your work first.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,200
I'll just take the medicine later.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,200
Senior, see you later.

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Okay.

34
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,320
Thank you.

35
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,520
How is it now?

36
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,760
Let's have some breakfast.

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
It's late.

38
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,320
Why did Ye Tang leave so early today?

39
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,600
She feels uncomfortable in the daytime.

40
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,520
It's because

41
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,320
I just returned from a bachelor party.

42
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,120
Once I get back, She's always lying there.

43
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,160
Ye Tang got a fever.

44
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,840
We have to go to the hospital now.

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,640
I'll go with you.

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,960
I'll go with you.

47
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,680
Let's go to the hospital.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,600
They didn't.

49
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
Theanol is dead?

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,240
No, they didn't.

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,200
Every time he is not dead.

52
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,080
That's right.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,800
If they have made a mistake,

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,560
then they have come back to life.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,920
It's a surgery.

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,280
Please keep an eye on her condition.

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,280
I'll go to bed soon.

58
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
You're still not in bed.

59
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,960
Call us tomorrow.

60
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,960
Don't worry.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
Bye.

62
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,320
Go.

63
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:36,540
But the

64
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,760
導 parfois

65
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,240
So,

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,520
we should just meet bleed you face.

67
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,480
I want some stulling.

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,560
No, Dora

69
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,440
Tetsuo,

70
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,480
we should be resourcesful.

71
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,880
We are not busy enough.

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,880
Everyone,

73
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,240
please have a sit there.

74
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,480
You longtimeged for night?

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,200
I'm not alone.

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,320
You'll be with me.

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm leaving.

78
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Wait.

79
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,120
Buy me a bottle of VC.

80
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,000
Okay.

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,200
I'll be right there.

82
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,040
Where are you?

83
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,000
Why didn't you come to the filming studio today?

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm in the hospital.

85
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,360
Hospital?

86
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Send me the address.

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,440
I'll be right there.

88
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,000
Doctor,

89
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
I heard you say hospital.

90
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,560
What's wrong?

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,840
It's a simple one.

92
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
He might be sick.

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Best Academician

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,120
It's breast cancer.

95
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,560
Why would you eat VC alone?

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,600
I could eat anything if I'm not sick.

97
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
What'll happen if I have a relapse if I'm sick?

98
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,240
These meds have a side effect now.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,560
If it wasn't for the word KeyaGame,

100
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,400
It's easy to go home, right?

101
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,320
Have a bite.

102
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,640
No, no.

103
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,040
You should rest first.

104
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,880
Call me if you need anything.

105
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,000
Jiang Dan.

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
Are you okay?

107
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,120
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

108
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,800
Let me see.

109
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,480
What's wrong?

110
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,120
What's wrong with you?

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
What's wrong with you?

112
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,400
What's wrong?

113
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
I'm not sick.

114
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Tang Tang is sick.

115
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,800
I came with her.

116
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm glad you're okay.

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,200
Are you here

118
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
because you're worried about me?

119
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,120
Nonsense.

120
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,080
I'm not sick.

121
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,040
Why would I come here?

122
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
Then why didn't you

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,880
listen to me

124
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
and come here?

125
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,960
I'm just

126
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,400
a suitable boyfriend.

127
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,240
Mi Fei and Yuan Sen

128
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,480
are talking nonsense every day.

129
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,600
We can't see each other for a few times.

130
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
How are they suitable?

131
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,200
There was a special situation a few days ago.

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
I'm free today.

133
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,000
Where do you want to go?

134
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,480
I want to go...

135
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:01,960
Hello?

136
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:02,960
Dasheng.

137
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,920
I'm really not feeling well.

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,480
The Heir Apparent and the Monkey are both gone.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,160
Can you come?

140
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,960
Okay.

141
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
N Teng is not feeling well.

142
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,960
I have to go back to the swimming club.

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,200
I want to go with you.

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,840
Senior.

145
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,440
Are you okay?

146
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,200
It's nothing.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,560
You're here too?

148
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm here...

149
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm just...

150
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,040
I have a headache.

151
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,440
Did you forget to take your medicine?

152
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
If you didn't tell me, I would have forgotten.

153
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,120
Dasheng,

154
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,440
pour me a glass of water.

155
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:46,960
Okay.

156
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll go get it.

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,520
I'll go get it.

158
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,280
I'll go get it.

159
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll go get it.

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,760
I'll go get it.

161
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,520
I'll go get it.

162
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll go get it.

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay.

164
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,800
Senior, why does this medicine

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,160
taste so similar to the medicine Yue Teng Teng takes?

166
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,080
Did I see it wrong?

167
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
Sorry, Dasheng.

168
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,800
I broke your glass.

169
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Don't move.

170
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
I'll go get a mattress.

171
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:38,800
Sit down.

172
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,920
Take care of Senior first.

173
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll go first.

174
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,280
Xiao Nan.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,680
What?

176
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,040
You just left like that?

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,760
I always feel that

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,800
Gu Wen Tong is acting strange.

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,520
He never sends messages.

180
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
He sends messages when you and Han Yun Sheng date.

181
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
But I saw him eating

182
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,000
that anti-epidemic medicine.

183
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,680
It tastes very similar to Yue Teng Teng's VAC.

184
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,640
Gu Wen Tong's depression

185
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,840
is fake.

186
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,920
Maybe I was wrong.

187
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,360
That's good.

188
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,640
I'll call Gu Wen Tong and ask her out

189
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,240
to see if her medicine is real or fake.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,440
But this is too coincidental.

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
I was just about to tell Han Yun Sheng about the video.

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,280
But she got sick.

193
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,080
It's so strange.

194
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,280
It's done.

195
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,840
Gu Wen Tong said she has a class later.

196
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,640
She'll meet us at the cafe after class.

197
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,320
Our President is so annoying.

198
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,560
He always comes to me at this time.

199
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,800
I have something to do now.

200
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,920
I'll go find them.

201
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,160
I'm leaving.

202
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,920
Hi, Senior.

203
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,840
Shi Zi, you're back.

204
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Did you see Wen Tong?

205
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,880
She's in Han Yun Sheng's office.

206
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,520
I'll go find her.

207
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,600
Let's go.

208
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,120
I'm back.

209
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
Didn't you see Professor Wei Er Xin?

210
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,360
I did.

211
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,160
I talked to her.

212
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,600
But she said she had to read

213
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,960
En Tong's psychological assessment report

214
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,600
to give her a further solution.

215
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,080
En Tong, send me the report.

216
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,920
I'll send it to Professor.

217
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,240
I'll send it to her.

218
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,120
I'll send it to her.

219
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
I'll send it to her.

220
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,840
I'll send it to her.

221
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,680
I'll send it to her.

222
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,600
I'll send it to her.

223
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,640
Report.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
I forgot where I put it.

225
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
I can't find it.

226
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,280
It's okay.

227
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,560
You can go to the hospital

228
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,440
and print it again.

229
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,760
I don't think it's necessary.

230
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,160
I really feel much better.

231
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,680
Let's not look at any experts.

232
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,160
En Tong,

233
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,720
Professor Wei Er Xin is in the PTSD...

234
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
I've said it.

235
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,880
You don't have to look at anything.

236
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,520
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,800
I know you're doing this for my own good.

238
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,440
I really feel very confused.

239
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
I have class later.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,560
I'll go first.

241
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,320
It's okay.

242
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,640
Let her come.

243
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,120
I'll give it to her.

244
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm late for class today.

245
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,200
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,800
Zhishan,

247
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
what's the matter?

248
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,840
Nothing.

249
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,040
I just want to ask

250
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,600
how you're feeling.

251
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,800
Much better.

252
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,800
How did you get in?

253
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I was just...

254
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,520
I was just...

255
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,880
Why are you

256
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,160
suddenly so concerned about me today?

257
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,720
We're friends.

258
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
It's also right to be concerned.

259
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,520
Did you order

260
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,560
the coffee for a long time?

261
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,120
En Tong,

262
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,360
can you help us take a look?

263
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,480
Okay.

264
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,080
Here.

265
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,600
Here.

266
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,160
Here.

267
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,000
Is the criminal's bag not good?

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,960
Let's wait for him to come back

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,040
and take the medicine out.

270
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,440
Gu En Tong is very thoughtful.

271
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,120
If he takes it himself,

272
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,320
there won't be any accident.

273
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,400
I don't want to see anything else in the bag.

274
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,800
I just want to see if this key is real.

275
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,680
If I got it wrong,

276
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,960
I'll apologize to him later.

277
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,040
It's really Wei Si.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,680
I want to tell him the truth.

279
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,760
I can't make it clear on the phone.

280
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,320
Call Da Shan directly.

281
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,600
Only if you open it in person,

282
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,200
he can't find the truth.

283
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,720
Okay.

284
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm back.

285
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,800
Zhishan, why are you holding this bag?

286
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
I think the style of your bag

287
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,240
is pretty good.

288
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
I want one too.

289
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,080
I can't buy it in China for now.

290
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,520
If you really like it,

291
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,400
how about I ask a friend abroad

292
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,840
to bring you one?

293
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,760
Okay.

294
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,480
Thank you.

295
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,760
Your coffee will be ready soon.

296
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,600
Wait a little longer.

297
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,880
Zhishan,

298
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,240
you asked me out today

299
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,560
because you don't want to

300
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,880
worry about my health, right?

301
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,720
It's true.

302
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,560
But

303
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,320
I have to wait for someone to come over.

304
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,000
Wait for who?

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,800
Your coffee.

306
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,360
Sorry.

307
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,800
I made your bag dirty.

308
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,480
It's okay.

309
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,400
Just wipe it.

310
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,440
Well,

311
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,200
there's dry cloth in the bar.

312
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,160
Let me wipe it for you.

313
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,640
Okay.

314
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,680
Thank you.

315
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,400
You're welcome.

316
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
He's here.

317
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,160
Why did you call me here so urgently?

318
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,960
You're all here.

319
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,200
Sit down first.

320
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,080
I have something to tell you.

321
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,160
Why did you call Dasheng here?

322
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,600
What's the matter?

323
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,440
Why are you in a hurry?

324
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,920
It's not the time for you to be in a hurry.

325
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,920
What's the matter?

326
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,840
Your bag is ready.

327
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,320
Thank you.

328
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,160
Take out the medicine in your bag.

329
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,800
What do you mean?

330
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,120
Stop pretending.

331
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
I and Jannan saw it.

332
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,240
The medicine in your bag

333
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,920
is not anti-epidemic at all.

334
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,040
It's just a vaccine.

335
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,080
You're not sick at all.

336
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,360
Don't talk nonsense.

337
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,800
I didn't talk nonsense.

338
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,440
I just opened the bag and took a look.

339
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
If it's true,

340
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,840
even if I wronged you,

341
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll apologize to you.

342
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,240
If it's fake,

343
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,720
you lied to everyone.

344
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,040
You have to apologize to everyone.

345
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,680
You're defaming me.

346
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,000
Why are you in a hurry to leave?

347
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,120
Are you afraid to take it or guilty?

348
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,600
What's guilty about me?

349
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,240
But I don't accept it.

350
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,320
You're just insulting me.

351
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,080
You're so stubborn.

352
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
It's even more obvious that there's nothing wrong with it.

353
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,600
If you don't take it yourself,

354
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,760
don't blame me for being rude.

355
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,240
Let go.

356
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
It's a self-healing vaccine.

357
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
If there's really nothing wrong with it,

358
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,760
it's nothing to show everyone.

359
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,840
Dasheng, come and testify.

360
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,440
See if this vaccine is real or fake.

361
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,240
Dasheng,

362
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,560
you should believe me.

363
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,720
I don't know why

364
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,000
they're trying to get together

365
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
to frame me.

366
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,640
Look at it.

367
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
How did this happen?

368
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,120
I've already told you

369
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,000
it's not a joke to make fun

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,280
of a person who's sick.

371
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,160
You can say that

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,360
You can't joke about your illness.

373
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,760
You two don't like me.

374
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,160
I understand.

375
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,160
I don't blame you.

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,720
If you're really bored,

377
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,520
go out and vent your anger.

378
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,120
I'll go see her.

379
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
If there's anything,

380
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,520
we'll talk later.

381
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,920
No.

382
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,760
I saw the VCR just now.

383
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,320
Why did it change suddenly?

384
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,760
What's wrong?

385
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,320
There must be something wrong.

386
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll go see her.

387
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:24,920
Yuntong.

388
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,560
Are you okay?

389
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,040
Da Sheng.

390
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
You believe me, right?

391
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,920
I don't know

392
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,320
it's my own business.

393
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,480
I shouldn't bother others.

394
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't think too much.

395
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,480
I just think if I have a chest bump,

396
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,360
can you go out with me and vent your anger?

397
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,360
It's good to vent my anger.

398
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,320
It's good to go out and enjoy the sun.

399
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,960
I'm sorry about what happened just now.

400
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,480
I didn't think it through.

401
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,120
Senior Sister helped me before.

402
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
It's my turn now.

403
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,960
After all, I'm a psychologist.

404
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I hope you can support me as much as you can.

405
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,120
Thank you.

406
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,520
Da Sheng, look.

407
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,080
The view is so beautiful.

408
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,160
Let's take a picture together.

409
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,480
It's simple.

410
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Thank you.

411
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,920
Help us take a picture.

412
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,200
Okay.

413
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,080
Let's go.

414
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
Look carefully.

415
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,200
Why are they all people?

416
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,080
They are separated.

417
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,320
Where is the photo?

418
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,320
I'm sorry, Senior Sister.

419
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,080
You just said we should take a picture.

420
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,680
You didn't say it's a photo.

421
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,360
How about this?

422
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,080
You take a picture of us.

423
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,120
Remember to take a picture together.

424
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,120
Okay.

425
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,200
Senior Sister.

426
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,760
Didn't you say you wanted to come out and relax?

427
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,720
I rented the equipment from the camping club.

428
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,040
I prepared all these for you.

429
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,520
You're considerate,簡單.

430
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,840
Da Sheng, I can't drive.

431
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Can you help me?

432
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,800
Let me do it.

433
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,040
Here.

434
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,160
Thank you.

435
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,720
Here.

436
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,120
Da Sheng, I want to drink some wine too.

437
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,840
Give this to me.

438
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,200
Senior Sister.

439
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,840
You're not suitable for drinking now.

440
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,040
You should eat more sweets

441
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
and add some doba.

442
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,200
I don't like sweets.

443
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,320
I'm too tired.

444
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,760
Put it here.

445
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Da Sheng, I remember

446
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
the summer vacation before we went to college

447
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,680
was also like today.

448
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,320
After the camping,

449
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,400
we went to watch a drama together.

450
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,480
Othello.

451
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,720
Do you remember?

452
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,960
Yes.

453
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,160
We watched it together.

454
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,280
There were Yuan Sen, Shisi and Monkey.

455
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,880
I remember

456
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,240
when we saw Othello

457
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,280
suicide on the spot,

458
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,720
it was so cruel.

459
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,600
I was thinking

460
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,240
if it was me,

461
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,640
I would never push my lover away.

462
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,000
I still have this part in my phone.

463
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,880
Let's rewind it.

464
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
Here.

465
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Senior Sister,

466
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,240
you're not suitable for watching a drama now.

467
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,840
Otherwise, it's easy to get depressed.

468
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,720
We should listen to more interesting things.

469
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,800
For example,

470
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,160
this.

471
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,240
You can only play the daba.

472
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,200
Why don't you just play the daba?

473
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,800
You always say that it's bad.

474
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't understand.

475
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
It's called bad.

476
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,840
Bye bye.

477
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,120
It's simple.

478
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,520
You may not know

479
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,240
that Da Sheng doesn't like to listen to the sound of the flute since childhood.

480
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:00,960
I'm sorry.

481
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,880
I'm late.

482
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
Why is Shisi here?

483
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,960
I asked him to come.

484
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,920
Well,

485
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,480
I have something to do with Jian Dan.

486
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll leave Nong Tong to you, Shisi.

487
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,320
We're leaving.

488
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,640
Let's go.

489
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,040
We're leaving.

490
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,680
Okay.

491
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,120
Shisi,

492
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,320
I suddenly feel that I can't get angry.

493
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,440
I want to go back and rest.

494
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,840
Nong Tong.

495
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:41,960
Let go of me.

496
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,080
Don't do it again and again.

497
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,080
What do you mean?

498
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,200
Your premonition is false.

499
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,680
I already know it.

500
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,280
I know it.

501
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,760
I know it.

502
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,520
I know it.

503
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,200
I always feel that

504
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,180
Gu Wen Tong is a medical

505
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,680
and he's always in a relationship with Han Yun Sheng.

506
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,760
But I just saw him taking the anti-medical medicine.

507
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,400
It's very similar to the VAC of the music hall.

508
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Gu Wen Tong is pretending to be a medical.

509
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,800
Maybe I was wrong.

510
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,080
I'll call Gu Wen Tong and ask her out.

511
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,680
Let's see if she's really a medical.

512
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,400
I heard from Zhishan that your premonition is false.

513
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,440
I was shocked.

514
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,840
But I don't believe it.

515
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,640
Then I asked you for a psychological evaluation report.

516
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,280
You said the report was lost

517
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,240
but you didn't want to go to the hospital for a printout.

518
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,240
I started to doubt it.

519
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,920
But I still don't want to believe it.

520
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,000
So I went to the cafe

521
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,240
to see if it was true.

522
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,040
So you were the one who changed my medicine just now.

523
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,120
Send me the coffee.

524
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,360
Find a way to get it for me.

525
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,480
Who are you waiting for?

526
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,000
Your coffee.

527
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,480
Sorry.

528
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,000
Your Highness.

529
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,160
Your Highness, listen to me.

530
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,680
I was just in a hurry.

531
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,440
I really had no choice.

532
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,640
I only ask you for one thing.

533
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,960
Don't tell Sheng about this, okay?

534
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,080
Your Highness.

535
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,080
Gu Wen Tong.

536
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,760
Listen to me.

537
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,720
Be honest with yourself.

538
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,480
I'm sorry.

539
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,280
I'm sorry.

540
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,080
I'm sorry.

541
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,880
I'm sorry.

542
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
I'm sorry.

543
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,440
I'm sorry.

544
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
I'm sorry.

545
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm sorry.

546
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,880
I'm sorry.

547
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm sorry.

548
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,520
Your Highness.

549
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
He Yansheng.

550
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,600
Do you believe me?

551
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,000
You mean

552
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,200
Wen Tong's illness?

553
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,920
I didn't mean to slander her.

554
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,120
I really saw that the bottle

555
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,560
wasn't anti-epidemic.

556
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,760
It was a VCR.

557
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,040
It was a VCR.

558
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,480
So I...

559
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,160
I know.

560
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,760
You wouldn't do that to Wen Tong.

561
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,200
So,

562
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,400
you believe me.

563
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
You're my girlfriend.

564
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,040
Who else would I believe?

565
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,880
Your Highness.

566
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,600
Where are you?

567
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,240
I'm here to see you.

568
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,000
You're not here.

569
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,440
Why are you in such a hurry?

570
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,480
I want to talk to you about Wen Tong's illness.

571
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,600
Wen Tong...

572
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,960
She doesn't want to talk to someone else.

573
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,760
I think

574
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,800
we should respect her decision.

575
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,640
Okay.

576
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,760
I see.

577
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,200
Uncle Gu.

578
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,520
I'm Han Yansheng.

579
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,680
I want to talk to you about

580
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,040
Wen Tong's illness.

581
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,960
Hello?

582
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,680
Dad?

583
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,400
Why are you calling me?

584
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,200
Wen Tong.

585
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,000
I've talked to the teacher.

586
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,960
She said

587
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,800
I've already talked to the teacher.

588
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,200
You can take a break for a while.

589
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,640
What are you talking about?

590
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,480
Why did you make the decision

591
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,320
and let me take a break without telling me?

592
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,760
Wen Tong.

593
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,160
I know

594
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,960
you have depression.

595
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,560
I neglected you

596
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
and didn't care about you.

597
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,160
It's my fault.

598
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,440
Your uncle Han has contacted

599
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,880
the best psychological expert abroad.

600
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
He'll help you with the diagnosis.

601
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,400
No, Dad.

602
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,200
I told you the truth.

603
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,440
No.

604
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,880
I said I couldn't leave him.

605
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,920
What about your illness?

606
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
I'm not ill.

607
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
I can't explain it to you

608
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,160
in the phone.

609
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,240
What did you say?

610
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Are you lying to me?

611
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,120
No.

612
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm not lying.

613
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,880
How about this?

614
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,640
I'll send you the psychological assessment report.

615
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,640
Okay.

616
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,720
I'll talk to you later.

617
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:51,800
Okay.

618
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,520
So you don't have depression.

619
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,560
You lied to me.

620
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,380
New Issue

621
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,460
company

622
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,980
You struggled a lot

623
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,920
You wanted to quit

624
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,360
Then myeltomy

625
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,360
Where should I start?

626
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,360
When we first met

627
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,360
Some look, some words

628
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I still can't forget, my eyes are already red

629
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,360
Red as a poem

630
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Those young days

631
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Are ordinary but interesting

632
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,360
In the gap of time, I quietly didn't know

633
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Those broken pasts

634
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,360
The vague names, fortunately

635
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,360
We once had each other

636
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,360
Those young days

637
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,360
Are ordinary but interesting

638
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:59,360
But one day, the promise becomes a luxury

639
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,360
Those broken pasts

640
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,360
Love never changes

641
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:15,360
Life is really unknown
