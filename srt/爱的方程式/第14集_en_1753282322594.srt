1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I love you more than him

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Have a smile to answer

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who do you think you are?

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why are you talking about my dream?

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
None of your business

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Han Yansheng

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Han Yansheng

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The Love by Hypnotic

13
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who do you think you are?

14
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why are you talking about my dream?

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
None of your business

16
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

17
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Jiang Dan

18
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Finally the winter vacation is over

19
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to go to the mountains with Yuan Sen

20
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Where are you going?

21
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I bought a ticket to go home tomorrow morning

22
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are going back?

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then remember to call my grandma

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My grandma?

25
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are my grandma

26
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who is going to go on a winter vacation with me?

27
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yuan Sen must be hanging out with his girlfriend

28
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The crown prince is going to accompany En Tong

29
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll go

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's make an appointment

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Forget it

32
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This

33
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I ask your girlfriend

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's the arrangement for her roommates and the Han family?

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why?

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just ask

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Well, you can ask your girlfriend by the way

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where is your Han family going?

39
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The moon is sweet, the Han family is home

40
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Brother, who told you to ask the moon?

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Another one

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The moon is sweet, the Han family is home

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Another one also goes home

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can go home to accompany my grandma

45
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I must be very happy

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Grandma, I'm back

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm back

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
My good granddaughter

49
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I miss you so much

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Me too

51
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You must be tired on the way

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hurry up and rest

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The food that grandma cooked for you is ready

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wait

55
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hello, your express

56
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Thank you

57
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Han Shang

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Han Shang

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What did grandma cook for you?

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's all your favorite

61
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I know

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't hide it from you

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's going on?

64
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are sick

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I went to the hospital for a checkup

66
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's that

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Slow heart failure

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Is it serious?

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What did the doctor say?

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It can be controlled by taking medicine

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Not serious

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not serious

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Not serious

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The medicine that Han Shang lent

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He knew it long ago

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Then why didn't he tell me?

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I told him not to tell you

78
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can't complain about him

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There are still a lot of dishes

80
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll get it for you

81
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Grandma, let me help you

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Your grandma is not very optimistic

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you continue to drag it down

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The disease will only get worse

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You have to be hospitalized as soon as possible

86
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
As for the cost

87
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not a small amount

88
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jianna, guess where I am now

89
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm in front of the waterfall

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There is a waterfall in Mingshan

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I never knew

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's beautiful

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You didn't come

95
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But I believe

96
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
After you go home and see your grandma

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You must be happier than I am now

98
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
By the way, Jianna

99
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have to ask grandma for me

100
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Jianna, why is your voice not right?

101
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm fine

102
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Have fun

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Remember to take more beautiful photos for me

104
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay, I'll hang up

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
See you in school, bye

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Grandma, let me do it

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are old

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Take care of yourself

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't do heavy work in the field in the future

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I know you love me

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Grandma is not yet that

112
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Age that can't do anything

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This work is okay

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Besides

115
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I just cough sometimes

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Not serious

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No way

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to listen to me in the future

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not going to do it

120
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not going to do it

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not going to do it

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm not going to do it

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have to listen to me in the future

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Take care of yourself

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Okay, okay, I'll listen to you

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It doesn't matter what you did just now

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I just went out for a walk

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
By the way, grandma

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Our school has a social practice activity

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can also have subsidies to go to the house

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The quota is very small

132
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I want to go

133
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you too tired and too hard?

134
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Our family doesn't need your money

135
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But this is also a good exercise opportunity

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Where are you going?

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then you have decided

138
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Grandma supports you

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
By the way

140
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I have a lot of that special property

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You want to go back

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to take it back to Xiaohan

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She bought us a lot of medicine

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
We have to thank her

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You go back

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is there a place to live?

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Of course

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course not

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you apply for a room in advance?

150
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You didn't apply in advance

151
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You can't live in

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Grandma, please help me

153
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I really have something to do

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is the school's rule

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't make it difficult for me

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's go

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Go back

158
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You girl

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you really have your own

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Really good

161
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hurry up and take your luggage and go

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I said there are rules here

163
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hurry up and go

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Grandpa

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Eat more fruit

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I eat so much

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Go to the health

168
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This peach is good

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you

170
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Eat more fruit when you go back

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Eat more fruit

172
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Han Yansheng and Gu Wentong

173
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Cooperate well

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
They two stand together

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Also very compatible

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I heard they two

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Every year

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Will participate in volunteer activities

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So lovely

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Thank you

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Thank you

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Old Han, Wentong

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I just sent the boss the goods

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do you want to go to dinner together?

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have an appointment with the monkeys to have a blackout tonight

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You go first

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wentong, let's go

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
it is good

190
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a pity that my family is going to work

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Otherwise, I can go with you

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Participate in volunteer activities

193
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you want to eat tonight?

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Roast meat, hot pot

195
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Or Japanese food

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
All right

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Then Japanese food

198
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want to eat

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to eat

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I want to eat

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I want to eat

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want to eat

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hi

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is our shop

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
New chocolate pudding cake

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can come to the store and have a look

207
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is our shop

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
New chocolate pudding

209
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Can be delivered

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hi

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is our shop

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
New chocolate pudding cake

213
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Can be delivered

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Jian Dan

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's really him

216
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Jian Dan

217
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hi, Jian Dan

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Why are you here?

219
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Didn't you go home?

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why are you sending flyers here?

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I am doing part-time jobs

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you done now?

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you want me to send you back?

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I live in the hotel

225
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's very close to here

226
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's two stops away

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You don't have to worry about me

228
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's go

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let the lion give you a ride

230
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can take a taxi by myself

231
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No need

232
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you sure you can do it yourself?

233
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No problem

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Then be careful

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Be careful

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why can't you get on fire?

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The previous boss said that the electric bottle of this car had a problem

238
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What should I do?

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Do you have spare electricity?

240
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, it's in the trunk

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is it

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Okay

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Go and try it

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Okay

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's done

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go

247
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are so good, Jian Dan

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Why do you know how to repair cars?

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I know how to repair leather and wool

250
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's okay to be hard

251
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But it's better to go to the repair factory to have a look

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's safer

253
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why don't you go with us?

254
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm afraid there will be an accident on the road

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes, Jian Dan, let's go together

256
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Get in the car

257
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Take me to change clothes first

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Boss, how long can this car be repaired?

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Your car can't be repaired for a while

261
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You have to come to repair the car tomorrow

262
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Tomorrow?

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You are lucky

264
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Your car is so bad

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's good to drive it here

266
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thanks to my friend

267
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He helped me do some emergency measures on the road

268
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Girl, you know how to repair cars?

269
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I used to repair a tractor

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's similar to the principle

271
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There are not many girls who can do this job like you

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think you can hire a worker here

273
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And provide free accommodation

274
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you think I can do it?

275
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We hire male employees

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's not convenient for you to be a girl

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Jian Dan, you are not suitable to work here

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's okay, I can do it

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Jian Dan has said so

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
We should support him

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Boss

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
My good friend

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He really needs this job

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You saw his attitude just now

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You should think about it

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Take him in

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Boss, I will work hard

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Since you insist

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can stay

290
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thank you, boss

291
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Jian Dan, you really want to work here?

292
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's free accommodation

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not too hard

294
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's good

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
By the way, Jian Dan

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You are back

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you want to tell him?

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Girl, come with me to do the procedures

300
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay?

301
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Okay

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can go first

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Thank you, boss

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Xiao Huan, remember to pack your things

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Okay

306
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Left, left, left, left

307
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Here

308
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Shizi

309
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's play together

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't want to play

311
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't want to play, you can play

312
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Han

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Have you contacted Jian Dan recently?

314
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Han, you are cheating your teammate

315
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't want to play

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I...

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He is back

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why do you mention him?

319
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I just care about him

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Boss's car is broken

321
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I fixed it on the repair shop

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But I have something to do tomorrow

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Can you help me to get it?

324
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay

325
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thank you, I'll go back first

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Bye, Shizi

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Bye

328
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Hello

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm here to get the car

330
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's from the repair shop

331
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's it

332
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Repair shop

333
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Sign here

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Here is the key

336
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Okay

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Jian Dan

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I put the tools you want here

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Okay, thank you

340
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why are you here?

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm here to work

342
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You are not working here, are you?

343
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm here to work as a part-time worker

344
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you need money

345
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can help you

346
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No need, I can earn it myself

347
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You are not suitable for this job

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think it's good

349
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's up to you

350
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Here

351
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
An

352
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let's have a drink

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Cheers

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm not happy

355
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not in the mood

356
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What's wrong with you today?

357
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You are so depressed

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Did you know that

359
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Jian Dan is working in the repair shop?

360
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Didn't Jian Dan go back to his hometown?

361
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I met him on the street yesterday

362
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He was sending flyers to Jian Dan

363
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It seems that he is in need of money

364
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I don't know if he has some trouble

365
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Jian Dan is so hard

366
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Is it because of grandma's illness?

367
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He is now living in the dormitory

368
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There are male employees around

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's too dangerous

370
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I remember after my aunt went abroad

371
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Was her house always empty?

372
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And asked you to find someone to clean it up

373
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Yes

374
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Anyway, he can't come back in a short time

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Now Jian Dan is living in a man's dormitory

376
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How can that work?

377
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm coming

378
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm coming

379
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why are you here?

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Cleaning the house

381
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
The house certificate?

382
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This house belongs to my aunt

383
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
After she went abroad

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
She has been looking for someone to clean it up

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Thank you

386
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't misunderstand

387
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm not here to help you

388
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
But the housekeeper who hired me before

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Resigned from her job

390
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I was just looking for someone

391
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
And I thought of you

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't refuse me now

393
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Think about it

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And answer me

395
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm here

396
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That one just now

397
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Jian Dan

398
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I used up the water

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Use yours

400
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll return it to you later

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
By the way

402
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Two new employees came here tonight

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The staff dormitory can't live here anymore

404
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Maybe I have to squeeze it for you

405
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You clean it up

406
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm leaving

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm leaving

408
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I signed the contract

409
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Here, here

410
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Done

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Here

413
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
If you have such a good thing

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Call me again

415
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll do it next time

416
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You can live here from now on

417
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Remember to close the door and windows at night

418
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Call me if you need anything

419
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Wait a minute

420
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
This is the specialty that grandma asked me to bring you

421
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Thank you for giving grandma medicine

422
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You know it all

423
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I didn't mean to hide it from you

424
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I know

425
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Grandma told me

426
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She asked you not to say it

427
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
How to do this?

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Very simple

429
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Just slice the bacon

430
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Then put it in the pan and steam

431
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Twenty to thirty minutes

432
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Remember not to steam for too long

433
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Too troublesome

434
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You should make it for me

435
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll come over later

436
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't be too idle

437
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm leaving, uncle

438
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Dasheng

439
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I just watched a movie

440
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's go together

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I have an appointment tonight

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm leaving

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What?

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You won't be a monkey again, will you?

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No

446
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm leaving first

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's always like this

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm leaving

449
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I told you to close the windows and windows

450
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why are you opening the door?

451
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You're really here

452
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You're here for real, right?

453
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Need help?

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No, I'm ready

455
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Let's eat

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
This is dried pepper fried bacon

457
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Fried bacon with garlic

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Fried millet with bacon

459
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And bacon and winter bamboo shoots

460
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Try it

461
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Is it good?

462
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
How is it?

463
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Is it good?

464
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Not bad

465
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
But the standard of bacon

466
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There is still a little distance

467
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I haven't cooked for a long time

468
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's rich

469
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Otherwise, it must be better than this

470
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I'm sorry

471
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm sorry

472
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm sorry

473
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm sorry

474
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
When did you learn to cook?

475
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Around ten years old

476
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
At that time, my parents had an accident

477
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
There were only me and grandma left

478
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Grandma is not in good health

479
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
And I have to make money to support my family and take care of me

480
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think it's really hard

481
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So I learned to do housework and cook

482
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
When I was a kid

483
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Grandma really liked the food I cooked

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's a pity that I'm in school now

485
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I haven't cooked for grandma for a long time

486
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Don't worry

487
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Grandma will be fine

488
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
At the worst

489
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'll lose some money

490
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Be your little white mouse

491
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
You will cook for me every day

492
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
When I finish my cooking training

493
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I will cook for grandma

494
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Who wants to cook for you?

495
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You don't know how to cook these dishes, do you?

496
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can cook

497
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
No

498
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I know a lot

499
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm good at making spring rolls

500
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Take it

501
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's delicious

502
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Eat more

503
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Eat more

504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Grandpa, we are leaving

505
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Grandpa, we are leaving

506
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Bye bye

507
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Bye bye

508
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Da Sheng

509
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We finished so early today

510
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Let's go somewhere

511
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,240
I want to go to the

512
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,000
Go buy some oranges

513
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Buy oranges

514
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
What are you doing with oranges?

515
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I bought it to eat

516
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
When did you start to like oranges?

517
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I like oranges

518
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I like oranges

519
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I like oranges

520
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I like oranges

521
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I like oranges

522
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I like oranges

523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I like oranges

524
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Wait a minute

525
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Why are you here again?

526
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Take it

527
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Why do you buy oranges?

528
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Didn't you say that oranges are your favorite dish?

529
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Make it lighter

530
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
How is it?

531
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Is it beautiful?

532
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Thank you

533
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
It's definitely because

534
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
the ingredients you bought are not fresh enough

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The oranges have to beput in mud

536
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Then I will buy it somewhere else

537
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I know a place

538
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's very fresh

539
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The ingredients are quite rich

540
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
Buy some

541
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,360
Why did you order so much meat?

542
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Make barbecue

543
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Can't finish

544
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
Eat it later

545
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
Don't don't don't

546
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Don't order it, it's a waste

547
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
OK, order some more

548
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,080
You can't bake in the future, I can't eat

549
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,560
Why do you always eat every time?

550
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,480
Actually

551
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,640
I have been working on it

552
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
It is best to use this

553
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,960
Yan That

554
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,840
Worked a lot today

555
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,200
Go to eat with us

556
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,520
Are you going?

557
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,720
I heard it will snow tonight

558
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,760
Be careful of cold

559
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,360
All right

560
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,840
See you

561
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,900
Baby, gas is not telling

562
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,540
Okay.

563
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,140
Let's take a look at the barbecue restaurant.

564
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,020
There's a discount.

565
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,900
Let's take a look at the barbecue restaurant.

566
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,580
Dr. Han, please have a barbecue.

567
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,180
Okay.

568
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,140
It's settled.

569
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,300
Let's have barbecue tonight.

570
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,380
Okay.

571
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,060
The weather forecast said it would snow tonight.

572
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,900
Really?

573
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,940
I heard that if you're with someone you like,

574
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,220
you can grow old together.

575
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,580
It's so romantic.

576
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,820
Dasheng,

577
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,940
let's have dinner tonight.

578
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,740
I'll have dinner...

579
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,900
It's the last day of the volunteer activity.

580
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,100
You're the leader.

581
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,940
You should organize a dinner for everyone.

582
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,700
After all,

583
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,980
there won't be many chances to get together in the future.

584
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,620
Okay.

585
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,460

Okay. No problem.

Hello.

590
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,100

00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,700
Please look at our menu.

592
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,180
Order later.

593
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:05,660
Okay.

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,460

King of enjoy

604
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,220
Pandemonium

605
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,160
Excuse me.

606
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,760
Excuse me.

607
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,480
There are many people in the new store today.

608
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,000
Do you think it's convenient for us to have a table?

609
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,000
No need.

610
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,440
I won't eat today.

611
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Thank you.

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,960
Here you are.

00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:02,760
Enough.

614
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm afraid you're too tired and too tired to eat.

615
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,680
Have a bowl of porridge.

616
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,400
Chicken.

617
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,600

624
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,160
I'm leaving.

625
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,800
Everyone is on the line now.

626
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,160
You can't leave in advance.

627
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,040
Senior, Senior.

628
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,680
Today's event is so meaningful.

629
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
If there's another event,

630
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,080

631
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,880

642
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,220
Your wish will come true

643
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:12,180
Suddenly getting closer and felt like dying

644
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,980
The memory is too temporary

645
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,780
Not painful, not itchy, but scattered several times

646
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,980
Where should I start

647
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,180
To touch the past

648
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,580
Some look, some words

649
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,580
I haven't missed it yet, my eyes are already wet

650
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,180
Red as a poem

651
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,180
Those young days

652
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,380
Ordinary but interesting

653
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,380
In the gap of time, secretly kept

654
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:01,580
Those broken pasts

655
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,380
Blurred names

656
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:12,980
Still good, we once had each other

657
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:29,980
Those young days

658
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,180
The memory is too temporary

659
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,580

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,580
To touch the past

667
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,980
Some look, some words

668
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,980
I haven't missed it yet, my eyes are already wet
