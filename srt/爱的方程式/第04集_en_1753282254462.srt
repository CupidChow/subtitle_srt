1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't care

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Have a smile to answer

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Love by Hypnotic

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Tell me,

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
how have you been

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
during my absence?

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Just like before.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But we've met

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
a very interesting girl recently.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Really? Who?

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
A person

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
who has nothing to do with it.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Han Yansheng!

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's her.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can sign

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the contract for me.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The shooting of the group

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
is really important to me.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is a private gathering.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please leave.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
As long as you sign,

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll leave immediately.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You mean

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
you won't leave

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
if I don't sign?

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Dasheng,

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you have to be polite

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
when you talk to girls.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm not.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello,

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
my name is Gu Wentong.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Dasheng, Monkey and I

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
are from the same class.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I just came back from the exchange class.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's my first time to meet you.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm happy to meet you.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello, Senior, my name is Jian Dan.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Jian Dan?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it the one

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
who pushed Dasheng

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
into the water

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
in the forum?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
it's cuter than the photo.

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's not stand here and talk.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's go in.

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come on.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's go.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Come on in.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's go.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go in quickly.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I brought you all gifts.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's go.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've prepared gifts

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
for all of you.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Here.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Dasheng,

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
this is a digital puzzle.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It might be a small piece for you.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But it's helpful

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to speed up the solving.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Try it.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Thanks.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Monkey,

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
yours.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's mine?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I like the taste the most.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Right?

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
En Tong, you're so sweet.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the handbook

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
that Yuan Sen has been

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
wanting.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please give it to him.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
En Tong is so sweet.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I thank you on behalf of Yuan Sen.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're welcome.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not as good as you said.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lion,

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
this is for you.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you remember

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I've been saying I wanted this book?

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I remember everything you said.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thanks.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's simple.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I didn't expect

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
to meet you today.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I didn't prepare a gift for you.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's okay. I don't need it.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, you can't.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You were in a hurry

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
when you came here.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The bangs are a little messy.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I happened to think of

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
a new hair clip

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in my bag.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Don't bother.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Look.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think it suits you.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Try it.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Here.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Here.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's done.

108
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wow.

109
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Isn't it cute?

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's really cute.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's simple.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think you can try

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
this hairstyle more.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's really cute.

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I think so too.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's pretty.

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is the registration and registration of the book ready?

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's done.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I have to report to

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the music department teacher.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's almost time.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have to go now.

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I won't talk to you anymore.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

125
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Bye, Senior.

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay. Bye, Jian Dan.

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bye.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye.

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bye, Jian Dan.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Senior.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wait a minute.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Jian Dan.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's wrong?

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Your hair clip.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I told you I would give it to you.

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't have a reason

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to take it as a gift from you.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay. I'll take it back.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm leaving, Senior.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Bye.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bye.

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to talk to you

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
about the book signing event.

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Move away.

146
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have nothing to talk about.

147
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You have to tell me

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
why you don't sign it.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Have you ever had a book signing experience?

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you know how to sign?

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't know how to do it yet.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But I can learn.

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You don't know anything?

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just want to learn.

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm not a good student.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm not a good student.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not a good student.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not a good student.

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You don't know anything

160
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and you don't want to start a rock climbing club?

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No one can do anything.

162
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
How do you know my name?

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm curious.

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why do you want to start a rock climbing club?

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I...

166
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm...

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me hear you out.

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You want to learn

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and earn a scholarship, right?

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How can I give you the place

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
if you don't have a goal

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and don't know rock climbing skills?

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You don't have the right to do that.

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Tell me.

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How can I be qualified?

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Come with me.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
As long as you can climb up there,

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll sign it immediately.

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No problem.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dongguan, you're going to jump off the umbrella?

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't even know how to wear a protective gear.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You want to be the president of the rock climbing club?

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Give up.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Rock climbing is not as simple as you think.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I know it's not that simple.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I will never give up.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But don't regret it.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If I climb up there,

189
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you have to sign it for me.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Don't worry about reminding you.

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Rock climbing needs to wear professional rock climbing shoes.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll give you a lesson.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Rock climbing needs to wear professional rock climbing shoes.

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Rock climbing needs to wear professional rock climbing shoes.

195
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Give me some water.

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Wait until you reach the next rock.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let me give you more.

198
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Just work harder.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you know that?

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Come on.

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's simple.

202
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Come on.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000

Come on.

It's simple.

Come on.

207
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Come on.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're so fat.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm just crying.

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I just like myself.

212
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm just crying.

213
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000

00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I just like myself.

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I just like myself.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I just like myself.

235
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I just like myself.

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just like myself.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000

I just like myself.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Da Sheng.

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I thought you said

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that you wanted to introduce

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You lost your heart.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come here.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have something to announce.

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
From today onwards,

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
our swimming club

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,080
From today, our swimming club will have a new member.

250
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,560
Introduce yourself.

251
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,480
Applause.

252
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,280
Hello, everyone. My name is Gu Entong.

253
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,240
I'm happy to join our swimming club from today.

254
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm a member of the big family.

255
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,600
I don't know everyone's favorite now.

256
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,840
I just picked some snacks.

257
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,360
I hope you like it.

258
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,480
So great.

259
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,360
Wait a minute.

260
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,720
Give me another one.

261
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

262
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,880
Entong.

263
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,760
Didn't I tell you that you're the most beautiful and the most delicate girl I've ever seen?

264
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,280
If I were your boyfriend,

265
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,400
I would be a dream girl.

266
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,480
Han Yansheng.

267
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm ready.

268
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Let's go.

269
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,480
What are they talking about?

270
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,560
Let's not guess it ourselves.

271
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
We'll know when we go there.

272
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,480
I'm not going. I have to work.

273
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,680
Come on.

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,480
Let's go.

275
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,440
Let's go.

276
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,240
Let's go.

277
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Let's go.

278
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Part 2

279
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,040
Han?

280
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,600
What's the problem with you and your boyfriend?

281
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,480
Why does he ask you to come and see his play?

282
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,040
He wants bigger shows.

283
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,320
to use the second floor.

284
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,960
I've made a deal with him.

285
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
If he can climb to the top of the wall,

286
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,400
I'll lend him the site.

287
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,920
You want to set up a rock climbing club?

288
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,640
You have ambition.

289
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,880
Watch carefully.

290
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,480
皓嫁

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
Fresh.

292
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,680
It tastes good.

293
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,520
to stay true to ourselves.

294
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
Don't cry.

295
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,160
You'll finally see the truth.

296
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,200
Are you serious?

297
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,660
You're trying to save me?

298
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,200
She's like a에A loved one,

299
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,000
who plays hardn we'll be afraid.

300
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
No, I'm an EIA.

301
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,760
Miss Li.

302
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,560
Fly.

303
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,840
You guys are quick.

304
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,680
Like us.

305
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,560
Let him.

306
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
What?

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,400
It's too big.

308
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,600
It's broken.

309
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,320
Be careful.

310
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:56,760
Jian Dan.

311
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,320
Be careful.

312
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:57,880
It's broken.

313
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,760
It's too dangerous.

314
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,240
Jian Dan.

315
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,040
Jian Dan.

316
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,640
Don't fight.

317
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,480
It's broken.

318
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,120
Jian Dan.

319
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,640
Be careful.

320
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,400
Come down.

321
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,200
Come down, Jian Dan.

322
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,880
Be careful.

323
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,160
You can step on the right foot.

324
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,880
It's stuck.

325
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,360
Come on.

326
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,800
Come on.

327
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,640
Come on, Jian Dan.

328
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,440
Come on, Jian Dan.

329
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,520
The right foot.

330
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,880
Right foot.

331
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,680
OK.

332
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,280
Good.

333
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:25,720
Watch it.

334
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,200
Good.

335
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,840
Come on.

336
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,160
Come on.

337
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,960
You can do it.

338
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,800
Come on.

339
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,520
Good.

340
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Good.

341
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,800
Good.

342
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,320
Good.

343
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,880
Good.

344
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,520
Good.

345
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,400
I did it.

346
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,000
Good.

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,520
Good.

348
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,920
The meeting of our club is about to start.

349
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
We have to go now.

350
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,440
OK.

351
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

352
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,160
Proceed to the presentation room.

353
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,120
Jian Dan.

354
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,040
You made me feel jealous.

355
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,720
Don't talk nonsense.

356
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,640
It was an accident.

357
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,160
What accident?

358
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,920
Check it.

359
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,920
You two have become

360
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,400
the top in this new Shuang Li Regardless.

361
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,360
I'm satisfied.

362
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,320
The iron man even set the voting.

363
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Now, Tong Yan's CP is higher than Shengnan's CP.

364
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,960
Tong Yan's CP?

365
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,480
What's the point of it?

366
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,840
Gu Wentong and Han Yansheng are called Tong Yan's CP.

367
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,080
You and Han Yansheng are called Shengnan's CP.

368
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,320
The netizens are too good.

369
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
One vote.

370
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,400
Then you say one more vote.

371
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,640
You have your own phone.

372
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,440
I...

373
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,600
We can't lose to Gu Wentong in the momentum.

374
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,080
Gu Wentong, listen to me.

375
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,080
You're kidding me.

376
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm kidding.

377
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,320
Wentong, what do you think of the CP incident

378
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
that's been going on in school lately?

379
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
It's just a gossip.

380
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,320
Everyone is just playing around.

381
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,440
Why don't you do your own thing first?

382
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,120
Don't worry about me.

383
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
I'll do it myself later.

384
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,160
Okay.

385
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,400
Xia Mo.

386
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,680
Are you going to regret it?

387
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm warning you.

388
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,560
According to the rules of the conference,

389
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,400
if you fail to guess the members above 5,

390
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,880
you'll be fired.

391
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,720
Don't worry.

392
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,920
I'll definitely buy it.

393
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,100
I'll

394
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,680
buy it later.

395
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,200
Okay.

396
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,040
Everyone!

397
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,600
I...

398
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,320
Tomorrow,

399
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,080
my booth where students with reminds sport

400
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:53,680
at the superficial photo three

401
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
will take effect like your demo.

402
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,640
Wait.

403
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
Don't talk.

404
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,600
Give me a card.

405
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,600
This card is a power card.

406
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
It represents your personal charm

407
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
and determination to pursue success.

408
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,600
This card means that you have the power

409
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
to face all difficulties.

410
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Because your heart is full of love,

411
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
it also means that

412
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
a relationship can develop.

413
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Two people can listen to each other

414
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
and feel that there is no limit.

415
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Good, Jian Dan.

416
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Business and peach blossom are all so forgetful.

417
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Tell me,

418
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
is there anything good to tell me?

419
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
What?

420
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Where did the peach blossom fortune come from?

421
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
But I do have good news to tell you.

422
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
Han Shan gave me a letter.

423
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,600
This is much better than peach blossom fortune.

424
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Jian Dan, put on your clothes.

425
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Let's celebrate. I'll treat you.

426
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Celebrate in two days.

427
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
I have to make the new poster first.

428
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Happy Day

429
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Hey. Are you interested in the rock climbing club?

430
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,600
Have a look.

431
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey. Are you interested in the rock climbing club?

432
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Take one and take a look.

433
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,280
Let me see.

434
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,480
Sheng,

435
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,960
the simple one looks quite difficult.

436
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
Do you want to join the photo shoot?

437
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,960
Shall we go help her?

438
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,560
There's a contact information below.

439
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,200
Classmate,

440
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
are you interested in joining the photo shoot?

441
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
Take one.

442
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,120
What era is it now?

443
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
You even use the old-fashioned way

444
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
like sending a leaflet.

445
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,920
What method do I use?

446
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,760
It's up to you.

447
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,840
You don't know innovation.

448
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,480
You're destined to find someone else.

449
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,240
You're arrogant and unreasonable.

450
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,160
You're destined to be liked by no one.

451
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,360
Sheng,

452
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
Sheng has always been like this.

453
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,800
He never meant to hurt you.

454
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,080
Don't take it to heart.

455
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,120
Sheng,

456
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,760
we're going to eat.

457
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Let's go.

458
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,320
You go ahead.

459
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,200
I have something to do.

460
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,920
I'll go first.

461
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:42,920
Senior,

462
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,600
do you have a letter?

463
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,000
Jin Dan.

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,760
What's wrong?

465
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,400
You can't find her?

466
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,480
I didn't find any.

467
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,000
Han.

468
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,080
What's wrong with you?

469
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,200
Why are you all so sad?

470
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,320
Us?

471
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,960
Yes.

472
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,760
You and Jin Dan.

473
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,520
Her recruitment is not going well.

474
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Why are you all so sad?

475
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,480
As expected,

476
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,520
she's destined to be liked by no one.

477
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,800
What's your good idea?

478
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,080
Tell me.

479
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,560
Tell me.

480
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,360
Tell me.

481
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,560
Jin Dan.

482
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,920
What are you doing?

483
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,640
It's been two days

484
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,200
and no one has signed up.

485
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,840
If we don't get it

486
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,000
as soon as it's established,

487
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,240
we'll be disbanded.

488
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,760
No.

489
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,560
Look.

490
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,400
The message you sent is limited.

491
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
The scope of publicity

492
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,760
and expansion is limited.

493
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,400
Why don't you consider

494
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,560
using the Internet for publicity?

495
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,520
Internet publicity?

496
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

497
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
Look at your gossip with Han.

498
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,000
It's a piece of cake.

499
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,480
I see.

500
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,240
Thanks, Monkey.

501
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,280
It's nothing.

502
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
You're welcome.

503
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,560
You should thank another person.

504
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,520
What?

505
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,840
Nothing.

506
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,360
Can you help me again?

507
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,400
What do you think?

508
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,680
Stop.

509
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,760
Attention, everyone.

510
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,440
Today's training is over.

511
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,680
Go to the changing room and change your clothes.

512
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,280
I'll take you to a place.

513
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,320
Come on.

514
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,200
Move.

515
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
Do you want to be disbanded?

516
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,800
No.

517
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,760
Today's training is over.

518
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,080
Go to the changing room and change your clothes.

519
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,440
Come on.

520
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,240
Come on.

521
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
Move.

522
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,120
Hello, everyone.

523
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,320
Welcome to our climbing club.

524
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,480
I'm the president of the climbing club, Jiantan.

525
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,800
To let you know more about climbing

526
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,920
and like climbing,

527
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,760
our club has organized

528
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
a prize-winning activity.

529
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,400
Do you see the box?

530
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,000
I see it.

531
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,240
No matter who it is,

532
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,160
as long as you get that box,

533
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,920
you can win the prize.

534
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,720
It's so big.

535
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,560
Shouldn't we continue training at this time?

536
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,920
Where is he?

537
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Good.

538
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,040
Good.

539
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,080
You may not know much about the climbing project.

540
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,360
It's based on the advanced sports projects

541
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,840
developed by climbing.

542
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,040
Because it can improve our coordination ability and flexibility,

543
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
it is also called

544
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,080
the ballet on the rock

545
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,360
and the art of jumping on the wall.

546
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:05,920
Good.

547
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,000
Climbing

548
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,520
not only can improve our concentration, confidence

549
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
and self-confidence,

550
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,240
but more importantly,

551
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
we can win the prize.

552
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,960
It's not a big deal

553
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,680
to know about climbing.

554
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,520
What are you talking about?

555
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,480
Nothing.

556
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,360
Who wants to try?

557
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,200
It's too high.

558
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,280
I don't dare to climb.

559
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,160
Right.

560
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,880
What if you fall down?

561
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,800
I won't fall down.

562
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,600
The one above is dangerous.

563
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,040
No.

564
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,120
There is a rope.

565
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,440
It's too dangerous.

566
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,320
Let me do it.

567
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,440
You're so mean, Monkey.

568
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,640
Watch me.

569
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,120
Go.

570
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,280
Put on the equipment.

571
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,040
Come on, Monkey.

572
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,000
Be careful.

573
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,360
Safety first.

574
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,680
Don't worry.

575
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,360
It's done.

576
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,920
It's done.

577
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,080
Go.

578
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,200
Come on, Monkey.

579
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,760
Come on, Monkey.

580
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,560
Come on, Monkey.

581
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,320
Come on, Monkey.

582
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
Come on, Monkey.

583
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,200
Come on, come on.

584
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,320
Come on.

585
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
Red, come on.

586
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,560
Come on.

587
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,360
OK.

588
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,600
Red, come on.

589
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Come on, Red.

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,000
Hurry up, Red.

591
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,280
Come on, Red.

592
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,280
Come on, Red.

593
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,920
Come on.

594
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,280
Hurry up.

595
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
Come on, Red.

596
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,800
Hurry up.

597
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,440
Hurry up.

598
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,000
Come on, Dinge.

599
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Come on, Red.

600
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,880
Hurry up.

601
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,800
Come on, Red.

602
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,000
Come on, Ahh.

603
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,280
Come on, Red.

604
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,980
Hurry up.

605
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,880
Come on, Red.

606
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,880
Come on, Red.

607
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,440
Come on, Mr. Lu!

608
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,360
Come on, Mr. Lu!

609
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,960
Come on, Mr. Lu!

610
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,760
Come on, Mr. Lu!

611
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,000
Come on, Mr. Lu!

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Come on, Mr. Lu!

613
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,440
Monkey, are you okay?

614
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,480
I...

615
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,960
I'm afraid of heights.

616
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,480
It's safe to lock the door.

617
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,720
You'll fall down if you let go.

618
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,160
I dare not.

619
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:13,960
Oh, no.

620
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,720
I'm afraid of heights.

621
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,480
Monkey, hold on tight.

622
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,120
Don't let go.

623
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,160
Wait for me.

624
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:24,680
Okay.

625
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,600
You...

626
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,520
Okay, get your head up.

627
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,560
Be safe.

628
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,920
Okay, come on down.

629
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,860
Yeah!

630
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,080
Here!

631
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,760
Mr. Lu, monkey!

632
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,560
Have fun!

633
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,120
Are you fine, Mr. Lu?

634
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,680
How?

635
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,280
Great!

636
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Yellow bear!

637
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,580
Mr. Chen.

638
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:15,940
Hurry up!

639
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,940
We're almost there.

640
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,800
Be careful!

641
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,580
Be careful!

642
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,920
Hang in there!

643
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:32,040
He has a black

644
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:32,800
Put me down first.

645
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,540
Prof. He has a black

646
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,560
Mr. He.

647
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,920
It's three times.

648
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,820
Are you tired?

649
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,620
One, two, three.

650
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,940
Be careful.

651
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,420
Are you okay, Monkey?

652
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,260
Jintan, I'm sorry.

653
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,660
I didn't help you.

654
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,020
It's okay.

655
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,060
Huan, don't take it off.

656
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,540
Why?

657
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,740
Jintan, wait for me.

658
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,580
Huan, come here.

659
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,380
I'm doing this for Jintan.

660
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,340
I've been climbing for half an hour.

661
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,300
People will think

662
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,140
it's a terrible thing to climb for a day.

663
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,340
Jintan is more annoying.

664
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,100
I'm responsible for

665
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,620
my bad deeds.

666
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,300
What does it have to do with me?

667
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,700
Of course it has to do with you.

668
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,620
Don't forget.

669
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,420
You mentioned the online publicity.

670
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,420
How is it?

671
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,260
I'm sorry.

672
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,180
Thank you.

673
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:59,980
Jintan, although I didn't help you,

674
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,900
I've prepared a surprise for you.

675
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,380
Rifleize

676
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,420
The name is still the same

677
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:49,420
We once had each other

678
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Those young days are gone

679
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:00,460
The heart is not needed to be

680
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,460
But one day the promise becomes a luxury

681
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,460
Those broken pasts

682
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,460
It has never been a complete life

683
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Colorful paint
