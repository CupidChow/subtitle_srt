The Long Ballad

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Han Yansheng.

4
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's really you.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why are you here?

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know it.

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you so weird?

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you think I want to come with you to a date?

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just go.

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't block me.

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't come if you can't hear me.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's the big deal if you come and go?

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The performance has started.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You go now

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
not only to disturb others

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but also to disrespect the performers.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Long Ballad

19
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You haven't left yet?

21
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can fall asleep in such a high-end concert.

22
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You are really unbearable.

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You are so annoying.

24
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You like me every day.

25
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm so tired because you like me every day.

26
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And,

27
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
the concert is over.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Why don't you ask me to leave?

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She is too tired.

30
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let her sleep a little longer.

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
After you finish the umbrella,

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you can call her.

33
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Are we familiar?

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Very good.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Goodbye if you are not familiar.

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where did you get this car?

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Over there.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But you are not so lucky.

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is the last one.

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is it so unlucky?

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
For the sake of your poor life,

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll take you back.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Get in the car.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't need it.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm leaving.

46
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Then I'm leaving.

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the last chance for you.

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can leave or not.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even if I leave until dawn,

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will never get in your car.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Slow down.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You are over-reacting.

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are dressed like a lady

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but you are a man.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Did you do it on purpose?

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then I tell you,

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you can't tell anyone

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
about the car I'm driving today.

59
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll think about it.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What can you think about?

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Give me the helmet.

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Slow down.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Be careful.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Prepare the speed bump.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Slow down.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Okay.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Although the process is not very pleasant,

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to thank you for giving me a ride.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't give me the tickets

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
for the concert anymore.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The school gave you a scholarship

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
to encourage you to study hard.

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
If you give me another ride,

76
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I won't come.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When did I give you a ticket?

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Stop pretending.

79
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The tickets for the concert

80
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
were found under the photo frame

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
next to the broken trophy.

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It happened to be your seat.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If it wasn't you,

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
who else could it be?

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
簡單,

86
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
this is the ticket for the concert tonight.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Take it to Sanda Xin

88
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and pay the bill.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I have no income.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And the ticket is so expensive.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You should go and see it yourself.

92
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We are classmates and roommates.

93
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you don't take it,

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
it means you still mind

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the dyeing hair cream.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
簡單, take it.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The tickets for the concert are hard to buy.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Since Yue Tangtang is so rich,

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
let's keep it

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and change our mood.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay, thank you.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's really not you.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I won't take the scholarship

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and do such a boring thing.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I won't buy tickets

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for the biggest,

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
self-loving and self-reliant person.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Since you hate me so much,

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
why are you still

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in the swimming club?

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why are you still in the swimming club?

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can quit.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fine.

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yue Tangtang, you framed me.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What did I do?

116
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Stop pretending.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
When you gave the tickets to Han Yansheng,

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you accidentally broke his trophy.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You were afraid that he would find out

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and dare not go to the concert.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So he gave me the ticket

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and I carried it for you.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Am I right?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yue Tangtang,

125
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
this is why you gave the ticket to簡單.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Who said that?

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I gave you the ticket with kindness.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You framed me.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And that trophy,

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
do you have any evidence?

131
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The ticket in Han Yansheng's hand

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
is the best evidence.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I have evidence.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Anyway, Han Yansheng and I

136
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
are sure that you did it.

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Han Yansheng?

138
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Except for the trophy,

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
my apology letter

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
was also exchanged for

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Han Yansheng's emoji, right?

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why is this me?

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't try to deny it.

144
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That day, except for you, me, Mi Fen,

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
there was no one else in the dorm.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These are all your guesses.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where is the evidence?

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Isn't it simple to get evidence?

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
There are only a few stores

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that can print photos at school.

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can ask around and you'll know.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So what if it's me?

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You asked for it.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If it wasn't for you,

155
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I would have quit the swimming club.

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Huo Haiqing,

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you're so annoying.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You can dislike me,

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
but you can't frame me.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't ask you about the past.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If you ever come to me again,

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
don't blame me for being rude to you.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm afraid you can't do it.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I...

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Jiannan, where are you going?

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to the library.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're not going to the swimming club?

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not going there anymore.

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,720
Hello, can I use your phone?

173
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,440
Okay.

174
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,160
Thank you.

175
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,960
Hello, grandma.

176
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
Jiang Dan, what's wrong with your phone?

177
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,120
It's broken.

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,280
I'll fix it.

179
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,080
It's broken?

180
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,920
I'll fix it.

181
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,840
I'll fix it.

182
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,720
I'll fix it.

183
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,640
I'll fix it.

184
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
I'll fix it.

185
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,400
I'll fix it.

186
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
I'll fix it.

187
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,320
I'll fix it.

188
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,240
I'll fix it.

189
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
What's wrong with your phone?

190
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,800
My phone is turned off.

191
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,760
And the quality signal is not good.

192
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,320
So I can't get through to you.

193
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,480
Don't worry.

194
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,360
Jiang Dan,

195
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,520
how are you doing with your classmates?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,440
My classmates like your specialty.

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,960
How's the club?

198
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,040
Club?

199
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,640
You know about the club?

200
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,200
I took over the swimming club in our school.

201
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
I'm the happiest girl in the club.

202
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
Everyone likes me.

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,880
Do you have enough money?

204
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,040
I have enough money.

205
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,960
You just need to take care of yourself.

206
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,640
Okay.

207
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,680
I'm still in the library.

208
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,880
I'll hang up now.

209
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,760
I'll call you next time.

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Okay.

211
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Thank you.

212
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,460

Doctor Wu

214
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm sorry, a child collateral

215
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,720
甚麼事啊

216
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,000

219
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,160
guessed

220
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Is Yue Tang Tang and Jian Nan from the same department?

221
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,800
Same department?

222
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
And same dorm?

223
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,640
Send me Yue Tang Tang's phone number.

224
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,800
Hurry.

225
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,680
Why do you want Yue Tang Tang's phone number?

226
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm here.

227
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,480
Who's that?

228
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,480
It's me, Han Yansheng.

229
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,360
Han Yansheng?

230
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Why are you looking for me?

231
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,080
Let Jian Nan answer the phone.

232
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:07,920
Jian Nan?

233
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,880
Let her answer the phone.

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,960
I have something to talk to her.

235
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,000
Jian Nan.

236
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,120
Stop it.

237
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,400
Come out and answer the phone.

238
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,520
Who's that?

239
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,640
Write a return application to me.

240
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,880
Three thousand words.

241
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,640
What?

242
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,000
Three thousand words?

243
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,080
Why don't you just...

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,560
Jian Nan.

245
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,120
Why are you looking for me?

246
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
I've already retired.

247
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,720
Why do you want me to write a return application to her?

248
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,960
She's crazy.

249
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,920
When are you going to find her?

250
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,680
I'll go with you.

251
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,200
Wait.

252
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,600
Why do you call me when you want to find her?

253
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,640
Three thousand words.

254
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,320
How do I write it?

255
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,720
Here.

256
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
The return application you asked for.

257
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,320
Three thousand words.

258
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,040
One word is not enough.

259
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,640
One word is not enough.

260
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,080
It's not qualified.

261
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I'll write it back.

262
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,240
Did you see it?

263
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,120
You said it's not qualified.

264
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,680
I said it's not qualified.

265
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,360
It's not qualified.

266
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,960
When you write it and it's qualified,

267
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,160
it's considered a real return application.

268
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,080
You...

269
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,760
Whether the return application is qualified or not,

270
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,400
I won't come to the swimming pool again.

271
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,520
Stop right there.

272
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,240
Excuse me.

273
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,240
Do you need anything else?

274
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,480
Here you are.

275
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Why do you give me my phone?

276
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,120
I broke your phone last time.

277
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,720
Take this with you.

278
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,720
I don't want it.

279
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
Do you still want to be in a mess with me?

280
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
Who wants to be in a mess with you?

281
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,080
Or do you want a new phone?

282
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
I'll take the phone.

283
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,880
But I'll pay you back slowly.

284
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,240
Gypsy

285
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,080
This youth is a difficult way to go

286
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Also express with sincerity

287
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Grow up with sincerity

288
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,080
She is a flower of stubbornness

289
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Will you be afraid?

290
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
She also asked herself

291
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Zipadiya

292
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,080
The one who is passionate

293
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,080
Only the sound

294
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,080
Will melt with the sound

295
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Zipadiya

296
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
The one who is beautiful

297
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Love her

298
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,080
Answer with a smile

299
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,080
Zipadiya

300
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,080
The one who is passionate

301
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Only the sound

302
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Will melt with the sound

303
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
Zipadiya

304
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,080
The one who is beautiful

305
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,080
Love her

306
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,080
Answer with a smile

307
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Simple, go to eat, I'm starving

308
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Chief, take a break

309
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Lao Han, here

310
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,080
This simple is not here

311
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,080
I always feel like it's missing

312
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm going to class

313
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,080
Such training is all yours

314
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,080
What?

315
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,080
I'm going to the gym

316
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm going to the gym

317
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Such training is all yours

318
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Lao Han, you

319
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
Lao Han is really cold

320
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm coming back

321
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm coming back

322
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,080
Next week is going to the selection class

323
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Ni Fan, what class did you choose

324
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Movie, art, theater

325
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,080
This class only needs to watch the movie

326
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,080
Write after reading, there is no exam

327
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
How about it, do you know

328
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,080
What did you choose

329
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Applied mathematics

330
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,080
You actually choose applied mathematics

331
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
This class is very high

332
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080
I know, but you didn't hear

333
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,080
Professor Wang of this class is a typical king

334
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,080
The ranking of the class is the first

335
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,080
Every year, the students in his hands are countless

336
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Is there such an exaggeration

337
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
There is more exaggeration than this

338
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I heard that one year the principal asked him to talk

339
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
As a result, he said

340
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
You actually treat me like this

341
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Then I will make this more difficult

342
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
The result is more difficult

343
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
How difficult are you

344
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
The pass rate is only ten percent

345
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Really a king of magic

346
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,080
I didn't expect that in those years

347
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
Someone else took it out

348
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Professor, this scumbag

349
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,080
Is a new student of psychology

350
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Hello, Professor Wang

351
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Professor Wang, thank you for helping me unload

352
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,080
I have no other questions

353
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Wait a minute

354
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
What you just said

355
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Data is wrong

356
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
The pass rate was not ten percent

357
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Is five percent

358
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Sixty-one people in the class

359
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Only three people are qualified

360
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
簡單, this is too scary

361
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Are you sure you choose applied mathematics

362
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Isn't there a five percent pass rate?

363
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,080
How are you so great

364
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,080
I will beat you

365
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
It's over

366
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,080
what

367
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
The school is trying to encourage everyone

368
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
To actively participate in the club activities

369
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Increased the club activities

370
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,080
In the final score

371
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,080
What about your club bonus

372
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,080
Will it affect your scholarship selection?

373
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,080
You said if I go back to the club now

374
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
Will Han Yingsheng kick me out?

375
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,080
No

376
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
Because he won't let you in

377
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm kidding with you

378
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,080
He doesn't want our other clubs

379
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,080
Why can't we go?

380
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,080
The recruitment time of other clubs has passed

381
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,080
Won't recruit people in my club

382
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Look at this general club

383
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,080
At this moment, it will definitely not recruit people

384
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
What if it's a new club

385
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,080
You go back to the school forum

386
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,080
Maybe we will meet

387
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,080
Right

388
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,080
In the creation of a new club

389
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,080
You are like our club

390
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,080
It was just established last year

391
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,080
What do you think

392
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,080
Sorry

393
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
You want to create a film studio application

394
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,080
We can't pass for the time being

395
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,080
The scene of the transfer club is now

396
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,080
It's led by the swimming club

397
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
So

398
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,080
It must be authorized by the swimming club president Han Yingsheng

399
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
To sign

400
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,080
Do you still want me to beg him?

401
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Han Yingsheng

402
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Dr. Han

403
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
The swimming club is a training center

404
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Innocent people and others are not allowed to enter

405
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
I have something else to talk to you

406
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
I have class

407
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
No time

408
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
Monkey

409
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Wait

410
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
Not

411
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,080
Han Yingsheng

412
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Old Han is like this

413
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,080
Don't mind

414
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
I went to let the students take classes

415
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
I am unlucky

416
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
Han Yingsheng

417
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,080
I lent you my book last time

418
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Go

419
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,080
Thanks

420
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
You are welcome

421
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
Why are you here?

422
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
I didn't

423
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
I am here for class

424
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
What do you want

425
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,080
I ask you to sign

426
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,080
Give the scene of the second floor of the swimming club back to the swimming club

427
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,080
The swimming club has been disbanded

428
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
That's right

429
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,080
As long as you sign the authorization

430
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,080
The swimming club can be re-established immediately

431
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
You are going to set up a swimming club

432
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Now only the scene is missing

433
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,080
You don't have to waste your time

434
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
I won't sign

435
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
The swimming club on the second floor of the swimming club

436
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,080
You belong to the swimming club

437
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
At that time, it was only for swimming club to be managed by the director

438
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
Now the shooting is re-established

439
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Return to the swimming club is reasonable

440
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Why don't you sign

441
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,080
Since I am the director

442
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Then I have the right to choose who to give the scene to

443
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
And you are not within my selection range

444
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
You are trying to get away from the trouble

445
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
I am not

446
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
Whatever you think

447
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
What should I do

448
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,080
You can sign the authorization

449
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Class is over

450
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Today's class is over

451
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
This is my mailbox

452
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,080
If you have any questions about today's class

453
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
You can send me an email

454
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Can you continue talking now

455
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Excuse me

456
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
Professor Chu

457
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Let me see

458
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Alright

459
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,840
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,440
Han.

461
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,200
Han, why are you so late?

462
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
You've ruined my

463
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
You've been waiting for a long time, haven't you?

464
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Of course.

465
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
The usual things are always very hard.

466
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
You have to wait a while.

467
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
En Tong will be here soon.

468
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
He's here.

469
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,460
The

470
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Everyone, long time no see.

471
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Long time no see.

472
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Look, the goddess is the goddess.

473
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
She's been beautiful since she was a child.

474
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Welcome back.

475
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
Thank you.

476
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I've been a exchange student for a year.

477
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
I miss you so much.

478
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
I see so many

479
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
The layout is all prepared for me.

480
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
This is the credit of the heir.

481
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
We don't dare to take credit for the credit of the person.

482
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Thank you, Heir.

483
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
It's good that you like it.

484
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
By the way, I also prepared this for you.

485
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
The life of Haida is difficult.

486
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I've been gone for a year.

487
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
I don't need this.

488
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
The change of Haida has been great this year.

489
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
It's a new canteen.

490
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
And then the address of the Qin Fang has been moved.

491
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
I have to see.

492
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Italian noodles are on the third floor of the new canteen.

493
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,200
Sushi is on the second floor of the old canteen.

494
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
And milk tea is on the first floor of the new canteen.

495
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,200
These are all my favorite.

496
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,200
And the new Qin Fang has been changed to the main building of the musical.

497
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
It's all the information I need.

498
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
Heir, you're considerate.

499
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
It's good that you like it.

500
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I like it very much.

501
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Why didn't I see Yuan Sen?

502
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Where is he?

503
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
He's out of the house.

504
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
Okay, tell me.

505
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
How have you been during my absence?

506
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
Just like before.

507
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,200
But we recently met a very interesting girl.

508
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,200
Really? Who?

509
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,200
Just a person who has nothing to do with it.

510
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
Han Yansheng.

511
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,200
When I first met you

512
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I didn't miss a word

513
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,200
My eyes are red like a poem

514
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Those young days

515
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I'm tired but interesting

516
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,200
In the gap of time

517
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I quietly didn't know

518
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Those broken pasts

519
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
The vague name

520
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Fortunately, we once had each other

521
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Those young days

522
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm tired but interesting

523
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
In the gap of time

524
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,200
I quietly didn't know

525
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Those broken pasts

526
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,200
The vague name

527
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Fortunately, we once had each other

528
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Those young days

529
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm tired but interesting

530
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
In the gap of time

531
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I quietly didn't know

532
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Those broken pasts

533
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
The vague name

534
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Fortunately, we once had each other

535
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
Those broken pasts

536
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,200
The vague name

537
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Fortunately, we once had each other

538
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Those broken pasts

539
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
The vague name

540
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Fortunately, we once had each other

541
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Those broken pasts
