I'm sorry.

They didn't mean to lie to you.

18
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,480
They did it to help me.

19
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:16,760
Don't be mad.

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560

we shouldn't interfere too much.

44

If it's about Jian Dan,

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,840
save it.

65
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:03,160
I'm your aunt.

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,200
Can't I show a little concern for you?

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,120
I was worried
you didn't bring enough to drink,

68
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,133
so I brought you some.

69
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,957
I know you're in a bad mood,

70
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
so I came to drink and talk with you.

71
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,040
Fine, no talking. We can drink at least.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,600
Drink away your sorrows.

73
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
It's just a breakup.

74
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,222
Not the end of the world.

75
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,680
Another.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,680
Drink up!

77
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,400
Why did you and Jian Dan break up?

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,600
Han Yansheng.

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,360
Don't people say alcohol
brings out the truth?

80
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,200
Why is it

81
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,760
that he clams up instead?

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,120
Forget it. Asking him is pointless.

83
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
I'll check on Jian Dan instead.

84
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,400
Why did you drink so much?

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,200
Sheng?

86
00:06:45,211 --> 00:06:46,800
You should take better care of yourself.

87
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
Can you hear me, Sheng?

88
00:06:52,684 --> 00:06:53,680
Jian Dan...

89
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,120
I'll help you back to your dorm, okay?

90
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,000
Come on.

91
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,160
Be careful.

92
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,280

I just saw your message.

96
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,880
Did you wait long?

97
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,745
Get him inside.

98
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,600
Easy there.

99
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:08,600
His bag.

100
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,920
She's back.

101
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:29,866
Jian Dan.

102
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,800
Jian Dan.

103
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
You're finally back.

104
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,890
We were just about to ask you
to come have some BBQ with us.

105
00:08:36,369 --> 00:08:37,550
That's a no.

106
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,320
Then, how about hot pot?

107
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
Or fried chicken?

108
00:08:41,211 --> 00:08:42,880
There's a new place with great luosifen.

109
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,288
Extra strong. Extra smelly. Come on!

110
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:45,777
- Sounds good. Come on.
- Let's go.

111
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,440
Try this lamb skewer.

112
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:50,088
The grilled squid is good too. Eat up.

113
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,530
The prawns are tasty too.

114
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,577
Right? I thought so too.

115
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:53,840
And their grilled fish tofu

116
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,720
is out of this world.

117
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,080
And look at this sausage.

118
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,240
Yes.

119
00:08:58,575 --> 00:08:59,280
Potato slices.

120
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,840
So good.

121
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,040
This onion is way too spicy.

122
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
It's making my eyes tear up.

123
00:09:08,575 --> 00:09:09,495
That's right.

124
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,760
Sir, go easy

125
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,680
on the spice next time!

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,000
Seriously!

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,880
Here.
Have a grilled mantou to cheer you up.

128
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Try it.

129
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,355
Bite.

130
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,640
Have some water.

131
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,160
Good?

132
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,200

Where are you going?

138
00:10:52,822 --> 00:10:53,910
I'm heading to Xiuchuan City

139
00:10:53,912 --> 00:10:55,360
for math competition training.

140
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
I won't be around for a while.

141
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,320
You're leaving?

142
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,120
What about Jian Dan?

143
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,320
I left the club stamp in the drawer.

144
00:11:07,111 --> 00:11:08,240
I'll leave the Swimming Club

145
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,920
in your hands.

146
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,040
I'll see you off.

147
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:13,920
No need.

148
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,280
Jian Dan! What took you so long?

149
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,360
Han left for his math training.

150
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
He's probably just gotten on the bus.

151
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Hello? Jian Dan? Do you hear me?

152
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,640
Looks like the rumors
on the forum were true.

153
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,480
Han Yansheng dumped her.

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,840
I never thought
they were a good match anyway.

155
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,555
Getting dumped
was only a matter of time.

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,466
You know spreading rumors
is illegal, right?

157
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,820
That's right. Don't talk about things
you don't know about.

158
00:12:10,822 --> 00:12:11,844
What's wrong with you?

159
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,640
That Huo Zuyang is so annoying.

160
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,320
He leaks everything. So annoying!

161
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
You guys go ahead and eat.
I'm heading out.

162
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,640
Let's pack her food for her.

163
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,920
Jian Dan, come to the café right now.

164
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,000
It's important.

165
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:54,711
It's about the voice recorder.

166
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,840
Okay, I'll be right there.

167
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,360
Play it and listen.

168
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,920
(Han Yansheng's condition
is getting worse.)

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,680
(It might never get better.)

170
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,840
(I feel more lost
and helpless than ever.)

171
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,880
(Maybe I should give up.)

172
00:13:18,134 --> 00:13:20,920
(I should tell him I don't love him)

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
(and break up with him.)

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,840
That... That's my voice.

175
00:13:26,877 --> 00:13:28,160
But it's been edited!

176
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
No wonder Han Yansheng was so angry.

177
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,577
The edits are subtle,
but with professional software,

178
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,760
it can be identified
as not the original recording.

179
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
I tried to restore it,

180
00:13:39,687 --> 00:13:40,680
but I couldn't.

181
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,622
The full recording can't be recovered.

182
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,400
It's okay.
I have the original on my computer.

183
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,315
Add this to that,
and then subtract that.

184
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,710
And then do this. Yes.

185
00:14:02,555 --> 00:14:03,933
Easy.

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,454
This problem is too easy.

187
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:07,680
Let me show you the steps.

188
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,140
(Jian Dan, Audio File)

189
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,440
(Han Yansheng
was in great condition today.)

190
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,520
(He was very cooperative.)

191
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,320
(I'm confident)

192
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,920
(I can help him get past
his mental block.)

193
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,240
(Han Yansheng didn't get
in the water for the exam today.)

194
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,800
(He's not in a good state.)

195
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:46,360
(It feels like
he's lost confidence in himself.)

196
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,040
(It hurts to see him like this.)

197
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,880
(I want to help,)

198
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:53,760
(but I really don't know)

199
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:55,800
(what to do.)

200
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,680
(I just had a terrible nightmare.)

201
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:02,360
(In the dream,)

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,280
(Han Yansheng's illness
had gotten much worse)

203
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,044
(and might never be cured.)

204
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,400
(He lost all confidence)

205
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,200
(and started giving up on himself.)

206
00:15:14,374 --> 00:15:16,948
(Thankfully, I woke up and realized)

207
00:15:17,111 --> 00:15:18,120
(it was just a dream.)

208
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,920
(But I'm feeling uncertain now.)

209
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,920
(I don't know if pushing him
to face his past trauma)

210
00:15:24,858 --> 00:15:26,280
(was the right thing to do.)

211
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,480
(Yesterday,
I recommended a movie to him)

212
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,600
(called "Good Will Hunting".)

213
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:34,800
(The main character in it)

214
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,840
(suffers from PTSD.)

215
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,520
(He was abandoned as a child, abused,)

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,360
(and ended up extremely arrogant
yet deeply insecure.)

217
00:15:47,066 --> 00:15:49,444
(He thought his girlfriend
didn't love him.)

218
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,960
(That she wanted to leave him)

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,160
(and break up with him.)

220
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,800
(In the end,
with the help of a professor,)

221
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
(he overcame his trauma,)

222
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,800
(reconciled with his girlfriend,)

223
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,977
(and started a new life.)

224
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,160
(I hoped the film)

225
00:16:04,555 --> 00:16:06,044
(would encourage Han Yansheng,)

226
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
(but he didn't watch it.)

227
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,866
(He's been in low spirits.)

228
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,160
(I don't know)

229
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
(how to help him anymore.)

230
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,120
(I feel more lost
and helpless than ever.)

231
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,511
(Maybe I should)

232
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:23,520
(give up.)

233
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:26,600
(Give up on the current treatment)

234
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,164
(and just let things run their course.)

235
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,240
(Honestly, I don't care)

236
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:34,422
(whether he can swim again or not.)

237
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,600
(All I want is for him)

238
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,080
(to be happy.)

239
00:16:38,802 --> 00:16:40,520
(So what if the audio)

240
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:42,680
(was edited?)

241
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,800
(I still can't get better.)

242
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,760
Sorry, the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

243
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,880
Sorry, the number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

244
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:17,888
(Your email has been sent.)

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,440
Shi, he still won't answer my calls.

246
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,960
I... I'm not sure if he read my email.

247
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,320
Can you ask him?

248
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
Maybe he's busy.

249
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,400
I can text him for you.

250
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,088
(Shi: Did you read the email
Jian Dan sent?)

251
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,075
(Shi: Did you read
the email Jian Dan sent?)

252
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,000
(Han Yansheng: Yes.)

253
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,560
I thought after he heard the recording,

254
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:19,160
he would stop ignoring me...

255
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,600
Don't lose heart just yet.

256
00:18:20,977 --> 00:18:22,480
Why not wait until Han comes back

257
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,577
and tell him in person?

258
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,880
Whatever you have to say,
it's better face-to-face.

259
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:29,880
Forget it.

260
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,840
She can't

261
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,480
go on like this.

262
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,120
Talk some sense into her.

263
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,880
Let her vent.

264
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,840
Jian Dan, why are you still asleep?

265
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,560
My head hurts...

266
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,440
Your head hurts? Let me check.

267
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,280
No fever. Probably not the flu.

268
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,120
You've just been overtraining lately.

269
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,280
Your body's exhausted.

270
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:43,377
Get up and eat something.

271
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:45,800
I don't have an appetite.

272
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:48,680
I'll call Han Yansheng.

273
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Don't call him!

274
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,760
Don't worry.

275
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,200
I doubt he'll keep ignoring you.

276
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,155
What is it?

277
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,960
Jian Dan's sick

278
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,022
and not eating properly.

279
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:02,622
Do you want to say something to her?

280
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,760
Her condition is none of my concern.

281
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,244
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

282
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,680
Hello? Han Yansheng?

283
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,720
Hello?

284
00:20:26,088 --> 00:20:27,533
I'd like to place an order.

285
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,640
Um, Jian Dan,

286
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,688
Monkey told me yesterday

287
00:20:34,688 --> 00:20:36,460
there's too much going on
at the Swimming Club.

288
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,555
He can't handle it all.

289
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm going to help him out.

290
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,377
Get some rest, okay?

291
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,879
You've won a free bowl
of Special Century Egg

292
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,920
and Lean Pork Rice Porridge
from Nanshan Restaurant.

293
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,177
The delivery is on its way.
Please check and receive it.

294
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:04,640
I didn't enter any lucky draw.

295
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,960
Anyone who has dined at our restaurant

296
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,400
is automatically entered
into the draw. Thank you.

318
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,960
Where is it?

319
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,880
Hello?

320
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,555
Monkey, where are you?

321
00:24:13,588 --> 00:24:14,960
I'm at the office.

322
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,120
Some documents

323
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,622
need the club president's stamp.

324
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,044
I'm looking in the dorm for it.

325
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,355
Before Han left,
he said it was in the drawer.

326
00:24:22,355 --> 00:24:24,550
But I've turned the place upside down
and can't find it.

327
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,294
Did it occur to you

328
00:24:26,327 --> 00:24:27,520
he might've meant

329
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
the office drawer?

330
00:24:32,581 --> 00:24:33,640
That's possible.

331
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,200
Can you help me check if it's there?

332
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,840
Found it.

333
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,840
Awesome.

334
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
Wait there. I'm on my way.

Jian Dan,

337
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:02,888
come to the Swimming Club office
right now.

338
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,360
There's something you need to see.

339
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,360
I'll be right there.

340
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,280
Jian Dan.

341
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:14,000
Jian Dan, look at this.

(HADS Psychological Assessment Form)

343
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,577
(Name: Han Yansheng)

344
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,266
So that's what it was.

345
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,280
I was too careless.

346
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,920
I didn't even notice
anything was wrong with him.

347
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,088
My necklace!

348
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,680
Where's she headed?

349
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,911
Where else?
Off to find Han Yansheng, obviously.

350
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,240
Miss.

351
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,177
Is this what you're looking for?

352
00:26:28,232 --> 00:26:29,037
Thank you.

353
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,000
You're welcome.

354
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,360
No matter how upset you are,

355
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,711
never throw things away carelessly.

356
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,400
Goodbye, Miss.

357

Students.

359
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:58,400
Tomorrow is the official exam.

360
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,480
Go home early today,

361
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,400
get plenty of rest,

362
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
and save your energy

363
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,920
for the final test tomorrow.

364
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,080
You're not a student here.

365
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:33,880
You can't go in.

366
