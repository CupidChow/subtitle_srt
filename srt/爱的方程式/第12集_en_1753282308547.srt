1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one you love

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one you love

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Love is not complicated

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Have a smile to answer

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The one you love

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 10

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Senior

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're here

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Senior, what are you looking for me for?

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What's wrong?

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
簡單, I have a question for you

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Do you have someone you like?

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm just asking randomly

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're busy with the club and study every day

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You should be free to fall in love

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been having some emotional problems lately

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know what to do

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There is a boy

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Said he liked me

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I also like him a little bit

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But we have been friends for many years

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just don't know what to do

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
簡單

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You know this person too

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's Dasheng

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know why everyone calls him Han

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm the only one who calls him Dasheng

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Because I saved his life before

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's why

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dasheng has always been very good to me

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And only allow me to teach him like this

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
簡單, you are learning psychology

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You help me analyze

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You say

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Should I take the initiative?

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm still a freshman

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't learn it here

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You told me before

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Said I can come to you no matter what happens

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Right?

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But I really don't have any experience in these things

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's okay, it's okay

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's okay

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
簡單

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If I'm really with Dasheng

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You will bless us

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Great

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
With your blessing

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm so happy

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
After talking to you

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I feel much better

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you,簡單

55
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
簡單 is back

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm back

57
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
簡單

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your clothes are not dry

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why are you picking it up?

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll hang it back

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you okay?

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm fine

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't eat with you later

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I have something else to do

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm leaving

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Waiting for your answer

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is good, I've seen it

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I think you need to strengthen your freedom

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then I'll arrange it for you

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,180
I think you should focus on strengthening this

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Change the air

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then strengthen the water

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Take the water

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Okay, you can go home

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you following me?

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You scared me

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are the one who is sneaky

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You should have seen me just now

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why didn't you give me the book?

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why didn't you say anything?

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you do something bad behind my back?

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Dasheng

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hurry up

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm not going to do anything

85
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to take a shower

86
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to take a shower

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to take a shower

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm going to take a shower

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to take a shower

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to take a shower

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Dasheng, hurry up

92
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Everyone is waiting for you to train

93
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is Jintao here?

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Senior

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The book has been delivered

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm leaving first

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's going on?

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's so strange today

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay, hurry up

100
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Go

101
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you drawing?

102
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I didn't draw you

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you drawing?

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I didn't draw you

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't draw you

106
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let me see

107
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fifty points for drawing

108
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But there are also 100 points for drawing

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Can you help me sign?

110
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sign a name of falling water

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This signed your name

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This painting becomes very precious

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is it so fast?

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Of course

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The whole KOS world

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who doesn't know the answer to falling water

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the review material I helped you organize

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
After you read it

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The exam should be over

120
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You draw for me

121
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Review material

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's just a broken heart

123
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
So delicate

124
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yan Sen

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You drew me, right?

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wrong

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is not

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you all right?

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let me find

130
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Too difficult

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,640
or the one who can press the elbow.

132
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,160
What can I say?

133
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Yuan San is a student of art.

134
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
He can turn knowledge into a painting.

135
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,520
The Crown Prince is an IT student.

136
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,840
Then he can turn knowledge into a game.

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,480
As long as it's a game,

138
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,720
it can burn my study soul.

139
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,400
You're going to work when you're studying.

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,560
I don't have time to play games for you.

141
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,200
Do it for me quickly.

142
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,960
I have a set of questions waiting for you.

143
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,600
It's too hard.

144
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,480
Athena,

145
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,080
I hope you can be the best in the world.

146
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,440
I hope you can be the best in the world.

147
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,080
Please.

148
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
Please bless me.

149
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,800
Bless me to pass the exam.

150
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,640
If you really think it's hard,

151
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,800
then don't do it.

152
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,880
Really?

153
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,040
I'll ask my aunt to do a test for you.

154
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,840
No, no, no.

155
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,280
Brother, I'm sorry.

156
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,960
Please don't disturb this old lady.

157
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll do it.

158
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,080
I'll do it for you.

159
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,200
Sit down.

160
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,760
Pass.

161
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,600
The test.

162
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
What's the condition?

163
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,920
Who knows what condition it is?

164
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,960
The test.

165
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
The test.

166
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
The test.

167
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
The test.

168
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
The test.

169
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
The test.

170
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
The test.

171
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
The test.

172
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
The test.

173
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
The test.

174
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
The test.

175
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
The test.

176
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
The test.

177
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
The test.

178
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
The test.

179
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
The test.

180
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
The test.

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,960
The test.

182
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
The test.

183
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
The test.

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
The test.

185
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
The test.

186
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
The test.

187
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
The test.

188
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
The test.

189
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
The test.

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
The test.

191
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
The test.

192
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
The test.

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
The test.

194
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,960
I smell the air of freedom!

195
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Look at your faces.

196
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
I think you're not bad.

197
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
As long as the monkey is fine,

198
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
we're all fine.

199
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Zeyi.

200
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Get the score.

201
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,840
Anyway,

202
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
I just want to tell you that

203
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,060
actually I feel terrible

204
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,260
if you're like this.

205
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,200
That's...

206
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,820
I think they have something else.

207
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,400
We need to eat something good.

208
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,200
Celebrate them.

209
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Come on.

210
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:57,760
Come on.

211
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,520
Come on.

212
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,600
What happened?

213
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,280
No.

214
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,640
No?

215
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,080
Why are you running?

216
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:15,840
Fine.

217
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Forget it.

218
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's go shopping.

219
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:19,840
Let's go.

220
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Sheng.

221
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you have time this afternoon?

222
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,120
We just finished our exam.

223
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,960
Let's go shopping.

224
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,960
Relax.

225
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,080
I took off

226
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
the lion's cuff.

227
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,440
I want to buy a new dress for him.

228
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,120
You two are similar in figure.

229
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,320
Try it on for him.

230
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Why don't you find him directly?

231
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,120
I want to give him a surprise.

232
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,080
How about it?

233
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,040
Okay.

234
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,160
Okay.

235
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,760
See you at the mall.

236
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,880
Come back soon.

237
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,000
Deng Tong.

238
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,760
Your Highness, you're here too.

239
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:14,720
Wang Hao.

240
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,520
Is this the surprise you prepared for me?

241
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,920
It's not just once.

242
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:18,920
Deng Tong also prepared

243
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,880
a bigger surprise for you.

244
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,680
I won't bother you.

245
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,400
I'm leaving.

246
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,280
Bye.

247
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,320
Your Highness.

248
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,640
I just picked two dresses

249
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,880
that suit you.

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,360
Why don't you try it on?

251
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,600
It's a gift for you.

252
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,520
Here.

253
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,400
Try it on.

254
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,320
Okay.

255
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,920
Deng Tong.

256
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,840
How's the design?

257
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,600
So cool.

258
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,520
I want it too.

259
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,400
If I can find a boyfriend

260
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,920
as handsome as me, that would be great.

261
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,280
My lady.

262
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,960
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

263
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,200
His body is so model-like.

264
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,680
He's born with a dress.

265
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,760
The dress before

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
suits him very well.

267
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,440
I'm not...

268
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,520
I think this color is pretty.

269
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,760
Try it on.

270
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,200
The shopping is so easy.

271
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,880
Xia Nan.

272
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,320
Why don't you buy anything?

273
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,920
How expensive is it?

274
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Why don't you buy the one you like

275
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,960
and then go online?

276
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,000
You're good at this.

277
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,920
I'll try it on too.

278
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,760
My lady, you're so good at this.

279
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,920
The dresses you picked today

280
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,840
are all your boyfriend's.

281
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,200
Welcome back.

282
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,200
When did they

283
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,840
start dating?

284
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,600
Isn't Han Yan Sheng

285
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,480
the one that Senior Sister likes?

286
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,280
What's going on?

287
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,960
Why is he crying so sadly?

288
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,040
Did he...

289
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
fall in love?

290
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,040
Forget it.

291
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,280
It has nothing to do with me.

292
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,160
He's so pitiful.

293
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,080
Are you okay?

294
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,880
What's the matter?

295
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,760
Nothing.

296
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
I just want to tell you

297
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,600
that if you're unhappy,

298
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,320
you can contact me anytime.

299
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,160
I promise

300
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,680
I won't tell anyone.

301
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,560
Okay.

302
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:43,920
But

303
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,200
I don't have the time to do that.

304
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,280
If you're unhappy,

305
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,600
just tell me.

306
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,040
I'll share it with everyone.

307
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,600
We can get through it together.

308
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,240
It's not a big deal.

309
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,400
Why are you suddenly so concerned about me?

310
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,080
We're good friends.

311
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
It's normal to care about each other.

312
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,200
Have some.

313
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:32,840
You...

314
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,760
You...

315
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,600
You...

316
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,800
You're not going to lend me your sword?

317
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,480
I bought it from a monkey.

318
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,000
I won't waste it.

319
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,200
So... So you just said

320
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,760
you were not in love.

321
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:50,880
In love?

322
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,760
I'm not in love.

323
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,960
How can I be in love?

324
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,760
Then,

325
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,680
you and Senior Sister En Tuo...

326
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
How is that possible?

327
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,360
How can I be in love with En Tuo?

328
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
So you don't like him?

329
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,560
We're just friends.

330
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,600
It's good that you didn't make a mistake.

331
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,840
Just pretend I didn't say anything.

332
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,040
You can eat slowly.

333
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,200
I'll go first.

334
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,320
Hello?

335
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,920
Mi Fen.

336
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,480
I want to ask you something.

337
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,040
I went to see Han Yan Sheng just now.

338
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,440
He told me

339
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
he was just friends with Gu Wen Tong.

340
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,440
Then why did Gu Wen Tong tell me

341
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,520
Han Yan Sheng likes him?

342
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,600
It's obvious.

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,960
He's jealous of you.

344
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,240
That's why he said that.

345
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,440
Then what's going on with him and Shi Zi?

346
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,640
I don't know.

347
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,320
But some people

348
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,960
are born to be love masters.

349
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,280
Not like us,

350
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,800
we don't understand anything.

351
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
Let's think about it together.

352
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,760
So handsome.

353
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
I'm also handsome.

354
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,120
Yuan Sen?

355
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,800
Isn't your favorite water hot?

356
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
Yuan Sen is hot water.

357
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,440
Hot water is Yuan Sen.

358
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,760
It's simple.

359
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,600
I'll tell you something serious.

360
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
Tell me.

361
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,680
I want to

362
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,440
confess to him.

363
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,240
Help me go out and cook.

364
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,120
Boss.

365
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Hello.

366
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,080
I want to book a place

367
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,320
for the cafe on Saturday night.

368
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
Is it for your birthday or for the club?

369
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,000
Confess to him.

370
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,800
Confess?

371
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,960
You young people are so romantic.

372
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,400
But I

373
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,640
have seen many boys

374
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
come to the place to confess to girls.

375
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,240
It's not common for girls to confess to boys.

376
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,560
You're brave.

377
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,400
It's not me.

378
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,720
It's my friend.

379
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,840
I know.

380
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
You all say you're friends.

381
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,080
I'll book it for you on Saturday.

382
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,320
You have time.

383
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,080
What's your name?

384
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,960
It's simple.

385
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
Simple.

386
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,240
Saturday.

387
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,480
Right.

388
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,840
What's your favorite person to confess to?

389
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,880
We can customize the theme

390
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
according to his preference.

391
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,760
He's the heir's roommate.

392
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,360
But I want to

393
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,800
design and design it myself.

394
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,520
You can do it yourself.

395
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,360
You're the heir's friend?

396
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,520
I'll give you a discount.

397
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,400
How much is it after the discount?

398
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,920
It's 1,000 yuan.

399
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,400
It's 800 yuan after the discount.

400
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
It's so expensive.

401
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,160
I think you're a student.

402
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,840
So I'll give you the biggest discount.

403
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,360
Then let's make a reservation first.

404
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll make the payment as soon as possible.

405
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,320
Okay.

406
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,480
Then hurry up.

407
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Thank you, boss.

408
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:47,960
Bye.

409
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,120
Boss.

410
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,520
Xiaosu, you're back.

411
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,000
Yes.

412
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,320
A friend of yours

413
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,160
came to rent the venue and said he wanted to confess.

414
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,000
Friend?

415
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,760
Who is he going to confess to?

416
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,480
He said he's your roommate.

417
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,160
Roommate?

418
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,040
Okay.

419
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
Han.

420
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,120
How's your relationship with Jiang Dan?

421
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,760
Why are you asking this?

422
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
I heard something about you today.

423
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,600
What?

424
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,760
800 yuan? It's so expensive.

425
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
I think we should just forget it.

426
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,760
Let's just cancel the confession.

427
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,800
How can we?

428
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,680
You finally have the courage to say yes.

429
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,440
And you said

430
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,520
you wanted to wait for him to confess

431
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,240
even if you waited until he confessed.

432
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,680
Where else can I find so much money?

433
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,680
I got it.

434
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,640
I heard it right.

435
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,080
You want to confess to Han?

436
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,080
It's true.

437
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,440
The boss received it himself.

438
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,480
I've read the reservation.

439
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,280
It's a simple name.

440
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,240
What's so strange about it?

441
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,480
There are many girls who like me.

442
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Not just him.

443
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,160
But it's simple.

444
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
He doesn't seem to be the type of guy

445
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
who confesses easily.

446
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,280
Besides,

447
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,480
I think you two are close.

448
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,800
Who said that?

449
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
He even came to my office this morning.

450
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,080
That's a warm-up.

451
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
The boss said

452
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
he wanted to confess to our dorm.

453
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,480
I've been thinking about it.

454
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,680
It's only Han.

455
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,880
That's not necessarily.

456
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
What if Han wants to confess to me simply?

457
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,240
Should I say yes or no?

458
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,040
No, no, no.

459
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,800
It's you.

460
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,360
He likes you.

461
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,200
Hello.

462
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,800
We're selling things.

463
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,080
How much do we earn?

464
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,160
How much do we sell?

465
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,080
Don't miss it.

466
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Don't miss it.

467
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,280
It's cheap.

468
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Take it home.

469
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,400
Come on, come and have a look.

470
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
Please, please.

471
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:23,800
Hello, please.

472
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,440
Please understand.

473
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
We're selling things.

474
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,520
Take a look.

475
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,560
See if you like it.

476
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,360
Please, please.

477
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,120
Please understand.

478
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,200
Buy some for your girlfriend.

479
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,880
Jin Dan.

480
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
I didn't expect

481
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,120
you have a business mind.

482
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,680
Of course.

483
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,240
I'm a psychologist.

484
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,720
How about it? Are you interested?

485
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,480
Try it.

486
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,360
Okay, I'll try it.

487
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,120
I'll be a fool.

488
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,640
Choose one you like

489
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,880
and play the board.

490
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,160
Look at these things.

491
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,720
They're all suitable for you.

492
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,720
I'll choose this one.

493
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,960
I'll take it.

494
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,500
Congratulations,

495
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,640
maleOlplanic dragons

496
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,960
have one viri Romania.

497
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,000
Congratulations,

498
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,320
thanks, Huy.

499
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,960
Nobody.

500
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,200
Old Han.

501
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,480
Old Han,

502
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,520
you're exactly here.

503
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,200
Here.

504
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Gift effect.

505
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,720
Why were you giving me this?

506
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Are you worried about me?

507
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,200
Why did you give me this?

508
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,160
There's no He Shuwu's

509
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,920
I gave it to you

510
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,320
He is putting the bill at the factory

511
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,920
I went to the factory

512
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,480
I bought one and got another box

513
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,880
Who knows I paid for it

514
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,040
I found a pool, right?

515
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,880
Is he short of money?

516
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,200
Is it because of his grandmother?

517
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,160
Is it too hard for him to confess to Han?

518
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,600
What does it have to do with his confession?

519
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,280
The cost of the reserved venue is 800

520
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,520
The boss said he didn't have enough money

521
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,320
So I thought of a way to raise money

522
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,040
It's too hard for him to confess

523
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,000
You don't go to school

524
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,000
Thank you, uncle Wei

525
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,160
I love this one

526
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,720
Take it back

527
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm going back

528
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,640
This is all sold out

529
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,280
I sold out too

530
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,840
Jian Dan, I'll go to the grocery store first

531
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,600
I'll go

532
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,480
It's okay, I'll go

533
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,240
Jian Dan

534
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,600
Is it that I can turn the board after I pick up something?

535
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Sister, do you like it?

536
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,040
This one, I want this

537
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,000
This one, I want this

538
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,640
So many people

539
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
I'm so lucky

540
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,240
Sister, you are so lucky

541
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,960
You are the first one to count to one today

542
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,840
Really?

543
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,600
If you are busy, you should be busy first

544
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,240
Don't mind me

545
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,400
I'll just take a look

546
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,760
You

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,040
I..

548
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,760
I want to pay every cent

549
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,480
Correct

550
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,880
Right

551
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,480
All right, I'm going

552
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,240
How about this?

553
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,400
That's it

554
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,280
Hey, it's beautiful

555
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,400
it's a joke

556
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,520
I can't use it.

557
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,280
Do you want to buy one?

558
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,000
This is the prize you call it.

559
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,040
It's broken.

560
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,400
I don't know who used it.

561
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,000
You use this to fool everyone

562
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,120
and trick everyone to draw.

563
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,160
It's too much.

564
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,080
I won't buy your stuff for a dollar.

565
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,880
It's so ugly.

566
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,720
You're messing with us.

567
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,240
That's it.

568
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
How can you do this?

569
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,840
Really.

570
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,600
That's it.

571
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
We can't buy it.

572
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,080
You can't do this.

573
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,880
It's a sale.

574
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,680
No.

575
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,840
You must have misunderstood.

576
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,640
We checked it before selling it.

577
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,640
It's brand new.

578
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,360
You mean I'm fooling you?

579
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,080
I just saw the lipstick she drew.

580
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,280
I'm jealous of this one.

581
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,120
I'm doing this for a lipstick.

582
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,760
Is it worth it?

583
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,120
Yes.

584
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,640
Your prizes are about quality.

585
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,800
Let's see if the things we bought

586
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,880
are good or not.

587
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,480
How can we buy it?

588
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,920
The quality is not good.

589
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,760
What's wrong?

590
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,840
How can you do this?

591
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,560
You're selling stuff.

592
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,600
Give us back the money.

593
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,080
No.

594
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:10,400
Give us back the money.

595
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,280
Give us back the money.

596
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,720
I bought new ones.

597
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,880
How can you do this?

598
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,440
Stop it.

599
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
Give us back the money.

600
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
The director is here.

601
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,720
What?

602
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,520
I didn't see him.

603
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,960
Who is doing business here?

604
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,880
Who is it?

605
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
Director.

606
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,800
You're a criminal.

607
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,200
You're a criminal.

608
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,720
You'll be punished next time.

609
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,600
You'll be punished next time.

610
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,120
I got it, director.

611
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,960
I'm so unlucky.

612
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,640
I could have bought it for 800 yuan.

613
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,560
How did it become like this?

614
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,960
Now it's good.

615
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,120
We have no money.

616
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
And we're confiscated.

617
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,400
It's annoying.

618
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,680
Are you rich?

619
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,080
Do you want to

620
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,360
measure your money

621
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,200
with your heart?

622
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,680
If you want to make money,

623
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
I have a job

624
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,200
to introduce to you.

625
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,400
It's short,

626
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,320
and the salary is high.

627
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,720
But it's a lot of work.

628
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,560
It's tiring.

629
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,160
It's okay.

630
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,360
We're not afraid of thunder.

631
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
Okay.

632
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,040
Thank you.

633
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,480
Follow me.

634
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,080
Let's go.

635
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,920
The work you found for us

636
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,960
is in the swimming pool.

637
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,760
Why don't I know

638
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,320
the swimming pool is hiring.

639
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,640
You're right.

640
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,040
Then why do you want to see us?

641
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,760
Not hiring.

642
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,040
We are hiring the key workers.

643
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,000
The swimming pool

644
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,400
has been untouched for a while.

645
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,200
Your task

646
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,600
is to clean up

647
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,400
the swimming pool

648
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,360
before dawn tomorrow.

649
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,960
Remember,

650
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,360
it needs to be very tidy.

651
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:36,400
the

652
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Wake up!

653
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,360
How are we going to clean up

654
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,920
such a huge pool?

655
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,000
This kind of car really needs to be cleaned.

656
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,000
Look at the dirt on the floor.

657
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
It's been a long time since anyone cleaned it.

658
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,640
Yeah.

659
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,200
I told you.

660
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,360
According to this amount of work,

661
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,840
Dr. Han is not a loser.

662
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,240
He's so smart.

663
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,040
How could he do such a stupid thing?

664
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,080
Stop chatting.

665
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,280
Get to work.

666
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,840
If he finds out we're chatting,

667
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,560
he'll say we're lazy and don't work.

668
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,120
Here.

669
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,840
This is your salary.

670
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,320
I want to emphasize that

671
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,120
if it wasn't for your urgent need for money,

672
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,520
I would have hired a professional to clean the pool.

673
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
I believe their work efficiency is higher

674
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,640
and more satisfying.

675
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,080
Thanks.

676
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,040
Great.

677
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,760
I have the money to confess my love.

678
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,560
Let's go.

679
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Thank you, Mr. Han.

680
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,200
Sheng.

681
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,520
I heard you asked Jiang Dan and Mi Fen

682
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,920
to clean the pool.

683
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,400
I'll deduct the cleaning fee

684
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,320
from our club's reserve.

685
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,480
No need.

686
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
This money is mine.

687
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
Is it okay?

688
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:15,720
Here.

689
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,840
I'll hang this for you.

690
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,440
Here.

691
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,200
Hurry up.

692
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,400
Okay.

693
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,320
This...

694
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,200
This...

695
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,600
What should I do?

696
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,160
This...

697
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,520
Let me see.

698
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,120
I'll pull it.

699
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:39,920
How much?

700
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
Good.

701
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,000
Here.

702
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm off.

703
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,520
Set aside.

704
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,400
Yamy.

705
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,000
The simple one is to confess in the cafe.

706
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,280
Why did the Crown Prince

707
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,520
send the photo to Dasheng?

708
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,920
Is the simple one's confessor

709
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,240
Dasheng?

710
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,480
It's almost done.

711
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,720
I'll go now.

712
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,960
Wish you a successful confession.

713
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
Thank you, Senior.

714
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,840
I'm leaving.

715
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,560
He did tell me.

716
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,440
Simple.

717
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,280
It's almost time.

718
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,320
I have to go back to the dorm and change.

719
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,160
I'll leave it to you.

720
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,360
I'll leave it to you.

721
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,320
Simple.

722
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,280
You're back so soon.

723
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,440
I came early.

724
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,320
Why are you here?

725
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,520
Who do you think it is?

726
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,880
Since you're here,

727
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,760
help me out.

728
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,040
Did he write the confession

729
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,360
in the pencil case?

730
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,920
I don't know.

731
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
I just want to know.

732
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm not sure.

733
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,800
I'm not sure.

734
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,640
I'm not sure.

735
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm not sure.

736
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,360
I'm not sure.

737
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,160
I'm not sure.

738
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,920
I'm not sure.

739
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,800
I'm not sure.

740
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,720
I'm not sure.

741
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,520
I'm not sure.

742
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
It's too old-fashioned

743
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,040
to put it in the book.

744
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,600
Why isn't it here?

745
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,120
Could it be...

746
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,520
That's the one.

747
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,680
I just wrote it.

748
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,240
Why did you tear it apart?

749
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,760
You.

750
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,560
Go to sleep.

751
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,640
sigh

752
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,040
I suddenly get refluxes

753
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,020
my memories slip away

754
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,020
It hurts and it hurts, but it's repeated several times

755
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,020
Where should I start

756
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:13,020
To touch the heart

757
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Some look, some words

758
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I haven't missed it yet, my eyes have been covered

759
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,020
Red as a poem

760
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,020
Those young days

761
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,020
There is a word in the ordinary

762
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,020
In the gap of time

763
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,020
I secretly didn't eat

764
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Those broken pasts

765
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,020
The vague name is still good

766
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,020
We once had each other

767
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,020
Those young days

768
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,020
Heartache is unnecessary

769
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,020
