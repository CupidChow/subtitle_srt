1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Use sincerity to express

2
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Grow up gently

3
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,600
She is a flower that is fragrant

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,000
Will it be afraid?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,200
She has also asked herself

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,800
Zipadia

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
The one who is popular

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Only think

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,000
Will melt like a smile

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Zipadia

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,400
The one you are beautiful

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,200
Love is not complicated

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,000
Have a smile to answer

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Love by Hypnotic

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 10

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
What did you say just now?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,400
I am sorry

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,000
I am sorry

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,400
I am sorry

20
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
I am sorry

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
I am sorry

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
I am sorry

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
I am sorry

24
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
I am sorry

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
I am sorry

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,000
I am sorry

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,600
I am sorry

28
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
I am sorry

29
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,000
I am sorry

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,800
I am sorry

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
I am sorry

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
I am sorry

33
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,000
I am sorry

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
I am sorry

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,800
I am sorry

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
I am sorry

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
I am sorry

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,400
I am sorry

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,000
I am sorry

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
I am sorry

41
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,000
I am sorry

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,400
I am sorry

43
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
I am sorry

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
I am sorry

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,200
I am sorry

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000
I am sorry

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,600
I am sorry

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,200
I am sorry

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,000
I am sorry

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am sorry

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,600
I am sorry

52
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,600
I am sorry

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
I am sorry

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
I am sorry

55
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,200
I am sorry

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
I am sorry

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,800
I am sorry

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,800
I am sorry

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,400
I am sorry

60
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
I am sorry

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,000
I am sorry

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
I am sorry

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I am sorry

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
I am sorry

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I am sorry

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,880
You think you're a monkey?

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,840
You're the monkey.

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,440
Don't.

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,480
Get down.

70
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,840
I'm not scared.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
If you don't let me down,

72
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll post your pictures on the internet.

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,200
So everyone can see you.

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,200
You're so pretty.

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,960
Jiang Zhishan, how dare you!

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
I don't care about anything.

77
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,320
Miss,

78
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,760
where did you hide the

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,280
white-haired woman?

80
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,640
She's nowhere to be found.

81
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
I won't tell you.

82
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,320
I hid the white-haired woman in her eyes.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,280
In the wardrobe.

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,480
In the wardrobe?

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
In the wardrobe.

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,080
Get out.

87
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,800
Miss.

88
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm going.

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,560
Boss.

90
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Chief Chu.

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,680
Boss.

92
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Han, wake up.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,800
It's noon.

94
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,480
What's wrong?

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,400
Why are you so late?

96
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
Who told you to drink so much yesterday?

97
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,240
You're drunk.

98
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,360
How did I come back last night?

99
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,400
I don't remember.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
Jian Tan sent you back?

101
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,400
Jian Tan?

102
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,240
Monkey, give me my clothes.

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,360
Here.

104
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,880
What's wrong?

105
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm thinking about it.

106
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
What's wrong?

107
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Did I do anything special

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,200
after I got drunk last night?

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
How would I know?

110
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,200
You ran out of the restaurant

111
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,560
after you got drunk.

112
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,960
You ran out of the restaurant in a flash.

113
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,440
I didn't know what happened to you two.

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,400
Nice to meet you.

115
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,640
Are you Xue Ice?

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,760
Hi, no worries.

117
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,620
How's the food?

118
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,960
It's Chocolate and Beer.

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,960
They always work here.

120
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,760
Rice?

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes.

122
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,600
Just leave it for me.

123
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
You don't even know about that.

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,780
Stop it.

125
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
Why do you have to go to work?

126
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,640
Gosh.

127
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,800
Why am I there?

128
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,680
Didn't you say

129
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,920
you'd work at round one?

130
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,680
Are you really going?

131
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,560
Are you telling

132
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
me some secrets?

133
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,040
It's simple. What time is it now?

134
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
It's about 1 o'clock.

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
1 o'clock?

136
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,320
My head hurts.

137
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
I won't drink so much anymore.

138
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,080
Wait.

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll get you a glass of honey water later.

140
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,200
Thank you.

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,480
Who sent this?

142
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,960
I can't understand anything on it.

143
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,680
It's simple.

144
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,080
Help me look at this.

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,280
Greek.

146
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,760
Greek?

147
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,400
You can understand Greek?

148
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
What does it say on it?

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Cypadia.

150
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,040
It's a Greek female mathematician.

151
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,400
I think the Greek girl

152
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,720
who knows Greek

153
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,160
is Han Yansheng.

154
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,960
She must have sent this.

155
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,240
I told her to send it according to the gift list.

156
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,840
She actually used this to fool me.

157
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
I think it's pretty good.

158
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,160
You like it?

159
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,320
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,560
No.

161
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,360
This is a gift from Han Yansheng for you.

162
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,240
It's okay.

163
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,560
Just take it as thank you for

164
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,560
speaking nicely in front of the photographer.

165
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,280
You know it all?

166
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,720
I'm telling the truth.

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,160
We're all for our club.

168
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,560
Don't worry.

169
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
I won't take those words to heart.

170
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll adjust the training plan

171
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,200
according to the actual situation.

172
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,000
That's great.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,560
They'll be happy to know it.

174
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,280
I'll go to class now.

175
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,240
Okay. Go ahead.

176
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I like the necklace.

177
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,240
You're here to wait for me?

178
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,720
I heard from the monkey

179
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
that you sent me to the dorm last night.

180
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,440
Did I do anything special?

181
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,800
I'll answer for you.

182
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,000
Me too.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,840
We don't believe

184
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800
you'll believe that

185
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
you'll like him.

186
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,280
Let's go.

187
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,800
There is a..

188
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Let's have lunch together.

190
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,240
We'll run out of dishes after dinner.

191
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,560
The girl is so pretty.

192
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,720
The cafeteria is over there.

193
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,200
Okay.

194
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,000
Go away!

195
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,160
Be careful!

196
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Are you okay?

197
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm fine.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,240
Thank goodness.

199
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,840
How are you doing?

200
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
You're so ugly.

201
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,880
Have you been dating for a long time?

202
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,720
A long time.

203
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
Of course.

204
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,840
When did you date?

205
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,920
I don't know.

206
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
How can I not know?

207
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,400
You're so stubborn.

208
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
You can't tell me.

209
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Are you looking at this?

210
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,760
You're pretty.

211
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,160
Really?

212
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,720
The raw meat Втор Lenin

213
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,840
The raw meat dad VOCaser

214
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,620
Did you fall out with something?

215
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,520
No.

216
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,480
I'm sorry.

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
What are you doing?

218
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,200
Don't misunderstand.

219
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
I...

220
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,840
I...

221
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,800
I got the wrong person.

222
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,840
You got the wrong person?

223
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
Who do you want to catch?

224
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
I'm a little tired of this restaurant.

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,480
Let's go eat something else.

226
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,440
Young people like you

227
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
should be in the right team.

228
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,840
I'm going upstairs.

229
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Do you have anything else?

230
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Wait a minute.

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Hello?

232
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,840
I've received the bag you brought from abroad.

233
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
I've received the bag you brought from abroad.

234
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
I thought you wanted to use that broken necklace

235
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,840
to fool me.

236
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,840
You've already bought the bag I wanted.

237
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Thank you.

238
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
Necklace?

239
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,840
When did I give you a necklace?

240
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Didn't you give it to me yesterday at the film studio?

241
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,840
But I don't like it.

242
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,840
So I gave it to you as a gift.

243
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,840
You mean

244
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
it wasn't me who gave it to you.

245
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
It was you who gave it to me.

246
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
What do you mean by you gave it to me?

247
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
It wasn't you.

248
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Forget it.

249
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I'll explain it to you later.

250
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm hanging up.

251
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,840
Weird.

252
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,840
She gave me the necklace.

253
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Who else would she give it to?

254
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,840
Zhizhan, we're going to eat.

255
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Let's do it together.

256
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Okay.

257
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Let's go.

258
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
What did you want to tell me just now?

259
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,840
Nothing.

260
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm so sorry.

261
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,820
I…I'll be leaving now

268
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,280
Hello?

269
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,240
Why do you ask to be late to be buttered up like this?

270
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,980
I had prepared a FullD Celeb

271
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:50,900
to let you hel my

272
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,840
full belly

273
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,440
Shut up

274
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,720
I told you to shut up

275
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,440
you impertinent

276
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,160
You also say that.

277
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,860
The correctly appropriate

278
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,680
Gray-haired person

279
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,600
is a 1700

280
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Where is it?

281
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,280
Where is it?

282
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,600
Where is it?

283
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll see how you threaten me.

284
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,480
Go.

285
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,640
Hey, what are you doing?

286
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm...

287
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm squatting.

288
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,760
Listen to me.

289
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,360
The smell of the smell of the air-conditioning is very simple.

290
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
There must be something wrong.

291
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,680
I don't believe I can't squat a big pot.

292
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,280
All right, all right. I know.

293
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,600
Don't call me if you're okay.

294
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,240
I'm hanging up.

295
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,760
I finally found it.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,720
What are you doing?

297
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,320
Don't be rude. Give me the camera.

298
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:06,920
Give it to me.

299
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,920
Give it to me.

300
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,320
You're embarrassed to ask for the camera?

301
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,160
You dare to steal in broad daylight?

302
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,240
I... I didn't steal anything.

303
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
Don't talk nonsense.

304
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,720
Is this a kite?

305
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
You pervert.

306
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,360
What is this?

307
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,000
What is this?

308
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm telling you.

309
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
I didn't steal it on purpose.

310
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,720
What is this?

311
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,680
What is this?

312
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,400
Who believes this?

313
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,280
Wait a minute.

314
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,400
I'll be right back.

315
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,560
What are you doing here?

316
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,320
You ask him.

317
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,560
Did you steal something from my cabinet?

318
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,960
I didn't.

319
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:49,880
No.

320
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
You said you didn't.

321
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,520
You hid the things.

322
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,200
Don't touch me.

323
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,880
I didn't.

324
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,400
I didn't.

325
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,880
How could you?

326
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,440
I didn't.

327
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,040
I didn't.

328
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,520
I didn't.

329
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,680
You stole my underwear.

330
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,080
You stole my underwear.

331
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
I didn't do it on purpose.

332
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,720
I didn't do it on purpose.

333
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,240
I...

334
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,760
Pervert.

335
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,480
Pervert.

336
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,800
I... I'm not a pervert.

337
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,600
I...

338
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,880
This is a birthday gift

339
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,080
for my girlfriend.

340
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,360
Who is your girlfriend?

341
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,560
Do me a favor.

342
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,280
I have something to listen to you.

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,600
Really?

344
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,640
You'll listen to me?

345
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,600
Deal.

346
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,880
Here.

347
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,600
Dear.

348
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I really like the gift you gave me.

349
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,800
It's still my size.

350
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,920
You're so considerate.

351
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,360
I'm sorry, dear.

352
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,560
I wanted to give you a surprise.

353
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,480
But I didn't expect to make soup.

354
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
All right.

355
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,560
All right.

356
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,480
You're a little bit blind.

357
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
Are you two really boyfriends?

358
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,680
Of course.

359
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,120
He's my boyfriend.

360
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Can't I?

361
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,480
I don't believe you.

362
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll kill you two.

363
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,640
Don't let me catch you.

364
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,400
Well.

365
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,360
Did you see Mr. Han and Jiang Dan?

366
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Get out.

367
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,880
All right.

368
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,920
You're not only stealing my underwear, are you?

369
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,880
I've torn it.

370
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,600
You're so bold.

371
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,480
You didn't even go to the changing room to steal my stuff.

372
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,120
I didn't steal it.

373
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,920
Wait.

374
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,720
How do you know

375
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:52,960
the

376
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,960
You're thinking too much.

377
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,600
Tell me.

378
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,000
What did you do to me last night?

379
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
What did you do?

380
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,080
You're thinking too much.

381
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,680
You're thinking too much.

382
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Tell me.

383
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,560
Stop talking.

384
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,280
You're thinking too much.

385
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
You're thinking too much.

386
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,640
Come back with me.

387
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,800
Isn't it her birthday?

388
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,240
Why did you bring her a cake?

389
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
Your aunt

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,480
is trying to make me suffer.

391
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,280
Monkey.

392
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,080
What bad words are you talking about behind my back?

393
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,240
I didn't say anything.

394
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,760
Right, Han?

395
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,720
I didn't say anything.

396
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,920
How could I say anything?

397
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,640
You dare to say it but you don't know it?

398
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,080
Don't think I didn't hear anything.

399
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,640
Be gentle, old lady.

400
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,320
It hurts.

401
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,680
Be gentle.

402
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,720
Han.

403
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,240
I have something to tell you.

404
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,360
Someone is taking a picture.

405
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
Honey.

406
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,520
You bought my favorite cake.

407
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
It's so great.

408
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,320
What cake?

409
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,480
I want to ask you.

410
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
It's pink.

411
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,920
There are little pigs.

412
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,560
Honey.

413
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,840
I'll make you some soup.

414
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,680
It's a little hot.

415
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,760
Let me blow it for you.

416
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,160
Here, honey.

417
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,080
Be careful. It's hot.

418
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,080
It's delicious.

419
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
It's delicious.

420
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,160
Honey, I'll make you

421
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,880
your favorite vegetable.

422
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:34,760
Okay.

423
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,000
It's so delicious.

424
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,360
Stop acting.

425
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,600
They are all gone.

426
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,080
Hey,

427
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,160
do you want to see the training suit?

428
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,040
The necklace is made very exquisite.

429
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,640
No, no.

430
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,360
We don't need it.

431
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,480
I want this.

432
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,520
Take it.

433
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,720
No.

434
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,160
Do you want your girlfriend?

435
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,080
Yes, yes, yes.

436
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,880
It's not...

437
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,400
Aren't you in a relationship?

438
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,760
Do you want to buy two for your girlfriend?

439
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
You misunderstood.

440
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,800
We are not boyfriends.

441
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Sorry to bother you.

442
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,120
Didn't you have something to tell me?

443
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,840
What is it?

444
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,480
Nothing.

445
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
It seems that the person just left it.

446
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I'll return it to him.

447
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
You haven't told me

448
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
whose necklace is this

449
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,840
Spanish-Spanish necklace?

450
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,120
Who is this for?

451
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,280
For Xipadi?

452
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,400
Isn't it for Han?

453
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Or is it for your girlfriend?

454
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,480
I see.

455
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,080
Yes.

456
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,600
The necklace is for a simple girl.

457
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,160
And

458
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
it's my girlfriend.

459
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,680
Han,

460
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,200
you can't hide it.

461
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,080
You two are so fated.

462
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,800
But

463
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,880
simply, I don't know

464
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,360
the necklace is for her.

465
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,280
Don't tell her yet.

466
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,960
I'll tell her when the time comes.

467
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,360
What are you talking about?

468
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
Are you okay?

469
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,680
Let's go back to the dorm.

470
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Let's go.

471
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,440
Bye.

472
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,240
Bye.

473
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,000
Bye.

474
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,040
Little girl.

475
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,280
You're not in the mood today.

476
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,520
Are you hiding something from me?

477
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,600
No.

478
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm looking for you two.

479
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,440
Look.

480
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,760
There's a new pottery art gallery outside the campus.

481
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,880
There.

482
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,400
You can make pottery for free.

483
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,240
Let's go together.

484
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
I don't know how to make pottery.

485
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,160
You can make it.

486
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,360
They'll teach you.

487
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,120
We can make a couple's cup together.

488
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,000
And

489
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,320
bring it back for free.

490
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Let's play together.

491
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,520
Let Yansen go with you.

492
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
No.

493
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,320
I want to give it to Yansen.

494
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
I see.

495
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:30,720
I'll go with you.

496
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,960
It sounds good.

497
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,880
I'll go with you.

498
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,400
Let's go.

499
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:35,880
Let's go.

500
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,080
Let's go eat first.

501
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,040
I'm starving.

502
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
I'm hungry.

503
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
I'm hungry.

504
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
I'm hungry.

505
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm hungry.

506
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
I'm hungry.

507
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
I'm hungry.

508
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
I'm hungry.

509
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm hungry.

510
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
I'm hungry.

511
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,520
I'm hungry.

512
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm hungry.

513
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
I'm hungry.

514
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I'm hungry.

515
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm hungry.

516
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
I'm hungry.

517
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
I'm hungry.

518
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I'm hungry.

519
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm hungry.

520
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm hungry.

521
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm hungry.

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
I'm hungry.

523
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm hungry.

524
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
I'm hungry.

525
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm hungry.

526
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm hungry.

527
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm hungry.

528
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I'm hungry.

529
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I'm hungry.

530
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm hungry.

531
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
I'm hungry.

532
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
I'm hungry.

533
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm hungry.

534
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
This is nice.

535
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
Isn't this cute?

536
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
Hello.

537
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
This is funny too.

538
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Your items are packed.

539
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,520
Yours.

540
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,520
Mine.

541
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
Thank you.

542
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,520
This is great.

543
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
I didn't expect it to be done.

544
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Look at how smart I am.

545
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,520
I made a plate for the cup.

546
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,160
It's practical and beautiful.

547
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,640
It doesn't look like you.

548
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,560
Who said I drew it?

549
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,880
Of course it's me.

550
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,800
Who?

551
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Who?

552
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,920
Who did you draw?

553
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,840
Isn't it simple?

554
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,440
Two people.

555
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,520
It must be Han Yan Shou.

556
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,600
No.

557
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,920
I drew it casually.

558
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,240
Crasily?

559
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,960
You drew a couple?

560
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
You want to give it to Dasheng, right?

561
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,200
I'll give it to him.

562
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,840
I'm using it to collect it.

563
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,920
Why is there such a big hole?

564
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,080
Hello.

565
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,960
Can you help me repair it?

566
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:40,880
Sure.

567
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,800
Come and get it in the afternoon.

568
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,080
There's something between simple and Dasheng.

569
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,320
It seems that I have to

570
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
take care of my job and the simple.

571
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,680
Miss, what do you want?

572
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,320
Take it. It's for you.

573
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:22,920
It's for you.

574
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,520
Is this your portrait?

575
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
It's too ugly.

576
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,440
But don't say it.

577
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,920
There's really a smell of

578
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,440
a flower.

579
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
I drew you.

580
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:46,760
No.

581
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,680
You dare not?

582
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,200
This is a gift

583
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
for you.

584
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,040
I...

585
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
I can't give it to you.

586
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,440
What do you think of the painting?

587
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,120
It's great.

588
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,920
It's...

589
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,280
Well...

590
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,040
It's a good thing.

591
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,200
Look at my talent.

592
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,120
I'll collect it

593
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,800
and give it to him.

594
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,520
As long as you like it.

595
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,120
Thank you.

596
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,200
By the way,

597
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
I asked you to come here

598
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,880
because of

599
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,160
something between simple and Dasheng.

600
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,600
What about them?

601
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,640
Don't you think

602
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
they're too tacit?

603
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,320
They don't like each other,

604
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
but they don't say anything.

605
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,240
I'm worried about them.

606
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,320
What do you say?

607
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
There's an activity

608
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,080
at school this afternoon.

609
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,040
Simple.

610
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,600
I'm looking for you.

611
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,880
Come with me.

612
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
Where?

613
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,120
You'll know when you get there.

614
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,840
But I have to go to the Taozi Shop

615
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
to get the cup.

616
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,160
I've asked the monkey to get it for you.

617
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,680
Let's go.

618
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,240
Hurry up.

619
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,800
Why did you bring me here?

620
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,880
To help you find a boyfriend.

621
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,000
Lianyi?

622
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,320
No need.

623
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
I'll go back first.

624
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,640
Well...

625
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,720
Excuse me. I'm looking for a boyfriend.

626
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
Don't you have a monkey?

627
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,640
It's for others.

628
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,680
It's fake.

629
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,280
You don't have to

630
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,760
look for a boyfriend in such a hurry.

631
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,280
Maybe...

632
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,360
I think

633
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
it's good to have a boyfriend.

634
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,040
There's about an hour left.

635
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,280
Simple, wait for me.

636
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,560
Look over there. It's pretty.

637
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,800
Go over there.

638
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,640
Take a picture.

639
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,080
Stand still.

640
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,560
Smile.

641
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
Simple,

642
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,320
turn around.

643
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,640
It's better to turn around.

644
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
Here, make a wish.

645
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,320
Raise your hand higher.

646
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,640
Han.

647
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,560
Help me.

648
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,840
This is simple.

649
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
Give it to him.

650
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,040
Why is his stuff

651
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
with you?

652
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
It's a long story.

653
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,240
Anyway,

654
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,000
just give it to him as soon as possible.

655
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,240
He has a date tonight.

656
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,040
It's urgent.

657
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
Date?

658
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,800
Don't you know?

659
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,320
The date that he attended

660
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,080
is at the Central Lake of the school.

661
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,240
I have a picture here.

662
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,600
Look.

663
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,920
I heard from Jiang Zhenshan

664
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
that he went to the Taoyi Store

665
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,680
to make a couple cup in the daytime.

666
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,760
He said he was going to give it to Xin Yi tonight.

667
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,800
Why didn't you give it to him?

668
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
You insisted on giving it to me.

669
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,320
I just remembered.

670
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,200
Jiang Zhenshan is looking for me.

671
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,240
I have to go there.

672
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,480
Otherwise, he won't forgive me.

673
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,520
What's wrong?

674
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,880
Han will arrive in ten minutes.

675
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,040
It's simple.

676
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
I'm going to the bathroom.

677
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,760
Wait for me.

678
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,640
Help me get it.

679
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,640
Don't go away.

680
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,960
What's wrong with him?

681
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,760
He's so mysterious.

682
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,040
The event started at seven o'clock.

683
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,920
You're early enough.

684
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,000
Why are you here?

685
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,440
Are you here to attend the wedding?

686
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,120
But...

687
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,040
Take it.

688
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
I'll give you the monkey's ear.

689
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
Have you seen the things in the bag?

690
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,560
Am I the one who peeked at your things?

691
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,320
Who do you think I am?

692
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,200
That's not what I mean.

693
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,600
Why are you so angry?

694
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,360
Are you so eager to find a boyfriend?

695
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,760
You even prepared a gift.

696
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,760
I can't wait.

697
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,960
I was engaged to Jiang Zhishan.

698
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,040
You misunderstood me.

699
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,560
And this gift is not for anyone else.

700
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,240
It's for...

701
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Forget it. It's not important.

702
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,400
You don't want it?

703
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
No.

704
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Jin Dan.

705
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,560
Jin Dan.

706
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Jin Dan.

707
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,240
I got the things back.

708
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,360
You gave it to me, didn't you?

709
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

710
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,640
I didn't.

711
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
You're thinking too much.

712
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,040
But it's clearly about you and me.

713
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,640
Don't come over.

714
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,840
I have something else to do.

715
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
I have to go.

716
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Are you going to the wedding?

717
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
No.

718
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Then what else do you have to do?

719
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
I...

720
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,160
Why should I tell you?

721
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,160
Who are you to me?

722
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,480
I can do whatever I want.

723
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
It's none of your business.

724
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
I don't care.

725
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
You're my girlfriend.

726
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
I'll take care of it.

727
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,540
inexpensive

728
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,240
Those shattered pasts

729
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,240
The vague names

730
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Fortunately, we once had each other

731
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,240
Those young days

732
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,240
Heartache does not need to be delayed

733
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,240
When one day, the promise becomes a luxury

734
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,240
Those shattered pasts

735
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:36,240
It has never been a complete picture of life
