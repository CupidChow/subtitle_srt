You can't solve this problem
with a regular method.

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,240
Otherwise, you fall right into its trap.

17

What are you doing here?

18
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,133
No idea what Monkey was thinking.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,888
He actually asked you to solve this.

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,988
Someone even made a wish

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,560
to solve a math problem

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,320
on this special day.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,920
What a way to kill the buzz.

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,000
Better than someone
who already has a boyfriend

25
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,355
but still comes to solve it.

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,920
What boyfriend?

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,560
Whose boyfriend?

28
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,680
Forget it. Consider it
my good deed for the day.

29

She stepped out for a bit.

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240
Call back later.

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,040
Who's on the line?

37
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
You... You are...

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
Hello, I'm Jian Dan's grandmother.

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,800
Grandmother?

40
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,520
Hello, ma'am.

41
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Uh... Jian Dan stepped out for a bit.

42
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:24,417
She's back now.

43
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,777
I'll let her take the call.

44
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:27,600
Here.

45
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,680
Jian Dan, it's Grandma.

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
Who answered the phone just now?

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,200
Is that your new boyfriend?

48
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,640
No, no.

49
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,800
Grandma, you got it wrong.

50
00:04:43,342 --> 00:04:44,880
He's not my boyfriend.

51
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,480
We're just coursemates.

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm in the library now.

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,114
I'll call you back later.

54
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:52,040
Bye.

55
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,155
Why did you answer my phone?

56
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,200
It kept ringing.

57
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
It was disturbing everyone.

58
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,520
You could've turned it off.

59
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,022
Now Grandma thinks I have a boyfriend.

60
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,333
Don't you have a boyfriend?

61
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,280
Of course not.

62
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,880
Who told you

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I did?

64
00:05:19,844 --> 00:05:21,160
You said it yourself last night.

65
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,933
You said you had a date.

66
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,880
A date?

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,000
Does that mean boyfriend?

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,000
We're here together right now.

69
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,080
Does that mean this is a date?

70
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,133
So the math guy

71
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:37,850
with the pretty handwriting

72
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,942
and shared interests

73
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:40,480
isn't your boyfriend?

74
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,920
Of course not.

75
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,040
He's my pen pal.

76
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
You should've said so earlier.

77
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Had you said it earlier,

78
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,760
it wouldn't have caused
all this misunderstanding.

79
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,040
You're acting strange.

80
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,560
Come on in.

81
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,520
This is where you usually do the shoot?

82
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,400
It looks so professional.

83
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,720
Yuan Sen,

84
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,720
here are the two sets of costumes
you asked for.

85
00:06:25,044 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll get back to work.

86
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,560
All right.

87
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,200
It's for you.

88
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,080
You want to shoot with me?

89
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,600
Isn't this your wish?

00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:52,780

(I love you so much!)

93
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,200
Yes, it's my wish.

94
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,840
This is Yue Luo's costume.

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Mine is Ling Xi's.

96
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,200
How did you know

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,960
I like this couple?

98
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,480
I saw it in your Moments.

99
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
I love their love story.

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,920
Ling Xi's a hopeless romantic.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,280
He goes against the entire army

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
for Yue Luo.

103
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,120
Go get changed.

104
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,840
Eat slowly.

105
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
You're here.

106
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

107
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:23,800
(Cat feeding)
I didn't expect your wish

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,880
to be feeding cats together.

109
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,840
I didn't know you got my wish.

110
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,600
Here you go.

111
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,320
Here.

112
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
Jian Dan!

113
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:17,051
I love you so much!

114
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
What happened?

115
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You know what?

116
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,080
Today is the happiest day

117
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,400
I have ever had in my life.

118
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,400
Luo Shui and you

119
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,960
did a couple cosplay?

120
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,800
Say, did your wish come true?

121
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:44,000
What wish?

122
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:46,533
The one I wrote for you.
Get to meet with your pen pal.

123
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:49,280
Don't bring that up.

124
00:10:49,355 --> 00:10:50,280
I didn't see my pen pal,

125
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,644
but I did run into Han Yansheng.

126
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:52,800
He was driving me crazy.

127
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,880
Han Yansheng?

128
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
What happened?

129
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
Tell me everything.

130
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,520
I just washed my feet.

131
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,444
Go on and tell me.

132
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,920
The problem is solved.

133
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Did you solve it yourself?

134
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,400
Does that matter?

135
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:31,200
As long as your wish comes true.

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,760
Wait. The handwriting on your book

137
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
looks exactly like the one
on this paper.

138
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,680
Aren't all numbers look the same

139
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
to you?

140
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,320
Fair enough.

141
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:48,044
Just looking at them
gives me a headache.

142
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,000
Class,

143
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,880
before we begin, I have good news.

144
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,800
Jian Dan's paper

145
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,240
has passed

146
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,720
the publishing house's review

147
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
and will be published.

148
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,840
Let's congratulate her.

149
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,000
All right.

150
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,280
Let's start class.

151
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,040
Congrats.

152
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,000
Thanks to your help.

153
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm grateful.

154
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,111
How will you thank me then?

155
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,080
Fen,

156
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,160
I have good news.

157
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,920
What's it?

158
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,640
My paper's getting published!

159
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,480
For real?

160
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:16,691
That's amazing!

161
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,800
Jian Dan, you're awesome.

162
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,720
Let me give you a peck.

163
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,560
Worst timing. Who is it?

164
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,920
(Congratulations!
You've won a "Dine-And-Dash" free meal.)

165
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,422
What is it?

166
00:13:26,444 --> 00:13:27,680
I won something!

167
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,640
What did you win?

168
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,120
Lottery? Big prize or small?

169
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,320
Not a lottery. It's a free meal.

170
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,760
Free meal?

171
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,600
I love free meals.

172
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,000
Jian Dan,

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,960
when are we going for that?

174
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Mi Fen, I think you've put on
some weight.

175
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,160
Maybe time to diet.

176
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,160
Free meals aren't great for that.

177
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,240
Have I?

178
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,400
You liar!

179
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,240
Yuan Sen.

180
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:54,960
Keep up.

181
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,760
Back me up. Quick.

182
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:57,160
I'm behind you.

183
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,022
Hurry up. Come on.

184
00:13:58,022 --> 00:13:58,620
No! I'm dying.

185
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,691
Right away.

186
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,880
I'm dead.

187
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,622
I'm still alive.

188
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,600
Han has been in a good mood lately.

189
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,520
Wonder why.

190
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,680
Han.

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,760
Your phone.

192
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,480
(Jian Dan: Dinner at Nanshan Restaurant
at 6 PM tomorrow.)

193
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
(Okay?)

194
00:14:33,866 --> 00:14:35,222
(Han Yansheng: Okay.)

195
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,490
(Name: Curly-Haired Girl)

196
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,580
(Name: Hypatia)

197
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,880
(Yuan Sen: 5:30 PM.)

198
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,920
(Yuan Sen: Meet you downstairs at your dorm.)

199
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,600
Are you going on a date?

200
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,880
You've been busy with your makeup
for an hour.

201
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,444
Has it been that long?

202
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,760
You're wearing this
to have dinner with Han Yansheng?

203
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:16,920
Well,

204
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,800
it's just a dinner,

205
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,360
not a date.

206
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,377
Still, you can't go out
looking so casual.

207
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:26,733
Any problem with this?

208
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:28,711
Plenty.

209
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:30,440
You're having dinner
with the hottest guy.

210
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,520
How can you wear that?

211
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,280
Come here.

212
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Try this on.

213
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,600
Keep it yourself.

214
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:06,960
Fen,

215
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,840
are you sure this looks okay?

216
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,600
Of course.

217
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,280
Trust my taste.

218
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Listen.

219
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,240
I have fine taste.

220
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,200
Wearing this high-schooler outfit,

221
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,680
with that angelic face of yours,

222
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,840
anyone would be stunned.

223
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
(Yuan Sen: I'm downstairs.)

224
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,600
Jian Dan, I need to head out now.

225
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:32,000
Send me a photo once you put that on.

226
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,560
Yuan Sen.

227
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,960
What are you doing here?

228
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,840
I... I was just passing by.

229
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,840
Mi Fen,

230
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,160
where's Jian Dan?

231
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,680
She's upstairs.

232
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
I'll go get her.

233
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,280
Bye.

234
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,120
Why are you here?

235
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,640
Weren't we meeting at the restaurant?

236
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,040
It's on the way.

237
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,000
Seriously?

238
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,560
(Yuan Sen: Mi Fen,
meet at the Luosifen shop.)

239
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,360
What are you doing?

240
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,480
Riding a shared bike.

241
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,280
Eco-friendly and cheap.

242
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,531
We rode this back

243
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,880
from the concert last time.

244
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
Are you sure
you're okay with this today?

245
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,080
Well, let's take a taxi.

246
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
This restaurant is pretty expensive.

247
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,120
Are you sure you can afford this?

248
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,044
Or are you planning to dine and dash?

249
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,600
Dine and dash, yes.

250
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,874
Excuse me. Scoot over.

251
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,720
What's going on?

252
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,711
(Taxi)

253
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,400
What's going on?

254
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,160
I ordered a rideshare.

255
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,080
Excuse me.

256
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,720
Sir.

257
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,960
Why didn't you say it was a rideshare?

258
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,040
If I had,

259
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,520
would you have still come?

260
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,360
If that's the case,

261
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,240
I'd rather take the shared bike.

262
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,800
Here's your Luosifen.

263
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,240
Thank you.

264
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,240
I ordered two bowls for you.

265
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Thank you.

266
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,800
This is for you.

267
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,520
May I open it?

268
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,211
It's so finely made.

269
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,660
(Prince Luo Shui)

270
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,760
So handsome.

271
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,000
The editing of the photos
will be finished by next week.

272
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,560
I'll send them to you then.

273
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,251
Welcome.

274
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,120
Hello, do you have a reservation?

275
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,800
Hello. My surname is Jian.

276
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,280
I booked ahead.

277
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,480
You reserved the seafood buffet

278
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,320
for two.

279
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,320
This way, please.

280
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,560
No need to bring me that.

281
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:03,200
Both plates are mine.

282
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,720
Did you meet your pen pal?

283
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:23,400
He asked to meet,

284
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,520
but he stood me up.

285
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:30,280
What do you think he's like?

286
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Well...

287
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:33,040
He's smart,

288
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,097
sharp,

289
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,840
and a serious thinker.

290
00:25:37,688 --> 00:25:38,920
He also has neat handwriting.

291
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:43,800
But questionable character.

292
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:47,400
How can you tell?

293
00:25:48,051 --> 00:25:49,160
He stood me up

294
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,440
without giving an explanation.

295
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,680
He just disappeared.

296
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,240
That shows he's unreliable

297
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
and not trustworthy.

298
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,440
That's your fault.

299
00:26:00,444 --> 00:26:01,955
What does it have to do with me?

300
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,040
I think

301
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,600
maybe he couldn't reach you,

302
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,622
that's why he didn't get to explain it
to you.

303
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,920
I left my contact info.

304
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,120
How could he not reach me?

305
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,960
Maybe he never saw it.

306
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,760
Maybe.

307
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,600
Thank you.

308
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,080
I'll treasure it.

309
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,480
About the question you asked me...

310
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,840
My answer is...

311
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,822
Yes.

312
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,720
Yes?

313
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,240
Yes to what?

314
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,720
He means he's willing to be my friend!

315
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,200
Yuan Sen is willing to be my friend!

316
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,080
Table six.

317
00:27:43,222 --> 00:27:43,880
Bill, please.

318
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:44,920
Sure. One moment, please.

319
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,440
Table six

320
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,377
was selected for our
"Dine-And-Dash" free meal.

321
00:27:50,422 --> 00:27:51,555
You don't have to pay.

322
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,200
Dine-And-Dash?

323
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,640
We launched a promotion on our app.

324
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,800
You were selected,

325
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,240
so your meal is free.

326
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,377
(So it was really "dine-and-dash".)

327
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,640
Does it include drinks?

328
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,200
Guests,

329
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,040
this is the finest champagne
we have here.

330
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,005
Rich and fragrant.

331
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,840
Shall I open it now?

332
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,600
Wait.

333
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,040
I'm allergic to alcohol.

334
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,680
I can't drink.

335
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,480
It's fine.

336
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,520
I'll drink it.

337
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,040
You have class tomorrow.

338
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,640
I don't.

339
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,480
How about we have beer?

340
00:28:47,508 --> 00:28:49,360
It goes better with a buffet.

341
00:28:50,057 --> 00:28:51,480
We have dark beer

342
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,520
air-shipped from Germany.

343
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,440
Beer makes me bloated.

344
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,560
Let's have Erguotou.

345
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,520
Don't you want that?

346
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,520
This costs 698 yuan.

347
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,520
I'll have one.

348
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,711
Thank you for your dinner.

349
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:40,733
You're welcome.

350
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,720
Table six. Bill, please.

351
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,240
Table six

352
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,311
was selected for our
"Dine-And-Dash" free meal.

353
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,533
You don't have to pay.

354
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,200
We ordered a bottle of champagne.

355
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,000
The gentleman with you

356
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
paid for it.

357
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,400
You tricked me.

358
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,760
You said it was your treat,

359
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,120
but it was a free meal.

360
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,840
Don't look down on a free meal.

361
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,920
They're hard to win,

362
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,680
especially for their seafood buffet.

363
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,320
It's harder

364
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,000
than winning a lottery.

365
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,520
If so, that shows

366
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,688
your sincerity, huh?

367
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,520
Sincerity...

368
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,800
You can't measure that with money.

369
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,440
Fine.

370
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,911
How about you make a request?

371
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:56,266
I'll make it up to you.

372
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,040
That's more like it.

373
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
The school's open day is this weekend.

374
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,360
Our Swimming Club is hosting

375
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,640
visiting students and parents.

376
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,840
But we're short on people...

377
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,520
No problem. I'll help.

378
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,640
Excuse me, Mister.

379
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,845
