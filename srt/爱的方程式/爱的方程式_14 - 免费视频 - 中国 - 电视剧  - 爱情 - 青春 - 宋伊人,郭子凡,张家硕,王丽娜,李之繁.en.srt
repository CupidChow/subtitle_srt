- Stop following me.

Jian Dan, it's finally winter break.

22
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:56,040
I plan to go sketching
in Mingshan with Yuan Sen.

23
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,080
Where are you going?

24
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,468
I bought a train ticket
to go home tomorrow morning.

25
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,000
You're heading home?

26
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,200
Say hi to my grandma for me.

27
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,760
It's my grandma.

28
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,200
She's my grandma too.

29
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,400
Who wants to team up with me
for winter break?

30
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,200
Yuan Sen will probably
spend it with his girlfriend.

31
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:21,840
Shi will stay with Entong.

32
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,720
Han, you in?

33
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,120
I'll pass.

34
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,120
Ask your girlfriend.

35
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,288
What are her roommates
doing during break?

36
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:34,600
Why should I?

37
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,680
Just do it. Don't ask why.

38
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,325
Even better,

39
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:42,560
you can ask your girlfriend

40
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,782
where you two are going.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
Yue Tangtang is going home.

42
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,040
Dude, who told you to ask Yue Tangtang?

43
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,000
Ask the other one.

44
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,844
She's going home too.

45
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:05,560
Jian Dan can go home
to be with her grandma.

46
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:06,840
She must be super happy.

47
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,360
Grandma, I'm home!

48
00:05:30,977 --> 00:05:34,000
You're home! My sweet granddaughter!

49
00:05:34,782 --> 00:05:36,617
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you too.

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,102
You must be tired.

51
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,920
Come rest for a bit.

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,960
I made all your favorite dishes.

53
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,800
Wait here.

54
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,680
Hi, your delivery's here.

55
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,800

These are all your favorites.

62
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,644
I knew I couldn't hide it from you.

63
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:30,240
What's going on?

64
00:06:30,862 --> 00:06:31,760
Are you sick?

65
00:06:32,622 --> 00:06:34,142
I went to the hospital for a check-up.

66
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:36,234
They said it's...

67
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,955
Chronic heart failure.

68
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,920
Is it serious?

69
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,022
What did the doctor say?

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,320
The medicine can manage it.

71
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
It's not serious, really.

72
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,777
Han Yansheng sent the medicine.

73
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,080
So he already knew?

74
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:56,640
Why didn't he tell me?

75
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,720
I asked him not to tell you.

76
00:07:00,817 --> 00:07:02,194
Don't you blame him.

77
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,337
I made plenty of dishes.

78
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,314
Let me go get them.

79
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,466

for treatment now.)

88
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,480
Guess where I am right now.

89

I'm standing in front of a waterfall!

91
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,844
I had no idea there was
a waterfall in Mingshan.

92
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:55,240
I seriously didn't know.

93
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
It's beautiful.

94
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
Too bad you're not here.

95
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,240
Still, I believe

96
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,360
you're probably even happier than I am

97
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,200
now that you're home with your grandma.

98
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,222
Oh right, Jian Dan.

99
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,800
Say hi to your grandma for me, okay?

100
00:08:08,485 --> 00:08:08,960
Okay.

101
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,577

Have fun out there.

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,266
Don't forget to take lots
of pretty photos for me.

105
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:20,400
Alright then.

106
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:21,840
I'll hang up now.

107
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,120
See you when school starts. Bye!

108
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,120
Grandma, let me do it.

109
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
You're getting older.
Take better care of yourself.

110
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,844
You shouldn't do heavy work
in the fields anymore.

111
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,880
I know you worry about me.

112
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,920
But I'm not at that age yet

113
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,640
where I'm completely useless.

114
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,760
This kind of work is nothing.

115
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,600
Besides,

116
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,680
I just cough every now and then.

117
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,440
Nothing serious.

118
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,933
No way. From now on,
you have to listen to me.

119
00:09:17,137 --> 00:09:18,582
You need to take proper rest.

120
00:09:19,114 --> 00:09:20,840
Alright. I'll do what you say.

121
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,680
But where did you just go?

122
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,280
I just went out for a walk.

123
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,080
Oh right, Grandma.

124
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,160
Our school is offering

125
00:09:31,194 --> 00:09:32,720
a social work program.

126
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,666
If I take part,
I can even get a stipend.

127
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:35,960
There aren't many spots.

128
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,080
I really want to go.

129
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:40,834
Won't it be too tiring for you?

130
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:43,240
It's not like we need the money.

131
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,228
But it's also

132
00:09:46,257 --> 00:09:47,600
a great chance for me to grow.

133
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,720
I really want to go.

134
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,400
If you've already decided,

135
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,422
then you shall have my support.

136
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,022
By the way,

137
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,222
I packed a bunch of local snacks.

138
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,360
When you head back,

139
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:03,960
bring some for Han, alright?

140
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,320
He bought so much medicine for us.

141
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,288
We really should show our gratitude.

142
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,733
Do you have
somewhere to stay when you go back?

143
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,280
Of course.

144
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,080
Of course not.

145
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Did you apply in advance
to stay in the dorm?

146
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:26,440
If you didn't apply early,
you can't stay there.

147
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,320
Auntie, please make an exception.

148
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,160
I really do have an urgent situation.

149
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,080
That's the school's policy.

150
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Please don't put me on the spot.

151
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,240
Go on now.

152
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,120
Leave!

153
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,120
You sneaky girl.

154
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:49,280
You've really got some nerve.
Unbelievable.

155
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,911
Hurry up and grab your things.

156
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,360
I already told you the rules.

157
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,160
Come on, get going.

(Ocean University)

159
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,760
Grandpa, you should eat more fruit.

160
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,600
Get more vitamin C.

161
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:05,670
It's good for your health.

162
00:11:05,688 --> 00:11:06,400

164
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,680
Thank you.

165
00:11:08,688 --> 00:11:09,733
Eat more fruit at home.

166
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,920
Han Yansheng and Gu Entong
really work well together.

167
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,560
They even look great together.

168
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,666
They're such a good match.

169
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,160
I heard the two of them
volunteer together every year.

170
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
They must have a heart of gold.

171
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,920
That's so kind of them.

172
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:22,800

Thank you!

Han! Entong!

175
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:38,560
I just finished delivering goods.

176
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,200
Do you want to grab some food?

177
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,360
Sure.

178
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,680
I made plans tonight
to game with Monkey.

179
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,200
You two go ahead.

181
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay.

182
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,120
Too bad I have to work during break.

183
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Otherwise, I could've joined you

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,800

Grilled meat? Hotpot?

187
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,622
Or Japanese food?

188
00:12:28,274 --> 00:12:28,960
Anything is okay.

189
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:33,240
Let's do Japanese food.

190
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:39,160
Hi, there.

191
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,440
We just launched a new item.

192
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
Chocolate pudding cake.

193
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,480
Feel free to drop by our shop.

194
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,674
This is our new chocolate pudding.

195
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,040
We also do deliveries.

196
00:12:47,371 --> 00:12:49,440
Hi, there. We just launched

197
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,560
a chocolate pudding cake.

198
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,440
Delivery is available too.

199
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:06,560
Jian Dan?

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,711
It really is her.

201
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,480
Jian Dan!

202
00:13:17,888 --> 00:13:20,022
- Shi?
- Jian Dan, what are you doing here?

203
00:13:20,244 --> 00:13:21,355
I thought you went home.

204
00:13:21,377 --> 00:13:22,688
Why are you handing out flyers?

205
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
I'm doing a part-time job.

206
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,666
Are you done for the day?

207
00:13:26,733 --> 00:13:27,755
Should I walk you back?

208
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,160
I'm staying at a budget hotel.

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,120
It's really close by.

210
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Just two stops from here.

211
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,688
Don't worry about me. You guys go.

212
00:13:32,805 --> 00:13:34,000
Let Shi drive you back.

213
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,280
It's okay. I'll grab a taxi.

214
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:36,360
Really, I'm fine.

215
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:38,680
Are you sure you can manage?

216
00:13:39,331 --> 00:13:39,920
Certainly.

217
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,488
Be careful, okay?

218
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Yeah, stay safe.

219
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,600
Why won't it start?

220
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
The boss said

221
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,520
the battery's been acting up.

222
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,720
What should we do now?

223
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,840
Do you have a backup battery
or something?

224
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,600
Yeah, it's in the trunk.

225
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:06,400
This one.

226
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,000
All set.

227
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,200
Go ahead. Give it a try.

228
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:36,548
It works!

229
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:39,680
Go on.

230
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,880
Jian Dan, you're awesome.

231
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,177
I didn't know you're a mechanic.

232
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,760
I just know a bit here and there

233
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,977
to get by in a pinch.

234
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,577
But honestly, your car

235
00:14:46,628 --> 00:14:48,280
should be taken to a repair shop.

236
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,000
Just to be safe.

237
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,560
Why don't you come with us?

238
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,044
What if something else goes wrong?

239
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, Jian Dan, just come with us.

240
00:14:54,091 --> 00:14:54,640
Hop in.

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,640
Alright.

242
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,200
But let me get changed first.

243
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,640
(Job Opening)

244
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:05,240
Boss,

245
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,640
how long will the repair take?

246
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
Given the condition it's in...

247
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:10,080
It won't be quick.

248
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,320
You'll have to
come back for it tomorrow.

249
00:15:12,862 --> 00:15:14,154
Tomorrow?

250
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:15,880
You're actually lucky, to be honest.

251
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,840
The battery was almost totally dead.

252
00:15:18,177 --> 00:15:19,960
It's a miracle the car
made it here at all.

253
00:15:21,114 --> 00:15:22,160
All thanks to my friend.

254
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,760
She helped me rig a quick fix.

255
00:15:26,622 --> 00:15:28,920
Young lady, you know how to fix cars?

256
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,600
I used to work on tractors.

257
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,600
It's the same idea.

258
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,400
Girls who can do this kind of stuff

259
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,711
are really rare these days.

260
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,880
Since you're hiring,

261
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,680
and you even offer free housing,

262
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,120
could I give it a shot?

263
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,280
We usually only hire men here.

264
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,480
You're a girl.

265
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,844
It might not be the best fit.

266
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:49,760
Jian Dan,

267
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:51,755
are you sure this is
the right place for you?

268
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,280
It's fine. I can handle it.

269
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Jian Dan said she's up for it,

270
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,066
so we should support her.

271
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:00,280
Boss.

272
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,560
This good friend of mine

273
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,640
really needs this job.

274
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,120
You see how serious she is.

275
00:16:06,737 --> 00:16:07,200
So,

276
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,971
do consider it.

277
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:10,440
Give her a chance.

278
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,120
Boss, I'll work really hard.

279
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,600
If you're that determined,

280
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,040
then you may stay.

281
00:16:19,171 --> 00:16:20,120
Thank you, boss!

282
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:20,920
Jian Dan,

283
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,680
are you sure about this?

284
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,240
They give free housing,

285
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,800
and the job isn't too tough.

286
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,680
It's not bad.

287
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:30,733
Oh right, Jian Dan.

288
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,834
Since you're back now,

289
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,066
shouldn't you tell Sheng?

290
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,680
Maybe not yet.

291
00:16:39,017 --> 00:16:39,960
Hey girl,

292
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
let me get you registered,

293
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,880
okay?

294
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,000
- Let's go.
- Okay.

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,866
- You can leave your stuff here.
- Thanks, boss.

296
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,560
Han, don't forget to gear up.

297
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,080
Got it.

298
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,240
Left, left, left!

299
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm coming!

300
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,480
Shi, join us.

301
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,040
Come on.

302
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,760
Nah, I'm out.

303
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,440
Carry on.

304
00:17:02,908 --> 00:17:03,400
Han.

305
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,800
Have you talked to Jian Dan lately?

306
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,040
Han! You just let the team down!

307
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,422
I'm done playing.

308
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,920
Didn't she go home?

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,320
Why are you bringing her up?

310
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Just asking.

311
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,280
I was curious.

312
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,622
My boss's car broke down.

313
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:26,080
I dropped it off at the repair shop.

314
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,200
But I have work tomorrow.

315
00:17:27,266 --> 00:17:28,577
Can you go pick it up for me?

316
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,644
Sure.

317
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,920
Thanks. I'll head out then.

318
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,200
- Bye, Shi.
- See ya.

319
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,560
Hi, I'm here to pick up a car.

320
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,440
For Su Lishi.

321
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,600
It's this one.

322
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,360
Su Lishi?

323
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,400
Alright, sign here.

324
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:48,920
Okay.

325
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,600
Here's the key.

326
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,040
Thanks.

327
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,280
Jian Dan.

328
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,733
I left the tools you needed here.

329
00:17:58,948 --> 00:18:00,360
Great, thanks!

330
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,555
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

331
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,280
Wait, are you working here?

332
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:39,760
I'm doing part-time here.

333
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,520
If you need money,

334
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,200
I can help you.

335
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:52,680
No need.

336
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,422
I can earn it myself.

337
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,160
This job doesn't suit you.

338
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,422
I actually like it here.

339
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,280
Okay.

340
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:04,800
It's your call.

341
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:25,955
There he is.

342
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,760
Han, game time?

343
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,600
Join us?

344
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,760
Nah.

345
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,120
Not in the mood.

346
00:19:32,937 --> 00:19:33,902
What's up with you today?

347
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,280
You seem kind of off.

348
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,000
Did you already know

349
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,733
Jian Dan was working
at the repair shop?

350
00:19:43,422 --> 00:19:44,920
I thought she went home!

351
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
I ran into her on the street yesterday.

352
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:48,480
She was handing out flyers.

353
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,155
It looked like she needed the money.

354
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,400
I wonder if she's in trouble.

355
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,680
She has really been through a lot.

356
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,840
(Is it because
of her grandma's illness?)

357
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,320
She's living in
the repair shop dorm now.

358
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:01,840
Everyone else there is a guy.

359
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,600
That's really not safe.

360
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,017
Didn't your aunt's place stay empty

361
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,320
after she went abroad to study?

362
00:20:09,777 --> 00:20:11,555
And you hired someone
to clean it regularly.

363
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,440
Yeah.

364
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,266
She's not coming back anytime soon.

365
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,988
Right now Jian Dan's stuck

366
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,044
in a dorm full of guys.

367
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,000
That can't be okay.

368
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm coming.

369
00:20:44,754 --> 00:20:45,640
Why are you here?

370
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,980
(Housekeeping Service Contract)

371
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,080
A housecleaning job?

372
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,120
So, I do chores?

373
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,760
This place belongs to my aunt.

374
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,160
She moved overseas to study.

375
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,822
We've had someone clean it since.

376
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,280
Thanks.

377
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,222
Don't get me wrong.

378
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm not doing this to help you.

379
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
The lady who used to clean

380
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
quit before New Year's.

381
00:21:10,555 --> 00:21:11,622
I need to hire someone.

382
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,600
You came to mind.

383
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:14,560
Don't turn me down just yet.

384
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,760
Think about it.

385
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,920
Hey, about earlier...

386
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,000
Jian Dan.

387
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:36,177
I ran out of shampoo.
Mind if I borrow yours?

388
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,577
Cool, I'll give it back later.

389
00:21:40,142 --> 00:21:40,840
Oh right.

390
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,400
We've got two new guys
joining us tonight.

391
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,942
The dorm is full now.

392
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,400
You might need to share your space.

393
00:21:46,466 --> 00:21:47,310
Tidy up a bit, okay?

394
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:47,960
I'm off.

(I signed the contract.)

397
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,120
You're here, handsome.

398
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:19,360
All done.

399
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:20,960
Alright.

(Transfer: 200 yuan)

401
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,288
I sent it to you.

402
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,120
Got it.

403
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,200
If you have gigs like this,

404
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:30,600
call me.

405
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,360
There won't be a next time.

406
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,177
You can stay here from now on.

407
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,440
Lock the doors and windows at night.

408
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,133
Call me if there's anything.

409
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Wait a second.

410
00:23:07,468 --> 00:23:09,560
Grandma asked me to bring you
some local specialties.

411
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:13,200
Thanks for sending her the medicine.

412
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,155
So you knew.

413
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,200
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

414
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
I know.

415
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,000
Grandma told me everything.

416
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,280
She asked you not to say anything.

417
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,360
How do you cook this stuff anyway?

418
00:23:34,514 --> 00:23:35,640
It's really easy.

419
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,520
Just slice the cured meat.

420
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,320
Then steam it in a pot

421
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:41,160
for about 20 to 30 minutes.

422
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:42,840
But don't steam it too long...

423
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:44,000
That's way too much work.

424
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:46,120
Why don't you just cook it for me?

425
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll come over later.

426
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,222
Don't make it too salty.

(Ocean University's
"Care for the Elderly" Program)

428
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,600
I'm heading out, Sir.

429
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:15,228
Sheng!

430
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,540
There's a new movie out.

431
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,600
Let's go watch it.

432
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,280
I have plans tonight.

433
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,466
Don't tell me it's with Monkey again.

434
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,520
No, it's not. I must get going.

435
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:32,320
It's always like this with you.

436
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,955
Didn't I tell you to lock the place?

437
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:53,880
Why is the door open?

438
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,897
You came at the perfect time.

439
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,000
Did you follow the smell?

440
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,640
Need a hand?

441
00:24:59,088 --> 00:25:00,320
I'm good. It's already done.

442
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,240
Dig in.

443
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:04,680
Stir-fried cured meat
with dried chilies.

444
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,160
This is stir-fried with garlic shoots.

445
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,910
This is stir-fried millet
with cured meat.

446
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,933
And I also made
bamboo shoot soup with cured meat.

447
00:25:09,965 --> 00:25:11,480
Come on, try it. See if you like it.

448
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Well?

449
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:32,480
How is the soup?

450
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,920
Not bad.

451
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,480
But it's still a bit off from
what I consider perfect.

452
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,360
That's because
I haven't cooked in a while.

453
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,280
I'm out of practice.

454
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:50,080
Otherwise, it would've tasted better.

455
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,320
When did you start learning how to cook?

456
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,760
I think I was around ten.

457
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:04,280
That was when my parents
had an accident.

458
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,720
After that, it was just Grandma and me.

459
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,080
Her health wasn't good either,

460
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:11,280
but she still worked
to support both of us.

461
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,080
I felt like she was carrying too much,

462
00:26:13,285 --> 00:26:15,571
so I started helping
with housework and cooking.

463
00:26:15,925 --> 00:26:16,880
Back then,

464
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,160
Grandma really loved the food I made.

465
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,640
It's just a shame

466
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:23,280
that ever since I started school,

467
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,520
I haven't cooked for her.

468
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,680
Don't worry.

469
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
She is going to be fine.

470
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,479
If it comes down to it,
I'll take one for the team.

471
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,555
I'll be your guinea pig.

472
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,360
You can cook for me every day.

473
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,160
Once you've perfected your skills,

474
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,320
cook for your grandma.

475
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,040
Who said I'd cook for you every day?

476
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,640
Don't tell me these four dishes
are all you know?

477
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,760
Of course not.
I can make tons of stuff.

478
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,760
My specialty is razor shell pot.

479
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,480
Here, try this one.

480
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,080
It's really good.

481
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,840
Eat up.

482
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,080
Eat up.

Grandpa, see you.

485
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
Bye, Grandpa.

486
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,440
Bye.

487
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,320
Sheng, we're done early today.

488
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:25,440
Let's go hang out.

489
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,390
I need to swing by the seafood market

490
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,422
for some razor shells.

491
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,360
Razor shells?

492
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,920
What for?

493
00:27:32,577 --> 00:27:33,640
To eat, obviously.

494
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,400
Since when do you
even like razor shells?

495
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,000
Hang on. Wait for me.

496
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:43,880
You again?

497
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:46,720
Take it.

498
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,240
Why did you buy razor shells?

499
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,720
Isn't razor shell pot

500
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
your best dish?

501
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,320
Make it light.

502
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:20,840
So, how is it?

503
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,800
It's just okay.

504
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,120
That's probably because the ingredients

505
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,111
weren't fresh enough.

506
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,880
Razor shells taste best
with mud on them.

507
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:40,960
I'll try a different market next time.

508
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,040
I know a great place.

509
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:44,880
Their stuff is super fresh.

510
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
They even deliver within a few hours.

511
00:28:50,377 --> 00:28:51,320
Let me check it out.

512
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:54,080
They have a huge selection.

513
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,320
Why did you order so much meat?

514
00:29:00,577 --> 00:29:01,733
We're doing a barbecue.

515
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,211
We can't finish it all.

516
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,320
We can just eat the rest later.

517
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,205
No, no, no.

518
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:09,960
That's enough. It'll go to waste.

519
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,834
One more order.

520
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,200
You handle the grill,
and I'll handle the eating.

521
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,000
Why am I always
the one doing the cooking?

528
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,555

to some BBQ.)

it might snow tonight.

After this, we probably won't

558
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,760
get to meet up often.

559
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,360
Alright then.
Can you help book a table?

560
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,600
Sure thing. No problem.

561
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,640
(Han Yansheng: Something came up.
I might be late.)

562
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,800
Hi, there. Would you like to order now?

563
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:02,720
Here's our menu for you to browse.

564
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,080
We'll order a bit later.

565
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,640
No problem.

566
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:06,360
Thank you.

567
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,399
(- Let's grab BBQ tonight.
- Something came up. I might be late.)

568
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,577
Hi, there. Excuse me.

569
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,360
It's our opening,
and we have a full house.

570
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,880
Would you mind sharing a table?

571
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,960
No, it's alright.

572
00:32:53,297 --> 00:32:54,360
I'm not eating here today.

573
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,240
Thanks anyway.

574
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,739
- That's enough.
- Yeah, that's enough.

575
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,355
You've worked so hard.
You should eat up.

576
00:33:04,377 --> 00:33:05,200
I hope it's enough.

577
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,520
Here, I got milk tea for everyone.

578
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,040
Senior, you finally showed up!

579
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:10,822
Which one do you want?

580
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,644
I'll have this one.

581
00:33:11,645 --> 00:33:12,240
Alright.

582
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,288
Entong, I've got
something to take care of.

583
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,200
I'll head out now.

584
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:19,885
Everyone is still enjoying themselves.

585
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,266
Can't you stay for a little while?

586
00:33:22,211 --> 00:33:22,880
Yansheng, Entong,

587
00:33:23,028 --> 00:33:24,645
this event was really meaningful today.

588
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:25,880
If you ever plan another one,

589
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:26,960
please invite us!

590
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Of course I will.

591
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,066
Here's to our volunteer event

592
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:31,280
and a perfect wrap-up.

593
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,333
Let's raise our glasses!

594
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,800
Cheers! Bottoms up!

595
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,840
Yansheng, come on!

596
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,240
Sheng!

597
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Cheers!
