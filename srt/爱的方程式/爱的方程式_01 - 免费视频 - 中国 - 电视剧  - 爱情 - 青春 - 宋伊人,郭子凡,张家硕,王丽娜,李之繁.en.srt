Han Yansheng.

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,155
I made this cake for you by hand.

34
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,620
I don't need it.

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,180
Hold on.

36
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,500
Excuse me.

37
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,500
You almost hit me.

38
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,140
Shouldn't you at least say sorry?

39
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,260
You two are friends, right?

40
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,220
First of all, I don't like sweets.

41
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,540
Second, I don't think
I owe you an apology.

42
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,380
If you don't like cake,

43
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,888
I can give you something you like.

44
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,660
Do you know what I like?

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,740
I do. You like math.

46
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,620
I read your paper
on a mathematics journal

47
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,500
about the Poincaré Conjecture.

48
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,300
What's your take on that?

49
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,580
Do you agree with my points?

50
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,180
Didn't you say you read it?

51
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,500
Does knowing the Poincaré Conjecture
make you feel superior?

52
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,580
You sound like
you know something about it.

53
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,300
The Poincaré Conjecture states

54
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,220
that a simply connected, closed
3-manifold

55
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,380
is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.

56
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,660
In Topology,

57
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,460
it's as significant as proving
that one plus one equals two.

58
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,220
This is also the only one

59
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,940

that has been solved.

60
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,220
Okay.

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,780
I'll be right there.

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,580
Han Yansheng,
I made this cake for you...

63
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,940
I... I'll wipe it for you.

64
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,860
I don't want to see you two again.

71
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm from Shenmu Village.

72
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,580
Here. Pick one.

73
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,223
I made this luck deck myself.

74
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,540
Pick a card. I'll read your fortune.

75
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,100
You have bad luck today.

76
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,140
I suggest you stay away from water.

77
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,220
I just fell into a puddle.

78
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,140
My bag is still wet.

79
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,940
You're something.

80

Hello, I'm Mi Fen.

81
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,300
My bed is opposite yours.

82
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,420
Nice to meet you.

83
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,300
Say, I brought some local snacks.

84
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,420
Do you want to try some?

85
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,380
Jian Dan,

86
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,020
you're such a treasure girl.

87
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,940
Grandma told me to bring more snacks

88
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,260
to share with my dormmates.

89
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,060
Then I won't hold back.

90
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,020
Delicious.

91
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,540
Where are the rest?

92
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,740
There are three people in our dorm.

93
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,900
The bed next to you is empty.

94
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,181
The girl beside me

95
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,060
left early this morning with a cake.

96
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,340
No idea where she went.

97
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,220
What's that? Smelly.

98
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,700
It's you.

99
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,300
I was wondering who it was.

100
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,500
Turns out it's Miss Zala.

101
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,940
Do you know each other?

102
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:50,620
(Monkey: You can come get your book.)

103
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,140
(See you at the swimming pool.)

104
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,020
I'm meeting someone.
I'm going to be late.

105
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,460
Bye.

106
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,780
Han, you're here.

107
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:12,060
That's very unkind of you.

108
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,500
You didn't tell me you've got a cake.

109
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,820
It's not my day today.

110
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:17,466
I don't want to hear the word "cake".

111
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,060
Who upset you?

112
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,500
Tell me. Cheer me up.

113
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,100
Do you have nothing better to do?

114
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,200
Have you done the recruitment poster
for Swimming Club?

115
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:27,340
That's out of my depth.

116
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,780
I left it to Yuan Sen.

117
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:31,500
Don't worry.

118
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:32,740
Good.

119
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,940
Han, are you going swimming?

120
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,980
Han!

121
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,620
He's going swimming.
He hasn't touched water in a year.

122
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,420
Aren't you surprised at all?

123
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,220
I'm surprised.

124
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,940
I don't see you even a little surprised.

127
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,540
(I knew he wouldn't always stay down)

128
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,060
(because of that incident.)

129
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,180
(He just needs a little push now,)

130
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,580
(and he'll be back to form.)

131
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,500
You again?

132
00:09:56,577 --> 00:09:59,500
Don't you know unauthorized people
aren't allowed in the Swimming Club?

133
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:01,820

Put it down.

137
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,340
This isn't 90 percent new at all.

138
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,500
You're scamming me.

139

140
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,940

145
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,700
Let's observe first.

146
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,650
This might be Han's chance
to get over his fear.

147
00:10:59,096 --> 00:10:59,900
Stop acting.

- Wake up!

00:11:45,894 --> 00:11:46,660

at the pool was you...

I don't care if it was a mistake.

172
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:55,940
From now on,

173
00:12:56,548 --> 00:12:57,980
stay away from me.

But just to be safe,

179

you'll need a blood test

180
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:33,060
and take an X-ray

181
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:35,340

your first time drowning.

take some tests, right?

00:13:43,527 --> 00:13:45,100
All right. Get some rest first.

(Apartment Building No. 15, 16)

189
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,660
Han, the results are out.

190
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,980
Wait, wait.

191
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,340
Let's talk here.

192
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,700
How's he?

193
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,020
The doctor said he just swallowed water.

194
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,940
Nothing serious.

195
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:24,700
Good to hear that.

196
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,380
I'll apologize to him...

197
00:14:28,454 --> 00:14:29,211
Wait here first.

198
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,580
I'll check with him.

199
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:35,700
Monkey.

200
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:38,020
Who are you talking to outside just now?

201
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,260
Jian Dan wants to visit you.

202
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,820
Who is Jian Dan?

203
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,244
The one who pushed you into the pool

204
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:47,220
and saved you.

205
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,300
I don't want to see her.

00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:16,980
Read this.

213

Who is it? Let me see.

214
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,500
This is too funny.

215
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,180

219

Yuan Sen, why aren't you reacting at all

220
00:15:40,124 --> 00:15:41,500
when something this big happened?

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,860
Do you have the delete access?

222
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,420
No.

223
00:15:46,675 --> 00:15:48,420
Can you stop people
from liking the post?

224
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,180
No.

225
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,180
See? There's nothing we can do.

226
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,260
No point in panicking.

227
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,100
You may be right.

228
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,781
But this concerns Han's reputation.

229
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,490
What if he finds out about this post?
You...

230
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:00,487
What post?

231
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:07,820
Nothing.

232
00:16:07,978 --> 00:16:09,180
Um... Han.

233
00:16:09,508 --> 00:16:11,740
Why aren't you resting?
Why are you out here?

234
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:12,859
I'm taking a walk.

235
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,955
What were you talking about?

236
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,260

237
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,100

241
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:26,340
Right?

242
00:16:32,355 --> 00:16:33,884
Han, you haven't eaten, right?

243
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,244
I'll go buy breakfast for you.

244
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,220
Stand there.

245
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:38,487

246
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,620

256

00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:40,970

touched the pool for a year.)

that wasn't the real reason.)

Tell me.

322
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,200
Did you ask Monkey
to give me that letter?

323
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,580
You got it?

324
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,580
Have you read it?

325
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,700
Yes.

326
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,420
Did you put the paper in the envelope?

327
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,860
It took me a long time to write it.

328
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,540
So that's what you meant to say?

329
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,420
Everything I wanted to say

330
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,860
is in there.

331

Very good.

333
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:02,940

Yes. Why not?

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,400
Then I'm relieved.

No thanks.
I know which club I'm joining.

345

The Swimming Club.

347
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,540
You're joining the Swimming Club?

348
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,300
Their entrance requirements
are super strict.

349
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,180
It's hard to get in.

350
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,100
I heard that too.

351
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,820
But I looked into it.

352
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,780
They have the highest rating
out of all the clubs.

353
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,260
I need the credits.

354
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,980
Yes, but...

355
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,780
You've rubbed the president
the wrong way.

356
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,933
Did you forget about that?

357
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,460
Don't worry.
We've cleared up the misunderstanding.

358
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,420
I'm sure he won't hold a grudge.

359
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,022
I'm going to sign up.

360
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,380
I'll come find you later then.

361
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,260
Bye.

362
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,740
Excuse me, are you recruiting
a new president?

00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,180
As for this student...

370
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,420
(Awards Received)

371
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,940
You don't have a single award,

372
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,820
and you're signing up
for the Swimming Club?

373
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:21,155
Who gave you the courage?

374
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,340
Who says I have no rewards?

375
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,016
I win the championship every year

376
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,755
in my village's swim competitions.

377
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,500
What kind of award is that?

378
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,620
Don't waste your time.

379
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,380
The Swimming Club doesn't take in

380
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,580
just anyone.

381
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,260
Look at the club's mission here.

382
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,820
"To enrich campus life,

383
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,460
promote swimming

384
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,060
and get more people to exercise."

385
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,220
If the club only accepts
talented students with awards,

386
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,311
doesn't that go against
its original intent?

387
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,340
How is that any different from clubs

388
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,933
that only care about profits?

389
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:58,940
Senior,

390
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,580
please give me one chance.

391
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,466
I'll prove my ability to you.

392
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,740
If you put it that way,

393
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,200
everyone should be given a chance.

394
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:07,600
Otherwise, wouldn't that be unfair?

395
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,620
Sorry,

396
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,620
you may have a point.

397
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,300
But our club has recruitment standards.

398
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,900
Given your current situation...

399
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,333
Given her current situation...

400
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,060
She's been accepted.

401
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,660
President, are you saying...

402
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,220
You're accepted.

403
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,260
But she hasn't won any rewards.

404
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,260
I've seen her swimming myself.

405
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,620
I believe she's qualified
to join the club.

406
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:41,740
Yeah. She pulled you out of the water

407
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,288
and even gave you mouth-to-mouth...

408
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,980
What I'm saying is

409
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,460
Jian Dan can swim.

410
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,180
As the Vice President,

411
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,100
I officially approve
Jian Dan's application.

412
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,900
Monday night at 8 PM.

413
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,780
All new members must report in.

414
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:03,860
Don't be late.

415
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,300
Don't worry. I'll be there on time.

416
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,022
Hello, everyone.

417
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,580
I'm the Vice President
of the Swimming Club, Xiahou Ling.

418
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,460
Okay. Good.

419
00:27:27,622 --> 00:27:29,377
First of all, congratulations to you all

420
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:31,060
on becoming the new members.

421
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:33,180
This year will be different from before.

422
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,060
This year, we're introducing
a brand-new training mode.

423
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,140
Each senior will pair with a new member

424
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,700
for one-on-one training.

425
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,260
Most importantly,

426
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,180
our president will participate in this.

427
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,620
He'll be choosing one new member

428
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,820
for one-on-one training.

429
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,500
Applause!

430
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,060
Han, the new members are all here.

431
00:27:59,100 --> 00:27:59,780
Pick one.

432
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:06,140
I'm choosing at random.

433
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,500
Those who aren't picked,
don't be discouraged.

434
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,860
Every one of our senior members
is top-notch.

435
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:15,333
I believe you'll get excellent training

436
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,700
and good results

437
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
under their guidance.

438
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,300
Applause!

439
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,700
It's you.

440
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:57,580
Me?

441
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,060
Starting today, I'll be giving you

442
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,180
one-on-one training.

443
00:29:01,842 --> 00:29:04,220
But don't get too excited just yet.

444
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,222
I'll be even tougher on you

445
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,460
than on the others.

446
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,940
I'll do my best.

447
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,140
He picked a girl?

448
00:29:24,872 --> 00:29:27,340
(Ocean University)

449
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:31,860
Jian Dan.

450
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:33,540
Congrats.

451
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,622
The president picked you
for one-on-one training.

452
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,940
I believe you must be

453
00:29:38,981 --> 00:29:39,980
the best among us

454
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,533
to get chosen, right?

455
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:44,060
Why don't we have a race

456
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,780
and let everyone see

457
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,900
your real ability?

458
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,220
What do you say?

459
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:53,260
Why should I race you?

460
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:55,540
Because I'm not convinced.

461
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,060
I believe many others here feel the same

462
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,777
and question whether you're that good.

463
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,100
If you win,

464
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,940
it proves you're a good swimmer,

465
00:30:08,341 --> 00:30:09,580
and we won't say another word.

466
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,980
But if you lose,

467
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:14,140
you have to give up
the one-on-one training spot

468
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,660
to someone more capable.

469
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,060
I'll race you,

470
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,380
but I won't accept an unfair race.

471
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,100
What do you want then?

472
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:22,660
It's simple.

473
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,700
If I lose, I give up the spot.

474
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:26,980
If you lose, you...

475
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,822
If I lose, I quit the club.

476
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,977
Is that really necessary?

477
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:38,780
Of course.

478
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,844
You'd better give it
everything you've got.

479
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,340
Still...

480
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,311
You're going to lose to me.

481
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,340
Let's see, then.

482
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,244
Han, why did you pick her?

483
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,533
I thought you didn't like her.

484
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,700
That's why

485
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,700
I picked her.

486
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,577
I'm going to straighten out
that curly hair of hers.

487
00:31:14,722 --> 00:31:15,900
You're insane.

488
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,780
Take your marks.

489
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,911
Let's see how she
gets into the water later.

490
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,688
She's so funny.

491
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:49,780
Not bad.

492
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:10,680
She caught up!

493
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,000
Wow, she swims so fast.

494
00:32:15,755 --> 00:32:16,733
She caught up!

495
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:32,549
She has passed her!

496
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,755
- Fighting!
- Go for it!

497
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,940
90 meters.

498
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,533
- Come on!
- Go for it!

499
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,859
Never would've guessed.

500
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,311
You're pretty awesome!

501
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,310
Good for you!

502
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,018
Han, you've got good eyes.

503
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,377
You picked a potential swimmer.

504
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,911
You won. I'll quit the club.

505
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,580
It's just a bet.

506
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,220
You don't have to do that.

507
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,222
A bet is a bet.
I don't need your sympathy.

508
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,618
Also, don't get smug.

509
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,577
I let my guard down this time.

510
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,311
Next time, I'll beat you.

511
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:03,020
That's all for today's training.

512
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,644
Dismissed.

513
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,380
You!

514
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:08,940
You.

515
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,660
You.

516
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,100
Stay.
