Come on. Tell me.

00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,320
How has everyone been

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
while I was gone?

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,880
Same old.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,560
But lately, we've met

19
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
someone pretty interesting.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Yeah? Who?

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,920
Just someone totally irrelevant.

22
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Han Yansheng!

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,520
That's her.

24
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,080
Just help me sign
the authorization form.

25
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,488
Starting the Rock Climbing Club
really matters to me.

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
This is a private party. Please leave.

27
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,800
(Club Authorization Application)

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,688
As soon as you sign,
I'll leave right away.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,320
So you mean

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,933
if I don't sign, you're not leaving?

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,760
Sheng.

32
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,520
You should be nicer
when you talk to girls.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
Hi, I'm Gu Entong.

34
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,360
I was

35
00:02:33,392 --> 00:02:35,360
in the same class as Sheng and Monkey.

36
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:37,222
I just got back
from an exchange program.

37
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,360
Nice to meet you.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,840
Hi, Entong. I'm Jian Dan.

39
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,120
Jian Dan?

40
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:48,520
Aren't you the one on the forum

41
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,720
who pushed Sheng into the water?

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,360
You're even cuter in person
than in photos.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,560
Thanks.

44
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,440
Let's not just stand here. Come on in.

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,120
Come on.

46
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,080
Come in. Let's go.

47
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,960
Let's all go in together.

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,210
I brought gifts for everyone.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
Come on.

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,520
I even

51
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,440
got a gift for each one of you.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,720
Here.

53
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,311
Sheng.

54
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,400
This is a sliding number puzzle,
like Huarong Road.

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
It might be super easy for you,

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,680
but it can help you speed up

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
your problem-solving.

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,760
Give it a try.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,444
Thanks.

60
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,160
Monkey, I got you something too.

61
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,080
What is it?

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
My favorite flavor!

63
00:03:59,218 --> 00:03:59,840
I know.

64
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:02,040
Entong, you're way too thoughtful.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,080
This is the figurine
Yuan Sen's been dying to get.

66
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,720
Help me pass it to him, will you?

67
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:11,440
See? You always think of everything.

68
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,640
I'll thank you on his behalf.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,429
Don't mention it.
I'm not as good as you make me sound.

70
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,760
Shi.

71
00:04:21,722 --> 00:04:23,355
(Hacker Defense Handbook)
This one's for you.

72
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,000
You remembered my wishlist!

73
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course.

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,560
I remember everything you've said.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,632
Jian Dan...

76
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880
I didn't expect to run into you today.

77
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,333
I didn't prepare a gift for you.

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
It's okay. I don't need one.

79
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:47,269
That won't do.

80
00:04:47,377 --> 00:04:48,960
You ran over here in such a rush, right?

81
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,280
Your bangs are a little messy.

82
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,920
I just remembered I have

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,400
a brand-new hair clip in my bag.

84
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,720
- It's okay.
- Look.

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,960
I think it suits you.

86
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:58,192
Try it on.

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
Here.

88
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,000
All done.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,080
Guys, look.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
Isn't she super cute?

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,560
It really is cute.

92
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,860
Jian Dan, I think you should
try this hairstyle more often.

93
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,750
It's seriously so cute.

94
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,760
I think so too.
You look great, Jian Dan.

95
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:17,640
Did you finish your enrollment?

96
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,760
Yeah, all done.

97
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,760
I just need to check in
with the music department.

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,680
It's about time.

99
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,640
I should get going now.

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
I'll catch you later.

101
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,320
Okay.

102
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,840
Bye, Entong.

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,120
Alright, bye, Jian Dan.

104
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Bye.

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,240
Bye.

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,110
- Bye.
- Stay safe.

107
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:32,822
Bye, Jian Dan.

108
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
Entong.

109
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,720
Entong, wait a second.

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,720
Jian Dan.

111
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,400
What is it?

112
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:00,960
Your hair clip.

113
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,440
I told you, it's a gift.

114
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,511
I don't think I should accept
a gift from you for no reason.

115
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Alright then, I'll take it back.

116
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,320
Well, I'm off, Entong.

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:13,720
Okay.

118
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,240
Bye.

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,320
Bye.

120
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,640
About the Rock Climbing Club...

121
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,840
I'd still like to talk to you.

122
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,520
Move. There's nothing to talk about.

123
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,680
At least tell me

124
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,088
why you won't sign it.

125
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,088
Have you ever gone climbing?

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,374
Do you know any techniques?

127
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,080
Not yet, at the moment.

128
00:06:54,963 --> 00:06:55,760
But I can learn.

129
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,298
You don't know a thing,

130
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,200
yet you shamelessly
want to start a club?

131
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,120
Nobody's born knowing everything.

132
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,920
How would I know I can't unless I try?

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
I'm really curious.

134
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,520
Why do you want to start a club?

135
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,680
I...

136
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,640
I...

137
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,822
Allow me to explain it.

138
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,229
You're doing it for the credits.

139
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,840
For the scholarship, right?

140
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:19,960
With motives like that,

141
00:07:19,996 --> 00:07:21,240
and no climbing experience,

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,977
how can I possibly
trust you with the space?

143
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,688
You're just not qualified.

144
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,520
Then tell me,

145
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:30,422
what would make me qualified?

146
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,000
Come with me.

147
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,000
If you can climb up there,

148
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,622
I'll sign it right away.

149
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:00,483
Deal.

150
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,840
What now? Planning to skydive?

151
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,545
You can't even put on the gear,

152
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,133
and you want to lead a club?

153
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:34,890
Just give it up.

154
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,680
Climbing's not as easy as you think.

155
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,880
I know it's not easy.

156
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:41,560
But I'll never give up.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,814
Just don't go back on your word.

158
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,276
If I make it up there,

159
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,163
you have to sign it.

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Just a kind reminder.

161
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,177
You need proper
climbing shoes for this.

162
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:06,577
(Palms face down, strike simultaneously.
Arms bent 90° overhead...)

(Climbing Techniques)

164
00:09:51,276 --> 00:09:52,956
Give me a sip of water.

165
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:55,320
Wait till you reach
the next rock before.

166
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,720
Let me push you a little.

167
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,520
You need to try harder, got it?

168
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,360
You got this!

169
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
Go, Jian Dan!

170
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Go, Jian Dan!

171
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,440
Jian Dan!

172
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,360
Go, go, go!

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,967
You can do it!

174
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,690
Let's go!

175
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Maybe lose some weight
while you're at it!

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,280
No way!
I love myself just the way I am.

177
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,483
Sheng.

178
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,840
You said you wanted
to introduce me to members from

179
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,560
the Swimming Club?

180
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,280
Let's go.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,480
Okay.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,472
Come on. Give it a try.

183
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
Everyone, come over here!

184
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,880
I have an announcement.

185
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,480
Starting today,

186
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,160
our Swimming Club

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,680
has a brand-new member.

188
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,280
Introduce yourself.

189
00:11:22,466 --> 00:11:23,511
Give it up for her!

190
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:27,080
Hi, everyone. I'm Gu Entong.

191
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm really happy that starting today,

192
00:11:28,622 --> 00:11:30,040
I get to join the Swimming Club too

193
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,400
and be part of this big family.

194
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not quite sure yet

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,160
what everyone likes,

196
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,480
so I just brought a bunch of snacks.

197
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,920
Hope you all like them.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,120
This is awesome!

199
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,440
Please give me a dozen more
new members like her!

200
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,600
Keep dreaming.

201
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,320
Entong, did I ever tell you

202
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,288
you're the prettiest
and most thoughtful girl

203
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,311
I've ever met?

204
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,189
Whoever ends up dating you

205
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,152
is going to smile in their sleep.

206
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,160
Han Yansheng!

207
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,160
I'm ready.

208
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,505
Alright then. Let's go.

209
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,240
What are those two up to?

210
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,320
No point guessing on our own.

211
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,520
Let's go over and see.

212
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,120
I'm not going. I have to work.

213
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,400
I'm off.

214
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,520
Han, what's going on
with you and Jian Dan?

215
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Why did she suddenly
ask you to watch her climb?

216
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,355
She wants to start a Rock Climbing Club.

217
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,844
She needs the second-floor space.

218
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,200
We made a deal.

219
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,734
If she can climb
to the very top of this wall,

220
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,911
I'll let her use the space.

221
00:13:23,688 --> 00:13:25,333
She wants to start a Rock Climbing Club?

222
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,880
That's ambitious.

223
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,109
Watch this.

224
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,160
For a girl, she's doing pretty well.

225
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,080
It's fine. She grabbed on.

226
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,311
That was close.

227
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,720
Quick reflexes, huh?

228
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,000
Props to you!

229
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,120
Careful!

230
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:56,800
Jian Dan!

231
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,280
Be careful!

232
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,588
Come down! It's too dangerous!

233
00:14:58,588 --> 00:15:00,220
- Jian Dan, watch out!
- Hold on tight, Jian Dan!

234
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,590
- Don't push yourself!
- Hold steady!

235
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,266
Jian Dan, come down!

236
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,080
Come down, Jian Dan!

237
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,640
Careful!

238
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,920
You can step on the right foothold!

239
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,065
Grab it!

240
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,680
- Keep going!
- Come on!

241
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,619
You got this, Jian Dan!

242
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,920
- Go, Jian Dan!
- You can do it!

243
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,440
Right side foothold!

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,760
To the right!

245
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,180
- Nice!
- Good!

246
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,333
- Great job!
- Awesome!

247
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,600
You got this!

248
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,066
- Keep going!
- Go for it!

249
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:37,960
You got it!

250
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,640
Come on!

251
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,860
(Rock Dancer)

252
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:52,190
- Amazing!
- That was awesome!

253
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,120
Han Yansheng, I did it!

254
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:41,960
Sheng.

255
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,829
Our club meeting is starting soon.

256
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,840
We should hurry.

257
00:16:45,036 --> 00:16:45,734
Alright.

258
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:15,327
Jian Dan.

259
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,887
You kissed Han Yansheng!

260
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,876
Stop it! It was just an accident!

261
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,025
An accident?

262
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,880
Look!

263
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,360
(Sheng-Dan Upside-Down Kiss)
You two made campus gossip headlines.

264
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,555
You're now number one
on Ocean University's trending list.

265
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,440
This is lame.

266
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,600
The person who posted it
even added a poll.

267
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,520
Right now, the Tong-Yan ship is
way ahead of the Sheng-Dan ship.

268
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,720
Tong-Yan ship and Sheng-Dan ship?

269
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,200
Gu Entong and Han Yansheng
are the Tong-Yan ship.

270
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,520
You and Han Yansheng
are the Sheng-Dan ship.

271
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,680
Netizens are way too insane now.

272
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm casting my vote!

273
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm voting with your phone too.

274
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,999
Use your own phone!

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,170
- Nope.
- Just give it to me.

276
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,650
We cannot lose to Gu Entong

277
00:17:58,716 --> 00:18:00,956
in popularity, is that clear?

278
00:18:01,429 --> 00:18:03,760
This is the campus forum.
I'll totally...

279
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:08,960
Entong.

280
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,160
What do you think
about all these rumors lately?

281
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,155
It's just gossip.
People are messing around.

282
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,920
You go ahead and do your thing.
Don't mind me.

283
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,133
I'll be fine on my own.

284
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,800
Alright.

285
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,820
(Cast your vote to ship them!
Tong-Yan ship: Vote)

286
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:01,640
Sign it.

287

(Club Authorization Application)

288
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,140
(Signature of Authorization:
Han Yansheng)

289
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,880
You're backing out?

290
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,963
I'm just reminding you

291
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,905
that under the student club guidelines,

292
00:19:22,992 --> 00:19:24,760
if you don't recruit
at least five members,

293
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,288
the club will be disbanded.

294
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,363
Don't worry.
I'll fill the slots in no time.

295
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,894
Fen, listen up!

296
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,440
Get off.

297
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:53,560
Take your shoes off. Get up here.

298
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
You know what?

299
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,120
Stop talking. Draw a card for me.

300
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,911
This card is an upright Strength card.

301
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,680
It stands for personal charm

302
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,760
and determination to succeed.

303
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,800
It means you have the strength

304
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,333
to face any challenge.

305
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,911
Because your heart is full of love.

306
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,400
It also hints at a relationship

307
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,444
that could grow into intimacy.

308
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,000
Two people listening to
and opening up to each other,

309
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,377
without feeling confined in any way.

310
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,422
Nice one, Jian Dan!

311
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,160
You're killing it
in both career and love luck.

312
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,120
Spill it.

313
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,040
You've got good news for me, don't you?

314
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,311
What love luck?
There's none of that going on.

315
00:21:00,876 --> 00:21:03,120
But I do have
some really good news to share.

316
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,444
Han Yansheng signed the form.

317
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,400
That's way better than any love luck!

318
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,760
Jian Dan, get dressed.
Let's go celebrate.

319
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,400
My treat!

320
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,839
Let's celebrate in a couple of days.

321
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,022
I need to finish designing
the recruitment poster.

Hey, interested in joining

324

No thanks.

329
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,861
Jian Dan looks like she's struggling.

330
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,720
Should we give her a hand?

331
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,466
There's contact info at the bottom.

Nope.

334

Come on. Just take one.

335
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,880
Seriously? Who would hand out flyers

(Rock Climbing Club Recruitment)
like it's the old days?

337

What I do is none of your business.

338
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,488
You don't know how to innovate.
No wonder you're not getting recruits.

339
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:21,133
You're rude and arrogant.
No wonder no one likes you.

340
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Jian Dan, Sheng has
always talked like that.

341
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:26,600
He didn't mean anything personal.

342
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,294
Don't take it to heart.

00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:30,040

344
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:31,640
weren't we going to grab food?

345

Come on.

346
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,800
You go ahead. I have work to do.
See you later.

Both?

You and Jian Dan.

Her recruiting's not going well.
She looked really down.

359
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,378
Not surprising at all.

360
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,545
Flyers are outdated.
She's bound to fail.

361
00:23:19,577 --> 00:23:20,888
So what's your brilliant idea?

362
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,360

363
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
Tell me.

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:46,374
Look.

371
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,240
You're only handing out so many flyers.

372
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,560
Your reach is going
to be limited, obviously.

373
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:54,320
Why don't you
consider promoting online?

374
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,280
Promoting online?

375
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,640
Yeah!

376
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,866
Just think about
the gossip with you and Han.

377
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,980
That spread like wildfire.

378
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,538
I get it now.

379
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,240
Thanks, Monkey!

380
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,111
No problem. Don't mention it.

381
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,711
You should thank the other guy.

382
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,280
Huh?

383
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,600
Nothing.

384
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,688
Can you help me with one more thing?

385
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,560
Sure. What do you need?

386
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:32,880
Hold up, stop!

387
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,000
Everyone, listen up!

388
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,600
That's it for today's training session.

389
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,840
Now, go change in the locker room.

390
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm taking you guys somewhere.

391
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,560
Come on.

392
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,400
Move it.

393
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,200
No training today?

394
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,978
Nope, training's over for today.

395
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,533
Go get changed.

396
00:24:48,876 --> 00:24:50,069
Come on. Hurry up!

397
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,589
Faster.

398
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:53,000
Get moving.

399
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,490
Hi, everyone!

400
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,483
Welcome to the Rock Climbing Club.

401
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:06,640
I'm Jian Dan, the club president.

402
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:11,210
To help everyone
get to know climbing better

403
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,080
and love it,

404
00:25:12,374 --> 00:25:14,010
our club is holding a special event.

405
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,749
Reach the top and win a prize!

406
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:18,730
See that box up there, everyone?

407
00:25:20,345 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah, we see it!

408
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,400
No matter who you are,

409
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,280
if you grab that little box,

410
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,000
you'll win the grand prize inside.

411
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,810
Shouldn't everyone
be at training right now?

412
00:25:41,312 --> 00:25:42,243
Where is everyone?

413
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Maybe some of you don't know much

414
00:25:51,858 --> 00:25:52,880
about rock climbing yet.

415
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,290
It evolved from mountain climbing.

416
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,760
It's a competitive sport.

417
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,967
It improves

418
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,840
our coordination and flexibility,

419
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,040
so it's also called ballet
on the rock wall

420
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,760
or rhythmic gymnastics on the cliffside.

421
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,960
Climbing

422
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,847
boosts your focus,

423
00:26:08,912 --> 00:26:11,320
self-confidence,
and drive to push your limits.

424
00:26:11,581 --> 00:26:13,356
But most importantly,

425
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,960
there's a big prize waiting!

426
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,745
- A big prize?
- What kind of prize?

427
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,666
At least she knows
how to bait people. Not bad.

428
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:24,520
What are you mumbling about?

429
00:26:25,807 --> 00:26:26,534
Nothing.

430
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,607
Anyone want to give it a try?

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
It's way too high. I wouldn't dare.

432
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,640
Yeah, what if I fall and hurt myself?

433
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:34,650
Exactly.

434
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,960
You won't fall.
There's a safety rope attached.

435
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:40,272
Yeah, you're secured by ropes up there.

436
00:26:41,523 --> 00:26:42,320
Still looks risky.

437
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,480
I'll do it.

438
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,400
You're the best, Monkey.

439
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,480
Watch me.

440
00:26:49,756 --> 00:26:51,040
Alright, gear up!

441
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,120
Go, Monkey!

442
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,760
Be careful!

443
00:26:56,396 --> 00:26:57,160
Safety first.

444
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,777
Relax, I got this.

445
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,280
Ready.

446
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:01,800
All set.

447
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:04,120
Go!

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,866
- Go, Monkey!
- You got this, Monkey!

449
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:09,840
Go, Monkey!

450
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,120
Go, Monkey!

451
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,600
Come on!

452
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,640
- Go!
- Go!

453
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,720
Go, Monkey!

454
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,640
- Keep going!
- Go for it!

455
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,160
Monkey, go!

456
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,003
You got this, Monkey!

457
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,076
- Keep going!
- Go!

458
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,050
- Go, Monkey!
- You got this!

459
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,160
- Come on!
- Come on!

460
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
Go, Monkey!

461
00:27:29,603 --> 00:27:31,770
- Go!
- Go!

462
00:27:32,534 --> 00:27:34,200
Almost there, Monkey! Come on!

463
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,570
- You got this!
- Keep climbing!

464
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:40,767
- Monkey, go!
- You got it!

465
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,490
- Keep going, Monkey!
- Go, go!

466
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,036
- Go!
- Go!

467
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:49,320
- Come on!
- Come on!

468
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,381
Monkey, are you okay?

469
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:07,821
I'm afraid of heights.

470
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:09,574
The safety rope is really secure.

471
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:11,800
Just let go,
and you'll float down slowly.

472
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
I can't do it!

473
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:18,800
Oh no.

474
00:28:19,488 --> 00:28:21,044
Monkey's afraid of heights.

475
00:28:25,356 --> 00:28:26,781
Monkey, hold tight! Don't let go!

476
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,120
Wait for me to come up.

477
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,600
Okay.

478
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:59,080
Hang in there, Monkey!

479
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,530
Hang in there!

480
00:29:01,596 --> 00:29:02,214
What do we do?

481
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,000
This is amazing.

482
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,560
Be careful!

483
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,933
Monkey, he is close to you.

484
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,080
Just hold on a little longer.

485
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,800
- Almost there!
- Just a little more!

486
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,560
Careful!

487
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,755
- Be careful.
- Just a bit more!

488
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,600
Han.

489
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,360
Monkey, calm your nerves.

490
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll take you down.

491
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,320
Okay.

492
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,680
Hold on to me.

493
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,440
Be careful.

494
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:37,760
I'll count to three.

495
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:39,422
We let go together.

496
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,000
Okay.

497
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:40,760
Ready?

498
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:44,560
One, two, three!

499
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,320
Careful!

500
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,511
You okay, Monkey?

501
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,640
Jian Dan, I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

502
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,880
I'm just glad you're safe.

503
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:03,920
Han.

504
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,088
Don't take it off yet.

505
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,400
Why not?

506
00:30:09,203 --> 00:30:10,825
Jian Dan, wait here a second.

507
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Han, this way.

508
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:17,555
I climbed up there for Jian Dan.

509
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:18,520
That's the only reason.

510
00:30:18,755 --> 00:30:20,466
But I only got halfway
before coming down.

511
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,560
People will think

512
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,200
rock climbing is super scary.

513
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,666
That makes it
even harder for her to recruit.

514
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,120
I meant well but messed up.

515
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,600
I have to make it right.

516
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
How do I fit into this?

517
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,850
Of course, you play a role.

518
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,941
Don't forget.

519
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,733
You suggested the online promotion.

520
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,822
So how about it?

521
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,280
Thanks.

522
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,333
Jian Dan, even though
I couldn't help you,

523
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,266
I did prepare a surprise for you.
