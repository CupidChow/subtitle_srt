If the drowning person
remains unconscious,

16
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,020
you have to perform mouth-to-mouth.

17
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,700
What's wrong?

18
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,300
You don't want to pass the exam?

19
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,100
Pay attention.

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,100
For mouth-to-mouth,

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,500
first of all, gently lift their chin

22
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
to keep their airway open.

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,740
Then use one hand to pinch their nose.

24
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,180
Next, blow big breaths into their mouth.

25
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,060
Han, lunch is ready!

26
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,700
Jian Dan, you're really something else.

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,020
We didn't see anything.

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,100
You two carry on.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,420
It's not what you think it is.

30
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,940
That's not how you save someone.

31
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,300
They'd be dead.

We'll now begin the first test,

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,140
on-site rescue.

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,380
Everyone, get changed.

37
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,060
Get ready to enter the water.

38
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,220
On-site rescue.

39
00:03:26,268 --> 00:03:26,840
Ready.

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,060
Go!

41
00:03:52,497 --> 00:03:54,940
Candidate in lane two, what's going on?

42
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,020
Sorry, Sir.

43
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:58,260
He's not feeling well.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,540
He'll get some rest first.

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,666
Let the next one go ahead.

46
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,860
Han Yansheng didn't
enter the water for the test.

47
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,154
He's in really bad shape.

48
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,660
It's like...

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,580
He's completely lost confidence.

50
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,460
(Seeing him like that,)

51
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,860
(it really hurts.)

52
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,230
(I want to help him,)

53
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,580
(but I don't know how.)

54
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,460
Their cakes look delicious.

55
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,380
Not bad.

56
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,180
Jian Dan, what's the matter?

57
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:41,060
The volunteer exam didn't go well?

58
00:04:41,588 --> 00:04:43,820
Han Yansheng failed
to complete the test today.

59
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,620
He must be feeling awful now.

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,060
I just don't know how to help him.

61
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,420
The best thing now
is to get him doing something else.

62
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:53,620
Take his mind off it.

63
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,140
Like what?

64
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,060
Well, I just wanted to invite you guys

65
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,140
to join me and Yuan Sen

66
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,820
for our 199-day anniversary.

67
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,900
199 days?

68
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,977
I've heard of 100-day
or 200-day anniversaries,

69
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:10,060
but never a 199-day one.

70
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,500
Is there some special meaning?

71
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,860
199 sounds like "forever" in Chinese.

72
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,060
It means Yuan Sen and I

73
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,911
will be together for a long, long time.

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,020
What time and where tomorrow?

75
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,019
Is it hot?

76
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,888
Not really.

77
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,940
Not bad, Mi Fen.

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,940
Mi Fen!

79
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,020
Here they are.

80
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,020
This setup is way too fancy!

81
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,220
How romantic!

82
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,180
Of course!

83
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,420
Life needs a sense of ceremony.

84
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,420
Yuan Sen,

85
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:52,540
how much did this all cost?

86
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,260
None of your business.

87
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,700
Yuan Sen loves me after all.

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,820
When will this be ready?

89
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,331
Almost.

90
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,570
- It's done.
- These are done.

91
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,460
Here, take these.

92
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,337
Go grab a seat.

93
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,337
Sure. I'm going in.

94
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:04,555
Add some chili sauce.

95
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:05,422
- Okay.
- Got it.

96
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,370
First come, first served.

97
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm sitting here.

98
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:09,620
I'll go first.

99
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,380
Here.

100
00:06:12,022 --> 00:06:13,100
Right on time.

101
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,660
Come on.

102
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,690
There's so much booze here.
Let's all have a drink.

103
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,580
Here.

104
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,340
Come on!

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,260
I'll do it.

106
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,005
Let's have a toast

107
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,020
to celebrate Yuan Sen and Mi Fen's

108
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,380
199 days together.

109
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,020
May they stay together always,

110
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,060
forever and ever!

111
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,260
- Thank you!
- Thanks!

112
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,100
- Bottoms up!
- Drink!

113
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:38,260
Don't drink too much.

114
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,260
Even if I do,
it's none of your business.

115
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,220
Really?

116
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,620
Who was hugging the tree
when she was drunk?

117
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:45,700
How embarrassing.

118
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:48,111
Pushing me won't help.

119
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,740
Alright.

120
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,100
Well, we're done with our drinks.

121
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,580
Now I've got an important announcement

122
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,900
to make.

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,860
Thanks for joining us

124
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,900
to celebrate our 199-day anniversary.

125
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,300
We've prepared gifts for you all.

126
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,140
Gifts?

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,980
Before you guys arrived,

128
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,700
we had already buried them

129
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,500
under the sand before us.

130
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,600
Do you want to find them?

131
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:12,460
- You guys...
- Yes!

132
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
Where are they?

133
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:15,311
Hurry up and go look for them, then!

134
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,060
Let's go!

135
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:17,340
Wait up!

136
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,940
Come, we'll join them.

137
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,420
Do you think they'll find them?

138
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,502
That depends on their luck.

139
00:07:32,154 --> 00:07:33,460
Where could they be?

140
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:39,771
There's nothing here!

141
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:41,500
I think both of them

142
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,620
tried to get rid of us

143
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,020
to have a sweet moment alone.

144
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,980
They're nowhere to be seen.

145
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,780
I found it!

146
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:32,580
Let me see!

147
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,980
Why should I show you what I found?

148
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,260
How petty.

149
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,580
Come on, just let me see.

150
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,660
Seriously.

151
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,540
What? That's it?

152
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,420
I like you.

153
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,780
Do you like me?

154
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,420
So she's drunk.

155
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,737
That gave me a fright.

156
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:35,780
Why push yourself if you can't drink?

157
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,100
You're unbelievable.

158
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,740
Why show off

159
00:09:41,933 --> 00:09:43,511
when you can't hold your liquor?

160
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,100
So?

161
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Any luck?

162
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,900
Our luck is really bad.

163
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,580
Take a break.

164
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:21,900
I'll do the digging.

165
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,377
I'm going to use the restroom.

166
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:49,500
- Someone's drowning!
- Someone's drowning!

167
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,577
- Look, someone's drowning!
- Someone's drowning!

168
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,180
- For real?
- Over there!

169
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,331
- Look!
- There!

170
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:55,350
Go help them!

171
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,160
Call the police!

172
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,300
Han Yansheng!

173
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,250
- Yeah, call the police!
- Hurry, go save them!

174
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,497
Go help them! Hurry!

175
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,700
Han Yansheng!

176
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,820
Jian Dan!

177
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,228
Come back!

178
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,020
Alright, I got it.

179
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,133
See you tomorrow at the student council.

180
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,820
Han Yansheng!

181
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,620
Han Yansheng!

182
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:01,737
Jian Dan!

183
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:03,580
Come back, I'm here!

184
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:05,540
Jian Dan!

185
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,700
Han Yansheng!

186
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,140
Jian Dan!

187
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,140
You're finally sober.

188
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,140
- Where are you going?
- Han Yansheng!

189
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:37,140
My goodness.

190
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:38,940
Han actually went in the water!

191
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,220
Han Yansheng!

192
00:12:47,537 --> 00:12:48,580
Jian Dan!

193
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,420
Oh no! Han is drowning!

194
00:13:16,468 --> 00:13:17,140
Jian Dan!

195
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,090
- Let's go!
- Jian Dan!

196
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:18,900
Be careful!

197
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,180
What do we do?

198
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,060
Careful!

199
00:13:44,788 --> 00:13:45,417
Han!

200
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:57,480
Sheng!

201
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,500
- Han!
- Han!

202
00:13:58,714 --> 00:13:59,380
Han Yansheng!

203
00:13:59,468 --> 00:14:00,140
Han!

204
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,120
Han!

205
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,860
Han Yansheng!

206
00:14:02,044 --> 00:14:03,244
- Han!
- Han Yansheng!

207
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,140
Han Yansheng!

208
00:14:07,182 --> 00:14:07,900
Han Yansheng!

209
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:08,500
Han!

210
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:13,668
What happened?

211
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,580
You were drowning.

212
00:14:14,622 --> 00:14:15,620
Jian Dan saved you.

213
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,500
Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

214
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,620
Do we need to go to the hospital?

215
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm fine.

216
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:26,700
I just need a bit of rest.

217
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,940
Come on, Han.

218
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:31,020
I'll help you over there.

219
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,020
Here.

220
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,100
I just had a terrible nightmare.

221
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,260
In the dream...

222
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,100
Han Yansheng's condition
kept getting worse.

223
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,060
Nothing could cure it.

224
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,940
(He completely lost hope.)

225
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,420
(He gave up on himself.)

226
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,700
(Luckily, I woke up
and realized it was just a dream.)

227
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,580
(But now I'm unsure.)

228
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,300
(I don't know
if pushing him to face his trauma)

229
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,700
(was the right thing to do.)

230
00:15:50,302 --> 00:15:52,980
(Apartment No. 17)

231
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,180
I like you.

232
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,340
Do you like me?

233
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,500
(What am I thinking?)

234
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,300
(Jiang Zhishan said she liked me.)

235
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,466
(Was that the truth
or just drunken talk?)

236
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,540
(That's odd.)

237
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,100
(She didn't seem
to drink much yesterday.)

238
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,180
(Just one sip and she was drunk?)

239
00:16:59,378 --> 00:17:01,947
(She even downed
a whole bottle of red wine then.)

240
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,100
Can you do something

241
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,300
to calm me down?

242
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,700
I... I like you!

243
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:02,900
Han.

244
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,420
What's wrong?

245
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,580
Bad dream?

246
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,260
I'm okay.

247
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:08,940
Go to sleep.

248
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,340
Your phone's ringing.

249
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,020
(Psychological
Counseling Center: Hello.)

250
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,700
(Your appointment has been confirmed.)

251
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,060
You don't look so good.

252
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,460
Didn't sleep well?

253
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm fine.

254
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,180
It's just that the volunteer test ended

255
00:19:23,737 --> 00:19:25,100
before it even began.

256
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,940
It's okay.

257
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,971
It didn't go well.

258
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,420
But there's always next time.

259
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,660
I have faith in you.

260
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:47,380
Sir,

261
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:50,380
I've been having nightmares
and insomnia lately.

262
00:19:50,794 --> 00:19:52,300
Is it serious?

263
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,580
Is there still hope for recovery?

264
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:57,020
Don't panic.

265
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,900
I understand how you're feeling.

266
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,180
But I suggest

267
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,700
you take
a psychological assessment first.

268
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,020
Once we get the results,

269
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,380
we can move on
to a more thorough diagnosis.

270
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,300
Sure.

271
00:20:15,028 --> 00:20:18,700
(Psychology)

272
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,200
Head back and wait for the results.

273
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,580
It'll take a few days.

274
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,540
Remember.

275
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,700
Relax.

276
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,900
Anxiety will only make things worse.

277
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:29,980
Thank you, Sir.

278
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,300
(Jian Dan:
Han Yansheng, where are you?)

279
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,780
(Have you had lunch?)

280
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:42,511
(I'm at the cafeteria waiting for you.)

281
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,910
(Han Yansheng:
I have something to deal with.)

282
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,044
(You go ahead and eat.)

283
00:20:59,533 --> 00:21:00,688
(Jian Dan: Alright, then.)

284
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,660
(Don't forget to eat lunch.)

285
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,700
(By the way,)

286
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,660
(I've got a psychology class
this afternoon.)

287
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,300
(Why don't you come along?)

288
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,580
Sorry, I'm late.

289
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,740
It's fine.

290
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:40,180
I'm just happy you came.

291
00:21:41,422 --> 00:21:42,900
Isn't that Han Yansheng?

292
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,340
I thought he was a math major.

293
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,380
Why is he in our class?

294
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Didn't you know?

295
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,700
He's dating our top student,

296
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,622
Jian Dan.

297
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,460
Of course he's here to keep her company.

298
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,180
Jian... Jian Dan.

299
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,740
Wait... Why'd you bring
your boyfriend to class?

300
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,777
If I'd known, I'd have
dragged Yuan Sen here too.

301
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,460
Alright, everyone.

302
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,940
In today's lesson,

303
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,180
we'll continue discussing

304
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,060
case studies of PTSD.

305
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,500
This picture here is

306
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,700
(Case Study)
of a U.S. veteran who served in Vietnam.

307
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,260
After returning home,

308
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,860
he developed
post-traumatic stress disorder.

309
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,460
His symptoms included

310
00:22:25,514 --> 00:22:26,820
recurring nightmares

311
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,580
and chronic insomnia.

312
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,780
Later on, through long-term medication,

313
00:22:33,131 --> 00:22:34,460
he made a full recovery.

314
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,340
There are lots of success stories

315
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:38,300
just like his.

316
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:41,220
For example, the patients shown here

317
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,300
recovered

318
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,460
through a combination
of medication and therapy.

319
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:47,740
They were all cured.

320
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,220
That's great.

321
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,980
So many people got better.

322
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:52,140
You'll be fine too.

323
00:22:53,994 --> 00:22:56,060
Professor, are there any failed cases?

324
00:22:56,474 --> 00:22:58,380
Yes, there are failed ones as well.

325
00:22:58,468 --> 00:23:00,388
The International Journal of Psychiatry

326
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,900
once published a case

327
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
about a man

328
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,140
who went swimming as a child.

329
00:23:07,862 --> 00:23:10,180
His legs got tangled in weeds,

330
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,140
and he nearly drowned.

331
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,740
Ever since then,

332
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:17,740
he developed an intense fear of water.

333
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,340
During desensitization therapy,

334
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,180
he couldn't overcome
his psychological trauma

335
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:27,380
and ended up
with secondary major depression.

336
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,500
It severely affected him

337
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,340
and those around him.

338
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:36,340
It's okay.

339
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,780
That's just one case.

340
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,940
It's not the norm.

341
00:23:47,062 --> 00:23:48,020
Use your arms.

342
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Harder.

343
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,060
Be cautious.

344
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,940
You've got to check this part closely.

345
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:53,820
Got it?

346
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,060
Engage your core too.

347
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,020
Understand?

348
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,180
Bear all this in mind

349
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,820
and you'll be just fine.

350
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,340
To my surprise,

351
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,500
she has such a soft side.

352
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:13,660
My God.

353
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,620
That was close!

354
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,740
Well, should I ask her or not?

355
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,260
If I ask her,

356
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,540
would that be too abrupt?

357
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:22,820
Be upfront

358
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,460
and I'll get the answer.

359
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,660
Should I ask her or not?

360
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,060
What do you want to ask me?

361
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:32,580
Wait...

362
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,060
Why were you sneaking around
eavesdropping?

363
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,780
Sneaking around?

364
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,780
You're the one who's being sneaky.

365
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,180
Spill it.

366
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,888
What do you want to ask me?

367
00:24:48,925 --> 00:24:52,980
Yesterday, you were drunk at the beach.

368
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,060
Do you remember what you said?

369
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,780
Since I was drunk,

370
00:25:01,034 --> 00:25:02,660
how could I remember it?

371
00:25:06,314 --> 00:25:07,300
Well...

372
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,260
Did I do something weird

373
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,220
or say something strange?

374
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:15,180
It's just...

375
00:25:21,748 --> 00:25:22,580
Jason?

376
00:25:23,262 --> 00:25:24,260
You're here?

377
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,500
Great.

378
00:25:25,577 --> 00:25:27,140
I'll be down there after I get changed.

379
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,420
Sure.

380
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,900
Jason?

381
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,100
Shan, I missed you so much.

382
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,940
I missed you too.

383
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,660
Are you in a good mood today?

384
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,580
Wow, he's handsome!
Is he courting Jiang Zhishan?

385
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,900
If it were me, I'd definitely say yes.

386
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,940
Handsome? Really?

387
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,980
He's so hairy.

388
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,580
He's just like a monkey.

389
00:25:56,577 --> 00:25:57,940
That's an insult to monkeys.

390
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,460
I've made a reservation. You'll love it.

391
00:25:59,466 --> 00:26:00,300
Let's go, then.

392
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,740
We can talk on the way there.

393
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,451
Alright. Coffee?

394
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:05,100
Where are you putting your hand, punk?

395
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:05,700
Monkey!

396
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:07,580
Time to train.

397
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,580
Let's go.

398
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:13,348
Ready?

399
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,660
One, two, three, four.

400
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,820
Two, two, three, four.

401
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,820
Three, two, three, four.

402
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,100
Switch sides!

403
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,260
One, two, three, four.

404
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,820
Two, two, three, four.

405
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,740
Three, two, three...

406
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,820
- You take over.
- Got it.

407
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,020
Four.

408
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:57,820
Jiang Zhishan!

409
00:26:57,888 --> 00:26:59,480
I'm still technically your boyfriend,

410
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:00,660
and you're cheating on me?

411
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,580
Wait, you're not Jiang Zhishan?

412
00:27:05,182 --> 00:27:07,460
Monkey, what are you talking about?

413
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:08,980
What do you mean by "cheating"?

414
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,780
I... I got the wrong person.

415
00:27:14,285 --> 00:27:15,860
I... I've got something to do.

416
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,100
I'm heading off now.

417
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,188
Your friend thought we were on a date,

418
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,580
and he got jealous.

419
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
What's happened?
You're in such a good mood.

420
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,580
Nothing.

421
00:27:58,422 --> 00:27:59,060
Oh, right.

422
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:00,940
I have something to tell you.

423
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,140
I've received an invitation to
an international climbing competition.

424
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,355
So I'll be heading abroad
in a few days to compete!

425
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,540
Really?

426
00:28:07,594 --> 00:28:08,340
That's awesome!

427
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,251
Give it your all

428
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:10,300
and bring home a medal.

429
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,428
I hired my usual climbing coach

430
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:13,340
to train me one-on-one.

431
00:28:13,388 --> 00:28:15,180
Hopefully, I'll get back
in top form soon.

432
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,060
It's just

433
00:28:18,222 --> 00:28:19,888
that I'm quite worried about Sheng.

434
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,740
While I'm away,

435
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,380
could you help take care of him?

436
00:28:27,474 --> 00:28:29,340
Don't worry. I've got it.

437
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:30,900
Thanks.

438
00:28:33,908 --> 00:28:36,380
Have you told the rest about your trip?

439
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:38,440
Not yet.

440
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,980
Only you and Sheng know it.

441
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,940
What about Monkey?

442
00:28:45,874 --> 00:28:47,180
You're not planning to tell him?

443
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:59,420
Suitcase, instant noodles...

444
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,260
Charger, adapter...

445
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,860
Suitcase? Instant noodles?

446
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:37,060
Why are you writing all this?

447
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm going abroad.

448
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,020
Didn't you just get back?

449
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,860
Why are you leaving again? For what?

450
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,260
Are... Are you coming back?

451
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,140
No, I'm not.

452
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,533
There's nothing or nobody here

453
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,940
worth staying for anymore.

454
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,180
Why would I be back here?

455
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:02,300
What are you doing here?

456
00:30:02,811 --> 00:30:04,500
You were so rude to my friend yesterday.

457
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,390
I haven't even settled the score
with you yet.

458
00:30:09,742 --> 00:30:13,540
Well... It was indeed my fault.

459
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:16,420
So, what would it take
for you to forgive me?

460
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:25,940
Help me buy everything on this list.

461
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,220
(Apartment Building No. 15-16)

462
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,020
Hello?

463
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:54,220
I bought all your stuff.

464
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,060
And I left it with the dorm lady.

465
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,380
Remember to pick it up.

466
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:58,740
Sure.

467
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,260
Ma'am?

468
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,900
Where's my stuff?

469
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,220
Over there.

470
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,540
Come get it yourself.

471
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,100
What's wrong with this?

472
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,260
Why'd you carry it in like that?

473
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,580
The wheels broke.

474
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,348
Where'd you get this suitcase?

475
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,300
The quality's awful.

476
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,660
Let's check what's inside first.

477
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,080
Why did you buy so many instant noodles?

478
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,180
Didn't you know?

479
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,540
Instant noodles
are a must-have when going abroad.

480
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,108
You didn't get scammed, did you?

481
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,260
They're all crushed.

482
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,220
Here's the thing.

483
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,960
I heard some supermarkets

484
00:32:01,011 --> 00:32:03,220
have perverts
who go around squishing noodles.

485
00:32:03,331 --> 00:32:04,780
How inconsiderate.

486
00:32:04,805 --> 00:32:05,980
They crushed all of them.

487
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,700
Good grief. They're all broken.

488
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,100
I know who did it.

489
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,060
Just how badly does he want me to stay?

490
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:23,131
Who was it?

491
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:30,700
(Apartment No. 17)

492
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,780
Monkey's not back yet?

493
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:51,940
Monkey?

494
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,620
What's the matter, Monkey?

495
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:56,940
When is Jiang Zhishan's flight?

496
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,020
The day after tomorrow.

497
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,180
What's with him?

498
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,460
Take good care of yourself.

499
00:33:19,971 --> 00:33:20,660
I will.

500
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,577
The Rock Climbing Club is yours now.

501
00:33:22,622 --> 00:33:23,955
May you have a glorious victory.

502
00:33:25,897 --> 00:33:27,060
Where's Monkey?

503
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,260
He asked about your flight time
two days ago.

504
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:30,740
And he left early this morning.

505
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,260
I thought he'd be here.

506
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,620
Suit himself.

507
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,420
I'm off.

508
00:33:36,177 --> 00:33:36,820
Bye.

509
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,860
Bye.

512
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,340
Thank you.

513
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,740
Hello?

514
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,900
Where are you, Jiang Zhishan?

515
00:35:12,931 --> 00:35:13,740
Hey?
