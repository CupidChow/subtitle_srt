I think your grandson and my son are secretly dating.

6
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,710
That means I can officially hit on you now.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:26,590
If you like him, go for it. What's there to be afraid of?

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,990
I think you should stop denying what you truly feel.

I want to have you by my side, Dynamite.

Stop getting sidetracked already, Ten.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,040
I'm going to prove that what we have is not useless.

From the top, one by one.

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,300
What if we don't make the cut?

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,890
Stop questioning; you're getting on my nerves. Just open it.

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,820
Yeah, we really did it!

00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,250

Yes.

00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,760
I never do such things,

71
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,550
especially not with you.

72
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,360

You're even better than your father.

He is no good.

Any family would be lucky to have you as their daughter's boyfriend.

84

You're someone dependable when help is needed.

85
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,310
This kind of decision is entirely yours to make.

Nothing.

103
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,660

Don't you miss him?

105
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,830
I do, but he said we should keep our distance for the time being.

106
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,690
Since he went out of town, he hasn't called.

107
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,940
He hasn't texted.

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,460
He has been silent with me.

109
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,300
Really?

110
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,630
Um, check my phone if you don't believe me.

111
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,200
I believe you. I can see the frustration you have here.

112
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm not frustrated. I just answered your question.

113
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,250
Okay, okay. Not frustrated. I see.

114
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,690
Unky, can making a phone call or texting really distract you?

115
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,330
I don't have the answer.

116
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,280
You should ask him directly.

117
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,700
No. I want to put my focus on our competition first.

00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,920

Okay. I understand that, sir.

121
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,050
If you choose not to call anyone, that's your call.

122
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,300
But please excuse me. I'm going to call my papa and mama.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I miss you, Doc.

124
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,130

00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,930
I miss you so much, Chef.

126
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,880
But I have to suck it in, right?

127
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,500
Why the hell did I tell him that I wanted some time apart?

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,830

129
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,560
Hey!

130
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,620
How did you get here?

131
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,070
By motorcycle. I got injured because of it, look.

132
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,700
Please have a patient interview with the nurse first.

133
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,030
What? Aren't you a doctor?

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,790
No. I'm here to observe only.

135
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,610
Hey, young man.

136
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,390
What?

137
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,790
Where's the restroom?

138
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,950
Go straight through here and turn right at the end.

139
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,200
Thanks.

Sorry, Ten.

145
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,850
It's his voice, but the wordings are not.

146
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,280
No.

147
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:03,350
Seriously, no.

148
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,050
Gosh, Chef.

150
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,910

Hey, what's wrong?

154
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,960
Why?

155
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,380
Did you get scolded by your Firefy?

156
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,990
No. I chose not to tell him in the end.

157
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,610
I must completely cut it off.

158
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,620
Okay.

159
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,600

162
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,610
I need a break for my heart.

163
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,970
Sure, let's go.

166
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,090
We can go find inspiration for our competition.

Alright. I'm going too.

168
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,590

177
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,610

179

183
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,280

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,220
Can I eat it too?

186
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,040
Congrats, Prem.

187
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,340
This basil plant is a gift from me.

188
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,080
When you water it, you may think of the time we spent together.

189
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,940
When it grows big enough to be used,

190
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,430
cook some pesto for me too.

191
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,950
Did you know that in the past, in Italy,

192
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,670
people placed basil in front of their houses as a symbol of love and good intentions?

193
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,330
If I give you the basil I grow,

194
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,550
will you put it in front of your house?

195
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,540
If I place it in front of my house, will he interpret it as me having feelings for him?

196
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,040
But this basil isn't doing anything wrong.

197
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,170
Wow, can I dig in now?

198
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,590
So hungry.

199
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,160
Woah, this is delicious.

200
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,910
So good.

201
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,200
Hey, aren't you eating?

202
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,230
Go ahead.

203
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,850
Don't mind me. I've been so busy since morning.

204
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,530
I didn't get to rest. I just got a break.

205
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,380
Then I started to feel very hungry.

206
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,940
I didn't feel like eating at the hospital either.

207
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,890
As you know, it's not that good.

208
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:53,960
I know. Hospital food is quite bland. I can't have it either.

209
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,770
Who are you, by the way? How did you get to live here?

210
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,840
Ah!

211
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,120
You are Dr. Anan's son.

212
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,850
He sent you here for discipline.

213
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,480
He sent you here to observe how we work here, right?

214
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,410
Yes.

215
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,100
Hey, I apologize.

216
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,200
Did that offend you?

217
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,100
I didn't mean to say that.

218
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,770
How about I allow you to say something that hurts me once.

219
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,990
Go ahead. By all means, I can take it.

220
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,710
But we just met. You didn't know any downsides of me.

221
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:31,820
Let's do this.

222
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,380
Let me introduce myself first.

223
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,440
I'm an EP doctor.

224
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,150
My name is Earn.

225
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,640
You can call me Earner,

226
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,790
Dr. Earn, Miss Earn,

227
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,930
Senior Earn, Lady Earn, Bitchy Earn.

228
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,720
Any names, I don't mind.

229
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,570
Do you stay here too?

230
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,870
I've been here for several days. How come I never met you.

231
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:58,420
Oh, I'm actually from this province.

232
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,330
I only stay at this house on the day I have an early morning shift.

233
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,590
What's your name? I don't know your name yet.

234
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,380
My name is Ten.

235
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,880
Ten, Todsatid.

236
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,830
I'm currently a third-year student, transitioning into my fourth year

237
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,410
soon.

238
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,240
Come on. No need to be so polite.

239
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,790
Our ages must not be that far apart.

240
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,890
Why do you stare at me like that?

241
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,060
Are you not gonna eat?

242
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,860
Well, you look like someone I know.

243
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,770
Who?

244
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,210
Your girlfriend?

245
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,380
No.

246
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,200
My mother.

247
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,540
Oh, you're subtly suggesting I'm old enough to be your mother?

248
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,060
Good one. Now we're even.

249
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,930
We're even.

250
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,610
No. I genuinely meant that.

251
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,210
That means your mother must be really pretty.

252
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,170
Just kidding.

253
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,340
But seriously, it's the first time someone's said that to me.

254
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,010
Why are you staring at me eating?

255
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,210
Join me.

256
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,990
You can have it all. I can make another one.

257
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,760
Wow.

258
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,870
You're a real catch–

259
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,240
on your way to being a doctor,

260
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,190
a gentleman,

261
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,680
and a good cook.

262
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,640
Perfect.

263
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,530
What do you say?

264
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,850
I'm treating you to a welcome celebration.

265
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,190
Okay.

266
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,870
I continue then.

267
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,040
Go ahead.

268
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,770
You're seriously a good cook. This is very delicious.

269
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,780
Thank you.

270
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,370
Knock yourself out.

271
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,930
Almost filled.

272
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,190
Cheers.

273
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:33,900
You are only in the 3rd year, why are you so early for this study trip?

274
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,310
An eager learner?

275
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,790
Not really.

276
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,210
I got sidetracked, so my father sent me here.

277
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,570
From dating?

278
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,150
Gotcha.

279
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,460
Is your date in med school too?

280
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,450
No, in culinary school.

281
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,180
Actually, we're not even official yet.

282
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:02,190
That's why you can cook.

283
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,040
Don't tell me it had ended before it got started?

284
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,710
I won't let that happen easily.

285
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm determined to have good grades

286
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,010
along with a loving and healthy relationship.

287
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,610
Awesome.

288
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,250
You have my two thumbs up.

289
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,010
Why did you decide to be a doctor here?

290
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,410
My ideology!

291
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,080
I grew up here.

292
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
When you need to get treatment from a doctor,

293
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,160
it takes forever and forever and forever.

294
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,320
Even if you arrive at 4 a.m.

295
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,120
you may not see the doctor until 1 p.m.

296
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,190
or 2 p.m.,

297
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,810
and if you're lucky, it could be noon.

298
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:00,650
I wondered what took those doctors so long to meet the patients.

299
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,370
Once I experienced it firsthand,

300
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,230
I realized that the hospitals here are not the same as those in Bangkok.

301
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,690
There, you may get to see a doctor not long after arriving at the hospital.

302
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:10,540
It's the complete opposite here.

303
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,900
So damn exhausting.

304
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,300
I once treated a patient who had been coughing for 3-4 days.

305
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,890
Initially, I diagnosed the patient with a lung infection

306
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,340
and prescribed some medications,

307
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,510
but it didn't help.

308
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,780
I wanted to refer the patient to another hospital in the city,

309
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,390
but the patient refused to move.

310
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:49,070
It was later revealed that the infection was tuberculosis-related.

311
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,880
I adjusted the medications,

312
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,410
but it was too late.

313
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,960
I still remember that incident clearly.

314
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,330
The patient's family were all in tears

315
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,270
and said to me,

316
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,450
“What kind of doctor are you?!”

317
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,190
I felt very awful.

318
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:26,630
I kept asking myself these questions over and over,

319
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,780
“Which part did I do wrong?”

320
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,060
“Did I do anything too late?”

321
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,520
“Could I have done it more thoroughly?”

322
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
But I was so damn tired.

323
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,580
I treated several hundred patients each day.

324
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,860
They say there are enough doctors throughout the country.

325
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,140
That's bullsh*t.

326
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,700
When I paid respects at the hospital shrine,

327
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,740
I never prayed for anything.

328
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,570
That day, I prayed.

329
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:12,780
Want to guess what I prayed for?

330
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:24,780
I prayed to be strong enough to continue being a doctor.

331
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,170
I knew that you did your best.

332
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,670
I also understand that for the incident that stuck deeply in your heart,

333
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,870
no one can help you get back on track

334
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,680
except yourself.

335
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,280
Yes, no one can help you get back on track

336
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,850
except yourself.

337
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,170
Music!

338
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,860
Get up, come on.

339
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,260
Help. Please help us.

340
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:36,280
Mom!

341
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,500
Mom!

342
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,160
Mom.

343
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,630
Wake up and talk to me.

344
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,030
Mom.

345
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,190
Mom!

346
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,160
No!!!!!

347
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,510
Why?

348
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,870
Why?!

349
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,480
What did he put on the door?

350
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,470
I won't bother reading it.

351
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,270
We won't be in the room for several days.

352
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,690
We're in Suphanburi celebrating our qualification for Super Monster Chef,

353
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,260
Thailand's famous cooking competition.

354
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,930
This is not to brag, just letting you know where we are, eiei.

355
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,070
What kind of person laughs ‘eiei'?

356
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,920
Good that he's not around.

357
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,400
I can spend this time pondering.

358
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,400
Metha, my bestie.

359
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,990
Go to Suphanburi with me, please.

360
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,270
I can't stand it anymore. I want to see him so bad.

361
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,290
Tada!

362
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,400
Welcome to Tian Tian Restaurant,

363
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,010
the most renowned restaurant in Suphanburi with full tables of customers,

364
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,310
ranked number one by me.

365
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,690
Come on in.

366
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,320
Papa, Mama.

367
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,820
I'm home.

368
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,910
Papa, Mama!

369
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,600
Eh?

370
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,330
Papa, Mama!

371
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,480
Hello!

372
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,750
Hello.

373
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,150
Mama, I have my friends with me.

374
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,260
Hi, Prem. Hi, Dynamite.

375
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,110
I missed you.

376
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,110
Have you eaten?

377
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,970
Not yet, Mama.

378
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,480
Then let's eat.

379
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,660
Hold on. Not now.

380
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,250
If you come to this province,

381
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,080
you must pay respects to the Tiger God at this shrine.

382
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,930
Why did you drag me here?

383
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,080
There's nothing worth seeing. It's scorching hot.

384
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,300
Don't make me smack those words out of your mouth.

385
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,870
The Tiger God here has good ears; he can hear you.

386
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:22,060
Do you know he's so sacred that you can get what you ask for?

387
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,620
Really?

388
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,160
He can grant you everything.

389
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,600
Ask for money, and you'll get gold.

390
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,950
Ask for a car, and you'll get a boat.

391
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,100
Ask for a sweetheart, and you'll get stuck in the friendzone.

392
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,030
You moron, I'm headed back.

393
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,250
I was joking.

394
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,490
This god is truly sacred.

395
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,320
Make a wish. Go for it.

396
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,050
Really?

397
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,740
Yeah.

398
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,880
"Cocktail's song."

399
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,590
What the hell is that?

400
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,530
"Kneel Down"

401
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,750
It doesn't hurt to try.

402
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,550
May you fulfill my wish of running into…

403
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,710
Fire! Come here. Come here. Come here.

404
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm not done with my prayer yet.

405
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,030
Holy crap. This god is truly sacred.

406
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,290
Am I having a delusion?

407
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,470
Why do I see Firefy everywhere I look?

408
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,160
See clearer now?

409
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,760
In 4K. Your mother is my cupid.

410
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,240
She sent me here to meet Firefy.

411
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,300
I better not go to him.

412
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,520
Hi, hi, hi, hi.

413
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,000
What brings you here?

414
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,520
That should be me asking, you grey hair.

415
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,830
This is my hometown.

416
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,520
What's the problem with me visiting your hometown?

417
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,310
Did you pee around to mark your territory or what?

418
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,480
I'm not a rabbit!

419
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,040
Strayed dog, you idiot!

420
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,750
Take it easy, man.

421
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,580
This is a holy place.

422
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,590
Can you be cool for me?

423
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,610
Got it, man.

424
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,630
What brings you here?

425
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:13,780
Did you follow me?

426
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,150
No. We're here to visit Ten.

427
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,910
He's working in a hospital around here.

428
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,000
Only 5 minutes away.

429
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,010
Really?

430
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,980
Woah. Unbelievable.

431
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,650
This is truly a miracle.

432
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,270
You asked that from the Tiger God, right?

433
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:32,110
I didn't say a word yet.

434
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,020
He can read your mind.

435
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,730
Are you coming?

436
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,350
If I were you, I wouldn't say no.

437
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,080
Do you want to come too?

438
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,620
Let's all go together.

439
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,780
No.

440
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,330
What?

441
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,200
I don't want to bother him.

442
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I'd rather be with us three.

443
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,830
A brief visit won't be that much of a bother.

444
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,570
Nah, I'm headed back. It's hot.

445
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,430
Are you sure you're not coming?

446
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,970
Well then, please excuse us.

447
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,790
Let's go.

448
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,450
Wait.

449
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:16,110
So? Are you coming?

450
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:21,170
Just let him know that I'm at Samsee's place.

451
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,820
Tell him to do his best.

452
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,600
That's it.

453
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Hey, that's it, really?

454
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,650
What about ‘I miss you.'? No?

455
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,400
Let's head back. Unky's mother is waiting to eat with us.

456
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,270
Come on.

457
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,710
Fine. Let's head back.

458
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,180
He's so tough to crack.

459
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,830
Hey, hey.

460
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,240
Where are you going?

461
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,840
Come here. The hospital is this way.

462
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,470
Check your operating system. It's not functioning properly.

463
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,870
This way, man.

464
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,020
Please wait for the nurse's interview for a moment.

465
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,160
What's your name?

466
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm Metha, your friend.

467
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,410
Hey! What brings you guys here?

468
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,290
We know you're lonely, so we're here for you.

469
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,270
More importantly, I'm taking Fire to track down his heart.

470
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,540
His heart?

471
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,620
What's wrong with it?

472
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,890
He's searching for his lost heart.

473
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:17,200
It's been taken by someone here in Suphanburi.

474
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,550
You jackass.

475
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,080
The more you explain, the more you lose me.

476
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,640
Don't try to understand this nutcase.

477
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:28,230
Do you know who we ran into before getting here?

478
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,750
Save your time guessing. Let me just tell you.

479
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,730
We ran into Chef.

480
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,380
Chef?

481
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,180
Yeah.

482
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,120
You mean Prem?

483
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,990
Yeah.

484
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,910
You must have gone mad.

485
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:39,640
No. Believe it or not, this is also Unky Samsee's hometown.

486
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,120
So, they're all here.

487
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,550
This coincidence is too unreal.

488
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,330
It's real. Couldn't be more real than this.

489
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,820
But the world is full of coincidences.

490
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Did he know that I'm also in this province?

491
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:53,890
Absolutely. I told him.

492
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:56,460
I even invited him to come see you,

493
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,130
but he declined.

494
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
He did have a message for you, though.

495
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,940
He's staying at Samsee's place.

496
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Just focus on your work.

497
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,650
That's it?

498
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,770
Um.

499
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:13,300
His friend asked him if he missed you or not?

500
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,400
What did Prem say?

501
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,860
He didn't say anything about it. Too bad.

502
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,810
What? Doesn't he miss me at all?

503
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,850
At least he let you know where he stays.

504
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,640
Maybe he wants you to come over and take him out for dinner.

505
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,160
Unky Samsee's family runs a restaurant, right?

506
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,400
Tian Tian something.

507
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,720
It's very close, just 5 minutes away.

508
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,980
Go see him. We'll go with you.

509
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,580
I'm not going. I have so many things to do here.

510
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,420
Come on. Just a brief break should be fine.

511
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,460
But he doesn't miss me.

512
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,870
He wants me to put all my attention on work here.

513
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,460
That's what I'm doing.

514
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,210
You've become hardworking all of a sudden.

515
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,420
We're going there without you then.

516
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,460
Fine.

517
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,610
Any words you want us to tell Prem?

518
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:55,430
None.

519
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,140
We're going then.

520
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,660
Wait.

521
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,940
Knew it.

522
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,150
Just a short message.

523
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,030
- Go ahead.
-  	Darn, I...

524
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,840
No, just “I.”

525
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,880
I'm here, but I never get your call at all.

526
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,780
I'm working in the hospital from dawn till dusk.

527
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
I don't get to eat well. The food here is not delicious.

528
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,710
I lose all appetite when the food is not good.

529
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:15,970
I can only endure it when I'm hungry.

530
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,780
I'm so lonely. I don't have anyone to call or hang out with.

531
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,330
Wherever I turn, no one seems to understand me.

532
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,130
Come on, that's way too long for a short message!

533
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,310
How are we supposed to remember all of that?

534
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,390
Here's a real short one.

535
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:33,040
I've been here for a while; why haven't you called me?

536
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,690
That's it.

537
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,410
What's with the ‘I'm cool' attitude in the beginning?

538
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,250
Yeah.

539
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,900
I'll tell him that for you. Let's go.

540
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,970
Ten said, “I've been here for a while; why haven't you called me?”

541
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:13,450
Just that?

542
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:16,890
He actually babbled a lot at first.

543
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,340
But that was what he wanted to say to you.

544
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,600
He only said just that and blamed me for not calling.

545
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,150
Go tell him this for me.

546
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,240
“You should have called me first. It can be tiring for the one who waits too!”

547
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,920
That's a message or more like a condemnation?

548
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,750
Then tell him this.

549
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:04,060
“Didn't we agree to take some time apart from each other?

550
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,340
You also wrote that in the letter.

551
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,850
Don't you remember?”

552
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,420
He means that you have poor understanding.

553
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,240
Is he calling me dumb?

554
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,570
Can't I feel tired of waiting?

555
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,610
Is he that dense and naive to see it?

556
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,240
Can't we talk even while taking some time apart?

557
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,620
If we can't talk, then that's it. Let's call it quits. Be my guest!

558
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,870
That's your message, right?

559
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes. Tell him every single word I said.

560
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,460
Metha, my friend.

561
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:28,550
Do this one for me.

562
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,860
I don't think I can move my legs now.

563
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,650
Me?

564
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,770
“Dense and naive to see it.”

565
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:39,410
“Hey! Can't I feel tired of waiting?

566
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,290
Are you really that dense and naive to see it?

567
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,980
Can't we talk even while taking some time apart?

568
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,550
If we can't talk, then that's it. Let's call it quits, you dumbass!”

569
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,800
Holy crap. That's harsh.

570
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,550
Anything else you want me to tell Chef? Go ahead.

571
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,890
Keep it coming!

572
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,870
So? What did he say?

573
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,890
He didn't say a word.

574
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,010
But this is how he reacted.

575
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,040
That bad?

576
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,860
Um.

577
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,360
I think your words were too harsh.

578
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:45,590
If I were him, I would be shocked too upon hearing about calling it quits.

579
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,120
Poor Ten.

580
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,020
Can you relay my message to him once more?

581
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,190
This will be the last one.

582
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,860
Tell him I'm sorry.

583
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,870
Hey, I think you should say that to him face-to-face.

584
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,750
You can take my motorcycle. The key is over there.

585
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:13,750
Hey, Oldie.

586
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,240
Thanks a lot.

587
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,180
Where's my friend, by the way?

588
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,750
Dy wants to buy something. Your friend offers to tag along.

589
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Didn't he say he couldn't move his legs?

590
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,630
You came to Suphanburi to see your friend or me exactly?

591
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,900
Where's Jane? She's not with you?

592
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,870
It's over.

593
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,460
Jane broke up with me.

594
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,020
It's over like we're history.

595
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,910
Really?

596
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,750
Um.

597
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,470
Give those to me. Let me help.

598
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,300
Trying to win me back?

599
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,010
What nonsense are you talking about?

600
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,680
I just don't want to see you carrying those bags around.

601
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,520
It's annoying.

602
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,170
I see. Try to keep up with me then.

603
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,290
Don't walk too fast. Wait for me.

604
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,070
Ten.

605
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:28,970
Ten.

606
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,750
Yes?

607
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,030
Dozing off?

608
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,260
No.

609
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,260
It's just that it's not too busy today.

610
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:40,010
So I was lost in thought for a bit.

611
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:40,760
Stop it.

612
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,110
Don't say ‘not busy'.

613
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,910
Why?

614
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,280
Doc, we have an emergency case. Hurry.

615
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,310
On my way.

616
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,950
Because we will have case after case.

617
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,180
This 40-year-old male patient said he fell down from a tree.

618
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,040
Send him to x-ray.

619
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,770
Got it.

620
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,370
Straight to the ER.

621
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,530
There's a case from a minor motorcycle accident outside. Please go check it out.

622
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,540
Hey.

623
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,810
Chef.

624
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,490
Excuse me.

625
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,270
Doc, we have another case, a stab wound abdomen.

626
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,990
It's an emergency.

627
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:53,250
I can take it from here.

628
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:56,410
Alright. Please finish the gauze dressing for me?

629
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,500
Thank you.

630
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,390
Aren't you going to say anything?

631
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,580
Please be careful not to expose the wound to water, sir.

632
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,920
You are so polite.

633
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,370
Ouch.

634
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,520
Where does it hurt, Chef?

635
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,540
Is it bad?

636
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,540
It hurts here.

637
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:48,000
It stings in here, Doc.

638
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,670
I tried so hard not to come see you to avoid distracting you.

639
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,100
But you called me out for poor understanding.

640
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,080
Did I really say that?

641
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,680
That's the impression I got.

642
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,160
And I missed you.

643
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,600
Have you missed me?

644
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,670
Yes. I've missed you.

645
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,160
But you told my friends that you didn't miss me.

646
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,900
You don't really know?

647
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,300
Who would know?

648
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,560
I didn't hear that face to face.

649
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,440
How could I know which one is true and which one is not?

650
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,620
What about you?

651
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,690
You berated me nonstop.

652
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,930
What? What are you talking about?

653
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,570
“Can't I feel tired of waiting?

654
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,290
Are you really that dense and naive to see it?

655
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:27,600
Can't we talk even while taking some time apart?

656
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,500
If we can't talk, then that's it. Let's call it quits, you dumbass!”

657
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,360
That “dumbass” part wasn't from me. I didn't say that.

658
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,470
But the other parts were, right?

659
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:40,330
Unbelievable. Not a single hint of you miss me there.

660
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,090
I'm truly sorry, Doc.

661
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,550
I do miss you.

662
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,520
When I heard that my words made you speechless, I rushed here.

663
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,240
That's how I got this injury.

664
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,760
I miss you too.

665
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,090
What did you say?

666
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,460
I miss you too!

667
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,460
I miss you like crazy, you know!

668
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,420
I actually heard that. I just wanted to hear it one more time.

669
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,460
Ahem.

670
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,890
Is he your friend?

671
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,750
Yes. On his way to see me here, his motorcycle slipped.

672
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,500
May I?

673
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,620
Try to avoid water for now.

674
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,200
Hey, Ten. I need a big favor from you.

675
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,810
There'll be a package delivered to me at the house.

676
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,130
I'm still in my shift; I can't leave yet.

677
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,640
Can you go there and receive the package for me?

678
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,300
You can take your friend with you.

679
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,440
Sure.

680
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,680
Thank you.

681
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,710
Doc, that woman, she…

682
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:12,880
Yes.

683
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,140
She looks like my mother, doesn't she?

684
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,320
When you first saw her, weren't you surprised?

685
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,680
Yes, I was.

686
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,970
I was so surprised that I even dreamed about my mom,

687
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,970
something I hadn't done in a long time.

688
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:50,480
I felt like I couldn't do anything to save her.

689
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:57,730
Don't stress about it, Doc. It's in the past.

690
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,910
That's what I try to tell myself.

691
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,270
I'm now trying to learn ways to save people.

692
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,290
Being here has made me see a lot of things.

693
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,280
It put me back on track as a doctor.

694
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,620
I realized I needed to try harder so that I could help more people.

695
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,780
That's good for you.

696
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
How about you? How are you doing?

697
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,410
I passed the audition.

698
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,840
Yes.

699
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,080
Congrats, Chef.

700
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,040
I knew you could do it.

701
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,100
When I heard about it, I was glad.

702
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,940
But somehow I couldn't feel 100% glad.

703
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,460
Do you know why?

704
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:48,440
Because the person I want to share my happiness with isn't by my side.

705
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,340
I can't share my happiness with you for a long while.

706
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,340
All I can do is wait, as you asked me to.

707
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,120
So, my happiness has loneliness in it.

708
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,050
Chef.

709
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:10,090
It wasn't my intention to tell you this feeling of mine.

710
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:13,190
But when I see how determined you are,

711
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,190
how you focus and set goals,

712
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,790
I think I should share how I feel.

713
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,220
I'm sorry, Chef.

714
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,540
I feel lonely too.

715
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,440
Can we not be apart anymore?

716
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,540
I've got a package for you, sir.

717
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:44,040
There he is. Let me grab that.

718
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,650
You may go wait inside.

719
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:41,310
Doc,

720
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:44,790
you took my oven glove?

721
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:48,670
It's torn, so I took it to fix for you.

722
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,360
You should have told me. I've been looking for it everywhere.

723
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,320
I wanted to surprise you when it's done.

724
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,710
What are these?

725
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,110
For attaching these.

726
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,520
Look.

727
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,520
Ah.

728
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,180
Very cute. Thank you, Doc.

729
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,820
Let me wear it.

730
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:27,280
I don't think it'll get torn again.

731
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,190
You sewed it very firmly this time.

732
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,980
I want to put my hand in here with yours.

733
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,230
I want to know if it will tear the glove apart.

734
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,090
It shouldn't be torn now, do you think?

735
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,330
You should pick that up.

736
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,720
It's my father.

737
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,140
He may call to check if I'm at the hospital.

738
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:28,680
You should hurry back to the hospital. I don't want you to be in trouble.

739
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,860
Okay, it's done.

740
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:37,990
Try not to fall again. Go see your grandma.

741
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,650
Where did you come back from, Ten?

742
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,450
From the Physicians' Housing.

743
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:52,510
Did you see Dr. Earn there?

744
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:53,630
No.

745
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,930
I went there to get this package for her.

746
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,300
Something is not right. She didn't answer my calls.

747
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,700
Let me try again.

748
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:22,810
She's still not picking up.

749
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,980
She's not picking up.

750
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,210
Keep this for me.

751
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,380
Okay.

752
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:46,790
Dr. Earn.

753
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:47,840
Hey.

754
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,850
Help. Please help us.

755
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:00,600
Mom!

756
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:16,220
Take her to the ER.

757
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,470
Help. Please help her.

758
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,910
Why?

759
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:37,030
Why?!

760
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,960
Doc.

761
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:00,370
Chef.

762
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:04,170
Are you alright?

763
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,010
It felt like you were so repulsed by me

764
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:01,000
to an extent that I questioned if you were the same Fire who once saved me.

765
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You've added fuel to reignite this Fire

766
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,070
and made me realize that I like you.

767
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:12,360
I've made up my mind not to let us be apart like before again.

768
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,800
I like you, Chef.

769
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,350
I like you too, Doc.
