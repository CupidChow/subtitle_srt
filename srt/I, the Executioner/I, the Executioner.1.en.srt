1
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,740
Good evening.

2
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,533
Ugh, finally!

3
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:05,540
Go all the way in.

4
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,973
Welcome!

5
00:01:24,476 --> 00:01:25,644
This way, ladies.

6
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:31,149
Oh, hello. Hi!

7
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:40,450
Minus interest in advance.

8
00:01:50,669 --> 00:01:52,670
Thank you very much.

9
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:55,381
Oops! I'm so sorry again.

10
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,008
Again?

11
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,009
Look who's on a lucky streak tonight.

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,762
She is indeed.

13
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,222
She's dealt good cards.

14
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,682
She has a gambler's brain.

15
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,684
Detective Bong has a knack for cards.

16
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:09,478
Remember that time at
Cho's father's funeral?

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,481
We were playing a few rounds
for fun until she cleaned us out

18
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:15,593
turning the atmosphere awkward...

19
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,879
Who farted?

20
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,614
Seriously!

21
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,615
That feels good.

22
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,719
Oh my, can I join such a big game?

23
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,222
Plastic Surgery Night Clinic

24
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,577
Wow, ladies.

25
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:11,875
Tonight, we have the
best of the best members.

26
00:03:13,251 --> 00:03:14,461
That's Deokchil.

27
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:16,754
And who might you be?

28
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,172
Call for backup.

29
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:21,384
I was introduced by
Miran. Nice to meet you.

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,053
Haven't we met before?

31
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,556
My face is quite common in Gangnam.

32
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,560
Don't get smart with me.
Have we met before?

33
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:36,482
What the heck are you
staring at, you creep?

34
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:38,610
We don't deal with phonies.

35
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:42,404
A camera?

36
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,407
Sexual assault!

37
00:03:57,796 --> 00:03:59,631
What the...?

38
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,511
Do-cheol.

39
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,306
Move the car.

40
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:11,351
Come this way.

41
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,821
Open this door!

42
00:04:23,238 --> 00:04:25,240
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

43
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,913
How dare you grope me and run?

44
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:36,835
You okay?

45
00:04:36,836 --> 00:04:38,252
I'm gonna kill that bitch.

46
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:39,629
Let's get outta here. Come on.

47
00:04:52,142 --> 00:04:53,560
Come on down. Hurry.

48
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:04,153
It's too tight.

49
00:05:04,154 --> 00:05:05,487
Shit! My belly is stuck.

50
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:06,990
Pull, goddammit.

51
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,997
Bastards!

52
00:05:13,998 --> 00:05:14,998
Come out, you punk.

53
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:16,499
Get moving.

54
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:19,669
This way!

55
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,504
In you go, thugs.

56
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:28,177
Deokchil! Come here, you.

57
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:31,681
No, you come! You goddamn joke.

58
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:41,608
Oh no... shit.

59
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,200
Pull yourself up, man.

60
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:54,120
Pull yourself up!

61
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:06,924
Thank God...

62
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:08,717
He's okay now.

63
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:10,344
Don't worry about him
and let's go our way.

64
00:06:10,345 --> 00:06:12,721
- Come this way.
- Where? Here?

65
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:14,224
Come on.

66
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,144
Wait for me.

67
00:06:20,855 --> 00:06:21,855
Don't push.

68
00:06:29,948 --> 00:06:31,657
We're here.

69
00:06:31,658 --> 00:06:32,951
In you go.

70
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,160
One, two, three...

71
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:37,747
No rush. We've got
plenty of vans waiting.

72
00:06:41,584 --> 00:06:42,961
Hey, you!

73
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,172
- Son of a bitch!
- Hey!

74
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:48,465
Are you out of your mind?

75
00:06:48,466 --> 00:06:49,758
But I didn't...

76
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,969
How dare you assault an officer?

77
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:52,512
You saw it, man.

78
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:53,888
What, jerk?

79
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:59,269
I said I didn't do it. The
dumb bitch fell on her own!

80
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:02,188
Don't pin it on me.

81
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:09,988
Bong! Bong!

82
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,780
Don't come closer.

83
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:12,782
I warned you.

84
00:07:14,617 --> 00:07:15,785
I swear I'll stab her.

85
00:07:16,286 --> 00:07:18,412
Rock, paper, scissors.

86
00:07:18,413 --> 00:07:19,413
Yes! Insurance payout!

87
00:07:19,414 --> 00:07:21,707
Come on, let me claim it this time.

88
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,085
My son's tuition costs
an arm and a leg.

89
00:07:25,086 --> 00:07:26,837
Release me, and no one gets hurt.

90
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:28,714
Keep quiet, punk.

91
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,299
After you.

92
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,508
What's going on? You're
supposed to be cops.

93
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:35,221
We're doing this because we're cops.
You know how much a detective earns?

94
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,807
We get a $40 raise per year.

95
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:40,642
And a so-called life allowance

96
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:44,355
of $45 on top of that.

97
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:46,574
So what's it gonna be?
You gonna jump or not?

98
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,028
Just go ahead and stab me.

99
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,738
It's okay. Go on.

100
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,824
Let me put the benefit
towards his education.

101
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,243
What are you doing?
Think of your family.

102
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,244
Hey!

103
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,624
Hey!

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Are you done yet?

105
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:49,169
Let's get something to eat.

106
00:08:54,592 --> 00:09:03,643
I, THE EXECUTIONER

107
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,324
In 2021,

108
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:24,246
Ahn Somi made allegation against
her professor, Youn Jung-sik,

109
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:28,542
of continuous sexual assault.

110
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:33,047
But both the school and the
police cleared him of any charges.

111
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:38,051
Later, Youn was promoted
to head of department,

112
00:09:38,052 --> 00:09:40,929
and Somi was painted as a gold digger.

113
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:44,266
Leaving behind a note
pleading her innocence,

114
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,143
she jumped off the building

115
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:49,146
where the professor's
office was located.

116
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,481
She was twenty-six years old.

117
00:09:51,482 --> 00:09:52,983
At the time of her death,

118
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:57,863
Youn was celebrating his
promotion with fellow professors.

119
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,949
The scene of Ahn Somi's suicide

120
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,371
was covered in brain matter
spilled from her shattered skull.

121
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:26,892
Another murder believed
to be the work of Haechi,

122
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,978
a vigilante killer
dubbed 'Justice Hero',

123
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:32,189
has occurred.

124
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,815
Suspicions surrounding

125
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:36,610
the murder in Ilsan from 9 months ago,

126
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,987
considered to be Haechi's first job.

127
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:43,033
The police are open
to all possibilities.

128
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:44,618
Who is Youn Jung-sik?

129
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:47,913
He not only sexually assaulted
his student but impregnated her

130
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:50,499
and maliciously labeled
her a gold digger.

131
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,627
The victim ultimately
took her own life,

132
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,754
while the perpetrator thrived.

133
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,424
Is our judicial system
in working order?

134
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,842
When the police and
prosecutors failed to act,

135
00:11:00,843 --> 00:11:03,428
Haechi took justice into his own hands.

136
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,430
The lack of trust in
the judicial system

137
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,016
leading to real-life crimes,

138
00:11:08,017 --> 00:11:11,019
highlights an extreme
aspect of our society.

139
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,939
Considering retaliatory murder,

140
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,360
can we draw a connection
to the Eom Sang-tae case?

141
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:23,323
Given that the Eom case exhibits
traits of retaliatory murder,

142
00:11:23,324 --> 00:11:25,660
we cannot rule out a
potential connection.

143
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,745
Eom carried out an acid attack

144
00:11:28,746 --> 00:11:33,584
on his ex-girlfriend and her family
after she broke up with him.

145
00:11:34,043 --> 00:11:38,588
The victim, who was soon
to marry another man

146
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:40,966
was left with a scarred face for life

147
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:43,677
but Eom pleaded
alcohol-induced insanity

148
00:11:43,678 --> 00:11:45,387
and received a mild sentencing

149
00:11:45,388 --> 00:11:47,472
resulting in unfavorable
public opinion at the time.

150
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:51,893
Eom suffered an acid attack

151
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:53,688
mirroring the crime he committed.

152
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:03,488
The next victim is Seong, a.k.a.
the Cigarette Burn Killer.

153
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,992
Seong, at the age of 13, beat
his grandmother to death

154
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,620
because he couldn't bear her nagging.

155
00:12:10,621 --> 00:12:12,205
During the act,

156
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:15,000
he repeatedly burned her
face with a lit cigarette

157
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:18,837
over a dozen times as she was dying,

158
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,631
earning him the nickname
Cigarette Burn Killer.

159
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:25,803
He was a juvenile at the time
so, was tried on juvenile court.

160
00:12:26,721 --> 00:12:27,721
WIFE

161
00:12:28,598 --> 00:12:29,599
Sorry.

162
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:36,021
He later went to Singapore to study

163
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,647
and was killed this year.

164
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:39,649
When he was found,

165
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,610
his face was covered
in cigarette burn marks.

166
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,737
Since the arrest of
Kang Ho-soon in 2009,

167
00:12:43,738 --> 00:12:47,158
how many serial murders have
there been in this country?

168
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,826
Zero.

169
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:52,621
CCTV cameras cover
every inch of this country

170
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:57,627
and forensics can provide ID with
a speck of dust or a partial print.

171
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:01,254
Serial murders?

172
00:13:01,255 --> 00:13:02,465
Why serial murders?

173
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,884
How is it serial murders?

174
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,346
Let's talk about it, huh?

175
00:13:09,972 --> 00:13:12,683
Continue.

176
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,686
Including the recent murder
of the professor Youn,

177
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:20,565
all victims were killed at
the locations of their crimes

178
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:25,655
following the exact modus operandi.

179
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:29,282
Not only that,

180
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:31,201
our profilers' analysis suggests

181
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:34,371
the possibility of the same
perp committing these crimes.

182
00:13:34,372 --> 00:13:35,872
...said the profiler.

183
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,876
The profiler spoke and
you take his word for it.

184
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:42,712
Anyway,

185
00:13:42,713 --> 00:13:45,382
who is this Haechi the
media is buzzing about?

186
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:46,675
Did we give him that name?

187
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:47,593
Haechi is...

188
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:48,885
What is this Haechi?

189
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:49,886
So, Haechi is...

190
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:52,681
See the sculptures in front
of the National Assembly?

191
00:13:52,682 --> 00:13:56,184
It's a legendary creature
symbolizing right and wrong,

192
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:59,813
when you round up people in one place,

193
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:04,317
the beast spots only the sinners
and butts them with his horn.

194
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,111
Captain.

195
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,111
Yes?

196
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,321
Did I ask the meaning of Haechi?

197
00:14:08,322 --> 00:14:10,699
Who is spreading it and why?

198
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,701
Precisely.

199
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,412
Can you tell him about that?

200
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:15,704
Shall I?

201
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,207
Do you have something I can throw?

202
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:20,208
Bong, Bong!

203
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,628
Following the acid attack on Eom,

204
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,551
when a hit-and-run perp
Oh Cho-hee was found dead,

205
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,430
an ex-journalist turned private
broadcaster, 'Editor Justice,'

206
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:37,350
claimed that both cases were
the work of the same individual

207
00:14:37,351 --> 00:14:40,729
and coined the term, Haechi.

208
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,941
So, when they ramble about
on the internet and the media,

209
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:48,236
we follow without thinking?

210
00:14:48,237 --> 00:14:50,990
Mindlessly chanting Haechi, Haechi?

211
00:14:52,867 --> 00:14:57,078
The information about these
crimes are open to public,

212
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,081
meaning it could be copycat crimes.

213
00:14:59,874 --> 00:15:02,752
But based on a word of a profiler,
you concluded it's a single suspect.

214
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,297
What if it's an organized crime?

215
00:15:06,881 --> 00:15:08,007
What are you gonna do?

216
00:15:11,886 --> 00:15:15,598
This is my first real case
since I was assigned here.

217
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:19,894
So for the sake of all our future,

218
00:15:21,187 --> 00:15:24,606
put your heart and soul into it.

219
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:25,983
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

220
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,903
...labeled her a gold digger.

221
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:32,697
The victim ultimately
took her own life,

222
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,991
while the perpetrator thrived.

223
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,995
Is our judicial system
in working order?

224
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:40,789
When the police and
prosecutors failed to act,

225
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,791
Haechi took justice into his own hands.

226
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:45,502
You're looking at your phone again?

227
00:15:45,503 --> 00:15:47,922
Don't you grasp the
seriousness of the situation?

228
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:53,343
Come on, I'm watching this for work.

229
00:15:53,344 --> 00:15:54,928
I'm going to talk to him in a moment.

230
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:56,805
Do it now.

231
00:15:56,806 --> 00:16:02,519
I said I'll handle it. Do I
look like I'm idling around?

232
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,438
Am I? Do I look like it?

233
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,608
Alright, alright.

234
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,028
Hey, Woo-jin! Seo Woo-jin!

235
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:17,660
Hey, you want to go for a run with me?

236
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:21,454
How about a little sparring?

237
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,165
I'll only use one hand.

238
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,630
If you're not up for
that, let's hit the sauna.

239
00:16:30,464 --> 00:16:32,048
Hey!

240
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:33,759
Open the damn door.

241
00:16:37,555 --> 00:16:40,182
What do you want? I'm
about to crawl into bed.

242
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:45,062
Man, it's freezing.

243
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:50,359
So damn cold.

244
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:54,863
Why is the engine off?

245
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,073
Gas prices.

246
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:01,411
Switch to electric.

247
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:03,789
Don't give yourself a
stroke saving pennies.

248
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:06,207
Cut to the chase.

249
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,793
Did you see the news?

250
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,086
Yeah, we had a fight over it.

251
00:17:10,087 --> 00:17:11,672
What happened?

252
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:15,091
I was watching the news during dinner

253
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:18,678
and my wife got all worked up
about our boy's school scuffle.

254
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:21,098
She was making a big deal out of it.

255
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:27,812
It's different from our days.
Take school violence seriously.

256
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,105
Talk to your son.

257
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,107
I was going to until you showed up.

258
00:17:33,027 --> 00:17:34,111
Let's get to work.

259
00:17:35,112 --> 00:17:36,113
Here.

260
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:38,324
What's this?

261
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:40,450
Jeon Seok-woo

262
00:17:40,451 --> 00:17:44,913
who caused a pregnant woman
to die in front of her family

263
00:17:44,914 --> 00:17:46,749
is due to be released
from prison this week.

264
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,626
Isn't that asshole Jeon Seok-woo?

265
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,465
Don't get worked up. Just watch.

266
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,426
A, who was taking his pregnant wife

267
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,637
and child to the hospital,

268
00:18:00,638 --> 00:18:04,641
asked Jeon to move his car
which was double-parked.

269
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:08,061
During the process, the
intoxicated Jeon assaulted A,

270
00:18:08,062 --> 00:18:12,650
and A's pregnant wife was
killed while trying to stop him.

271
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,778
In the tragic incident, the
unborn child also died

272
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,365
but the court sentenced
Jeon to three years in prison

273
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,660
considering no intention
to commit murder

274
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:25,787
and intoxicated mental state.

275
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:28,164
A, who failed to get
proper compensation

276
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:31,459
nor judgment through civil litigation

277
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,674
faced severe financial difficulties
from accumulated debt.

278
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:40,885
He committed suicide after
killing his young child

279
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,680
making the nation lament.

280
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:46,683
Jeon, that fucking bastard.

281
00:18:46,684 --> 00:18:50,895
I should've half-crippled him
before putting cuffs on him.

282
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:54,691
He claimed self-defense about
stabbing Yoon with a knife.

283
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:55,984
He got off without charges.

284
00:18:55,985 --> 00:19:00,196
It was an immigrant worker
who stabbed Yoon, not Jeon.

285
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:03,616
He should've revealed his ID first.

286
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:06,620
Don't give me that shit.
You were there with us.

287
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:12,793
Don't tell me to introduce
myself. It's not some blind date.

288
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:17,922
Anyway, Jeon caused this
shit and only got three years?

289
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:21,718
The internet exploded immediately

290
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,428
asking Haechi to kill Jeon.

291
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,346
It'd be weird if it was quiet.

292
00:19:25,347 --> 00:19:29,058
I would love for someone
to kill a scumbag like Jeon.

293
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:30,644
Watch what you say.

294
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:35,023
And we're to offer police protection

295
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:36,650
from Haechi's threat.

296
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:39,862
Protect who?

297
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:42,822
This shithead?

298
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:44,157
We?

299
00:19:44,158 --> 00:19:45,242
Who said that?

300
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,952
The boss?

301
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:53,750
Seriously, how can they tell me
to protect someone I arrested?

302
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:57,045
If he appears in front of
me, I'll rip him to pieces.

303
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:58,589
It's freezing.

304
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,970
He's coming out.

305
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,609
SEND JEON BACK TO JAIL!

306
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,280
Guys, if I really crush his head,

307
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:25,573
how much are you willing to donate?

308
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:27,910
Wow, Jeon is a real celebrity here!

309
00:20:29,078 --> 00:20:32,121
I just saw Kim Whoever.
Shall I get an autograph?

310
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:33,790
I'm a huge fan.

311
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,999
Here he comes.

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,002
Jeon Seok-woo, that bastard.

313
00:20:37,628 --> 00:20:39,213
DEATH ROW FOR MURDERER!

314
00:20:39,296 --> 00:20:41,590
Son of a bitch!

315
00:20:45,094 --> 00:20:46,887
Come out, you bastard!

316
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:49,597
Stop!

317
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:52,934
That shithead!

318
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:55,020
Please subscribe to Truth TV!

319
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:03,111
I'm Fire Fist from Firefist TV.

320
00:21:03,112 --> 00:21:06,322
I came out here to smash
that MOFO Jeon's skull.

321
00:21:06,323 --> 00:21:08,533
If that's not justice, what is?

322
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:09,368
What? What?

323
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,120
Look at these comments.
Seriously, man...

324
00:21:12,121 --> 00:21:14,330
Do you think I'm doing
this for the money?

325
00:21:14,331 --> 00:21:15,332
Then again,

326
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,460
if I go to jail for
slitting his throat,

327
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:20,628
what about my mom?

328
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:22,923
How else will she pay for food?

329
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:35,059
What chaos is this?
Do we get out or not?

330
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,352
Shall we come back tomorrow?

331
00:21:36,353 --> 00:21:37,562
Shut up.

332
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:39,939
We can't let him out
here. You go first.

333
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,566
Yoon, Bong! Clear the way.

334
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,193
Why is it always us?

335
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:47,781
Hey, Jeon Seok-woo!

336
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:49,366
Don't throw shit at us!

337
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,370
Come out.

338
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,497
Get out of the way.

339
00:22:02,171 --> 00:22:03,714
Let go of this.

340
00:22:10,888 --> 00:22:12,221
Let me get out.

341
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:14,807
What ludicrous act is this?

342
00:22:14,808 --> 00:22:17,519
Watch what I do.

343
00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:24,192
What the hell, you
piece of shit? Let go.

344
00:22:24,193 --> 00:22:25,736
Let go, you bastard.

345
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,035
Look! He has a knife.

346
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,415
Get a move on.

347
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,545
Are you crazy? It hurts.

348
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:48,925
Grab that bastard, not me.

349
00:22:48,926 --> 00:22:51,929
Sons of bitches raising
a goddamn ruckus...

350
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,527
I said we wouldn't protect Jeon.

351
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,237
I'm starving.

352
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:10,780
Blood pudding soup?

353
00:23:10,781 --> 00:23:12,241
Over here.

354
00:23:13,742 --> 00:23:15,243
Dig in.

355
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:18,079
When you draw blood,
you make up with other's.

356
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Thank you.

357
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:20,791
What's this?

358
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,959
What's wrong with him?

359
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,752
Why's he keep falling like he's high?

360
00:23:24,753 --> 00:23:26,672
And wielding a damn knife.

361
00:23:28,674 --> 00:23:31,384
Beautiful sweep! Is this him?

362
00:23:31,385 --> 00:23:32,469
Yeah, it's him.

363
00:23:33,387 --> 00:23:35,388
What are you watching?

364
00:23:35,389 --> 00:23:38,684
You're the famous 'UFC Patrolman'?

365
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,896
Is it true you got a 3-month
disciplinary for excessive force?

366
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:44,982
Really?

367
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:47,192
For subduing him?

368
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,777
Yeah.

369
00:23:48,778 --> 00:23:52,113
If you're getting disciplined anyway,
why didn't you rough him up more?

370
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:55,324
He had a knife. A perfect
excuse to give him a beatdown.

371
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:57,535
Even we shit our pants
when we see a knifer.

372
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,288
How did you catch
him? And earlier, too.

373
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:04,501
You're laughing.

374
00:24:05,294 --> 00:24:06,836
Something funny?

375
00:24:06,837 --> 00:24:08,088
Because I'm scared.

376
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:14,010
Yeah, it can happen.
Great sweep anyway.

377
00:24:14,011 --> 00:24:16,304
You lose yourself when
you're really scared.

378
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:20,016
Those kids at school
who swing fists crying

379
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:22,143
you can never beat them.

380
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:23,145
Do-cheol.

381
00:24:23,854 --> 00:24:26,940
You smacked Jeon a
few times, didn't you?

382
00:24:27,357 --> 00:24:29,525
You can't help yourself.

383
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:32,862
What? I ripped my jacket
trying to protect him.

384
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:33,864
Look at this.

385
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:37,158
What's the point of working
so hard to catch them?

386
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,577
I made that arrest
despite getting stabbed.

387
00:24:39,578 --> 00:24:41,162
What about Jo Tae-oh?

388
00:24:41,163 --> 00:24:43,748
Do-cheol almost got crippled
trying to catch him.

389
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,334
And he got away with probation
when he deserves 20 years.

390
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:47,835
Cut the crap.

391
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,671
So, you applied for a
transfer to the desk job?

392
00:24:50,672 --> 00:24:53,049
- Who are you talking about?
- You, man.

393
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,467
- And him.
- Me?

394
00:24:54,468 --> 00:24:55,843
I know everything.

395
00:24:55,844 --> 00:24:57,261
You're a sneaky bastard.

396
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,679
So are you.

397
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Here.

398
00:25:01,183 --> 00:25:04,185
The punk wielding a knife earlier,

399
00:25:04,186 --> 00:25:05,603
why didn't you just leave him?

400
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,274
If we got him after he knifed Jeon...
Killing two birds with one stone.

401
00:25:10,984 --> 00:25:12,152
What's your name, again?

402
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:13,779
Park Sun-woo, sir.

403
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:17,574
Park Sun-woo, nice name.

404
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,285
Are you going to stay
at the police station?

405
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,164
We can write a recommendation
to apply to our team.

406
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:30,712
Don't try to ruin a perfectly
happy guy's life.

407
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:34,799
It would be an honor.

408
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,594
I joined the force after
watching you catch Jo Tae-oh.

409
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:41,597
Look at this kid.

410
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:44,392
We're the same kind, you and I.

411
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:46,520
Don't try to get away.

412
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:52,191
Look at our faces.
We even look similar.

413
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:53,651
What's the matter with you?

414
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:56,112
You couldn't look more different.

415
00:25:56,113 --> 00:25:58,532
Get away from him.

416
00:25:58,907 --> 00:26:01,200
Call me Bro from now.

417
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:03,119
Let's have a toast.

418
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
Public!

419
00:26:04,121 --> 00:26:05,414
- Safety!
- Safety!

420
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,625
What's funny?

421
00:26:08,626 --> 00:26:10,419
They can't be more apart. He's insane.

422
00:26:12,254 --> 00:26:13,130
Hello?

423
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:15,214
Are you Seo Woo-jin's father?

424
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:17,341
I'm Sergeant Kwak from
Jinil Police Station.

425
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,136
I'm calling you regarding
concerns about your son.

426
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:21,555
Okay...

427
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:23,556
How much should I send?

428
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,141
Sorry? Oh no, it's...

429
00:26:25,142 --> 00:26:27,935
So how much, you creep?

430
00:26:27,936 --> 00:26:30,354
I'm tired of getting scam
calls day and night.

431
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,690
No, you seem to have mis...

432
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,441
He got the wrong person.

433
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,859
He's calling again.

434
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,652
Hello, sir.

435
00:26:35,653 --> 00:26:38,154
I'm a cop, alright?
And I'm busy right now.

436
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:39,572
Surprise, surprise.

437
00:26:39,573 --> 00:26:41,449
Sir, I'm really a police officer.

438
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:42,992
And we are really cops.

439
00:26:42,993 --> 00:26:43,993
Wait, wait.

440
00:26:43,994 --> 00:26:47,163
I'll do a video call, okay?

441
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:48,164
Do-cheol.

442
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,499
It might be real.

443
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,295
We're in front of your apartment.

444
00:26:54,296 --> 00:26:58,674
We received a call regarding
concerns of a suicide attempt.

445
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,093
Okay. I'll be right over.

446
00:27:03,472 --> 00:27:05,599
Wait. Please. I'll open it.

447
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:10,896
What's going on?

448
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:13,314
Honey! What's this about?

449
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,107
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

450
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:17,986
I was in a session, and didn't
know the battery was dead.

451
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,323
Tell me what's going on!

452
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,118
Woo-jin!

453
00:27:26,203 --> 00:27:27,204
Let us open it.

454
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,001
Get out of the way. Please.

455
00:27:40,634 --> 00:27:41,343
Woo-jin!

456
00:27:41,344 --> 00:27:42,427
What are you doing?

457
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,763
What did I do?

458
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:47,848
- You little piece of...!
- Stop it.

459
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:50,017
- Come here, you.
- Stop it. Leave him.

460
00:27:50,018 --> 00:27:50,852
You know what trouble...!

461
00:27:50,853 --> 00:27:52,020
Let go!

462
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:56,066
Are you to trying to
give me a heart attack?

463
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:02,446
It's all clear now.

464
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,074
- Thank you. Good work.
- Thank you.

465
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:06,743
Let's get out of here.

466
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,764
It must be difficult for you.

467
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:34,270
But the fact that he
called a suicide hot line

468
00:28:34,271 --> 00:28:38,275
shows that he has the strength
to overcome this on his own.

469
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:45,990
But if you're still unhappy, I
can help arrange a transfer...

470
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:46,991
Ma'am.

471
00:28:48,577 --> 00:28:51,830
Why would my son transfer and
not the perpetrating student?

472
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,416
My son was forced to fight

473
00:28:55,417 --> 00:28:58,085
because he was threatened
by a bunch of bullies.

474
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:59,504
Excuse me...

475
00:29:00,297 --> 00:29:03,091
Who are you calling a perpetrator?

476
00:29:11,224 --> 00:29:14,518
From this counseling record,

477
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,814
Woo-jin's had frequent fights
from elementary school.

478
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:20,107
If you look here,

479
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:22,652
you would say boys grow up fighting

480
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:28,324
reflecting your view
on school violence.

481
00:29:28,325 --> 00:29:32,120
But I'm a police officer. How can I...

482
00:29:45,967 --> 00:29:48,636
Excuse me. It's from work.

483
00:29:48,637 --> 00:29:49,763
Sorry.

484
00:29:51,473 --> 00:29:54,643
I'm in an important
meeting about my son.

485
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:57,144
What?

486
00:29:57,479 --> 00:30:01,190
This video was sent to
10 big-name streamers.

487
00:30:01,191 --> 00:30:04,902
When Editor Justice posted
it, it spread like wildfire.

488
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,154
Broadcast stations are tapping on it.

489
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:10,157
Cyber Crimes traced the IP

490
00:30:10,158 --> 00:30:11,868
which tracked back to Russia.

491
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,372
Anyway, doesn't it look like

492
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,707
the perp inflicted the same injuries

493
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:20,188
as his victim before pushing him off?

494
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,092
What's the matter?
Are you listening to me?

495
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:33,181
Snap out of it. What's wrong with you?

496
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:37,810
The bigger problem
is... There's a teaser.

497
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,812
Death notice video from Haechi!

498
00:30:39,813 --> 00:30:44,317
We're assigned to protect Jeon.

499
00:30:48,196 --> 00:30:49,197
Do-cheol?

500
00:30:49,906 --> 00:30:51,032
We're assigned a job.

501
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:56,413
What's wrong with you today?

502
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:04,211
Anyway, how come there
is no one in the office?

503
00:31:04,212 --> 00:31:07,923
Everyone's out investigating,
checking Jeon's safe house.

504
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:08,924
Captain.

505
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,344
We really should...

506
00:31:12,345 --> 00:31:15,222
We should request for reinforcement.

507
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:16,516
Have a drink.

508
00:31:17,767 --> 00:31:21,145
What can we do with just the two of us?

509
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,064
If I even mention reinforcement,

510
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:27,151
they'll pester us so badly and
assign the case to other team.

511
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,279
Where would I get reinforcement from?

512
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:35,869
What about that rookie who
caught the knifer yesterday?

513
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,747
The UFC Patrolman or something!

514
00:31:39,748 --> 00:31:40,789
Park Sun-woo?

515
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,584
Yeah, him! On secondment.

516
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:45,544
You know the superintendent.

517
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,545
Can't you pull strings?

518
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:53,011
You're acting weird since you
came back from Woo-jin's school.

519
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:55,972
Is it serious?

520
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:04,272
Psychological counseling
for children & adolescents

521
00:32:04,606 --> 00:32:09,777
The police decided to move Jeon
to a safe house to protect him.

522
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,987
Who is this country for?

523
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:14,615
Does serving the time
erase all your sins?

524
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,785
What about the innocent victims?

525
00:32:22,123 --> 00:32:26,127
We're conducting a
poll. Please participate.

526
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,890
1. Save Jeon Seok-woo.
2. Kill Jeon Seok-woo.

527
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,510
Jeon Seok-woo, come out!

528
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:36,721
Hello.

529
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:38,932
You are here.

530
00:32:43,144 --> 00:32:45,604
Let's get some work done.

531
00:32:45,605 --> 00:32:47,439
Yes sir. I'll do my best.

532
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,528
Don't do your best, do a good job.

533
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:54,739
- Did you bring the car?
- Yes, sir.

534
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:59,452
It's Jeon Seok-woo!

535
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,330
Please move.

536
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:04,332
Hold off the crowd.

537
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:09,461
Bros! Bros!

538
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:11,755
Jeon is getting away in a police car!

539
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:15,552
If you follow me, you'll
see him in a moment.

540
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,762
What's that?

541
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,474
Shit! It's Jeon Seok-woo.

542
00:33:22,475 --> 00:33:23,768
Jeon Seok-woo is over here.

543
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:33,557
Do you think he can pull it off?

544
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,697
You wanted him.

545
00:33:37,198 --> 00:33:38,907
It stinks!

546
00:33:38,908 --> 00:33:40,909
Why doesn't he wash his clothes?

547
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,412
It's you. You haven't showered.

548
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,706
- Get up.
- Are we good?

549
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:34,214
You have a good vibe, young man.

550
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:38,551
I'm not such a bad person, you know.

551
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,356
Hey!

552
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:52,356
We're here.

553
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,983
Bring him over.

554
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:01,866
So, this is what a police
bunkroom looks like?

555
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:06,454
It's okay.

556
00:35:25,682 --> 00:35:27,683
It's drafty in here.

557
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,227
Did you expect a five-star hotel?

558
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:34,023
You're offering protection.
Treat me right.

559
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:37,693
Strictly speaking, this
is a forced detention.

560
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:39,403
You beat a woman to death

561
00:35:39,404 --> 00:35:41,697
and her entire family is
dead because of you.

562
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:45,409
Only because you got away
lightly for being intoxicated,

563
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:46,770
you think the law is on your side?

564
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:51,332
You'll face God's punishment.

565
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:55,503
I paid my due.

566
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:59,215
That was that. And
this is another matter.

567
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:05,345
Why don't I write to the
Human Rights Commission

568
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:09,141
and petition to the government?

569
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:11,351
Maybe claim damages as well.

570
00:36:11,352 --> 00:36:14,438
Fucking scumbag.

571
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:16,858
What a wonderful world you live in!

572
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:21,946
I'm 50 years old. Let's
not use foul language.

573
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,825
Look, people don't change.

574
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,749
Have they decided to open
a school violence committee?

575
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:36,877
Man...

576
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:38,296
And Woo-jin's counseling?

577
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,174
Okay, I got it.

578
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,468
Let's talk later at home.

579
00:36:46,054 --> 00:36:47,387
What about Jeon?

580
00:36:47,388 --> 00:36:49,056
It's all done.

581
00:36:49,057 --> 00:36:50,974
But are you okay?

582
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,269
Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

583
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:57,356
Anyway, why did Haechi
have to upload a teaser?

584
00:36:57,357 --> 00:36:59,399
Couldn't he deal with him quietly,

585
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,070
and make everyone's life easy?

586
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:03,905
Don't you think?

587
00:37:06,282 --> 00:37:08,492
You should get home.
I'll give you a ride.

588
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,202
Will you?

589
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:11,620
Where do you live?

590
00:37:11,621 --> 00:37:15,583
Just go. There's no traffic,
so it doesn't matter where.

591
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:18,710
Look at this kid...

592
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:20,630
I owe you one.

593
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,007
How old did you say you are?

594
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,928
I was quite a troublemaker as a kid,

595
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:31,432
but being a parent
changes your perspective.

596
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:38,939
He won't tell me anything, you know?

597
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,653
Times have changed.
It's different, now.

598
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:45,655
Bro, kids these days,

599
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:51,327
their mind is all in here.

600
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:54,913
You know what phone cloning is?

601
00:37:54,914 --> 00:37:56,456
Making a duplicate of your phone?

602
00:37:56,457 --> 00:38:00,127
In my precinct,

603
00:38:00,128 --> 00:38:03,463
there is a guy who served
time for cloning phones.

604
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:06,843
If you're interested,
I can hook you up.

605
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:19,980
Wife, oh wife...

606
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:22,650
Honey, I said I was on my way.

607
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:24,861
Over here.

608
00:38:24,862 --> 00:38:25,862
Hey, honey.

609
00:38:26,654 --> 00:38:28,406
Thanks for the ride.

610
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:41,502
You didn't eat yet, right? I
have nothing else to offer.

611
00:38:42,003 --> 00:38:43,086
Thank you.

612
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,882
You don't have to give him anything.

613
00:38:46,674 --> 00:38:48,009
I'm exhausted.

614
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,180
It's a bit bland.

615
00:38:53,723 --> 00:38:56,224
What's this about?
I stayed up all night.

616
00:38:56,225 --> 00:38:57,393
Put this on.

617
00:39:00,188 --> 00:39:01,397
Look at this.

618
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:09,821
Since I posted Haechi's teaser video,

619
00:39:09,822 --> 00:39:13,909
many of Justice family
members shared tips

620
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,911
with so many incredible stories.

621
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:18,413
So, I planned a new content series.

622
00:39:18,414 --> 00:39:20,332
Proposal to Haechi!

623
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:25,213
It's a series on a request for
Haechi to execute someone.

624
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,924
700,000 dollars in insurance payout.

625
00:39:28,925 --> 00:39:32,552
It's the amount this woman got
paid after killing her elderly husband.

626
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:36,057
So I began my investigation,
and another tip came in.

627
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:41,853
This woman and the insurance handler
were having an affair at the time.

628
00:39:41,854 --> 00:39:46,359
A witness who personally saw
them frequenting motels tipped me off.

629
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,070
It's all fake news.

630
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:52,864
The payout was less than 70,000 dollars

631
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:56,285
and her late husband had taken
out the policy without telling her.

632
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,957
She got acquitted in court.

633
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:05,961
The insurance handler was a woman

634
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:08,089
and she is suffering
harassment over this now.

635
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:15,095
Murder and insurance fraud!
Everything was planned.

636
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,973
Add them to the hit list!

637
00:40:17,974 --> 00:40:23,104
This bastard was sacked
for taking bribes.

638
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,900
She runs this shop living
here with her children.

639
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:32,696
Some jerks smashed the
glass early in the morning.

640
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:35,908
The police came much later,
looked briefly then left.

641
00:40:36,826 --> 00:40:39,286
She was scared to be
alone with the children

642
00:40:39,287 --> 00:40:40,997
so she called our welfare center.

643
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:47,544
Why are people so interested
in others' business?

644
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,797
Damn idiots.

645
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,633
What should I cover this with?

646
00:40:57,013 --> 00:41:01,641
I'll contact the local precinct

647
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:03,935
to patrol for a few hours.

648
00:41:03,936 --> 00:41:07,439
Also, they have an
emergency smartwatch.

649
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,525
I'll request one for you.

650
00:41:10,443 --> 00:41:13,445
If you think something might happen,

651
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:16,531
just press the emergency button.

652
00:41:16,532 --> 00:41:18,325
She understands Korean well.

653
00:41:18,326 --> 00:41:19,534
Thank you.

654
00:41:19,535 --> 00:41:22,038
Hey, girls!

655
00:41:22,955 --> 00:41:25,165
Gimme five.

656
00:41:25,166 --> 00:41:26,375
Got you!

657
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,050
Get up, dork.

658
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:39,263
Didn't finish him off.
I can do way better.

659
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,858
The meal time is over. Is there...

660
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:53,277
Did you do this for everyone?

661
00:41:53,986 --> 00:41:55,571
The kid's got good sense.

662
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,697
I'm starving. Let's eat.

663
00:41:57,698 --> 00:42:00,618
Look at this portion.
Is it for a child?

664
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:03,370
How come I only have
two slices of spam?

665
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:05,372
Why didn't you get some for yourself?

666
00:42:05,373 --> 00:42:06,706
Two thick slices, man.

667
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:09,587
Can we have some peace while we eat?

668
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:12,797
Did you by any chance...

669
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:23,015
What? A live broadcast?

670
00:42:24,016 --> 00:42:25,601
Haechi will appear in a live broadcast.

671
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:31,731
Justice Family,

672
00:42:31,732 --> 00:42:34,317
thank you for your patience.

673
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,113
Finally! We're here to meet Haechi.

674
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:39,824
I'll try connecting the call first.

675
00:42:40,616 --> 00:42:43,619
Hello, Mr. Haechi. Are you really him?

676
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:49,833
I'm the man people refer to as Haechi.

677
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:52,461
The live chat is going crazy!

678
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,672
Many of my viewers want to know

679
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:59,343
if you really are Haechi.

680
00:43:02,054 --> 00:43:05,266
I'm sorry, but how can we
believe that you're really Haechi?

681
00:43:06,058 --> 00:43:08,351
I'll provide evidence.

682
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,645
Is he on the phone at a time like this?

683
00:43:10,646 --> 00:43:13,440
Well, you wanted him. Go.

684
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:15,359
Evidence? What evidence?

685
00:43:15,985 --> 00:43:18,945
The belongings I took
from those I judged.

686
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:23,575
After announcing my message,
I'll deliver them to you in person.

687
00:43:23,576 --> 00:43:25,869
Editor Justice knows our faces.

688
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,996
Only Sun-woo is to approach.

689
00:43:27,997 --> 00:43:29,477
Rest of the team, keep your distance.

690
00:43:38,674 --> 00:43:39,674
What is it?

691
00:43:40,968 --> 00:43:41,968
It's my Mom.

692
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:46,724
What is it, Mom?

693
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:51,979
Come again.

694
00:43:53,314 --> 00:43:54,314
What did you say?

695
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,736
What the hell are you talking about?

696
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:01,197
Who said that?

697
00:44:02,823 --> 00:44:05,493
I'll kill him if it's a bullshit.

698
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,037
Okay.

699
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:25,929
Mr. Haechi is now on the phone

700
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,059
postponing the execution of
Jeon he announced earlier.

701
00:44:30,643 --> 00:44:32,227
So, Mr. Haechi,

702
00:44:32,228 --> 00:44:35,231
what's the message you wish to share?

703
00:44:36,148 --> 00:44:39,776
Provided that all of the
following conditions are met,

704
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:43,531
I promise to surrender myself
to the police voluntarily.

705
00:44:44,073 --> 00:44:46,741
The judges, prosecutors,
lawyers, and police

706
00:44:46,742 --> 00:44:49,327
involved in unfair
investigations verdicts,

707
00:44:49,328 --> 00:44:52,372
must all resign after
admitting their wrongdoings

708
00:44:52,373 --> 00:44:54,083
and undergo legal proceedings.

709
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,876
Here are the names
on the punishment list:

710
00:44:56,877 --> 00:44:58,962
Minister of Justice Cho Sung-min,

711
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:01,172
Prosecutor General Bae Yeon-tae,

712
00:45:01,173 --> 00:45:01,882
Chief Justice...

713
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:04,551
This guy is a nutjob.

714
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:06,762
And why come out here to stir trouble?

715
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,682
With all the foreigners,
maybe he thinks

716
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:13,059
he can be invisible here.

717
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,562
He can hide in plain sight,
or escape into the woods.

718
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:16,980
Let's call SWAT just in case.

719
00:45:16,981 --> 00:45:18,399
Calm down, will you?

720
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:20,984
We can't call SWAT

721
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:22,987
until we confirm this isn't a prank.

722
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:25,488
Journalists are watching right now.

723
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,782
We gotta apprehend him quietly.

724
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,201
You didn't used to be like this,

725
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:32,412
but you've developed a
habit of condescending me.

726
00:45:32,413 --> 00:45:34,123
I've located the Editor Justice team.

727
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:37,585
They are moving towards
the middle of the square.

728
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:42,505
A man is walking towards them.

729
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,507
Central square! Close in.

730
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,593
Head towards the tteokbokki truck.

731
00:45:46,594 --> 00:45:48,387
Excuse me! Excuse me.

732
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,935
Dammit.

733
00:45:55,936 --> 00:45:57,855
If they make contact, we must get them.

734
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:03,944
You are witnessing a
historic moment with Haechi...

735
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:07,323
Excuse me!

736
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:26,132
Shit.

737
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,073
Move.

738
00:46:53,369 --> 00:46:53,994
I got him.

739
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:55,204
No, I lost him, dammit!

740
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,707
Hey, stop!

741
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:03,169
Stop there.

742
00:47:04,296 --> 00:47:07,882
Haechi is being chased by the
police putting his life at risk!

743
00:47:07,883 --> 00:47:11,302
I'm also risking my life
to film this, everyone!

744
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:14,597
We need your support!
Donations, please, now!

745
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,598
I'm Editor Justice.

746
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:17,017
Hey, stop!

747
00:47:17,726 --> 00:47:19,519
- Get him.
- Come here.

748
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:20,521
Son of a bitch!

749
00:47:22,898 --> 00:47:24,108
Stop there, now!

750
00:47:55,347 --> 00:47:56,515
Damn...

751
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,238
Stop, you bastard!

752
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:15,784
Go after him.

753
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:31,883
Who are you?

754
00:48:36,764 --> 00:48:38,182
What the fuck?

755
00:48:55,783 --> 00:48:57,617
Wh... where...

756
00:48:57,618 --> 00:48:58,494
He went that way.

757
00:48:58,494 --> 00:48:59,494
Sorry!

758
00:49:08,796 --> 00:49:11,047
- Where did he go?
- Down there.

759
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,341
- Under that?
- Yes.

760
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,844
Come out. What the hell?

761
00:49:57,344 --> 00:49:59,054
It was a nasty tumble down.

762
00:50:02,057 --> 00:50:03,057
Hey, Rookie.

763
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,986
I... I got Haechi!

764
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,489
- Haechi?
- That's Haechi?

765
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,870
Stop filming. Someone's hurt here.

766
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,871
Stop.

767
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,127
I got him, Bro.

768
00:50:30,586 --> 00:50:32,504
Don't move. Stay still.

769
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:42,221
Shit.

770
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:43,890
Stop filming. Please!

771
00:50:43,891 --> 00:50:46,100
- We ask for your cooperation.
- It's unsafe here.

772
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:47,603
Keep rolling.

773
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:50,606
It looks like we're
witnessing police brutality.

774
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:53,400
Stop filming, seriously.

775
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:56,819
What happened?

776
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,322
Well...

777
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:03,243
Over there with the police...

778
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:24,056
Bro.

779
00:51:24,723 --> 00:51:26,266
Did you see what happened?

780
00:51:26,934 --> 00:51:29,060
That Haechi guy really runs well.

781
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:31,270
How could he roll down
the stairs like that?

782
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:34,441
I know. I lost track
of time watching it.

783
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,360
We'll withdraw from here soon, right?

784
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:38,362
I'm sure.

785
00:51:39,279 --> 00:51:40,572
Are you done yet?

786
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:43,074
Your skin will come off.

787
00:51:43,075 --> 00:51:44,659
Haechi is apprehended.

788
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,953
You can finish and come out.

789
00:51:46,954 --> 00:51:48,580
Open this door. Now!

790
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,085
I'm exhausted.

791
00:51:54,002 --> 00:51:57,171
This could call for a serious
disciplinary action.

792
00:51:57,172 --> 00:52:00,384
We'll make sure it doesn't. It
happened while chasing a suspect.

793
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,510
Is Park Sun-woo okay?

794
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:06,306
He went to the hospital by himself.
He didn't want to bother us.

795
00:52:06,974 --> 00:52:09,183
He didn't have to go overboard.

796
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:13,187
Back in the day, we didn't even use
pain relief for something like this.

797
00:52:13,188 --> 00:52:16,607
The ball was rolling
straight toward the goal.

798
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:19,986
Why did he shoot it off track?

799
00:52:19,987 --> 00:52:21,989
Even if it went in, it's an own goal.

800
00:52:22,614 --> 00:52:24,407
Because that's not Haechi.

801
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:28,328
If he isn't, what was
all the circus for?

802
00:52:28,704 --> 00:52:32,915
Editor Justice raised 3,500 dollars

803
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,627
during the live broadcast.

804
00:52:36,628 --> 00:52:38,713
And the number of
views is still going up.

805
00:52:38,714 --> 00:52:40,840
That was his plan?

806
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:43,259
We should bring him in right away.

807
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,636
On what?

808
00:52:45,137 --> 00:52:48,806
If the slimy bastard
claims it was a tip-off,

809
00:52:48,807 --> 00:52:52,269
only that phony in the ICU will be
charged with spreading false facts.

810
00:52:53,353 --> 00:52:55,564
This is ridiculous.
Who's calling at this hour?

811
00:52:56,523 --> 00:52:58,525
Top brass is all waiting for my call.

812
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:02,154
This is Captain Oh of
Mapo Major Crime...

813
00:53:03,363 --> 00:53:04,865
What?

814
00:53:06,074 --> 00:53:07,074
Who?

815
00:53:07,951 --> 00:53:08,952
And?

816
00:53:27,888 --> 00:53:29,264
Show me the back shot of the head.

817
00:53:30,557 --> 00:53:31,600
It's exactly the same.

818
00:53:34,269 --> 00:53:35,311
Do-cheol,

819
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,897
his head is cracked in the
same manner as his victim.

820
00:53:37,898 --> 00:53:40,274
When did he go missing
from the safe house?

821
00:53:40,275 --> 00:53:42,902
While we were catching the
fake Haechi on Namsan.

822
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,279
No cameras.

823
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:47,490
The officers guarding him,

824
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,409
why didn't they report immediately?

825
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:52,411
Fearing disciplinary,

826
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:55,624
they set out to find him,
wasting crucial time.

827
00:53:56,500 --> 00:54:00,128
The perp couldn't have brought
him here after killing him.

828
00:54:00,504 --> 00:54:03,340
Jeon must have been lured here.

829
00:54:05,217 --> 00:54:06,426
Hold on.

830
00:54:08,595 --> 00:54:09,930
Shit.

831
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:11,430
Look.

832
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,726
He didn't die from the head injury.

833
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:19,313
He was strangled to death, then
his body was tampered with.

834
00:54:19,314 --> 00:54:21,316
His tongue is sticking out.

835
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:24,611
Why would he go through the trouble?

836
00:54:25,237 --> 00:54:29,323
Jeon must have resisted.
So, the perp killed him first

837
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:31,617
then brought him
here to finish the job?

838
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:35,621
Damn jerk. Couldn't
he just die cleanly?

839
00:54:35,622 --> 00:54:37,248
Instead of breaking his skull

840
00:54:37,249 --> 00:54:39,458
and leaving us with shit to deal with.

841
00:54:39,459 --> 00:54:42,253
Good for him. He deserved to die.

842
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:43,254
Are you delighted?

843
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:43,964
Sorry?

844
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:47,843
He should've been skinned alive,
and displayed in the city square!

845
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,845
Are you delighted?

846
00:54:51,847 --> 00:54:55,559
Is there a good murder and bad murder?

847
00:54:59,855 --> 00:55:01,064
Get your act together.

848
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:04,151
This is a serial murder.

849
00:55:05,777 --> 00:55:07,278
You have all seen

850
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:11,073
the video of me risking
my life to meet Haechi.

851
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:13,367
Haechi is now in serious condition

852
00:55:13,368 --> 00:55:15,996
due to police brutality.

853
00:55:16,371 --> 00:55:18,874
The police have yet
to make a statement.

854
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:27,423
I'm concerned they might
be covering up the truth...

855
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,508
Hold it. Everyone, stop.

856
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,719
We're exercising official duty here.

857
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:34,180
Sit down, all of you.

858
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:35,891
Seriously, are you fucking with me?

859
00:55:37,684 --> 00:55:39,810
Fraud, deception, and
obstructing justice...

860
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:42,981
Do you want me pack it
all up and throw you in jail?

861
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:46,400
Your whole gig is about
Likes and Subscribes.

862
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:48,402
Do you want the big guys in jail

863
00:55:48,403 --> 00:55:51,697
pounding Likes and
Subscribes on your body?

864
00:55:51,698 --> 00:55:54,200
Come on, Bro. Why are you like this?

865
00:55:54,201 --> 00:55:57,536
I have freedom of the press under
Article 21 of the Constitution.

866
00:55:57,537 --> 00:55:59,623
Who's your Bro?

867
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:05,711
Because of you, a young man
is fighting for his life in the ICU.

868
00:56:05,712 --> 00:56:09,548
And you're happy sucking
up views counts?

869
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:15,471
If the fake guy doesn't pull
through, you're done for, idiot.

870
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:18,432
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

871
00:56:18,433 --> 00:56:20,851
You fucking jerk.

872
00:56:20,852 --> 00:56:23,438
I warned you not to commit sins.

873
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:28,859
The guy's girlfriend
came to the hospital

874
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,069
and spilled everything.

875
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:32,072
How you put him up to this.

876
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:40,871
From this moment, if you
get any tips about Haechi

877
00:56:40,872 --> 00:56:44,751
clear it with us before
broadcasting. Understood?

878
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:47,753
Yes, sir. I'll come up with something.

879
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:51,590
When did the girlfriend
show up at the hospital?

880
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:52,676
I don't know.

881
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:55,886
What was that about
the girlfriend then?

882
00:56:55,887 --> 00:56:59,598
I found pictures on his phone

883
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,767
taken with his girlfriend.

884
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:05,980
And Editor Justice got
busted for taking bribes.

885
00:57:05,981 --> 00:57:09,775
Did you ever see a bribe taker
so willing to open his wallet?

886
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:12,987
I knew he'd exploit the
guy but never pay him.

887
00:57:12,988 --> 00:57:17,617
I set the trap, and he fell for it.

888
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:21,705
Your methods are
surprisingly scientific.

889
00:57:22,205 --> 00:57:23,405
How did he even think of that?

890
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:27,002
Nice!

891
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:30,629
Take it easy, it's just practice.

892
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:33,300
Don't take sparring so seriously.

893
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:36,719
Hold on.

894
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,556
Isn't this your dad?

895
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:42,434
This is ridiculous. Did you see this?

896
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:45,853
Look at this. It's hilarious.

897
00:57:45,854 --> 00:57:47,814
The South Korean police is so pathetic!

898
00:57:50,942 --> 00:57:52,651
Are you out of your fucking mind?

899
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:53,653
Come here.

900
00:57:54,321 --> 00:57:55,321
Dipshit!

901
00:57:56,323 --> 00:58:00,534
Are you so ashamed of your
dad that you've gone crazy?

902
00:58:00,535 --> 00:58:02,537
Push his head forward.

903
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:12,839
Students.

904
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,178
This is an aggravated assault.
Whatcha gonna do?

905
00:58:19,179 --> 00:58:20,263
What the fuck?

906
00:58:57,592 --> 00:58:59,386
We checked cellphone base stations

907
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:04,182
but the last call Jeon received
was from an untraceable source.

908
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:07,394
The caller likely used a burner phone.

909
00:59:08,186 --> 00:59:09,229
Here.

910
00:59:10,814 --> 00:59:13,942
Since it won't make much
difference for us all to stay up,

911
00:59:14,734 --> 00:59:18,237
Bong, why don't you go
home and get some rest?

912
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:19,823
Will you write my report?

913
00:59:21,032 --> 00:59:23,232
If I go home and come back,
I'll be even more exhausted.

914
00:59:24,828 --> 00:59:25,829
What?

915
00:59:26,746 --> 00:59:30,208
Do-cheol, you're in trouble.

916
00:59:31,918 --> 00:59:33,420
Your wife wants you to call her.

917
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,428
So bad.

918
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,848
Sorry, Honey. I left
my phone in the car.

919
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:50,269
The boys who fought
Woo-jin came to apologize

920
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:51,688
and promised not to do it again.

921
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:56,233
Their parents must have pressured
them before the violence committee.

922
00:59:56,234 --> 00:59:57,068
WIFE

923
00:59:57,069 --> 00:59:58,944
I've dealt with many kids like them.

924
00:59:58,945 --> 01:00:01,155
Their attitude was different.

925
01:00:01,156 --> 01:00:05,492
It's a positive development. I
told you it would all work out.

926
01:00:05,493 --> 01:00:06,703
What did Woo-jin say?

927
01:00:07,162 --> 01:00:09,164
He doesn't say anything.

928
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,621
Apologize through death!

929
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:52,707
Biker gangs deserve death penalty.

930
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:55,417
They'd probably get 100 years in US.

931
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:57,420
I'll squash 'em for a
hundred. Any takers?

932
01:00:59,297 --> 01:01:00,297
Korea's law makes me sigh.

933
01:01:00,298 --> 01:01:02,550
Catch them only to release?

934
01:01:03,343 --> 01:01:04,427
Should we live in fear?

935
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:21,443
A car collided with 10 motorcycles

936
01:01:21,444 --> 01:01:23,445
killing 12 people.

937
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:24,948
According to CCTV analysis...

938
01:01:25,532 --> 01:01:28,450
The suspect is 28-year-old
Min Gang-hoon

939
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:32,955
who lost his lover in a biker
gang accident 2 years ago.

940
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:36,458
He was in special forces at the time.

941
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,336
Enraged at the mild sentencing,

942
01:01:39,337 --> 01:01:40,754
he tried to retaliate the perps

943
01:01:40,755 --> 01:01:44,258
but ended up in a military
prison, and was discharged.

944
01:01:44,259 --> 01:01:46,970
Since then, he was
arrested for drug offenses.

945
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:49,597
Most importantly,

946
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:53,268
on the day Jeon was
moved to the safe house,

947
01:01:53,768 --> 01:01:57,397
Min's car was spotted near
Jeon's apartment complex.

948
01:01:59,899 --> 01:02:01,483
Is this the right place?

949
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:05,696
According to the CCTV, this
is the final location of his car.

950
01:02:05,697 --> 01:02:08,408
I checked with the local precinct.
Apparently, this is a drug den.

951
01:02:24,591 --> 01:02:27,718
He ended up an addict
following his girlfriend's death?

952
01:02:27,719 --> 01:02:28,719
Exactly.

953
01:02:30,305 --> 01:02:31,639
What's this oil?

954
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,100
Did it leak from that car?

955
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,102
It looks like it.

956
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:41,441
Let's all be careful.

957
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:44,235
Addicts are the most dangerous bunch.

958
01:02:44,652 --> 01:02:46,320
When they're high,

959
01:02:46,321 --> 01:02:48,615
their judgment's clouded,
and they'll stop at nothing.

960
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,618
It is Min Gang-hoon's car.

961
01:02:57,832 --> 01:02:59,417
Why so many juices?

962
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,630
Shit, this is piss!

963
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,467
It looks like he lives in the car.

964
01:03:26,444 --> 01:03:30,198
JUSTICE: WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

965
01:03:32,784 --> 01:03:36,162
Bro, you gotta see this.

966
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,295
This is Jung Chil-su, the leader
of Sangnam 12, the biker gang.

967
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,507
Police Commissioner
Residence / Moving Route

968
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:50,093
Damn...

969
01:03:50,718 --> 01:03:52,318
High Court Judge
Residence / Moving Route

970
01:03:56,724 --> 01:03:57,891
District Attorney
Residence / Moving Route

971
01:03:57,892 --> 01:03:59,309
Do-cheol.

972
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,350
These are pictures of the
safe house where Jeon was.

973
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:08,194
Where did he get these?

974
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:12,100
Only cops or officials
have access to it.

975
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:17,472
Shit.

976
01:05:22,393 --> 01:05:24,103
These punks...

977
01:05:28,191 --> 01:05:30,818
This really is a trap house.

978
01:05:33,488 --> 01:05:36,115
If the situation turns dangerous,

979
01:05:37,492 --> 01:05:39,577
are we allowed to respond with force?

980
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:44,999
Why? Are you gonna kill him?

981
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,215
Whatever happens, try not to kill him.

982
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:57,303
Forget about pay cut,
you'll drown in paperwork.

983
01:07:46,245 --> 01:07:47,538
We found Haechi.

984
01:07:59,342 --> 01:08:01,635
Ah, geez...

985
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:04,930
You are under arrest for
murders of the Sangnam 12.

986
01:08:04,931 --> 01:08:05,972
Come on out.

987
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:08,559
This could get messy.
Let's wait for backup.

988
01:08:19,445 --> 01:08:20,780
Hi.

989
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:36,502
Sun-woo!

990
01:08:37,671 --> 01:08:38,673
Get off me!

991
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,328
Damn... Damn...

992
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:23,009
Die.

993
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:41,359
Get off me.

994
01:09:43,029 --> 01:09:45,362
Hey! What do you think you are doing?

995
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:46,532
Are you crazy?

996
01:09:53,038 --> 01:09:54,165
Don't move!

997
01:10:11,766 --> 01:10:13,100
Crazy bastard.

998
01:10:29,075 --> 01:10:30,075
You!

999
01:10:38,626 --> 01:10:40,419
Freeze!

1000
01:10:43,089 --> 01:10:44,507
Go the other way!

1001
01:10:52,932 --> 01:10:54,225
Hey, come here!

1002
01:11:23,254 --> 01:11:25,131
Stop, for crying out loud!

1003
01:11:26,132 --> 01:11:27,925
That's enough.

1004
01:11:29,677 --> 01:11:30,677
Let him go, man.

1005
01:11:32,346 --> 01:11:34,056
- Let him go!
- Separate them.

1006
01:11:34,974 --> 01:11:36,267
Hold still.

1007
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:38,351
Cuff him.

1008
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:40,937
Hold still.

1009
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:49,155
You bastard!

1010
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:18,661
We got him!

1011
01:13:21,455 --> 01:13:23,290
Pull him up, pull him up!

1012
01:13:31,257 --> 01:13:32,257
Sun-woo!

1013
01:13:43,978 --> 01:13:44,979
What do they say?

1014
01:13:45,813 --> 01:13:47,773
Did you get the tetanus test and X-ray?

1015
01:13:48,983 --> 01:13:49,608
I'm sorry.

1016
01:13:49,609 --> 01:13:51,068
Don't sit up.

1017
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:54,195
You were stabbed with
an addict's syringe.

1018
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:57,074
So, get all the necessary tests done.

1019
01:13:57,908 --> 01:13:59,285
What about the others?

1020
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:04,790
Yoon says he fractured his
ribs but he's exaggerating.

1021
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:06,917
Everyone else is fine.

1022
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:11,296
After all,

1023
01:14:11,297 --> 01:14:12,715
we got Haechi.

1024
01:14:15,009 --> 01:14:16,634
We won't know that.

1025
01:14:16,635 --> 01:14:17,927
What do you mean?

1026
01:14:17,928 --> 01:14:21,223
Min being Haechi is just
our wishful thinking.

1027
01:14:22,516 --> 01:14:24,727
We don't know the facts yet.

1028
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:32,151
You're somewhat sorry
now that he's caught?

1029
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,528
You were rooting for him.

1030
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:37,239
Are you nuts?

1031
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,159
Murder is murder.

1032
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,537
And catching perps is my job.

1033
01:14:44,455 --> 01:14:47,332
I'll write the report. Take it easy

1034
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:48,751
for a few days.

1035
01:14:57,259 --> 01:14:58,594
You weren't...

1036
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:01,764
really going to kill him, were you?

1037
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:08,979
You'll make a mistake one
of these days. Be careful.

1038
01:15:14,068 --> 01:15:16,194
Why aren't you writing the report?

1039
01:15:16,195 --> 01:15:19,990
Min, we've secured the CCTV footage.

1040
01:15:21,992 --> 01:15:23,410
What the heck is going on?

1041
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:26,496
We're in the middle of interrogation.
Please cooperate.

1042
01:15:26,497 --> 01:15:29,582
Cooperate with you stealing our case?

1043
01:15:29,583 --> 01:15:31,793
Seo Do-cheol. What are you doing?

1044
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:33,878
We finally brought
him, and what is this?

1045
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:34,421
Get out.

1046
01:15:34,422 --> 01:15:35,630
- Come on.
- Now!

1047
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,175
- Let us at least sign the report.
- Get out!

1048
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:43,304
Since you took over the
case, Jeon got killed,

1049
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:45,098
the fake Haechi ended up in the ICU,

1050
01:15:45,099 --> 01:15:46,808
and 12 bikers died.

1051
01:15:46,809 --> 01:15:47,726
Twelve dead!

1052
01:15:47,727 --> 01:15:49,018
In this situation,

1053
01:15:49,019 --> 01:15:52,522
what's more important, solving
the case or who solves it?

1054
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:55,400
What if your premature
conclusion really goes haywire?

1055
01:15:55,401 --> 01:15:56,734
Don't dare to talk like that.

1056
01:15:56,735 --> 01:16:00,823
Isn't it your team that collected
the evidence from his car?

1057
01:16:01,949 --> 01:16:06,620
You're screwing your team
by doing this, alright?

1058
01:16:07,246 --> 01:16:08,914
National Forensic
Service Seoul Institute

1059
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,750
You were right about it.

1060
01:16:12,751 --> 01:16:14,460
Jeon's cause of death
wasn't a concussion.

1061
01:16:14,461 --> 01:16:16,337
It was strangulation.

1062
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:20,634
COD was cervical pressure asphyxia.
Conjunctival petechiae were evident.

1063
01:16:22,136 --> 01:16:25,347
His skull was bashed
in before rigor set in.

1064
01:16:26,765 --> 01:16:31,060
But here is what's really boggling.

1065
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:33,856
Strangulation is either by
the hands or instrument.

1066
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,440
Look.

1067
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:39,569
Strangulation leaves
mark on the neck, right?

1068
01:16:39,570 --> 01:16:43,156
If it was manual strangulation,
there would be marks from pressure.

1069
01:16:43,157 --> 01:16:46,367
If it was ligature, marks
from the material used.

1070
01:16:46,368 --> 01:16:48,787
But look at these marks on Jeon.

1071
01:16:51,248 --> 01:16:54,167
They're spread wide around the neck.

1072
01:16:54,168 --> 01:16:57,713
It wasn't by hands nor instruments...

1073
01:17:02,676 --> 01:17:04,678
If it wasn't hands or instruments...

1074
01:17:10,976 --> 01:17:12,310
Legs?

1075
01:17:12,311 --> 01:17:13,520
He was strangled with legs?

1076
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:17,483
Let me show you something.
Look at this.

1077
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,986
Not here... but here.

1078
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:23,613
Look.

1079
01:17:23,614 --> 01:17:25,823
This is no joke, huh?

1080
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:30,203
This is the triangle choke, a
popular technique used in MMA.

1081
01:17:30,204 --> 01:17:31,914
That's the only deduction I can make.

1082
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:36,710
What the...?

1083
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,923
Hold on.

1084
01:17:42,341 --> 01:17:44,927
- Do you have internet connection?
- Let me.

1085
01:17:44,951 --> 01:17:46,044
UFC Patrolman

1086
01:17:46,045 --> 01:17:50,557
UFC Patrolman subdues a knifer

1087
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:13,664
Son of a bitch.

1088
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:20,170
Are the guys still in the office?

1089
01:18:21,588 --> 01:18:24,966
There are some files I need to find.

1090
01:18:24,967 --> 01:18:26,093
And about Park Sun-woo...

1091
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:34,183
Send Bong and Wang to his
current and former precincts.

1092
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:40,107
Also, ask Yoon to get Min's
dash cam and traffic records.

1093
01:18:42,901 --> 01:18:45,069
If we announce that Min is Haechi,

1094
01:18:45,070 --> 01:18:48,781
our team... no, the entire
Korean police will be screwed.

1095
01:18:48,782 --> 01:18:50,283
What are you saying out of the blue?

1096
01:18:50,284 --> 01:18:55,705
Min ran over the bikers
for personal revenge.

1097
01:18:55,706 --> 01:18:58,291
So, unless the police
manipulate the evidence,

1098
01:18:58,292 --> 01:19:01,502
he'll get cleared on alibi.

1099
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:05,298
Min is not the real Haechi.
He was just imitating him.

1100
01:19:05,299 --> 01:19:09,302
Did they find something
at the forensic lab?

1101
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:11,221
Remember the marks on Jeon's neck?

1102
01:19:12,222 --> 01:19:14,808
This is the kind of thing
that can leave such mark.

1103
01:19:16,143 --> 01:19:19,021
Park Sun-woo applies
a triangle choke here.

1104
01:19:21,815 --> 01:19:24,610
You're presenting this as evidence?

1105
01:19:25,319 --> 01:19:28,446
First, you fight against the rich,
and now against the police?

1106
01:19:28,447 --> 01:19:35,037
Then anyone who can do the
triangle choke is a suspect?

1107
01:19:35,829 --> 01:19:38,831
I'm sure even Wang can do this.

1108
01:19:38,832 --> 01:19:41,417
Not 100%. I haven't learned it.

1109
01:19:41,418 --> 01:19:42,836
Look closely here.

1110
01:19:44,046 --> 01:19:46,464
There's another man we know.

1111
01:19:46,465 --> 01:19:48,258
Oh, no!

1112
01:19:49,134 --> 01:19:50,259
Is that Min?

1113
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:51,637
No shit.

1114
01:19:52,763 --> 01:19:56,557
This guy wasn't drunk.

1115
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:58,684
He was high on drugs.

1116
01:19:58,685 --> 01:20:01,355
Sun-woo got to learn about
Min after this incident

1117
01:20:01,980 --> 01:20:03,482
and decided to use him.

1118
01:20:04,441 --> 01:20:09,070
Sun-woo offered information
to help Min take his revenge

1119
01:20:09,071 --> 01:20:12,366
in exchange for playing Haechi.

1120
01:20:15,786 --> 01:20:18,913
When the fake Haechi was caught,

1121
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:22,291
why did Park Sun-woo act
so dangerously on the stairs?

1122
01:20:22,292 --> 01:20:26,003
If the fake Haechi died there,

1123
01:20:26,004 --> 01:20:27,922
he would've been the real Haechi.

1124
01:20:27,923 --> 01:20:31,300
And if I hadn't gotten the
truth from Editor Justice?

1125
01:20:31,301 --> 01:20:35,013
The top brass would've
announced that we got Haechi.

1126
01:20:36,682 --> 01:20:41,018
Park Sun-woo, after failing in Namsan,

1127
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:43,897
tried to turn Min into Haechi
and killed him instead.

1128
01:20:44,690 --> 01:20:46,941
He's a cop,

1129
01:20:46,942 --> 01:20:49,486
he knows too well how we'd handle it.

1130
01:20:51,405 --> 01:20:54,825
If he managed to kill Min then,
the case would've been closed.

1131
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:06,043
Do-cheol, can you handle this?

1132
01:21:06,044 --> 01:21:09,964
Let's prove first that
Min is not Haechi.

1133
01:21:09,965 --> 01:21:13,843
We just need to secure
Min Gang-hoon's alibi

1134
01:21:13,844 --> 01:21:17,222
for the two most recent cases,
Jeon and professor's murders.

1135
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:18,932
I'm sorry.

1136
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:20,642
This is a serial murder.

1137
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,437
He must have given the same
answer to the task force guys.

1138
01:21:24,438 --> 01:21:27,064
Men's Restroom

1139
01:21:27,065 --> 01:21:31,152
Let's get confession from
Min and check his alibi.

1140
01:21:31,153 --> 01:21:34,739
Come in. We're here to help you.

1141
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:37,074
You are not Haechi, right?

1142
01:21:37,075 --> 01:21:38,869
Then we're left with Park Sun-woo.

1143
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:42,371
Get a warrant while
he's in the hospital

1144
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:47,084
and the rest, search his house,
car and surroundings thoroughly.

1145
01:21:47,085 --> 01:21:49,463
I'll meet Sun-woo at the
hospital and stall him.

1146
01:21:51,173 --> 01:21:53,175
Despite everything,

1147
01:21:54,092 --> 01:21:57,971
We can't do things half-assed.
It's a matter of integrity.

1148
01:22:00,307 --> 01:22:03,977
You gotta stop the
press conference first.

1149
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:06,480
Do-cheol.

1150
01:22:07,606 --> 01:22:09,166
If this goes wrong,

1151
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:13,111
you should pay for my
daughter's college.

1152
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,300
There's no way she can go to college.

1153
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:17,783
Don't jinx it, jerk.

1154
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,210
Are you doing this on purpose?

1155
01:22:30,128 --> 01:22:32,839
I have rounded up the press
already. How can I cancel it now?

1156
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:37,426
Haven't I made it clear to you

1157
01:22:37,427 --> 01:22:39,137
for all of you to do
absolutely nothing?

1158
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:41,931
This is clearly disobedience.

1159
01:22:41,932 --> 01:22:47,312
It is indeed, sir.

1160
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,940
But before command and discipline,

1161
01:22:50,941 --> 01:22:55,528
aren't we buddies who've been
through thick and thin together?

1162
01:22:55,529 --> 01:22:57,738
I mean...

1163
01:22:57,739 --> 01:23:03,161
other than the biker gang case,

1164
01:23:03,662 --> 01:23:05,830
Min has alibis for the other...

1165
01:23:05,831 --> 01:23:06,831
Captain Oh.

1166
01:23:06,832 --> 01:23:07,832
Yes?

1167
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:09,727
Do not cross the line here.

1168
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:10,752
Do you understand?

1169
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:19,343
My team...

1170
01:23:19,344 --> 01:23:23,347
they are working their
ass off to solve the case.

1171
01:23:23,348 --> 01:23:26,560
Can't you back them up once?

1172
01:23:27,853 --> 01:23:31,772
During the football match 2 years ago,

1173
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:34,775
it was my team that kept
passing you the ball,

1174
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:38,112
so that you could pass
it to the Commissioner

1175
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:39,572
who ended up scoring 2 goals.

1176
01:23:39,573 --> 01:23:41,282
What are you talking about?

1177
01:23:41,283 --> 01:23:43,910
You're always like this.
Why bring that up now?

1178
01:23:45,662 --> 01:23:47,873
Do I have to tell you why?

1179
01:23:58,675 --> 01:23:59,885
Shit.

1180
01:24:05,515 --> 01:24:07,934
Hey, honey. I'm on duty now.

1181
01:24:09,394 --> 01:24:10,437
Nurse.

1182
01:24:12,105 --> 01:24:12,606
What?

1183
01:24:12,607 --> 01:24:16,610
She got a call. She said she'd be
back soon but it's been 3 hours

1184
01:24:17,235 --> 01:24:18,445
and her phone's switched off.

1185
01:24:18,737 --> 01:24:20,738
I reported it to the police,

1186
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:24,825
but the smartwatch you talked about,

1187
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:26,036
didn't you request that?

1188
01:24:26,828 --> 01:24:31,540
Thuy told the girls to call
me if something happens.

1189
01:24:31,541 --> 01:24:33,042
So I came rushing.

1190
01:24:33,043 --> 01:24:37,339
I'll be with the girls. Do
what you can to find her.

1191
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:44,429
UNKNOWN CALLER

1192
01:24:48,433 --> 01:24:49,351
Hello?

1193
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:50,351
Bro.

1194
01:24:54,147 --> 01:24:55,439
Where are you now?

1195
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,733
What about you?

1196
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:08,453
Do you have Thuy with you?

1197
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:16,795
Please say no if you're not.

1198
01:25:18,797 --> 01:25:20,090
Park Sun-woo,

1199
01:25:20,799 --> 01:25:22,384
are you really Haechi?

1200
01:25:23,802 --> 01:25:26,805
I never said I was.

1201
01:25:27,806 --> 01:25:28,974
RECORDING

1202
01:25:30,183 --> 01:25:31,226
Sun-woo.

1203
01:25:32,394 --> 01:25:35,187
She has two young children.

1204
01:25:35,188 --> 01:25:36,815
Let's not mess with innocent people.

1205
01:25:39,192 --> 01:25:40,318
You're recording the call.

1206
01:25:42,779 --> 01:25:46,407
I got your ass. You
can't escape from me.

1207
01:25:46,408 --> 01:25:48,994
Don't escalate the
situation. Stop here.

1208
01:25:49,828 --> 01:25:51,704
We'll figure out a way.

1209
01:25:51,705 --> 01:25:53,914
You know I rooted for you, honestly.

1210
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,834
And I root for you, Bro.

1211
01:25:57,836 --> 01:26:01,631
Can you look at the phone screen?

1212
01:26:13,226 --> 01:26:14,936
Son of a bitch!

1213
01:26:16,438 --> 01:26:18,439
Where...

1214
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,857
Where is my son?

1215
01:26:19,858 --> 01:26:21,233
These kids are so young,

1216
01:26:21,234 --> 01:26:23,069
and not afraid to play with fire.

1217
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:31,952
Answer the phone.

1218
01:26:33,747 --> 01:26:34,747
Thank you.

1219
01:26:35,874 --> 01:26:36,875
Who could it be?

1220
01:26:39,544 --> 01:26:40,545
Hello?

1221
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:45,090
Why are you calling me at the office?

1222
01:26:45,091 --> 01:26:47,885
My phone got hacked.

1223
01:26:47,886 --> 01:26:51,765
So please, do as I ask, Captain.

1224
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:56,686
Thank you.

1225
01:27:15,914 --> 01:27:16,498
At the time,

1226
01:27:16,499 --> 01:27:19,625
Thuy's husband who wasn't
wearing a seatbelt

1227
01:27:19,626 --> 01:27:25,715
lost his life when the steel
bars penetrated his body.

1228
01:27:26,716 --> 01:27:29,802
Thuy, who was driving, was unharmed

1229
01:27:29,803 --> 01:27:31,512
because she was wearing a seatbelt.

1230
01:27:31,513 --> 01:27:35,516
She also collected her husband's
700,000 dollars insurance payout.

1231
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:38,310
Thanks to the evil foreign wife,

1232
01:27:38,311 --> 01:27:41,231
the husband died shedding bloody tears.

1233
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:42,417
Bro!

1234
01:28:43,585 --> 01:28:46,004
Please save me.

1235
01:29:04,189 --> 01:29:08,026
You're annoyed to find Editor
Justice instead of Woo-jin.

1236
01:29:10,028 --> 01:29:11,738
Don't do anything stupid.

1237
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:16,034
I came alone as promised.
So come on out.

1238
01:29:16,534 --> 01:29:18,536
Help!

1239
01:29:18,912 --> 01:29:20,704
Help me!

1240
01:29:20,705 --> 01:29:27,252
Thuy tells me that you
had a chance to help her,

1241
01:29:27,253 --> 01:29:29,005
but didn't.

1242
01:29:39,349 --> 01:29:42,477
Okay, I'm sorry I fucked up.

1243
01:29:45,647 --> 01:29:48,441
But you can't take my son hostage.

1244
01:29:54,572 --> 01:29:56,740
Thuy didn't do anything either.

1245
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:58,451
What about Editor Justice?

1246
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:02,497
To be honest, you
want to kill that guy.

1247
01:30:03,873 --> 01:30:05,958
Not just you personally,

1248
01:30:05,959 --> 01:30:10,754
but you know how many people
got wronged by his words.

1249
01:30:10,755 --> 01:30:14,258
Haechi shouldn't act like this.

1250
01:30:14,259 --> 01:30:16,885
Why do you keep calling me Haechi?

1251
01:30:16,886 --> 01:30:18,596
I never said I was.

1252
01:30:19,973 --> 01:30:24,102
It's that man in front of
you that created Haechi.

1253
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,897
Have you ever entertained the
idea that you could be a Haechi?

1254
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:41,493
If you're getting disciplined anyway,
why didn't you rough him up more?

1255
01:30:41,494 --> 01:30:44,288
He had a knife. A perfect
excuse to give him a beatdown.

1256
01:30:44,289 --> 01:30:49,293
Seriously, how can they tell me
to protect someone I arrested?

1257
01:30:49,294 --> 01:30:52,421
If he appears in front of
me, I'll rip him to pieces.

1258
01:30:52,422 --> 01:30:54,214
You beat a woman to death

1259
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:56,425
and her entire family
is dead because of you.

1260
01:30:56,426 --> 01:30:59,928
Only because you got away
lightly for being intoxicated,

1261
01:30:59,929 --> 01:31:01,431
you think the law is on your side?

1262
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:04,641
You'll face God's punishment.

1263
01:31:04,642 --> 01:31:08,103
Couldn't he deal with him quietly,

1264
01:31:08,104 --> 01:31:09,304
and make everyone's life easy.

1265
01:31:10,023 --> 01:31:11,107
Don't you think?

1266
01:31:11,941 --> 01:31:15,445
You sound infallibly like Haechi.

1267
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:21,742
A violent cop displeased with system,

1268
01:31:21,743 --> 01:31:23,661
took justice into his own hands.

1269
01:31:24,037 --> 01:31:27,664
Park Sun-woo, you're really
crossing the line here.

1270
01:31:27,665 --> 01:31:29,875
Don't create this into a
situation you can't handle.

1271
01:31:29,876 --> 01:31:32,544
I'll take care of the situation.

1272
01:31:32,545 --> 01:31:35,673
I'm giving you the
opportunity to choose.

1273
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:39,594
The first option is where
Editor Justice is Haechi.

1274
01:31:40,345 --> 01:31:42,179
Since I set up everything,

1275
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:45,558
stick the metal pipe
into the accelerator.

1276
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:50,771
In the end, it'll be
pinned on Editor Justice

1277
01:31:50,772 --> 01:31:52,857
who has been acting
as Haechi all along.

1278
01:31:53,858 --> 01:31:56,693
He's the one who gave the name

1279
01:31:56,694 --> 01:32:00,281
and is making the most
money using Haechi.

1280
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:01,991
The person

1281
01:32:01,992 --> 01:32:05,494
who benefits most from Haechi
turns out be the Haechi.

1282
01:32:05,495 --> 01:32:07,580
Isn't it the most natural scenario?

1283
01:32:08,581 --> 01:32:13,210
In the process of tracking
down and arresting Haechi,

1284
01:32:13,211 --> 01:32:17,632
you're attacked by Editor Justice
and ended up killing in self-defense.

1285
01:32:19,008 --> 01:32:21,176
Then, Woo-jin will be spared

1286
01:32:21,177 --> 01:32:23,805
and we can both return to our places.

1287
01:32:27,725 --> 01:32:30,728
If you don't like this option,
there's the second one.

1288
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:35,108
You can try arresting me.

1289
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:38,403
But Woo-jin will fall in danger.

1290
01:32:39,028 --> 01:32:42,532
In fact, he may be
the first to die tonight.

1291
01:32:43,032 --> 01:32:46,034
Even if you try to arrest me,

1292
01:32:46,035 --> 01:32:50,748
everyone there will die
as in the first option.

1293
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,419
Because you can't defeat me.

1294
01:32:56,045 --> 01:32:59,132
Then of course, I will
turn you into Haechi.

1295
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:04,470
Do you think that will work?

1296
01:33:04,971 --> 01:33:06,264
What about my alibi?

1297
01:33:06,556 --> 01:33:09,276
Another Haechi can fill the alibi.

1298
01:33:09,934 --> 01:33:14,354
Why are you doing this?
You're a police officer.

1299
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,773
I became a police officer
precisely to do this.

1300
01:33:16,774 --> 01:33:18,651
Is it so important to know why?

1301
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:23,572
People only believe what
they want to believe.

1302
01:33:23,573 --> 01:33:26,241
Instead of questioning why,

1303
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:30,288
focus on your decision.

1304
01:33:49,807 --> 01:33:51,267
Fuck!

1305
01:33:54,103 --> 01:33:55,604
Help me.

1306
01:33:55,605 --> 01:33:58,023
It's okay, it's okay.

1307
01:33:58,024 --> 01:33:59,108
It's fine. Just a moment.

1308
01:34:06,115 --> 01:34:08,117
Your son is going to die.

1309
01:34:12,413 --> 01:34:15,499
You already have a clear answer.

1310
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,335
You don't have to make
a difficult choice.

1311
01:34:20,505 --> 01:34:24,425
I really think we'll make a great team.

1312
01:34:31,724 --> 01:34:34,227
BONG: Arrived at the
scene as captain told.

1313
01:34:34,644 --> 01:34:36,521
893-6851

1314
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:40,525
We worked our asses off to find him.

1315
01:34:42,026 --> 01:34:44,027
Seriously, you'll wet the bed, kids.

1316
01:34:44,028 --> 01:34:45,530
Woo-jin, uncle's here.

1317
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:54,038
You don't know people, do you?

1318
01:35:04,966 --> 01:35:06,676
The game has changed now.

1319
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:09,804
And...

1320
01:35:11,556 --> 01:35:13,766
I already have a team, sucker!

1321
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:04,859
Help!

1322
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:57,637
Are you okay?

1323
01:40:12,857 --> 01:40:13,857
Bro!

1324
01:41:08,329 --> 01:41:10,121
There's a woman on the truck.

1325
01:41:10,122 --> 01:41:11,122
It's okay, get in.

1326
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:14,417
What happened to your face, man?

1327
01:41:14,418 --> 01:41:15,960
He's so fucking good at fighting.

1328
01:41:15,961 --> 01:41:17,546
Hurry! Go after him.

1329
01:41:28,557 --> 01:41:30,059
Wipe the blood off.

1330
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:12,977
Do-cheol!

1331
01:42:18,482 --> 01:42:19,692
Do-cheol?

1332
01:42:33,205 --> 01:42:35,624
Shit! Open this now.

1333
01:42:42,715 --> 01:42:43,795
Why is he coming back here?

1334
01:42:44,925 --> 01:42:46,552
What the f...? That psycho.

1335
01:42:50,055 --> 01:42:51,055
Step on it.

1336
01:42:51,056 --> 01:42:51,807
No, no!

1337
01:42:51,807 --> 01:42:52,558
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1338
01:42:52,559 --> 01:42:54,518
- No, stop!
- Just step on it!

1339
01:43:22,838 --> 01:43:24,673
Do-cheol, are you okay?

1340
01:43:25,257 --> 01:43:26,382
Yeah, you?

1341
01:43:26,383 --> 01:43:27,593
I think I am.

1342
01:43:29,762 --> 01:43:31,263
Hurry up.

1343
01:43:33,390 --> 01:43:34,767
This motherfucker...

1344
01:43:47,571 --> 01:43:48,571
What...

1345
01:43:49,073 --> 01:43:51,075
He didn't wear a seatbelt.

1346
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:55,703
He can't die here like this.

1347
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:56,914
Are you okay?

1348
01:43:57,915 --> 01:43:59,874
Don't get out.

1349
01:43:59,875 --> 01:44:02,126
What about Woo-jin?

1350
01:44:02,127 --> 01:44:03,295
He's with his mom.

1351
01:44:04,338 --> 01:44:05,338
Okay, thank you.

1352
01:44:05,339 --> 01:44:09,425
Go further down. You'll find
Editor Justice and the victim.

1353
01:44:09,426 --> 01:44:11,094
Take care of them first.

1354
01:44:11,095 --> 01:44:12,804
Go, go! Hurry!

1355
01:44:12,805 --> 01:44:14,348
There's a man. Be careful.

1356
01:44:16,642 --> 01:44:17,726
Come on.

1357
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:28,612
Check his pulse.

1358
01:44:32,116 --> 01:44:33,951
- No pulse.
- Pull him out.

1359
01:44:35,452 --> 01:44:36,829
One, two, three.

1360
01:44:41,458 --> 01:44:43,627
We need a stretcher here.

1361
01:44:44,253 --> 01:44:45,838
Stretcher!

1362
01:44:46,255 --> 01:44:47,464
Hurry.

1363
01:44:50,134 --> 01:44:52,844
There's another one down the tunnel.

1364
01:44:52,845 --> 01:44:54,554
Should call 3 tow trucks, okay?

1365
01:44:54,555 --> 01:44:56,765
Restrict public access just in case.

1366
01:45:08,485 --> 01:45:10,361
Do-cheol! The EMT is here.

1367
01:45:10,362 --> 01:45:11,071
Do-cheol?

1368
01:45:11,072 --> 01:45:14,158
- We'll take it from here.
- Go away, dammit.

1369
01:46:00,245 --> 01:46:02,039
Over here.

1370
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:09,212
One, two!

1371
01:46:10,047 --> 01:46:11,048
Easy.

1372
01:46:14,843 --> 01:46:16,136
Let's move.

1373
01:46:17,554 --> 01:46:18,931
Hold on.

1374
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,481
Park Sun-woo,

1375
01:46:28,857 --> 01:46:32,444
I'll be killing you gently
as we write the report.

1376
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:42,037
So, you can't die so
easily, son of a bitch.

1377
01:46:43,497 --> 01:46:44,665
Let's go!

1378
01:46:49,044 --> 01:46:51,171
Man, it's tough.

1379
01:46:55,592 --> 01:46:56,885
Steady. Easy.

1380
01:47:00,389 --> 01:47:01,390
Come this way.

1381
01:47:24,621 --> 01:47:26,080
I'm Editor Justice,

1382
01:47:26,081 --> 01:47:29,209
at the scene of the serial
killer, Haechi's arrest...

1383
01:47:33,005 --> 01:47:34,505
Hello? Honey...

1384
01:47:34,506 --> 01:47:36,133
Like, subscribe and donate.

1385
01:47:40,012 --> 01:47:42,222
This is tough.

1386
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:27,767
Thanks to all your support,
our Major Crimes Division

1387
01:48:27,768 --> 01:48:31,771
has successfully
apprehended the suspect

1388
01:48:31,772 --> 01:48:33,564
in the Haechi serial murder.

1389
01:48:33,565 --> 01:48:35,775
We have achieved the feat of solving

1390
01:48:35,776 --> 01:48:39,779
both the Sangnam 12 biker murders

1391
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:43,784
and the so-called Haechi
serial murder case.

1392
01:49:36,253 --> 01:49:37,753
Honey.

1393
01:49:37,754 --> 01:49:38,921
Ju-yeon?

1394
01:49:38,922 --> 01:49:40,464
Yes? Honey?

1395
01:49:40,465 --> 01:49:42,633
Your back will hurt if you sleep here.

1396
01:49:42,634 --> 01:49:44,343
- Are you okay?
- Come down here.

1397
01:49:44,344 --> 01:49:47,054
- Did you get hurt?
- I'm fine. Come on.

1398
01:49:47,055 --> 01:49:48,764
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

1399
01:49:48,765 --> 01:49:50,683
I have salted fish and
picked cucumber...

1400
01:49:50,684 --> 01:49:53,769
I set them on the table.
Fry an egg and eat.

1401
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:54,770
Alright.

1402
01:49:54,771 --> 01:49:56,231
Make a fried egg...

1403
01:49:57,065 --> 01:49:59,233
- Your face...
- I know, I'm handsome.

1404
01:49:59,234 --> 01:50:01,152
- Put some ointment.
- Alright.

1405
01:50:01,153 --> 01:50:03,572
- Make sure to do it.
- Okay, ointment.

1406
01:50:05,073 --> 01:50:06,450
I have to sleep.

1407
01:50:09,244 --> 01:50:11,788
Don't forget the ointment.

1408
01:50:29,514 --> 01:50:30,682
You're home.

1409
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:49,201
Woo-jin, wait. Look at me.

1410
01:50:51,036 --> 01:50:52,329
Look at Dad.

1411
01:50:55,624 --> 01:50:57,334
Damn...

1412
01:50:57,709 --> 01:51:00,629
How could they do
this to a child's face?

1413
01:51:02,839 --> 01:51:03,840
You okay?

1414
01:51:04,633 --> 01:51:06,009
Sit down.

1415
01:51:07,219 --> 01:51:08,345
Come on.

1416
01:51:13,517 --> 01:51:14,518
Here.

1417
01:51:15,936 --> 01:51:17,521
Take a bite before going to bed.

1418
01:51:18,522 --> 01:51:23,360
You're so swollen that this
won't make a difference.

1419
01:51:30,075 --> 01:51:31,368
Woo-jin...

1420
01:51:35,038 --> 01:51:39,960
Dad was short-sighted.

1421
01:52:00,564 --> 01:52:01,356
Ugh, salty.

1422
01:52:01,357 --> 01:52:03,191
You woke me up.

1423
01:52:04,109 --> 01:52:07,112
Why are you making so much noise?
Do you want me to sleep or not?

1424
01:52:08,071 --> 01:52:10,073
Is it good? Let Mom have a taste.

1425
01:52:16,913 --> 01:52:18,753
Why are you giving this
salty stuff to a child?

1426
01:52:19,708 --> 01:52:20,792
Want some water?

1427
01:52:41,605 --> 01:52:43,815
HWANG JUNG-MIN

01:52:48,111 --> 01:52:51,031
