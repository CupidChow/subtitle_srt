[The Wolf]

20
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,179
[Episode 22]
Ever since Yao Ji pretended to make a deal with me

21
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:36,179
to treat Zhaixing's legs,

22
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,520
I knew something was off.

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,179
Think about it.

24
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:43,039
Yao Ji has been my nemesis.

25
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,440
Why would she easily agree to betray His Majesty to assist me?

26
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,559
Also, I would betray her anytime.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,899
Isn't she just dooming herself?

28
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:51,958
You are clear-eyed, Master.

29
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,380
Yao Ji is cautious enough to not get herself into danger.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,180
May I ask you something, Master?

31
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,580
Go ahead.

32
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,539
If it wasn't a fake poison but a real one,

33
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:10,119
would you deceive His Majesty

34
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:12,679
and secretly cure Young Feudal Mistress Ma's poison?

35
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,459
Wait! What nonsense are you talking?

36
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:27,019
Why are you thinking about what didn't happen?

37
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,520
Master,

38
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:31,139
I would like to know that, too.

39
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:33,900
Are you doing this, too?

40
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,039
If the day will come that I have to betray His Majesty

41
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:41,659
and choose to protect Ma Zhaixing,

42
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:44,739
then I would resign as the head of Night Fiends first.

43
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,499
I would then have nothing to do with you all.

44
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:52,379
Whatever I do would have nothing to do with you.

45
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,240
Master, that's not what I meant!

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,660
Leave.

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,779
- But, Master—
- Leave!

48
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, Master.

49
00:03:22,499 --> 00:03:24,740
After this test,

50
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:28,780
there's no way Chu Kui will put his total trust in me again.

51
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,900
We're in a perilous situation.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,980
I must figure out a way to get Zhaixing out of here the soonest.

53
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,500
What are you planting?

54
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,480
Go away.

55
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,800
You're still fussing about the Hundred Flowers Brothel incident?

56
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,660
How dare you laugh at me!

57
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,339
Why don't you go find those prostitutes?

58
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,539
They're as sweet as honey.

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,940
However sweet the honey is, it's not lasting.

60
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,079
Yet, the brightness of a star is eternal.

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,699
You picked up these sweet nothings from those brothels, didn't you?

62
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:51,259
Mo Xiao and I went to the Hundred Flowers Brothel

63
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,719
because His Majesty asked me to go investigate rebellious officials.

64
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,678
We weren't there to drink and have fun.

65
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,559
If you don't believe me, you may go ask His Majesty.

66
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,139
The Ministry of Justice has the record, right?

67
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,259
What about Miss Lufu from Kuizhou?

68
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,719
She didn't enter my room at all.

69
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:10,079
I used her to drive you away.

70
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,739
I don't care what you did at Hundred Flowers Brothel.

71
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:18,240
Anyway, you went there behind my back.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,418
Speak!

73
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:22,100
What else are you hiding from me?

74
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,579
Do you really have no other unspeakable secret?

75
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:35,199
None.

76
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,840
Wolf Boy never hides anything from me.

77
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,359
Are you still that Wolf Boy?

78
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,299
I'm always Wolf Boy in front of you.

79
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:57,120
What about when you're not in front of me?

80
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,819
When I'm not in front of you,

81
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:03,299
I'll still remember that I'm your Wolf Boy.

82
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
The current Prince of Bo,

83
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,140
whether he is with you or not, no matter what happens,

84
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,819
will always remember

85
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,820
to not let anything upsetting happen to you.

86
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,999
You haven't told me what you're planting.

87
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,560
Usnea herbs.

88
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,660
After leaving Ma Mansion,

89
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,259
you and I were suddenly bestowed a marriage.

90
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:46,780
And I suddenly found out

91
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,899
that you're my long-lost Wolf Boy.

92
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,759
You don't like God's arrangement?

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,200
No.

94
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,519
For eight years, you were Prince of Bo whom I don't know.

95
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,320
You're Wolf Boy as well as Prince of Bo.

96
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,580
But those eight years,

97
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,320
it was such a long time.

98
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,360
But I wasn't by your side and I knew nothing.

99
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,999
I know that people change.

100
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,259
But I always hope that these usnea herbs

101
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,619
can turn you back into Wolf Boy a bit more.

102
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,020
I know you don't like plants.

103
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,119
But now, are you willing to turn back into Wolf Boy a bit more

104
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:44,519
and accept these plants?

105
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,120
Just a bit?

106
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:08,540
♫ Eternity may not be far away ♫

107
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,220
♫ Lingering on love for one more day ♫

108
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,080
♫ My heartbeat kept repeating ♫

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,440
♫ That jump for joy during our first meeting ♫

110
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,499
At first, I didn't know how to appreciate the beauty of flowers.

111
00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:27,039
Now, I feel like learning it.

112
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,540
But isn't this too much?

113
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,940
Since I'm learning it, I might as well master it.

114
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,139
Not just these.

115
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,360
This is...

116
00:08:52,059 --> 00:08:53,580
Wolf pot?

117
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,539
Master knows that you like playing pitch pot.

118
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:57,520
That's why he ordered me to find that.

119
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,819
I asked someone to customize it.

120
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,219
Your Highness, did you see it?

121
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:08,560
Both of us are on this pot!

122
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,079
Mo Xiao,

123
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:15,680
did you take it upon yourself to have this made?

124
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,020
Well done.

125
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,340
Master complimented me!

126
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,019
Let's play a round?

127
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,620
Shall we?

128
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,559
With Master?

129
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,720
Who else?

130
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,938
Let's do as she said and play a round.

131
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,799
- Forget about the ranks.
- Sure!

132
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:45,639
Truth be told,

133
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,260
I'm the greatest player at this.

134
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,920
Okay, let's play!

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,240
♫ One more gaze and let's see who will melt whom ♫

136
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,820
♫ One more hugging practice until perfection is achieved ♫

137
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,580
Watch me.

138
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,199
Good!

139
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,240
Watch me.

140
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,578
Okay. I'm done calculating.

141
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,498
Prince of Bo is out.

142
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,019
Your scores are almost the same.

143
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,698
Now, we'll come up with a winner.

144
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:38,798
Last shot.

145
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,499
The highest scorer will flick the losers' foreheads.

146
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,419
Forehead flicking?

147
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,250
Yes.

148
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,000
♫ One more hugging practice until perfection is achieved;
A little bit ♫

149
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,219
Like this.

150
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,019
Good idea!

151
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:00,719
Okay. Well, Wen Yan, you go first.

152
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,378
Hurry up. Come.

153
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,699
- Go.
- Come.

154
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:06,118
Mo Xiao, give him some space. Come now.

155
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,099
That's a miss.

156
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,339
Get lost.

157
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,499
Hai Die. Come.

158
00:11:13,499 --> 00:11:16,799
Hai Die, good luck.

159
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,519
Aim for it.

160
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,500
Yes, there.

161
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:23,779
It's too difficult.

162
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,039
Mo Xiao, good luck.

163
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,499
Mo Xiao won!

164
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:34,138
Come flick Prince of Bo's forehead.

165
00:11:34,138 --> 00:11:35,738
What? I won.

166
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:38,119
Go, Mo Xiao.

167
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:40,678
Master, it's the rule of the game.

168
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:43,300
Just admit defeat.

169
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:50,739
Does it hurt?

170
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,879
You show good sportsmanship.

171
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,980
Wait.

172
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,278
Where's Ma Jing?

173
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,079
When she learned that you were rearranging the flower garden,

174
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,560
she went to the market to buy some flower pots.

175
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:02,959
She should be back soon.

176
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,319
I'm going to give her a surprise.

177
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,161
I can't let her see what Bo Royal Mansion looks like.

178
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:09,778
Carry on with the game. I'll wait for her out there.

179
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:12,018
- Hurry back.
- Flick the losers' foreheads!

180
00:12:12,018 --> 00:12:13,359
Go ahead.

181
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:16,620
Prince of Bo, here's the thing, this...

182
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,940
Master.

183
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,260
You're the one who told us to forget about ranks.

184
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,818
Come! Let's have a match!

185
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,599
Hai Die, set the pot.

186
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,159
What should I do when Ma Jing comes back?

187
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,039
I'll just blindfold her.

188
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,179
That'll do.

189
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,100
Physician Yao Ji?

190
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,600
Greetings, Young Feudal Mistress.

191
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,919
I was just ordered to take over the Grand Diviner Palace.

192
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:22,059
I am here to visit Prince of Bo.

193
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,019
You came at the right time.

194
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,400
I'm sure you haven't seen such a Bo Mansion.

195
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,220
Come on in, please.

196
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,959
His Majesty doesn't like plants.

197
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,599
At first, I just wanted to persuade him to let me plant my favorite usnea.

198
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:50,199
I never thought he'd change the face of the entire mansion.

199
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,680
Physician Yao Ji, isn't he very different from the Prince of Bo that you used to know?

200
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,140
They're just flowers.

201
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,300
It's nothing.

202
00:14:05,739 --> 00:14:08,279
I'll show something more exciting.

203
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,060
- Goal!
- Goal!

204
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,799
- Finally, a goal!
- Come here!

205
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,999
Defeat comes from arrogance. Serves you right!

206
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:16,978
- Flick his forehead!
- Master.

207
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:18,738
- Flick his forehead!
- Flick his forehead!
- Master, please...

208
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,660
Flick his forehead.

209
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,879
That hurts a lot!

210
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,798
Come! Let's carry on!

211
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,178
- Physician Yao Ji.
- I'll go first.

212
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:31,700
Do you think His Highness has really changed?

213
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,239
Goal!

214
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,199
Watch me. You just wait and see.

215
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,478
Just wait and see.

216
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,918
This will be a goal.

217
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,499
You seem to be enjoying yourself, Your Highness.

218
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:08,160
Don't you two know each other?

219
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,919
Why don't you greet each other?

220
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,900
Not just Prince of Bo,

221
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,219
but also Wen Yan, Hai Die, and Mo Xiao.

222
00:15:17,219 --> 00:15:19,579
We know each other very well.

223
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,199
I just took over the Grand Diviner Palace

224
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,380
and decided to pay you a special visit. Greetings, Your Highness.

225
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:39,460
Your Highness, why are you ignoring her?

226
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:43,718
Is it because of that small grievance?

227
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:46,120
Haven't you let go?

228
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,500
What did she say to you?

229
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:53,700
Nothing.

230
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,918
She just said that you're not on good terms due to the fight for the position of Night Fiends head.

231
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,559
She just said that you're not on good terms due to the fight for the position of Night Fiends head.

232
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,798
There's indeed a small grievance between you.

233
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,300
But now that it's been resolved, it's fine now.

234
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,540
You're right, Young Mistress.

235
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:12,719
There's no unresolvable grievance between Prince of Bo and me.

236
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:17,580
Moreover, I once made an effort

237
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,220
to treat your illness, Young Mistress.

238
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,719
I'm very busy.

239
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:29,039
Why are you here, Physician Yao Ji?

240
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,820
I will be hosting this year's Slaughter ﻿Banquet.

241
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,659
Your Highness became famous when you organized it last year.

242
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,980
Princess Consort Bo should learn a thing or two about it.

243
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,058
I received the imperial decree to invite Young Feudal Mistress Ma

244
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:45,620
to join the event with me.

245
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,679
Young Mistress, please come with me.

246
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:51,360
Now?

247
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:53,559
Please.

248
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,138
His Majesty will prepare ten sets of top-notch horse meat.

249
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:11,759
The prisoners in the dungeon will celebrate with us.

250
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,460
Today, you will choose the prisoners who will serve the meat. Is that okay?

251
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,580
Sure.

252
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,200
Him.

253
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,480
And him.

254
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,280
Whoever you choose will be executed.

255
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,720
One year ago, the one that Prince of Bo personally executed was

256
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,400
Lord Duan Yanyu.

257
00:19:07,219 --> 00:19:11,599
Is Wolf Boy long gone?

258
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,540
It's me.

259
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,220
Who are you?

260
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,319
Do I still know you?

261
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,520
As Prince of Bo, you're destined to be bound by duty.

262
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,299
I can't expect you to stop being the third prince.

263
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,359
I can't force you to turn back into Wolf Boy.

264
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,180
Can we still daydream of leaving all this behind

265
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:27,259
and turn back into the most innocent Xing'er and Wolf Boy?

266
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:31,939
You're Xing'er.

267
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,120
I'm Wolf Boy.

268
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,880
But we're also Prince of Bo and Princess Consort of Bo.

269
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,259
I'm the one who wished you'd turn back into Wolf Boy.

270
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,439
That's very selfish of me.

271
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,880
We won't be beaten down by this small matter.

272
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,680
Now, I just need some time to accept your world.

273
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,979
No matter how repulsed you feel...

274
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,019
remember to eat.

275
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:14,358
I have some military affairs to attend to tomorrow; hence, will be away for a while.

276
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:17,680
You have a few days to calm yourself down.

277
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,400
Remember, take good care of yourself.

278
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,580
Master.

279
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,380
What is it?

280
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,039
His father has woken up.

281
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:39,380
Zi Shen, the palace is quite clean, well done.

282
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,958
Your Honor, I found out that Prince of Bo and his underling Mo Xiao left the mansion in the middle of the night.

283
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:48,766
They're suspicious.
[Zi Shen, Yao Ji's valet]

284
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,019
It's you?

285
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,338
Who are you?

286
00:23:05,338 --> 00:23:08,760
Why did you save us from the fire?

287
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,419
At daybreak,

288
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:16,359
leave at once.

289
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,040
And don't ever come back again.

290
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,339
I never made any enemies.

291
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,019
Who?

292
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:28,379
Who is trying to kill us?

293
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:30,839
Could it be...

294
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,720
Could it be that scary man called Wolf Boy?

295
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,900
He wants to kill and save us?

296
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,839
Do you want to take the truth to your grave?

297
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,540
Or forget everything

298
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,839
and live a good life with your daughter?

299
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:54,099
Be smart.

300
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,039
Forget everything.

301
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,900
And don't ever come back again.

302
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,840
If you keep trying to get to the bottom of it,

303
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,079
you and your daughter will definitely die.

304
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,060
Leave...

305
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
We will leave!

306
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,699
From now on, we have nothing to do with what happened!

307
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:16,480
Very good.

308
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,559
Master, it's all settled.

309
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:37,499
If you hadn't found out that I was trying to save them,

310
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,040
I wouldn't have gotten you into this.

311
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,258
In order to avoid the Ma Army from having suspicions about the Ma Mansion massacre,

312
00:24:56,258 --> 00:24:58,919
His Majesty once ordered Prince of Bo to lead the Night Fiends and get rid of him.

313
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:01,419
Surprisingly, Prince of Bo secretly spared his life.

314
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:05,640
Master, Prince of Bo has truly changed.

315
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,940
No.

316
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,260
Prince of Bo has become disloyal to His Majesty because of Ma Zhaixing.

317
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,999
He probably saw through your test last time.

318
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,240
That's why he showed indifference.

319
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,800
He not only changed himself for her,

320
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,100
but also tried to deceive everyone

321
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,479
and get himself killed.

322
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:30,780
I will not allow him to keep making mistakes

323
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,800
and dig his own grave.

324
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,779
- The one back there, you'll take this.
- Yes.

325
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:38,919
Move it over there and return with some small ones.

326
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,079
Do you hear me?

327
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,718
Here, hurry up. Be careful.

328
00:25:41,718 --> 00:25:44,879
These flowers are His Highness's gifts to Young Feudal Mistress.

329
00:25:44,879 --> 00:25:46,198
You over here, hurry up, too.

330
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:47,419
- Hurry up and water the plants.
- Yes.

331
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:49,539
Be careful. Don't drop it.

332
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,178
Here, move it here. Hurry up!

333
00:25:51,178 --> 00:25:52,639
Over here.

334
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,300
Young Feudal Mistress.

335
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:58,139
Mo Xiao,

336
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:01,679
change it back to before and stop planting.

337
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,960
Young Mistress, but before Master went out of the city to marshal the troops,

338
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,979
he kept reminding that he wants to see

339
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:12,119
a transformed Bo Royal Mansion when he returns after half a month.

340
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:14,219
His Highness is bound by duty.

341
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:18,839
We seem to be doing all this to force him to turn back into Wolf Boy

342
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:20,940
and put more pressure on him.

343
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,760
We shouldn't be doing so.

344
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,718
But Master truly wants to change.

345
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:28,619
You are the one who should change your mindset, Young Feudal Mistress.

346
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,399
Grand Diviner, instead of staying in your palace,

347
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,219
why are you here?

348
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,139
I came to see Young Feudal Mistress.

349
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:43,459
His Majesty heard that you and Prince of Bo

350
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:46,720
had a fight because of the Slaughter Banquet.

351
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,739
He thought we could talk, woman to woman.

352
00:26:49,739 --> 00:26:53,020
He ordered me to try to placate you first

353
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,920
after Prince of Bo left the mansion.

354
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,358
It's our family affair.

355
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,579
His Majesty and Grand Diviner need not worry.

356
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:02,558
Grand Diviner Yao Ji, how kind of you.

357
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,860
I'm truly astonished at this abnormal act of yours.

358
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:12,259
I'm not that idle.

359
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:16,578
Nor am I interested in meddling in the private affairs between Prince of Bo and Young Feudal Mistress.

360
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:22,539
It's just that I received His Majesty's order and I must obey it.

361
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,880
If Young Mistress will be willing to go to a place with me,

362
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,499
perhaps it could avoid the deepening misunderstanding between you and Prince of Bo.

363
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:36,540
Or does Your Highness have no intention to do so?

364
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,480
If you refuse to go,

365
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,320
I will not be able to report back to His Majesty.

366
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,600
Fine. I'll go with you.

367
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,480
Young Mistress.

368
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Mo Xiao, if you're worried about her safety,

369
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,958
you may come along.

370
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:03,099
This way please, Young Mistress.

371
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,319
[Duan Mansion]

372
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:53,840
This old woman is Lord Duan's mother.

373
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,760
Mo Xiao, you, too, knew that Lord Duan's parents stay here?

374
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,640
When Lord Duan went into prison, he only had a mother left behind.

375
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,639
Master found out that Madam Duan was old.

376
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,380
She's blind, hard of hearing, and suffers many illnesses.

377
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,500
She's got only a few years left,

378
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,959
so His Highness let her stay here.

379
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,780
Uncle Duan always said that he was all alone.

380
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:34,020
I never thought that he had an old mother here.

381
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:40,419
That wasn't all that Prince of Bo did, right?

382
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:44,659
Young Mistress,

383
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,020
after Lord Duan died,

384
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,519
Prince of Bo secretly ordered Wen Yan to prepare medicines

385
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,399
and send them to the Duan Mansion every month,

386
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,360
because he couldn't bear to see her fend for herself.

387
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:59,679
Prince of Bo shouldn't have been that sentimental.

388
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,959
Are you happy now, Young Mistress?

389
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:07,760
Even though he's not the Wolf Boy in your eyes,

390
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,359
he's not worthless.

391
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,359
Young Mistress, actually...

392
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,640
actually, Master may just seem cruel.

393
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,280
Please give him some time

394
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,640
and get to know more about him.

395
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,999
After all...

396
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:31,239
After all, it's sad to be misunderstood.

397
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:33,979
It's like when people found you

398
00:30:33,979 --> 00:30:36,721
very cruel when you chased Wolf Boy away.

399
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:38,700
Were you happy about that?

400
00:30:39,719 --> 00:30:44,419
Enough! I don't want to hear about your family affairs.

401
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,078
I have done my job here.

402
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,159
It's time to head back to the palace and report back.

403
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm taking my leave.

404
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,419
Even the execution of State Stabilizing Marquis was because he was corrupt and wicked.

405
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:06,800
Prince of Bo has always been kind-hearted.

406
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,860
Let me take care of Madam Duan.

407
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,679
Who are you?

408
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,979
My father, Ma Ying, was Lord Duan's old friend.

409
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,318
You are Young Feudal Mistress Zhaixing.

410
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,659
Master told me about you and General Ma.

411
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,139
Young Mistress, you have stopped blaming Master?

412
00:31:55,139 --> 00:31:57,179
I never blamed him.

413
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,939
I shouldn't just think about Wolf Boy.

414
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:02,360
I should also see the good in Prince of Bo.

415
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:07,080
Surprisingly, Yao Ji has done a good thing.

416
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:13,740
My Lord, we don't have enough food for today

417
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,598
and it's not convenient for me to go out

418
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:18,880
because I'm brewing medicine.

419
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,639
Could you go to the market for me?

420
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,119
I'm afraid I won't able to do so.

421
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,879
Why not?

422
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:28,558
Mo Xiao, hurry back.

423
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,760
Don't let them be hungry.

424
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,739
Yes, Young Mistress.

425
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,780
Young Feudal Mistress!

426
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,580
What is this?

427
00:32:54,479 --> 00:32:56,400
Ever since Lord Duan went into prison,

428
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,039
many ministers who were close to him have stopped visiting us

429
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,219
and they avoid us at all cost.

430
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:08,700
You are the only one who has visited us.

431
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:11,979
Please get up now.

432
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:13,859
Get up now.

433
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,039
Here.

434
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:22,478
I'm glad that Lord Duan trusted the right person.

435
00:33:22,479 --> 00:33:26,519
He was right to treat you sincerely.

436
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,159
Also, before Lord Duan went into prison,

437
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,919
he knew he'd probably be executed, so he gave me this letter

438
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:41,519
and told me that I must give it to you in the future when given the chance.

439
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,879
Is that why you sent Mo Xiao away on purpose?

440
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,780
This is a serious matter.

441
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,198
I was left with no choice.

442
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:53,900
Only you can read it.

443
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,200
How outrageous.

444
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,359
I need to go at once.

445

[Duan Mansion]

446
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,799
Old Lady, where is Young Feudal Mistress?

447
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,059
I don't know.

448
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:40,420
She said she needs to leave due to some urgent matters.

449
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,880
She has left?

450
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,199
She left without saying anything?

451
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:47,399
She would never do that.

452
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:49,659
Could it be that something happened?

453
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Hai Die!

454
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,399
Is Young Feudal Mistress back?

455
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,399
I haven't seen her since this morning.

456
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,598
Oh no!

457
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:05,919
Did something bad happen to her?

458
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,520
What's wrong?

459
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,140
Master!

460
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,239
What's happened?

461
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,940
Why are you back?

462
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:13,838
They changed the date for marshaling.

463
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,499
Emperor Father summoned me back.

464
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:16,940
What's happened?

465
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,099
Where's Zhaixing?

466
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:22,758
Master, it seems to be Yao Ji's mischievous plot while you were out of the city.

467
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,439
She came to see Young Feudal Mistress early this morning.

468
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,739
She said she was decreed by His Majesty to help you two reconcile.

469
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:30,358
Oh right! She took Young Mistress to visit Madam Duan

470
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:32,219
and I went along.

471
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,819
After that, I was ordered to buy some items.

472
00:35:35,819 --> 00:35:38,480
When I returned, Young Mistress was gone.

473
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,960
Emperor Father didn't mention it during the morning assembly.

474
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:46,019
It must be Yao Ji's trick.

475
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,840
It was careless of me to underestimate the enemy.

476
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:51,698
I'll head to the Grand Diviner Palace at once.

477
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,480
Mo Xiao. Wen Yan.

478
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,059
Get the men to search for Zhaixing within Imperial City.

479
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,579
Hai Die, you'll stay here and wait for updates.

480
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,319
Yes, Master.

481
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:15,978
- Zhaixing!
- Don't be reckless.

482
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,640
You know what will happen if you take one more step forward.

483
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,540
I can kill her at any time.

484
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,800
Don't you dare touch her,

485
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,279
or I will not spare you!

486
00:36:28,739 --> 00:36:31,119
You've become soft for her.

487
00:36:31,699 --> 00:36:33,799
Shut up!

488
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,680
Wolfbone Flower?

489
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:49,019
Yes, you guessed it right.

490
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:58,038
You used to shun flowers

491
00:36:58,039 --> 00:36:59,758
and you disliked it the most.

492
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:03,479
That's why there are no flowers in your room.

493
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:07,740
But you were too anxious to save her today that you let your guard down.

494
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,898
You fell off the cliff, got seriously injured, and lost your consciousness.

495
00:37:12,898 --> 00:37:16,780
In order to save you, His Majesty made you take the medicine.

496
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,720
But that medicine has left its side effects on your body.

497
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,319
It weakened your body that you might die at any moment.

498
00:37:26,659 --> 00:37:28,499
At that time,

499
00:37:28,499 --> 00:37:31,060
you should know well

500
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:35,660
that you can't fall in love with a normal girl in this world.

501
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,520
Once the pain makes you lose your mind,

502
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,039
you will hurt anyone.

503
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,800
I intentionally used the Wolfbane Flower against you

504
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,680
to make you see yourself more clearly.

505
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,780
What a pity.

506
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,160
She's not Ma Zhaixing.

507
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,599
She's Hong'er whom I've killed.

508
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,359
You captured her and her father?

509
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,258
Where is Mr. Fang?

510
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:20,059
He's dead.

511
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:26,020
I know that you asked Mo Xiao to release them that night.

512
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,940
In order to stop you from making a grave mistake,

513
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,899
I helped you kill them.

514
00:38:32,899 --> 00:38:35,099
Where is Xing'er?

515
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:36,859
She's safe and sound.

516
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:38,358
I can return her to you at any time.

517
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:40,619
What do you really want?

518
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,560
If you still can't get over the fact that I defeated you,

519
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:48,380
you can tell on me for not executing Hong'er!

520
00:38:49,219 --> 00:38:51,319
You are wrong.

521
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:57,059
The opponent I want to contend against is not such a useless Prince of Bo.

522
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,700
I want you to turn back into that Prince of Bo whom I like.

523
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,840
That's why I made Hong'er's body look like Ma Zhaixing to lure you here.

524
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,498
If His Majesty finds out that Mo Xiao and you protected Hong'er and her father,

525
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:14,960
what will happen to him?

526
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,319
What about the other Night Fiends members?

527
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,079
You are the most foolish.

528
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:25,458
You are digging your own grave and trying to get the Night Fiends killed

529
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:28,220
because of a woman you shouldn't love.

530
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,418
What do you want?

531
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:31,979
I want you to be the past Prince of Bo.

532
00:39:31,979 --> 00:39:36,780
To do so, Ma Zhaixing must die.

533
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:39,359
Give Zhaixing back to me,

534
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,939
and I will do as you say.

535
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,559
It is too late.

536
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,180
She is heading towards death now.

537
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:14,660
His Majesty! I have a petition to make!

538
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,580
Ma Zhaixing, you belong to the Bo Royal Mansion.

539
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,879
Prince of Bo was ordered to leave the city,

540
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,399
but I have summoned him back not long ago.

541
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:29,280
Shouldn't he be here to make the petition with you?

542
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,518
This is a serious matter.

543
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,660
I cannot wait any longer.

544
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,760
I'm afraid you will not be happy to know what happened and who were involved in it.

545
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,639
His Highness would have stopped me from making this petition.

546
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,539
Get up and tell me.

547
00:40:42,539 --> 00:40:44,380
Thank you, Your Majesty.

548
00:40:46,676 --> 00:40:48,159
What is the urgent matter?

549
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,558
Go ahead and tell me about it.

550
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,939
I would like to request Your Majesty to reopen the case of Ma Mansion.

551
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:56,938
What did you say?

552
00:40:56,938 --> 00:41:00,258
Among my father's letters that I brought with me from the Ma Mansion,

553
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:03,980
there is a letter that the late Lord Duan wrote to him.

554
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,078
Hand it to me.

555
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,259
Yes, Your Majesty.

556
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:24,199
Lord Duan said in the letter that, more than a year ago,

557
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,800
Second Prince and Prime Minister Jing were gathering allies to try to seize their right to the throne.

558
00:41:28,839 --> 00:41:30,199
Father, who found out about it,

559
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,940
along with several ministers reproached him.

560
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,738
Second Prince got so mad

561
00:41:34,738 --> 00:41:37,399
and secretly swore to get rid of them.

562
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:39,119
And not long after that,

563
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,218
several ministers were told off. All of them were suspected of treason

564
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:44,859
and sentenced by Your Majesty.

565
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:46,960
Lord Duan got more suspicious

566
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,399
that Second Prince and the Jin Army colluded

567
00:41:50,399 --> 00:41:53,079
to kill my father.

568
00:41:54,259 --> 00:42:00,059
So you think Prince of Yun is the mastermind?

569
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,320
Outrageous.

570
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,880
Duan Yanyu said that to mislead people.

571
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,119
Do you actually buy into it?

572
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,478
Your Majesty, Lord Duan said that Father was involved in border security all year round.

573
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:12,698
He was away most of the time.

574
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:15,758
Sometimes, he only came home after a year or more.

575
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:18,558
But leaving your post and returning home must be decreed.

576
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,840
Without a high ranking man as the spy,

577
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,519
how could the murderer's timing be so accurate?
