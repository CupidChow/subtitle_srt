[Episode 7]

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,020
Y-You... mocked His Highness!

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,600
I will devotedly wait for the Fourth Prince to come back.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,340
Farewell.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,600
I won't be sending you off.

25
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,860
Minister, Second Prince's biological mother,

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,700
when she was with His Majesty, she was really involved with another man?

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,420
It was a house servant who revealed it, right before his death.

28
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,980
Half a year before His Majesty had granted Second Prince's biological mother His Grace.

29
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,520
Her relationship with a Bozhou Army cook was not ordinary.

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,960
Coincidentally, His Second Highness was premature by half a month.

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,310
However, the implication is significant.

32
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,570
Without concrete evidence, no one dares to mention this issue, for fear of angering His Majesty.

33
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,030
Yes.

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:29,320
But I have already found out that the majority of the previous Bozhou militiamen have become court slaves in the capital.

35
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,300
Within a few days, I will definitely find out who that army cook was.

36
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,670
Be quick about it!

37
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,900
Currently, the court slaves in the capital are assigned to Jingxiang's subordinates. You need to be careful.

38
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,820
Yes.

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:45,840
Once we find that Bozhou Army cook, His Second Highness's bloodline will be tainted.

40
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,670
Hurry and eat the rations. We have to get moving afterward. Hurry!

Brother, stop looking.

44
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,080
It's unlikely for us to get back to the capital.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,990
Most likely, we'll die inside this slave camp.

46
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,210
Death is nothing to be feared, but I have one unfulfilled wish.

47
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,980
I must escape.

48
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,820
General! General!

49
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,350
General, a Bozhou slave ran off.

50
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,270
What? One escaped?

51
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,120
Brothers, stop eating! Hurry and search!

52
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,090
- Where did he go?
- It looks like he went in the direction of the capital!

53
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,040
Hurry and chase after him! If Lord Jingxiang finds out, we'll all be in trouble.

54
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,690
Hurry!

[Prince of Bo Estate]

Emperor Father has mandated, starting tomorrow,

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,490
Ma Zhaixing will live on the estate as the Princess Consort of Bo.

58
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,300
Princess Consort?

59
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,790
Master, Ma Zhaixing?

60
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,900
Do you know any other Ma Zhaixing?

61
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,190
Master, could it be that His Majesty wants us to find a reason to silence her within the manor,

62
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,150
so that there will be no loopholes left when Ma Zhaixing dies?

63
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,580
Yes, that's reasonable.

64
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,310
Shut up!

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:43,680
I'm saying it once more. Starting tomorrow, Ma Zhaixing will be the Princess Consort of Bo.

66
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,750
You must treat her with courtesy. Do not expose any flaws.

67
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,480
- Yes.
- Yes, Master.

68
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,240
What are you doing?

69
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,610
Princess, you're awake.

70
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,000
Princess, may I ask you

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,550
what you did last night?

72
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,440
Don't tell me that you forgot everything!

73
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,980
You even fell into the pond!

74
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,970
Did I stumble after drinking?

75
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,430
I'm afraid it's not just that.

76
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,130
Feudal Young Mistress, soon after you left,

77
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,260
the Prince of Bo followed.

78
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,670
Before you fell, you were together, too,

79
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:53,690
because you were also wearing the Prince of Bo's cloak.

80
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,570
But after you stumbled and fell into the pond,

81
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,210
Prince of Bo didn't even turn around and just left.

82
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,420
The reason for this, I'm guessing...

83
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,500
is that the Prince of Bo wanted to treat you with courtesy last night,

84
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,320
but you got drunk.

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,230
Toward Prince Bo, you might've done some...

86
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,090
offensive actions.

87
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,080
For example?

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,170
For example, you treated the Prince of Bo like Wolf Boy or something.

89
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,350
Is that for real?

90
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,960
Really.

91
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,070
How could I do such a thing?

92
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,380
His Majesty just bestowed the marriage and I've already given the Prince of Bo such a bad impression.

93
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,200
How am I supposed to live out my future days?

94
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,190
Feudal Young Mistress.

95
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,840
Brother!

96
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,290
I was incompetent. In my recklessness, I offended the Imperial Court

97
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,500
and let you sacrifice your marriage matter.

98
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,780
Brother Feng Cheng, don't overthink.

99
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,110
Prince of Bo is an imperial prince.

100
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,510
I don't feel wronged by being married to him.

101
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,070
Rather, it is a good thing. From now on, His Majesty will not question the Ma Army's loyalty.

102
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,290
Young Mistress, you are just like the Feudal Lord, humble and kindhearted.

103
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:40,070
Young Mistress, I know that you agreed to this marriage with the Ma Army in mind.

104
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,300
If Prince of Bo is truly eccentric and unbearable,

105
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,340
this vassal will stop this marriage even if it angers His Majesty.

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,570
- Ma Jing.
- Yes!

107
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,910
From now on, you have to stay by the Young Mistress's side and take care of her.

108
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,440
Remember to not let her feel wronged at all.

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,500
If a situation like that happens

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,340
then I'll come back to the capital, even in the middle of the night, when I receive your letter.

111
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,220
I obey! I will definitely take good care of Feudal Young Mistress!

112
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,220
I won't let anyone bully her, including the Prince of Bo!

113
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,590
There's no need to be so serious.

114
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,390
You two haven't heard the saying, “Jiangmen hunǚ"?
(T/N: basically means military family daughters are tigresses)

115
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,270
Maybe after Prince Bo marries

116
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,620
this tigress, he'll be the unlucky one.

117
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,470
Feudal Young Mistress!

118
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,180
Reporting to the Young Mistress, the Prince of Bo's carriage is already at the door waiting.

119
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,800
Master, the Feudal Young Mistress has been waiting at the Palace's West Gate for almost two hours.

120
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,490
I don't want to travel with her. Send her back to the manor first.

121
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,170
Master—

122
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:31,160
Feudal Young Mistress, we've waited two hours already.

123
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,620
How come the Prince of Bo still isn't here?

124
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,830
Young Mistress!

125
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,170
Don't be afraid.

126
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,810
Did you see that I'm wearing almost the same clothes as you?

127
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,350
We're not going to let him be able tell the difference between us.

128
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,050
If he's still mad when you meet him,

129
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,500
then let him vent all his anger on me, all right?

130
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,690
Thanks for your worry.

131
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,350
His Majesty must have something important to be seeking an audience with the Prince of Bo.

132
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:15,130
Besides, I was rude yesterday. No matter how long, I should wait.

133
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:22,430
Young Mistress, are you certain you can get along with Prince Bo?

134
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,040
How come I feel a bit worried about the future?

135
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:32,190
But yesterday on the way back to the capital, His Highness was quite nice to me.

136
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,400
Then, can you tell me how come he changed?

137
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,900
Could it be that he's the same as in the legend?

138
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:48,090
A suspicious natural disposition, unpredictable, and capricious, difficult to understand.

139
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,210
Has he made such a bad impression on others?

140
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,910
Feudal Young Mistress!

141
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,900
What's wrong with you!

142
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,130
Can't you call in a softer tone? It's easy for you to scare someone to death like that.

143
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,800
What were you two doing that you were so focused?

144
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,070
We were not doing anything! It was nothing!

145
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,000
We were just bored so we were storytelling to pass the time.

146
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,560
Ah, right! Where is the Prince of Bo? Why has he not come to escort Feudal Young Mistress back to his royal manor?

147
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,650
His Highness still has official business to attend to.

148
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,870
He was not deliberately leaving Feudal Young Mistress here alone.

149
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,050
He specially dispatched me to send Feudal Young Mistress back to the manor to settle down first.

150
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,100
If he had official business to attend to, why did he not say so earlier?

151
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,440
Do you not see how strong the sun is?

152
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,780
I am now tanned and sunburned!

153
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,680
And look here, this is your Bo Royal Manor's future Princess Consort!

154
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,690
Your Prince of Bo did not personally come to get her.

155
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,320
- How would that sound if word got out about this? You—
- Then, I'll have to trouble you!

156
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,670
Sorry to trouble you.

157
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,810
[Yun Royal Manor]

158
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,250
Father?

159
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,430
Your Highness!

160
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,420
Chuchu, how are you feeling?

161
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,270
Is the pregnancy going smoothly?

162
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,650
Everything is fine.
[Jing Chuchu - Princess Consort of Yun]

163
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,330
The Imperial Physician said, in order to have a smooth birth, I should walk around more.

164
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,560
Very good. Very good!

165
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,310
Your Highness, the wedding gift to congratulate the Prince of Bo

166
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,370
has already been prepared.

167
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,250
Many thanks for your trouble, Father-in-Law.

168
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,890
Chuchu, since the doctor has said that you need to walk around more,

169
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,560
how about accompanying me to Third Brother's manor tomorrow?

170
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,410
Princess Consort of Bo, the Feudal Young Mistress Ma,

171
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,560
you'll be able to meet her and get to know her. How does that sound?

172
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,300
It sounds excellent.

173
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,120
I heard that Feudal Young Mistress Ma experienced the misfortune of her entire family being brutally murdered.

174
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,040
She has also come to the capital for the first time, totally unfamiliar with the place and the people.

175
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,770
I have wanted to go see her since a long time ago.

176
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,890
Since this is my first time going to the Bo Royal Manor, I should buy gifts for the Prince of Bo and the others

177
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,280
as an apology for last night.

178
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Tell me. What should we buy?

179
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,360
I think the Prince of Bo will probably like... lanterns!

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,650
And also a piece of flatbread!

181
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,280
That... Who is the person who actually likes those?

182
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,460
Of course, the Prince of Bo likes those!

183
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,600
Beat him! Beat him!

184
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,790
- Hit him!
- Beat him!

185
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,580
- A kid without a father deserves to be hit!
- Beat him!

186
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,430
- Hit him!
- Tell your father to come!

187
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,030
- What are you all doing?
- A child without a father! Hold him!

188
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,230
- What are you doing?
- Hit him!

189
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,190
Stinky beggar! Stop meddling! Get out of the way!

190
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,890
- You are just asking to be beaten! Beat him!
- Beat him!

191
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,850
Mo Xiao, what does His Highness like?

192
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,780
Practicing martial arts and writing.

193
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,940
- Practicing martial arts and writing?
- These are good! These are fresh!

194
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,560
- Stop hitting me!
- Stinky beggar! You are asking to be hit!

195
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,850
Stop hitting me!

196
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,930
- So meddlesome! Hit him! Hit him to death!
- Stop! Stop hitting!

197
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,220
Stop hitting!

198
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,020
Stop! Stop hitting him!

199
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,820
- Hurry up and stop!
- So meddleso— Run!

200
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,540
Uncle, are you all right?

201
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,390
Uncle!

202
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,780
Child, are you injured?

203
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,820
I am fine.

204
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,250
Quickly return home. Otherwise, your mother will be worried.

205
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,320
I understand.

206
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,540
Uncle! Uncle!

207
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,680
- Feudal Young Mistress!
-  Uncle, are you all right?

208
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,480
- Feudal Young Mistress!
- Uncle!

209
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,450
Feudal Young Mistress, what should we do?

210
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,430
If we leave him alone, in this condition, it will be very dangerous for him.

211
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,140
- Let's take him back to the Royal Manor for medical treatment!
- You must not!

212
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,860
Feudal Young Mistress, this man is of unknown origin. I fear that is inappropriate.

213
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,350
Doing this will break the Bo Royal Manor's house rules!

214
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,230
In Kuizhou City, medically treating the common people was considered a homely meal. (T/N: Meaning a common occurrence)

215
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:32,990
It does not matter who he is. Besides, Bo Royal Manor is quite near here.

216
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,690
I do not believe His Highness would just let his citizens remain injured without any medical treatment!

217
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,230
Bo Royal Manor's image cannot continue being defaced like this!

218
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,720
Ma Jing, help hold him up for me.

219
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,210
Mo Xiao, search him first.

220
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,030
Once you have verified, even if he is of unknown origin,

221
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,440
he temporarily will not be able to affect the safety of Bo Royal Manor.

222
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,380
Afterward, carry him back to Bo Royal Manor as fast as possible for medical treatment.

223
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,250
A person who was supposed to be killed along with her family has become the Princess Consort of Bo.

224
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,380
Is there anything in this world that is more outrageous than that?

225
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,740
Master is too pitiful.

226
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,580
She has arrived.

227
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,420
You must remember Master's instructions. We have to treat the Feudal Young Mistress with courtesy and keep our distance.

228
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,530
We cannot have too many conversations or interactions with her.

229
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,080
Secretly monitor the Feudal Young Mistress's every move.

230
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,080
You should tell that to that idiot, Mo Xiao.

231
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,550
Wen Yan! Hurry, hurry and save this man!

232
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,550
Be careful!

233
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,430
Take it slow. Take it slow!

234
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,270
Take it slow. Take it slow!

235
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,490
Wen Yan!

236
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,800
Where did that person come from?

237
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,480
A beggar from the side of the road, suffering from hunger and cold, plus has a body full of disease.

238
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,910
Feudal Young Mistress took pity on him and brought him home.

239
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,270
She said she was helping our Bo Royal Manor change its image.

240
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,270
How is he?

241
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,060
Feudal Young Mistress, this person is currently not in a serious condition.

242
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,340
If he recuperates for a while and drinks a few healing concoctions, he will be fine.

243
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,680
It is my first time coming here and I have troubled everyone like this.

244
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,610
I acted willfully.

245
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,610
When Uncle has gotten better, I will ask him to leave.

246
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,240
If the Prince of Bo wants to blame someone, I will take full responsibility.

247
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,250
Mo Xiao will keep watch here. Our main priority is to let Feudal Young Mistress settle down first.

248
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,970
Feudal Young Mistress, this is Hai Die.

249
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,030
She is responsible for arranging your living quarters and showing you around the Bo Royal Manor.

250
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,220
Feudal Young Mistress, please come with me.

251
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,560
I am Ma Jing.

252
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,960
How come it is so dull? There is not even a servant around!

253
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,680
Feudal Young Mistress, there is not even a single flower here either.

254
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,910
Could it really be like they say it is, that under here is that—

255
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,870
His Highness does not like flowers. He thinks they are vulgar and unbearable.

256
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,750
This is my first time seeing a courtyard with no flowers.

257
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,730
I think His Highness probably likes a clean and simple arrangement.

258
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,420
It is quiet and can calm people's minds.

259
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,090
Feudal Young Mistress, this way, please.

260
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,960
What is that place over there?

261
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,400
That courtyard over there is the Prince of Bo's living quarters.

262
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,160
Without his permission, no one is allowed to enter. It is a forbidden place in Bo Royal Manor.

263
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,240
Forbidden place?

264
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,360
Feudal Young Mistress, your wing is upfront. Please come this way.

265
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,520
[Yun Royal Manor]

266
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,080
Prime Minister, please wait a minute!

267
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,510
My Lord, an urgent report has just arrived.

268
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,740
Among the slaves being escorted from the capital to the fortification at the border, one has escaped!

269
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,490
A trivial matter like that does not need to be reported to me.

270
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,780
This... I originally was not going to disturb My Lord;

271
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,460
however, when the officers and soldiers tortured confessions out of the others, a slave confessed that the fugitive

272
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,480
once let slip after getting drunk that his son was the current Second Prince

273
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,430
and that he wanted to enter the capital to meet him before he died.

274
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,130
After investigating, I discovered that this person's name is Lin Guang.

275
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,440
Several decades ago, he was once an army cook for the imperial concubine who was from Bozhou.

276
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,670
In addition, he also knew that

277
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,210
on the imperial concubine's left calf, there was a scar the length of a forefinger.

278
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,540
Immediately dispatch someone

279
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,320
to silence all of the people who may be aware of this.

280
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,900
Find that army cook as fast as possible!

281
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,330
Yes, Prime Minister.

282
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,070
Hurry and put the bags down.

283
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,950
You must be exhausted.

284
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,570
Ah, right! Feudal Young Mistress, look!

285
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,190
This is the cloth bundle you asked someone to bring here from Kuizhou City.

286
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,130
Inside are your clothes and also your fine and delicate valuables.

287
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,790
Here. Take a look to see whether this is it or not.

288
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,640
Is this it?

289
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,360
It is so beautiful!

290
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,310
Who drew your picture? It is so pretty!

291
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,650
This is my mother.

292
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,530
That is not you?

293
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,240
How come she looks exactly like you?

294
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,290
- Quickly help me pack it back up.
- Sure.

295
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,110
Fortunately, it is still here.

296
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,750
What is that? It seems very important to you.

297
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:23,510
Princess, don't you feel that the Manor of Prince Bo is really spooky?!

298
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:29,180
Also, what's locked up inside that prohibited area?

299
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,410
Since it is a prohibited place, there must be some hidden secret.

300
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,110
Moreover, the Prince of Bo is a cold and ruthless person.

301
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,490
He is extremely cruel and merciless when handling things.

302
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,260
So, Feudal Young Mistress likes to create rumors viciously and sow discord behind people's back.

303
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,330
I came here personally just to hear your explanation about saving a man without my permission.

304
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,600
I didn't mean to break any rules. I apologize.

305
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,240
No need.

306
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,220
I am not surprised by your odd behavior.

307
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,620
My drunken behavior last night was truly disgraceful.

308
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,880
You also acted without authority.

309
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,770
You took in the beggar without permission and disregarded the strict rules of the manor.

310
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:20,040
Your Highness, the man was beaten up just because he wanted to save a child.

311
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,480
He was badly injured and passed out on the street.

312
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,700
Feudal Young Mistress has always been a kind person.

313
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,290
We cannot just shut our eyes to people who are dying, right?

314
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:34,190
Would a kindhearted person criticize their husband behind his back, disregard manners,

315
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:37,700
and treat the royal manor like Kuizhou City, just randomly ordering people around?

316
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:40,470
You've set foot in here for less than a day.

317
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,960
Feudal Young Mistress Ma, did you think you were already the mistress of Prince Bo Manor?!

318
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,200
I acted improperly in taking the liberty to decide matters by myself.

319
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,060
Prince of Bo, please don't be angry.

320
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,970
I am the one who has the say in this manor.

321
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,500
Strangers are not allowed here.

322
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,490
But Your Highness is not a cruel-hearted person.

323
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:03,320
Otherwise, you could have abandoned me when I lost consciousness.

324
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
I am not kind to you.

325
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,180
It is only because of your unique status, the Feudal Young Mistress of Kuizhou City.

326
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,540
Also, because I have to obey the emperor's order to keep you safe.

327
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,620
Your responsibility is to protect the common people.

328
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,450
I know that the rules in Prince Bo Manor are strict.

329
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,420
It's just that he's my father's age. I couldn't bear to not help.

330
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,720
What if mistakes occur?

331
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,120
I'm willing to accept the responsibility!

332
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,930
Young Mistress, it's best that you do as you promised.

333
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,510
Don't casually show charity

334
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,510
because of a moment of pity and then just casually abandon the person in the next moment.

335
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,680
Why would His Highness say those words?

336
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:08,640
As if he knew me in the past.

337
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,060
You don't know him and he doesn't know you.

338
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,130
Moreover, he's not as good as you imagined him to be.

339
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,170
Look at his petty and vengeful little face.

340
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:24,700
He simply has thorns growing out all over him and with one prick, you'll get hurt.

341
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:30,520
That isn't all his fault.

342
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,020
But I wasn't trying to have an argument with him.

343
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,210
How should I resolve this?

344
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,170
Hasn't the stuff we bought arrived at the door? I'll go check.

345
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,690
I'll go with you.

346
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,410
Here. Bring it all over here.

347
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:06,650
Greetings to your Highness.

348
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,580
Feudal Young Mistress, these are?

349
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:14,140
Upon arriving here, we caused some trouble for everyone

350
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,420
so I prepared some presents for everyone.

351
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,210
Mo Xiao, I saw you looking at this wine earlier on the street,

352
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,180
so I bought some for you.

353
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,730
Smell it. It's so fragrant.

354
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,820
Here, take it.

355
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,710
Then I, Mo Xiao, a rough person, won't be so modest.

356
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,100
Housekeeper Wen, I also prepared a gift for you.

357
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,090
I know you are proficient in medicinal skills.

358
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,430
Have you read this book before?
("The Pulse Classics" by Physician Wang Shuhe)

359
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,790
This is Wang Shuhe's work on pulse reading. I haven't had the chance to read it.

360
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:11,220
However, Feudal Young Mistress, I can't accept this without reason. You don't have to do this.

361
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:14,720
Feudal Young Mistress knows that you like this. Just accept it.

362
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,390
Hai Die.

363
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,210
I found this comb while shopping.

364
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,700
I think it's very pretty and suits you.

365
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,310
Thank you, Feudal Young Mistress, but I don't wear hair accessories.

366
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,870
How can girls not wear hair accessories?

367
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:33,450
Here, I'll put it on for you.

368
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,740
Look, it’s so pretty.

369
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,550
Your Highness, I heard from Mo Xiao that you only collect

370
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,330
respected paintings and unfinished books of calligraphers from previous dynasties.

371
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:52,130
Your Highness, our princess has put a lot of thought into this.

372
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,500
She said since you have such an eye for this, you must have excellent calligraphy skills.

373
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,080
So she prepared this for you.

374
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,010
Duan Yan (inkstone)!

375
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,320
You know, when we went to buy this,

376
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,280
the shop owner kept saying how good this was, but I didn't understand.

377
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,950
Duan Yan is the best among the four famous inkstones, hard as steel, yet smooth as skin,

378
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,660
warm and soft but not slippery.

379
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,750
Ink is easily created while grinding, like exhaling a breath. And no damage can be seen on the brush.

380
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,220
Wen Yan is chanting sutras again.

381
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,320
Your Highness, I know I broke a lot of your rules, so I hope Your Highness can accept my apology.

382
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,160
I promise it won't happen again.

383
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,710
Your apology is with such fanfare, but I'm sorry to tell you

384
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,110
that this calligraphy art is just for decoration, not my real interest.

385
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,750
As for doing calligraphy, I detest that even more.

386
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:59,520
Feudal Young Mistress, using such ways to win over people and scheming,

387
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,960
I also detest them.

388
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,130
Return everything!

389
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,400
This...

390
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,560
Young Mistress put in a lot of thought

391
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,170
and went to many places before we found these items.

392
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,040
Moreover, they were very costly. We sincerely just wanted to show our apologies to Your Highness.

393
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,690
Returning them just like this, is that not a little...

394
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,350
It was my fault, to begin with. It is right that I be punished.

395
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:38,930
But, Your Highness, you don't need to trample on my good intentions publicly like this.

396
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,620
Fine.

397
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,700
Your apology, I accept it.

398
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,000
Since it's mine now, it's at my disposal.

399
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:04,930
I would like to speak privately with you, Husband.

400
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,210
Dare I ask Your Highness, was it due to my impolite actions after the marriage bestowal yesterday

401
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:31,240
and my giving shelter to strangers today that caused you to treat me like this?

402
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,100
Your conduct, do you think these are the only faults?

403
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:41,000
What do you mean by those words?

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,300
Did I offend Your Highness another time?

405
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
I do have other prejudices against you.

406
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,310
I can just tell you now.

407
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,790
In accepting the marriage bestowal,

408
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:04,110
other than it being an imperial order, you must have other interests in mind.

409
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:09,740
Before Ma Fengcheng left, he visited me.

410
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,600
He said that since I am family with the Ma Army now,

411
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,500
for future imperial matters and campaigns,

412
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,460
he asks that I show them great care and will return the favor.

413
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:41,450
But according to law, subjects colluding with princes is deemed a capital crime?

414
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,230
Think about it.

415
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:47,490
With my personality, do you think I will let him off?

416
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:52,140
Your Highness, using His Majesty's marriage bestowal in exchange for the Ma Army's safety,

417
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,730
that was all my idea. This has nothing to do with Ma Fengcheng.

418
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:58,040
You're a smart person.

419
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,000
To put it bluntly, you're Ma Ying's daughter, who would dare harm you?

420
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,240
Wouldn't I just be provoking the Ma Family Army to surround the capital again?

421
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,710
Moreover,

422
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:14,230
Adjutant General Ma just came to test me.

423
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:16,330
No such thing happened.

424
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,730
You...

425
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,300
You tricked me!

426
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,700
It was just to reveal your true colors,

427
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,010
a woman who married me for her personal interests.

428
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,980
So what if I tricked you?

429
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,660
This marriage, I accepted it because it's an imperial order, while you did it for your personal interest.

430
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,460
We each had our own reasons.

431
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,130
In the Imperial Court, I will cooperate with you in putting on this good show.

432
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:49,650
But outside of that, we'll have nothing to do with each other, nor have any feelings between husband and wife.

433
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,420
I ask that you stop trying to win me over now.

434
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,220
Your Highness, I don't ask for a close, loving relationship.

435
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,160
I just hope we can get along peacefully.

436
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,470
I hope Your Highness can stop pushing people away.

437
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,000
Feudal Young Mistress is a fickle person with shallow affections. Why must I trust you?

438
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,780
Marriage is a girl's most important life event.

439
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,960
I do hope to get along with you.

440
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,370
And then to know and care for each other better.

441
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,570
Those are not false words.

442
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,380
Whether you are sincere

443
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,490
or insincere, I have no interest in knowing.

444
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,630
Your Highness, is it that no matter what I do,

445
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,630
your bias towards me will never disappear?

446
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,700
Unless that iron tree blooms,
(T/N: Idiom: a rare occurrence; a Sago Cycas - type of palm tree)

447
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,130
then I will believe in you.

448
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,030
Feudal Young Mistress, just give it up.

449
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,560
If you ask me again to treat you sincerely,

450
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,690
that is making things too hard for me.

451
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,630
I have said my words. You are smart.

452
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:28,160
You should be able to understand me, right?

453
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,020
Why are you eating pancakes again?

454
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,750
Looking like that, what problems do you have now?

455
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,970
Feudal Young Mistress, it hasn't been even a day

456
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,630
since we arrived here in the Bo Royal Manor.

457
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,120
But you and the Prince of Bo have become like this.

458
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,520
What about your future days together? How do you plan to live them with him?

459
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,950
Prince of Bo has great prejudice toward me.

460
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,120
So, we'll have to melt it slowly day by day.

461
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,620
I don't know why, but I keep thinking

462
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,530
that the Prince of Bo has a strange hostility toward me.

463
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,640
Because he is crazy!

464
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,610
Don't you think he is unpleasant to everyone?

465
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,020
He may be the Prince of Bo, but you are also from an extraordinary family.

466
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,720
Back in Kuizhou City, everyone loved you.

467
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,400
Countless young men rushing to you like a flock of ducks, am I right?

468
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,180
He isn't even treasuring you!

469
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,270
- That's right.
- Yes!

470
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:52,610
- Uncle.
- Uncle, you're awake?

471
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,230
Are you feeling any discomfort?

472
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:00,020
Ma Jing, get some water.

473
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,890
You saved me.

474
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,990
I thank you, Young Lady.

475
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,010
No need to thank me.

476
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,130
Where is this place?

477
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,780
This is the Prince of Bo's manor and this is the Princess Consort.

478
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,050
Bo... Prince of Bo?

479
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,780
Third Prince?

480
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:23,800
Yes, Uncle. You don't need to be afraid. It's okay.

481
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,900
Greetings, Princess Consort.

482
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,320
Actually, I haven't married him yet.

483
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,040
How about you call me, Feudal Young Mistress Ma?

484
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,230
Here, drink some water.

485
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,460
Ma Jing, bring the medicinal soup quickly.

486
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,170
Isn't he drinking water?

487
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,770
Steward Wen said that medicinal soup will be beneficial for his body.

488
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,820
- Housekeeper Wen said that?
- Yes.

489
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,490
Surely will.

490
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,970
Uncle, where do you live? I can ask people to send you there.

491
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:57,810
I'm from Bozhou Province.

492
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:00,290
I'm here to find my benefactor.

493
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,780
I only wish to see him once and thank him personally.

494
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,830
Too bad I haven't found him yet.

495
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,780
Thus, I became penniless and ended up on the street.

496
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,400
So, Uncle is such a sentimental person.

497
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,610
You came because of your benefactor.

498
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:21,020
How about this?

499
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,380
These days you stay here and rest first.

500
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,860
I'm going to try and find your benefactor.

501
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,670
Young Mistress, I thank you. I...

502
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,170
Uncle, you haven't recovered yet. You should rest.

503
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,700
Feudal Young Mistress, the soup is here!

504
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,740
Here.

505
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,690
Uncle, hurry and drink this medicinal soup.

506
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,820
Master, in interrogating the person that Feudal Young Mistress brought back this late at night,

507
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,760
shouldn't we tell her first?

508
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,350
Why?

509
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:52,750
Although that woman entered my royal manor,

510
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,910
she is not the princess consort yet.

511
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,940
My apologies.

512
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:00,540
But the inkstone that Feudal Young Mistress brought back, should we get it repaired?

513
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:03,090
I worry we might be going against the emperor's wishes.

514
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,540
I really am getting restricted by that Ma Zhaixing.

515
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,960
Uncle, our Feudal Young Mistress is famous for being very kind.

516
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,980
In the future, she will become Princess Consort of Bo.

517
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,070
The wedding was personally bestowed by His Majesty.

518
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,450
If you need anything from now on, just tell her.

519
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,860
Who would dare disobey her?

520
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,720
- Master.
- If you need anything in the future,

521
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,460
- I'm fine. Throw the inkstone out.
- Young Mistress will ask everyone in this manor to help you.

522
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,850
Uncle, don't listen to her nonsense.

523
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:35,240
She really likes to brag.

524
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,000
I'm telling you the truth!

525
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,230
In this Bo Royal Manor, I cannot make decisions.

526
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,250
Everything has to go through His Highness, the Prince of Bo.

527
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,420
You should thank His Highness for letting me do this.

528
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,250
Hurry and drink the medicinal soup.

529
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,050
Be careful, it's hot.

Second Prince, please wait.

Hai Die already notified Master that Your Highness personally came to visit.

533
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,300
Good, it's all right.

534
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,930
Chuchu, we haven't visited Third Brother's Manor for a while now, right?

535
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:15,800
Sibling affection is hard to obtain. It is a blessing earned from past lifetimes.

536
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,820
I am happy that you cherish it.

537
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,390
In the future, I'll constantly remind you

538
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,880
to come to Third Brother's manor more often.

Sister-in-Law.

542
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,160
Third Brother, we were thinking of coming here to visit you and Feudal Young Mistress Ma.

543
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,730
After much thought, we just decided to come.

544
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,490
Don't blame me for being impulsive.

545
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:43,340
You came here with a good intention. How is that impulsive?

546
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,230
In the blink of an eye, it's been ten years.

547
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,420
Back then, you were so young, an orphan adopted by Emperor Father.

548
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,180
We brothers read and practiced martial arts together.

549
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,290
But in these past years, Eldest Brother passed away.

550
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,260
Fourth Brother is far away in Qitan being held as a hostage.

551
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:06,460
You're busy with the military and I'm busy with Imperial Court politics.

552
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,480
We've neglected to stay in touch with each other.

553
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,430
You are right.

554
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:14,300
Emperor Father also mentioned that brothers should help each other out.

555
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,840
I received your instructions.

556
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:20,240
Third Brother, you two talk first.

557
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,820
I'll go seek out Feudal Young Mistress to have a chat.

558
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:25,840
Right, Third Brother's marriage is happening soon.

559
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,620
As his Second Brother, I should give him some advice about husband and wife relationships.

560
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:35,090
If you are still here, there are some words I can't really say.

561
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,150
Go then.

- Yes.

Much better. Much better.

How about we call each other sisters from now on, Sister Zhaixing?

Yes, Sister Jing.
