[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,100
[Episode 1]

21
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:41,030
The kingdoms of Jin and Yang are opposing powers that fought and resisted each other.

22
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:47,540
King Chu Kui of Yang launched large scale war campaigns, causing war fires to ravage everywhere.

23
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,450
The loyal and righteous King of Jin could not fight off Chu Kui and retreated to the North

24
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,320
to raise and rebuild an army for a future war with the enemy.

25
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,140
Chu Kui had no morals, killing all those who resisted without mercy.

26
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,320
He swore to exterminate the Jin Kingdom and unify the land under one ruler.

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,770
[Xiahou Yi, Chu Kui's Adjutant General]

28
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,560
Entire army, listen up! Kill everyone! Leave no one alive!
 [Xiahou Yi, Chu Kui's Adjutant General]

29
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,260
Thus, the world was divided into North and South

30
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:38,260
by two opposing major powers.

31
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,930
[Ten Years Later in Langshou (Wolf Hunt) Mountain, Kuizhou City, Yang Kingdom]

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,160
Recently, a rumor has been going around that wolf meat will cure any illness!

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,190
One ounce of wolf meat is worth 10 thousand taels!

34
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,280
Father, let's prepare to be prosperous!

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,440
Father, what are you doing?

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,830
What is that?

37
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,870
Demon Subduing Rod.

38
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,240
It's for getting rid of demons.

39
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,250
Father, don't listen to the nonsense saying that this mountain has a wolf monster.

40
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,680
It's all fake! There's not a single movement at all.

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,360
It'll be too late if there are movements.

42
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,050
Who is it? Hurry and come out!

43
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,370
Stop hiding in the dark and acting like a ghost!

44
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,030
[The animals in this scene are all computer graphics]

45
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,650
There really is a wolf monster! Let us hurry and go down the mountain!

46
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,020
Father, look! There's a big wolf!

47
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,400
Father!

48
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,680
Father, look!

49
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
It finally fell into our trap.

50
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,330
Father, watch me.

51
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,900
Go on.

52
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,840
The demon is about to come! Let's hurry and run!

53
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,550
- Hurry and run!
- No, Father! I must take this wolf with me!

54
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,000
There won't be time if we don't run now! Hurry and run!

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,440
I cannot!

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,860
Hurry, there's no time!

57
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,430
[Kuizhou City, at the foot of Langshou Mountain]

58
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,500
Young Feudal Master! You are the temporary Feudal Master of Kuizhou City!
[Ma Manor]

59
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,310
The wolf monster wreaking havoc on Langshou Mountain was personally witnessed by me!

60
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,820
Look! It ripped apart my arrow pouch!

61
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,410
He looks human-like yet wolf-like, his actions are beastly and terrifying.
[Ma Jun, son of the Feudal Lord of Kuizhou City]

62
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,690
My father has been so scared that he's bedridden.

63
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,060
Young Master and Lady, please rid the city of evil!

64
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
[Ma Zhaixing, Kuixhou City, Feudal Young Mistress]

65
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:09,240
Enough, enough! What looks like a human and a wolf?

66
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,380
I think you drank too much.

67
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,260
Everyone, listen to me! There's no wolf demon in Langshou Mountain!

68
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,550
If there really was then would you be able to leave the mountains alive?

69
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,520
Young Master, Feudal Lord and Young Mistress Zhaixing are caring towards the common people.

70
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,730
How come only you do not worry about the lives of the commoners?

71
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:36,860
Nonsense! You mean looking for Ma Zhaixing is better than looking for me?

72
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,120
Don't you know who's in charge of the city now?

73
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,580
The legend of the wolf demon is just nonsense!

74
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,070
I was willing to waste my time to let you finish talking

75
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,570
so you should be grateful!

76
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:57,610
Men! Kick out this person who is talking nonsense and leading people astray!

77
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,400
Hold up!

78
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,130
The legend of the wolf has been recently spreading everywhere, affecting the lives of the commoners.

79
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,320
They just hope that Ma Manor can figure out if it's real or not and give them an answer.

80
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,780
What sort of temporary feudal lord are you if you resolve this matter half-heartedly?

81
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,590
Ma Zhaixing! Impudence!
[Madam Ma, wife of the Feudal Lord of Kuizhou City]

82
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,690
Don't you know Jun'er is in charge of the city now?

83
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,230
A concubine's daughter has no right to speak here!

84
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:31,780
Yes, Main Mother is right. I am just reminding Elder Brother.

85
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,830
If Father returns and learns that he ignored the people's safety,

86
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,570
I wonder if Father will take back the order of making him the temporary Feudal Lord.

87
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,720
Ma Zhaixing, you dare to threaten me?

88
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,370
Jun'er!

89
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,370
Let me tell you. Your father favors her.

90
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,770
Don't let her see your weakness. Sit down!

91
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,960
All right!

92
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,850
Ma Zhaixing! Then, what great ideas do you have?

93
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,590
May Young Feudal Master lead the army up the mountain and confirm the authenticity of the wolf monster for everyone's sake.

94
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,970
If there is a wolf demon, please immediately order to seal off the mountain.

95
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,920
Forbid the eating of wolf meat and hunting of wolves to keep the people safe!

96
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:34,940
We ask Young Feudal Master to go up the mountain to see if there really is a wolf demon!

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,960
What? You are afraid? Are you not firm that there is no such thing as a wolf demon?

98
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,220
All right! I will personally take some men up the mountain to investigate.

99
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,770
If there are no wolf demons up there, what crime have you committed?

100
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,910
If there isn't a wolf demon, then isn't that a great thing?

101
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,630
It not only removes the people's fear, but Father will also be proud of you!

102
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,180
You're really something, Ma Zhaixing! Being a smooth talker now?

103
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,650
Thank you for your praise!

104
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,130
I will go with you to boost your courage and destroy evil things for the people's benefit!

105
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,260
There's no need! With an unlucky star like you around, nothing good can happen!

106
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,430
Then... I will not get in the way of my heroic brother saving everyone!

107
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,910
Young Master is intelligent! Thank you, Young Master,

108
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,770
for putting yourself in danger to give us justice!

109
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,230
Many hunters have seen the wolf demon here! Everyone be careful!

110
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,930
Yes!

111
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,000
There's demonic wind!

112
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,240
Everyone be alert! Protect Young Master!

113
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,760
Protect Young Master!

114
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,570
We're surrounded by wolves! We're surrounded!

115
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,190
Young Master, where are you going?

116
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,250
- Don't follow me!
- Young Master!

117
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,550
Help! Help! Save me!

118
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,020
- Where is everyone?
- Young Master!

119
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,490
Hurry and open it! Open it!

120
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,310
It's a trap set by wolf hunters!

121
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,730
Young Master!

122
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,850
Seal the mountain! Seal the mountain! This mountain must be sealed!

123
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,710
Yes!

124
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,800
[The animals in this scene are all computer graphics]

125
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,050
Wolf Boy!

126
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,660
Your wolf mother, siblings, and friends have all left.

127
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,690
Can I come down now?

128
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,860
I knew you would catch me!

129
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,910
Thankfully I learned how to make sleep mist from Housekeeper Wang!

130
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,970
It will make people hallucinate and think they saw a wolf demon!

131
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,490
After the mountain is sealed, I won't have to worry about you and the pack getting hunted!

132
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,630
And I don't need to worry about you falling into a trap and having no one to save you!

133
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,260
Wolf Boy, we've known each other for over a year. Good thing you're smart!

134
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,990
Although you can't talk very well yet, you understand what I say now. You are a good student!

135
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:14,960
I heard the elders in the city say there was a family that lived in the mountain over ten years ago.

136
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,550
The husband died on the way to take the scholarly exam.

137
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,060
Not long afterward, the wife died after hard labor.

138
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,550
But no one knows where that child went.

139
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,320
My guess is you might be that child who was eventually raised by the wolves.

140
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,250
Wolf Boy, listen to me!

141
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,710
We only pretended to be a wolf demon in order to curb the practice of eating wolf meat!

142
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,000
But from today on, everything is finished.

143
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:50,240
You did a good job!

144
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,410
You can have a piece of candied fruit!

145
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,430
I said one piece! Just one piece!

146
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,440
Give it back to me!

147
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,060
You! You bad thing!

148
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,940
Wolf Boy, there are many delicious and fun things below the mountain.

149
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,500
That includes your favorite meat buns and roasted chicken!

150
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Tomorrow, why don't you go with me down the mountain to take a look?

151
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,790
Wolf Boy, listen to me!

152
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,600
It's a hunter's trap!

153
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,370
Are you all right?

154
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,630
People... are very bad.

155
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,450
That's right. A bad person set this trap.

156
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,940
But that does not mean everyone below the mountain is bad.

157
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,920
Wolf Boy, you are human, not a wolf. You cannot hide here forever.

158
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,060
You have to return to humans sooner or later.

159
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,730
If you do not associate with people, how can you learn to tell who is good or bad?

160
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,390
All right. Then rest early today. I'll bring you down the mountain tomorrow.

161
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:29,480
I will show you there are many good people in this world.

162
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,030
Sleep early!

163
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,610
- Look, Feudal Lord is back!
- Feudal Lord is back!

164
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,390
Feudal Lord is finally back!

165
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,960
Yes, this is wonderful!

166
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,460
This is a great thing!

167
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:11,180
- Feudal Lord is finally back.
- Yes.

168
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,870
[Ma Ying, Feudal Lord of Kuizhou City]

169
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:17,490
[Ma Manor]

170
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,660
Welcome, Feudal Lord!

171
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,440
You may all rise!

172
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,210
Thank you, Feudal Lord!

173
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,430
Father, you're back!

174
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,750
I got up early every morning to practice writing and martial arts, waiting for you to return!

175
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,200
Mother has prepared many delicious dishes! Hurry and go inside.

176
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,560
There's no rush. I must take care of our guests from far away.

177
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,130
Adjutant General Ma, who is that noble guest who came back to the estate with the Feudal Master?
[Ma Fengcheng, Adjutant General of the Ma Family Army]

178
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,490
In this world, there are very few people that Father must personally entertain.

179
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,600
The person in the carriage must come from a strong background!

180
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,650
Madam and Young Master, the person in the carriage is no regular person.

181
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,720
He is the emperor's sworn brother, Xiahou Yi.

182
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,370
Commandant Xiahou? Why did he suddenly come to a place as small as Kuizhou City?
[Wang Xiang, housekeeper of Ma Manor]

183
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,090
I heard he came due to the rumor that wolf meat will cure any illness.

184
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,850
Commandant Xiahou, we have arrived at my estate.

185
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:25,660
[Commandant Xiahou Yi]

186
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,070
Wolf Boy, isn't it exciting?

187
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,360
Look! There are many flowers here! How pretty!

188
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,240
Sir, take a look at my paintings!

189
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,850
- You can't touch them!
- Butterflies!

190
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,340
Boss!

191
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,940
Boss, my friend thought your painted butterflies really knew how to fly!

192
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,610
- You're amazing, amazing!
- Oh really?,

193
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,590
- You're exaggerating. Thank you.
- I'm not!

194
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,530
Customer! Take a look at my chickens! Aren't they bigger than other shops'?

195
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:08,900
That's because the chicken feed they eat is the best of the best, so the meat is bouncy and healthy.

196
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,370
You can take a look at its eyes, such innocence.

197
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,500
That's because I use literature to reign in their wildness every day, without fail.

198
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,770
- What are you doing?
- Boss! Boss!

199
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,700
Boss! I'm sorry! My friend... just wanted to let the little chickens go!

200
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,300
Let them go?

201
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,000
- It's my first time hearing about letting little chickens go!
- I'm sorry!

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,250
Go, go, go! Why are you creating trouble?

203
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,760
Come here! Come!

204
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,180
Come, sit down. Sit here. Sit down.

205
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,440
- What is today's play?
- I don't know.

206
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,840
Watch closely.

207
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,970
I prepared this just for you. Don't go away!

208
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,540
A long, long time ago,

209
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,270
in the faraway northern lands, there was a girl.

210
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,480
Her name... is Xing'er!

211
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:20,340
Xing'er?

212
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,940
You?

213
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,220
It's starting!

214
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:38,390
Ever since her mother died, her father often was not at home.

215
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,850
She kept feeling down and was very lonely.

216
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:48,510
Until one day, Xing'er heard the mountain had mother's favorite, usnea herb.

217
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,760
And so, she risked danger and bravely went up the mountain to search for it.

218
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,050
Xing'er accidentally stepped into the wolf's territory and became his prey.

219
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,740
When Xing'er thought she was about to die, she discovered that the little wolf was sick.

220
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,930
You have a fever!

221
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,050
Xing'er did not find her mother's favorite usnea herb.

222
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:27,200
Instead, she used mint leaves to save the sick little wolf.

223
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,710
[Usnea]

224
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,570
Wolves are animals that repay those that help them.

225
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:45,260
He waited for Xing'er to go up the mountain and took Xing'er to find the usnea plant.

226
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,540
My mother's favorite usnea plant!

227
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Wolf Boy, thank you!

228
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,300
Thank you!

229
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,290
After Xing'er met the little wolf, she was able to slowly forget the pain of losing a mother.

230
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,760
The little wolf became her playmate from then on.

231
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,410
Xing'er always went up to the mountains alone to find Little Wolf.

232
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:26,230
Little Wolf brought her into his wolf world.

233
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,830
Little Wolf is the most important existence in Xing'er's life.

234
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,400
He enriched her life.

235
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:50,170
Because of Little Wolf, Xing'er learned that the wind can be seen.

236
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,130
This is the shape of the wind!

237
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:12,740
And because of Little Wolf, Xing'er learned that butterflies create sound when they fly.

238
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,470
You can hear the sound of the butterfly's wings!

239
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,950
Here.

240
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,830
I heard people who take care of wolves will use wolf teeth to make charms.

241
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,920
So, I asked an artisan to make you a wolf tooth necklace.

242
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,500
It can protect you along the way. Do you like it?

243
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,700
Xing'er really wanted to ask Little Wolf

244
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,200
whether he was willing to turn into a human and stay by Xing'er's side forever?

245
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,930
Candied hawthorn!

246
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,080
Candied hawthorn!

247
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,870
Candied hawthorn!

248
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:24,490
I don't know if Wolf Boy understood what I meant.

249
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,030
The play was very good.

250
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,170
Right, even wolves know to repay kindness.

251
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,450
- This girl was very pitiful. Thankfully, she had a wolf friend.
- Yes.

252
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,490
Where is my friend?

253
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,360
I don't know. I was fascinated by the play.

254
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,520
Young Master, your story was very good and very moving just now.

255
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,540
Oh no! He doesn't understand anything.

256
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,530
What will I do if something bad happens to him?

257
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,490
Candied hawthorn!

258
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,380
- Steamed buns!
- Selling fruits!

259
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,210
Come here and see the candied hawthorn.

260
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,470
It's very tasty. Buy one stick.

261
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,160
Fresh and hot buns!

262
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,340
Thank you, customer.

263
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,270
Candied hawthorn, do you want to buy it?

264
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,810
Steaming hot buns!

265
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:07,450
Candied hawthorn. Five wen for one stick.
(T/N: Wen - imperial currency)

266
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,790
You haven't paid yet!

267
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,300
Why are you hitting people! Take him to the local constabulary!

268
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,590
What kind of person is this? Catch him!

269
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,050
Right! What kind of person is he? Take him to the local constabulary!

270
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,120
He also wants to hit people?!

271
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,940
There are many of you surrounding this child.

272
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,570
How can he not be afraid?

273
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,640
- Leave, leave, leave.
- All right.

274
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,290
Just now, it looked like he was going to help me get up.

275
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,130
He definitely wasn't doing it on purpose.

276
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,760
This child took his stuff

277
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,040
but he didn't try to run away. How can he be a thief?

278
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,190
Boss, look. This is the money that he dropped on the floor just now.

279
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:55,940
You just did not see it.

280
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,150
Yes, he did give me the money.

281
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,390
I was wondering why I couldn't find it. So it dropped on the floor!

282
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,420
Yes, yes.

283
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,280
Okay, it's okay! Leave, leave!

284
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,980
It's okay now! Go back!

285
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,730
Go, go!

286
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,580
Too bad...

287
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,900
Child, I'll pay it for you.

288
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,150
Hold it. You need to remember.

289
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,820
Stealing is wrong.

290
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,470
You need to remember, okay?

291
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,410
You must be hungry. Eat it.

292
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:33,770
Grandma and Uncle, I'm sorry.

293
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,320
My friend is shy towards strangers since very young.

294
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,750
I apologize on his behalf. He wasn't stealing on purpose.

295
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,020
It's okay. Just treat it as doing something good.

296
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,360
We'll give him another chance.

297
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,800
Wolf Boy, give it to grandma.

298
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,560
Don't give me money.

299
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,390
I gave him the steamed bun out of pity.

300
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,450
Eat it then.

301
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,040
Thank you, Grandma!

302
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,940
It's okay. You can go.

303
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,800
- Let's go.
- Go.

304
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,850
- Thank you.
- Okay, leave.

305
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,710
Come here.

306
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,470
Come, sit. You didn't get scared, right?

307
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,750
You ran out here because you wanted to give me this?

308
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,340
- Wolf Boy.
- You're very obedient.

309
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,890
- Hurry and look!
- Mother is very happy. I care for you.

310
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,670
Come and give me a kiss.

311
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,940
Look! That is love.

312
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,910
Wolf Boy, are you willing to believe that there are good people?

313
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,230
Wolf Boy, you're so great and wonderful!

314
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,550
I'll give my candied hawthorn to you.

315
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,340
You are giving me your favorite steamed bun?

316
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,760
Okay.

317
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,980
[Ma Manor]

318
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,850
The emperor will be personally visiting Kuizhou a few days from now.

319
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,400
Your Ma Family Army has been guarding Kuizhou City for some years now,

320
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,360
but the contributions to the imperial court is just this little?

321
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,920
I say, Feudal Lord Ma,

322
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,980
His Majesty has been gracious with you.

323
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,700
You must improve your performance in serving the government.

324
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,370
Commandant, you are correct.

325
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:17,600
We are the emperor's left and right hand.

326
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,370
- We are both state subjects.
- Father is back.

327
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:25,420
How come His Majesty gave positions with such huge differences?

328
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:29,710
In His Majesty's eyes, you are...

329
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:33,240
a dog, stationed outside the capital for a long time.

330
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,200
What makes it different from a guard dog?

331
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,550
While I am like an invincible wolf,

332
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,050
assisting His Majesty in sweeping through all four directions.

333
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:49,880
Wolves actually are not invincible.

334
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,280
When they meet stronger opponents, they also know to retreat

335
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,450
and preserve their strength. This is a wolf's intelligence.

336
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,710
Only foxes, once they have a backing, will start to show off,

337
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,800
afraid others cannot see how powerful they are now.

338
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,620
I am Ma Zhaixing, the daughter of the Feudal Lord Ma Ying of Kuizhou City.

339
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,590
Just now, I was just talking about animal instincts with you, sir.

340
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,600
If I offended you, please forgive me.

341
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,330
But I think you would not be so petty.

342
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,280
Impudent! Do not forget your manners!

343
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,450
How could you act this way towards the Commandant Xiahou?

344
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,440
Go back to your room and think about what you did.

345
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,020
You cannot leave your room for seven days.

346
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,890
- Housekeeper Wang!
- Yes, Master.

347
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,540
Quickly lock up this wild girl!

348
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,870
My Lady...

349
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,660
Leave!

350
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:49,630
Yes, I'll leave.

351
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,390
- Father.
- Do you understand you were wrong?

352
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,110
You are deeply reflecting on your mistake, right?

353
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:53,110
Okay, you can get up.

354
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:55,400
Stand up, stand up.

355
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,320
Your legs are numb, right?

356
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,090
Look, I did not punish you to kneel.

357
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,340
Why are you punishing yourself like this?

358
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,140
When I was little, when I made a mistake,

359
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,770
my mother told me to kneel as punishment.

360
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,700
But you kept saying, "She's a girl. Why do you make her kneel?

361
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,960
As long as she reflects on her wrongdoing, that's enough."

362
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:19,250
Your mother was stricter than me, a man who goes to war.

363
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,750
How are you now? Hungry?

364
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,350
Okay, let's go and eat.

365
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,680
Zhaixing, during these next few days while Commandant Xiahou is here,

366
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,550
If you can, stay far away from him.

367
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:51,070
This person's mind is smaller than sesame (petty).

368
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,610
Father, how about I officially apologize to him tomorrow?

369
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,740
No need.

370
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,420
Right now, everyone in court is afraid of him because he is the emperor's sworn brother.

371
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,470
For Kuizhou City's citizen and for our Ma family,

372
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:09,790
I have to lower my head to him.

373
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:15,300
But, today, you helped me release that resentment.

374
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,400
You are truly my good daughter.

375
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,780
All right, I won't hold you accountable anymore for being rude to him.

376
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,490
But I must hold another matter against you.

377
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,840
I've never forbidden you from going outside.

378
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,720
That is because I believe in you.

379
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,340
You are a distinguished Feudal Young Mistress,

380
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,780
a lady of noble upbringing, yet you stayed out until the middle of the night?

381
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,570
Aren't you ignoring proper decorum?

382
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,660
I won't do it again!

383
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,950
Father, there won't be a next time.

384
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,740
It's because I have a good friend who entered Kuizhou City for the first time!

385
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,280
As a local,

386
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,740
I took him around the city!

387
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:07,010
What kind of good friend?

388
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,260
He's a loyal and obedient person,

389
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,520
and he is willing to take responsibility for his wrongdoings!

390
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,730
He loves to eat, too!

391
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:21,750
He sounds like a good child.

392
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,890
In the future, bring him to me if you have the chance.

393
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,900
I want to take a good look at him.

394
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,270
It's a promise!

395
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,090
It's a promise.

396
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:37,890
Ma Zhaixing, if I wasn't giving your father consideration,

397
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,400
I would have let you have a taste of my skills!

398
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,670
- Commandant.
- Come in.

399
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,050
Commandant, our young mistress is young and innocent.

400
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,320
She said many wrong words just now. Please forgive her.

401
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,560
Feudal Lord has given instructions.

402
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,500
Commandant has been on expeditions most of the time, personally joining the battle,

403
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,250
yet you are being bothered by joint inflammation.

404
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:22,730
So, he had me brew this nourishing soup for you.

405
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:35,280
This medicine soup reminded me of an important matter.

406
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,580
This Langshou Mountain, have you heard of it?

407
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,790
I understand medicine and previously went up the mountain to pick herbs,

408
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,620
so I am quite familiar with it.

409
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,420
That's perfect!

410
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,800
I order you to immediately go up the mountain and catch me a few wolf pups.

411
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,900
I've recently heard that wolf meat and blood

412
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,400
have great medicinal properties to treat joint inflammation.

413
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,370
Don't forget that your family's young mistress

414
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:20,000
earlier insinuated that I was like a fox showing off.

415
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,670
I won't fuss with her,

416
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,330
but it was still a serious crime of disrespecting the emperor's sworn brother!

417
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,650
Commandant!

418
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,830
Commandant, please calm down!

419
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:33,630
Why don't I just report it all

420
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,770
to the emperor in a few days?

421
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,380
Commandant, please don't!

422
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,450
Please no! You must not!

423
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,680
Then why aren't you rushing up the mountain catching me wolves to treat my illness?

424
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,690
If that medicine works,

425
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:50,100
I might stop making a fuss about your young mistress.

426
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,990
Yes, Commandant.

427
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:57,560
This servant will immediately go work on this. I surely will help unburden you.

428
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:27,270
This water source is the nearest from where wolves are seen.

429
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,090
Selling buns!

430
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,790
Here, take this.

431
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,190
- Candied hawthorns!
- Quickly go!

432
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,580
This morning when I went up the mountain,

433
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,410
didn't you want to thank them with those fruits?

434
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,210
Fresh hot buns!

435
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,860
Go! Hurry!

436
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,000
Buns!

437
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,900
Here you go.

438
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,280
Come here!

439
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,580
How come you're here, child?

440
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,340
Right.

441
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,010
Such nice fruits...

442
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,320
Yes, thanks!

443
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,030
Thank you, good child!

444
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,260
Wolf Boy, you're awesome!

445
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,160
Now, you not only know how to accept people, but also be good to them.

446
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
Good job!

447
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,850
What? You don't like it when I touch you?

448
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,930
Who taught you this?

449
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,860
- It was me...
- Son, you're so obedient!

450
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,570
- Hurry, hurry look!
- Mom is so happy.

451
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,930
Mom loves you. Give me another kiss.

452
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:25,340
Look! That is love.

453
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:31,930
Like XIng'er.

454
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,150
You can only do what you did earlier to me.

455
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,700
You cannot even with the wolf pack!

456
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,410
Also those words, you can only say them to me.

457
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:52,840
I am very fair. I also won't do these things to anyone else.

458
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,900
If you don't make me sad,

459
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,390
then I will never hurt you, either.

460
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:02,320
I believe you, you believe me.

461
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,110
We trust each other. Do you understand?

462
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,050
- What's wrong?
- Your roasted chicken is here!

463
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:24,630
Here, please try this!

464
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,450
You're hungry again?

465
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,740
You greedy foodie!

466
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,730
Wolf Boy, I promised my father that I'll go home earlier today.

467
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,010
I won't be going up the mountain anymore. You go back by yourself.

468
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:40,530
Be careful, okay?

I'll make Wolf Boy a new set of clothes.

After a while, when he goes to meet my dad, he can wear it!

00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,130
♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

475
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:19,090
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

476
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:28,930
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

477
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:34,400
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

478
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,760
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

479
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:48,760
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

480
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:56,010
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

481
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:59,630
♫ Forever being together ♫

482
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:03,250
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

483
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:10,420
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

484
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,600
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

485
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:24,590
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

486
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:31,880
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

487
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,840
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

488
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:46,140
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

489
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:52,400
♫ Forever being together ♫
