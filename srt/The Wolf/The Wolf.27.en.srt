[Episode 27] 
Cousin, you're right.

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
But I've helped Father complete a mission this time.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Say, will Third Brother see me in a different light?

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,540
Will he stop treating me like a kid?

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,960
Your Highness seems to care a lot about what Prince of Bo sees you as.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,099
Of course. He's the brother that I admire the most.

26
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,090
But he's still lacking a bit from Oldest Brother.

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,410
Your Highness, I'm sure Prince of Bo will be proud of you.

28
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,089
Cousin, look! It's Zhui Ri!

29
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,009
Your Highness, you recognize that hawk?

30
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:04,829
Cousin, you met its owner before.

31
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,929
It's Brother Ji Chong.

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,910
Brother Ji Chong!

33
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:22,889
Long time no see.

34
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,629
Brother Ji Chong, why are you here?

35
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:26,729
Fourth Prince, are you doing well?

36
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,309
Brother Ji Chong, I didn't expect to see you here after we parted ways.

37
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,928
Your Highness, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

38
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,649
I need a favor from you.

39
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:39,429
Seems like you were waiting for me to come.

40
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:43,449
Tell me. How can I help you? Just tell me.

41
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:47,270
Your Highness, I'm here

42
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:51,450
to seek help from you in order to save someone.

43
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,950
Save someone? Save who?

44
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,688
You traitor!

45
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,910
Let His Highness go!

46
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,270
Ji Chong, what are you doing?

47
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:10,049
Your Highness, the person I want you to save is Zhaixing.

48
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,970
What are you saying?

49
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,170
This is not an act!

50
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,129
I'm serious about this!

51
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,589
What's your motive?

52
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:27,488
Listen up. Chu Youzhen is in my hand now.

53
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,250
If you want him to stay alive, bring Ma Zhaixing and Ma Jing

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,909
to the borders between Yang and Jin by tomorrow noon.

55
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:38,890
We'll exchange hostages.

56
00:03:39,669 --> 00:03:43,930
If you try to ambush us or try anything funny,

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,730
all you will have left to do is collect Chu Youzhen's corpse.

58
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:52,610
Pass this message to Chu Kui and Prince of Bo.

59
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,269
Don't do it!

60
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,890
I'll rush back to the capital and report it to them!

61
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,329
Take good care of His Highness!

62
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,089
Time is running out. What are you waiting for?

63
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,950
Let's go!

64
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:20,509
Ji Chong, I treated you well in the past!

65
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,749
How could you bite the hand that feeds you?

66
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,569
Bite the hand the feeds me?

67
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,429
I'm not the one who started this.

68
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:33,069
Your despicable father and Third Brother started this first!

69
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,150
What?

70
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,050
You should blame them for this.

71
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,210
Commandery Princess, Prince of Bo wants to see you.

72
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,490
Commandery Princess, sorry about this.

73
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,620
Commandery Princess!

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,300
Commandery Princess!

75
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,650
Commandery Princess!

76
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,609
Where are you taking her?

77
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,469
Open the door!

78
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:01,609
Open the door!

79
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,485

Where's Prince of Bo?

83
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,089
Commandery Princess, please.

84
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,429
This place has a bloody stench.

85
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:49,450
I'm afraid you couldn't get used to it.

86
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,430
I've ordered my men to prepare some incense.

87
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:02,030
Why are we meeting here?

88
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,980
Since it has come to this,

89
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:07,989
I should show you my true identity.

90
00:09:07,989 --> 00:09:10,389
I shouldn't lie to you anymore.

91

Mo Xiao and the rest,

92
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,010
they're a part of the Night Fiends as well. Right?

93
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,810
It's no wonder.

94
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,429
From the first day that I stepped into Bo Royal Manor,

95
00:09:49,429 --> 00:09:52,349
I fell into Chu Kui's trap.

96
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:56,169
Our wedding was his means to keep watch over me.

97
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:59,230
I can finally understand

98
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,909
why you treated me with such conflicting behaviors

99
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,990
during the last six months.

100
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,229
When you sent me to the Taibao Battalion,

101
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,469
were you trying to kill me?

102
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:16,810
Or were you trying to let me go?

103
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,249
You're a prisoner right now.

104
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:23,250
Don't you think that question is silly?

105
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,309
Even if you know the facts,

106
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,330
you still need to resign to your fate.

107
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,629
Are you done talking?

108
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,350
Now, it's my turn.

109
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,530
Besides Prince of Bo,

110
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,670
do you still remember

111
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,590
your other identity?

112
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,928
That identity is meaningless to me.

113
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:50,750
That's the only reason I'm here!

114
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,810
The one who wiped out my family was Prince of Bo.

115
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,610
But the one who protected me was Wolf Boy.

116
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,969
I'll give you another chance to choose.

117
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,550
Do you want to be Chu Kui's Prince of Bo

118
00:11:12,329 --> 00:11:14,370
or Xing'er's Wolf Boy?

119
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:32,530
If you knew the truth I know,

120
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,729
you'd know that I can only be Prince of Bo.

121
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:36,370
I want you to choose!

122
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,608
Do you want to be Prince of Bo or Wolf Boy?

123
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,430
Answer me!

124

Wolf Boy existed because of Xing'er.

127
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:16,869
But Wolf Boy was dead when he was forced to jump off a cliff

128
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,169
because of Ma Jun.

129
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:24,790
After I knew that you didn't betray me in the past,

130
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:29,249
I did consider being Wolf Boy for your sake.

131
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,150
So, why can't you do that now?

132
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,090
Ma Zhaixing,

133
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,430
didn't you want me to leave the wolf pack?

134
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:46,829
Xing'er was good to Wolf Boy.

135
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,888
But after I fell off the cliff, His Majesty and Big Brother were the people who saved me!

163
00:15:19,829 --> 00:15:21,850
only these are left.

164
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,930
♫ But gentleness is always invincible  ♫

165
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,650
♫ I am already used to viewing from high above
in the mountain alone ♫

166
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,550
What are you trying to do?

167
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:38,450
Face the truth.

168
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,649
In this world, Wolf Boy and Xing'er no longer exist.

169
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,169
Don't!

170
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,340
♫ Climbing mountains and cliffs ♫

171
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,680
♫ I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry,
just so I can push on harder ♫

172
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,468
Don't! Don't!

173
00:15:56,468 --> 00:15:59,069
Don't destroy my Wolf Boy and Xing'er!

174
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,210
I beg you!

175
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,709
I beg you!

176
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,800
My Wolf Boy and Xing'er!

177
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,220
No!

178
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,410
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

179
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,590
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

180
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,770
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who
its afterglow will illuminate ♫

181
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,890
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

182
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,030
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

183
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:33,320
♫ But gentleness is always invincible  ♫

184
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,440
♫ I waste away aimlessly and without anyone urging me ♫

185
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,480
♫ A homeless drifter's delusional wish of finding
a place of belonging ♫

186
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,470
♫ Have long since lost the destination,
like a lone goose flying in circles ♫

187
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,510
♫ Just before I was about to give up ♫

188
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,510
♫ You suddenly appeared, bringing me light ♫

189
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,190
Why did you burn down my Wolf Boy and Xing'er!

190
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,489
Why?

191
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,530
Xing'er is dead.

192
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,349
The person in front of me is the daughter of the traitor Ma Ying

193
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:08,968
who only resembles Xing'er!

194
00:17:08,969 --> 00:17:11,329
My father wasn't a traitor!

195
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,570
Don't you insult him!

196
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,729
I'm Prince of Bo!

197
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,569
You're the daughter of a traitor!

198
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,700
Don't you understand?

199
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,220
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string ♫

200
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,480
♫ has experienced warmth ♫

201
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,570
My Wolf Boy is gone.

202
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,350
It's gone.

203
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,900
♫ You know who I am ♫

204
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:12,670
Wen Yan!

205
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:19,390
Examine her condition.

206
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,890
Yes.

207
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,448
What's wrong with Commandery Princess?

208
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:30,470
Wen Yan put the antidote in the incense.

209
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:33,769
He said it'll neutralize the poison after Commandery Princess inhales it.

210
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,649
That's fine. But why did she fall unconscious?

211
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,510
Was the antidote fake?

212
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,248
It has nothing to do with the antidote.

213
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:42,608
She suffered a huge shock.

214
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,689
That's why she fell unconscious.

215
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:54,349
Master, there's still some poison in her body.

216
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,229
- Get rid of it.
- Yes.

217
00:18:57,229 --> 00:18:59,069
- Fetch me some water.
- Hurry.

218
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,489
Hurry.

219
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,729
This won't do.

220
00:19:25,729 --> 00:19:27,829
She can't drink in this state.

221
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:30,949
I'll do it.

222
00:20:14,469 --> 00:20:16,790
- Wen Yan.
- Yes.

223
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:28,430
Master, her pulse is normal now.

224
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,050
She's fine now.

225
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,150
- Mo Xiao.
- Yes.

226
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,810
- Take her back to the cell.
- Yes, Master.

227
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,230
What's wrong with Commandery Princess?

228
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,110
Commandery Princess!

229
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:02,529
What did you guys do to her?

230
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,049
Did you torture her?

231
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,410
Commandery Princess is fine.

232
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,529
She fainted because she didn't eat for these few days.

233
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,969
Why didn't you feed her?

234
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:12,850
I'll ask my man to send some food here.

235
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,649
Take care of her.

236
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:21,049
Commandery Princess.

237
00:23:22,489 --> 00:23:23,989
Commandery Princess.

238
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:28,770
Commandery Princess, are you okay?

239
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,069
Are you okay?

240
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,670
Wolf Boy.

241
00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:45,749
Where's Wolf Boy?

242
00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:48,609
Did you meet Prince of Bo?

243
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,570
Ma Jing,

244
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,290
my Wolf Boy,

245
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,670
my Wolf Boy is gone.

246
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,709
What should I do?

247
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:10,650
What should I do?

248
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:14,609
My Wolf Boy is gone!

249
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,829
He's completely gone!

250
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,969
Just cry.

251
00:24:28,229 --> 00:24:34,189
You'll be fine if you cry and let everything out.

252
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:39,120
I won't.

253
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,110
I will never be fine!

254
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,810
You will be!

255
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,670
Believe me! Everything will be fine eventually!

256
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,950
There's nothing left!

257
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,309
Ma Jing!

258
00:24:58,189 --> 00:25:01,770
Wolf Boy is really gone!

259
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:13,689
How dare a wild adventurer like him hold my Zhen'er as a hostage and force me to make a trade!

260
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:16,269
- Your Majesty, calm down!
- Shut up!

261
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:20,468
Father, Ji Chong was a good friend of Ma Zhaixing.

262
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:24,988
According to my secret investigation, this man was the one who told the Ma Family Army about the truth.

263
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:28,050
Now, they're working together in order to save Ma Zhaixing.

264
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,848
I've painstakingly planned this for so many years!

265
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:33,249
But now the Ma Family Army is ruined.

266
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,569
And Ma Zhaixing is the only pawn that will bring me to victory.

267
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,350
But now, an outsider is trying to blackmail me!

268
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:43,229
Do I have no choice but to hand it over on a platter?

269
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:48,148
Your Majesty, I'm sure Fourth Prince's life is more important than Ma Zhaixing's life!

270
00:25:48,148 --> 00:25:49,728
Your Majesty, why are you hesitating?

271
00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:51,329
What did you say?

272
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:54,149
Do you think I'm dumb? Do you think I don't know what's going on?

273
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:57,308
Your Majesty, time is running out! We must be quick!

274
00:25:57,308 --> 00:26:00,169
I'm afraid we won't make it in time!

275
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,169
- Your Majesty, please put the Fourth Prince first.
- Your Majesty, please put the Fourth Prince first.

276
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,968
Do you guys think I'm not anxious?

277
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:08,249
All of you, leave!

278
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,069
Prince of Bo, stay here.

279
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:22,390
Prince of Bo, please persuade His Majesty.

280
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:45,549
Prince of Bo, Zhen'er is the son of the empress.

281
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:47,930
I understand.

282
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:53,189
Big Brother sacrificed his life in order to have me protect Fourth Brother.

283
00:26:53,189 --> 00:26:55,710
I will bring Fourth Brother back.

284
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,589
Go now.

285
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,850
Bring Ma Zhaixing along.

286
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,750
And swap her for Zhen'er.

287
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,050
Yes, Emperor Father.

288
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:10,429
Wait.

289
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:19,829
Prince of Bo, once you make sure Zhen'er is safe,

290
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,410
kill Ma Zhaixing.

291
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,249
Yes, Father.

292
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:42,290
Prince of Bo is on his way.

293
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:46,089
My friend in Jin told me that Jin will send backup when we

294
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:50,348
exchange hostages tomorrow to prevent Prince of Bo from trying anything funny.

295
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:52,729
Ji Chong, you're something.

296
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:56,049
That friend of yours must be a big shot then.

297
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,891
If not, he wouldn't be able to persuade the King of Jin to send the Crown Prince of Jin to be our backup.

298
00:28:00,891 --> 00:28:02,730
This is great.

299
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:10,109
Sorry. Your Highness may have to suffer a little.

300
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:13,069
Ji Chong,

301
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:17,810
why are you so courteous towards an evil sinner of the Chu family?

302
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,369
I would've hacked him to pieces if it weren't for the fact that he's our hostage!

303
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,790
Kill me then!

304
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,288
Just kill me! And you can avenge Sis Zhaixing!

305
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,769
- You stupid fool! I'll chop off your lips!
- Brother Xie Han!

306
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,208
- Brother Xie Han!
- Kill me!

307
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:32,610
I'll handle the hostage.

308
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,970
You should go and rest.

309
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:42,229
Fine.

310
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,509
Kid.

311
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,909
Although you have solid evidence, I still can't believe that

312
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:58,289
Third Brother and Father were the ones who murdered Sis Zhaixing's family.

313
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,769
But the truth is right in front of us.

314
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:13,589
I can't believe that Third Brother has an ulterior motive for

315
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,088
being kind towards Sis Zhaixing.

316
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,789
How could Sis Zhaixing accept the truth?

317
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:31,029
Yeah.

318
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:37,209
How should Zhaixing accept this piercing pain?

319
00:29:45,969 --> 00:29:48,989
Commandery Princess, eat something.

320
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:54,448
Commandery Princess, you've starved yourself for two days already!

321
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:56,190
If this continues...

322
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,849
If this continues, you will die!

323
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:01,269
Feudal Young Mistress, please eat something!

324
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:04,170
We'll meet the Ma Family Army soon!

325
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,349
Commandery Princess, please eat something.

326
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,329
Master.

327
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:15,549
She doesn't even want to have a sip of water.

328
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:17,670
What should we do?

329
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:21,549
Bring her here.

330
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,410
Master, she's here.

331
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,550
Do you want to die?

332
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,210
If I'm dead,

333
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:52,929
Ji Chong will kill Chu Youzhen.

334
00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:56,509
I'm sure you and Chu Kui will be in pain.

335
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,130
No.

336
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,070
You're the heartless Prince of Bo.

337
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:09,410
Why would you feel pain for anyone?

338
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,490
I was the one who murdered your family.

339
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,729
Don't implicate innocent people.

340
00:31:21,609 --> 00:31:26,590
In your eyes, Chu Youzhen is innocent.

341
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,489
But what about my father and my mother?

342
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,770
Aren't they innocent?

343
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,429
If you die, Youzhen will follow your steps.

344
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:47,530
And I, the murderer of your entire family, will still live on.

345
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,010
Do you think your death is meaningful?

346
00:31:55,249 --> 00:31:57,329
What do you think

347
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:02,410
your death will accomplish for your family?

348
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,869
Fool.

349
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:24,009
You didn't kill me when you had the chance.

350
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:28,550
In the future, I'll make you regret it!

351
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:32,150
I'll wait for your revenge.

352
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:52,649
Commandery Princess, please change your clothes.

353
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:56,283
Commandery Princess.

354
00:33:05,729 --> 00:33:09,729
Master, she's eating now.

355
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:11,890
Let's depart.

356
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,990
We wasted too much time on Ma Zhaixing.

357
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,810
Yes, Master.

358
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:55,469
Master, this is the place.

359
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:59,028
It's almost time. Yet there's no one here?

360
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:00,969
Is this a ploy?

361
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:08,650
Ji Chong won't joke around when we have Ma Zhaixing in our hands.

362
00:34:39,269 --> 00:34:45,089
People who want to achieve great feats must be merciless

363
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,230
and mustn't engage in relationships.

364
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,290
Prince of Bo is a great person indeed.

365
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,109
You murdered Feudal Master and his family, and you put the blame on Jin.

366
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:56,189
But I don't understand this.

367
00:34:56,189 --> 00:35:00,109
What exactly did that Chu Kui do to you?

368
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,590
Why are you so obedient?

369
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,329
Are you trying to buy time with all this nonsense?

370
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:06,968
Or do you have a trick up your sleeve?

371
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:08,810
You're wrong.

372
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,408
Aren't you too paranoid?

373
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,389
It's because you're not trustworthy.

374
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:16,370
I still don't know your background.

375
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,130
Prince of Bo, don't worry.

376
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:23,410
I will make sure you know my background today.

377
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,849
Let go of Zhaixing.

378
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,829
Give us the hostage!

379
00:35:40,729 --> 00:35:42,990
I make the call here.

380
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,170
No one can order me around.

381
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,689
Let her go!

382
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:57,090
Ji Chong,

383
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:01,030
if you don't want a corpse returned to you

384
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,310
both of us should release the hostage at the same time.

385
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,689
Fine. I'll follow your wish.

386
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:33,589
Sis Zhaixing, I know.

387
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:36,809
It's meaningless for me to say anything now,

388
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:39,740
but I still want to apologize to you on behalf of

389
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,420
Third Brother and Father!

390
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:48,810
Sorry for the pain and suffering.

391
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,990
I will surely kill Chu Kui and Prince of Bo.

392
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:54,509
I'll count to three

393
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:56,809
and we'll release them at the same time.

394
00:36:58,589 --> 00:36:59,989
Three.

395
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,370
Two.

396
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,930
One!

397
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:12,529
Commandery Princess, it must've been hard.

398
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,729
Surround them! Don't let them escape!

399
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,070
His Highness! His Highness is here!

400
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,650
I knew King of Jin would give the Ma Family Army a warm welcome.

401
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:45,190
I didn't expect the Crown Prince of Jin to come personally.

402
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,728
Indeed, I'm here to save Commandery Princess Ma.

403
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:50,369
But the Ma Family Army wasn't the only one who requested my help.

404
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,249
My brother, Prince of Chuan, Li Juyao requested my help as well.

405
00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:01,589
I told you, didn't I?

406
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:05,650
I will make sure you know my background today.

407
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:11,209
You're the King of Jin's son?

408
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,330
I'm Li Juyao.

409
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:17,969
Nice to meet you, Commandery Princess.

410
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,190
Prince of Chuan, Li Juyao?

411
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,669
Were you the mighty Prince of Jin that defeated everyone on the battlefield?

412
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,650
Sorry for my rudeness.

413
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,650
Our general once said that you were a young hero.

414
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:36,829
If Yang and Jin weren't enemies, he would've asked you to command the Ma Family Army together.

415
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:39,069
We would've been the strongest in the land.

416
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:46,989
I was just proud and arrogant

417
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,210
because I was successful at a young age.

418
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,230
I don't deserve the recognition that your general gave me.

419
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:01,248
Since you're from Jin, why did you sneak into my nation?

420
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:03,710
Of course, it's for Ma Zhaixing.

421
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,610
Today, I'll avenge her father for her.

422
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,928
I'll kill Prince of Bo.

423
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:11,429
Wait!

424
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,728
Ma Jing is still in their hands.

425
00:40:13,729 --> 00:40:16,688
Commandery Princess, just ignore me! Kill that scoundrel!

426
00:40:16,688 --> 00:40:18,669
If you don't kill him today, when will you get to kill hi–

427
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,770
- Let me go!
- Shut up!

428
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,129
Let me go!

429
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:24,010
We have the numerical advantage here.

430
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:26,469
Do you think we can't save Ma Jing?

431
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:28,988
Do it then.

432
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,850
Don't!

433
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,929
I'm sure he's prepared.

434
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,089
So, what if you guys have a backup?

435
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,770
Do you think I came unprepared?

436
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,449
Hai Die and the archers are hiding in the valley.

437
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:57,389
If you guys move, they will release their arrows.

438
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:00,549
And Ma Zhaixing will be where the first arrow lands.

439
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:01,809
Nonsense!

440
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,888
Brothers, he's bluffing!

441
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:05,489
Kill them!

442
00:41:07,489 --> 00:41:09,189
Be careful!

443
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,190
This is only a warning.

444
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,510
You guys may have the numerical advantage,

445
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:19,209
but my arrows are faster.

446
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:24,370
If they do shoot, Prince of Bo, do you think you can retreat without harm?

447
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,490
I never thought of leaving this place alive.

448
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,929
Since Ma Zhaixing, the Ma Family Army, and you two will die together with me.

449
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,489
It'll be a big contribution.

450
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,429
It's just that I didn't expect this trap of mine

451
00:41:40,429 --> 00:41:43,950
to lure out the two princes of Jin.

452
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:49,029
Ji Chong, no matter if he's bluffing or not,

453
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:51,329
Ma Jing is still in their hand.

454
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:54,790
I promised Brother Fengcheng to take good care of her.

455
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:56,990
She must be safe.

456
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:08,210
Prince of Bo, I can let you retreat safely,

457
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,509
but I hope you keep your promise.

458
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:16,290
As long as I retreat safely, my archers will retreat as well.
