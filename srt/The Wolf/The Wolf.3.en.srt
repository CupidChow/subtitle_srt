♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:18,990
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5

♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense

♫ But gentleness is always invincible

8

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,010
[Episode 3]

21
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:37,390
What do you mean?

22
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,070
If it wasn't for the mercy of Feudal Lord,

23
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,190
Princess Pingyuang and the child in her womb would have been long gone.

24
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,909
Princess Pingyuan!

25
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,530
Don't panic. I once received great favor from King Wen.

26
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,749
We can't stay here long. Come with me.

27
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:25,429
I survived and witnessed that you risked your life to save Princess Pingyuan.

28
00:02:25,429 --> 00:02:28,689
You preserved the bloodline of the former dynasty.

29
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,570
You secretly took care of them

30
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:38,350
and treated the princess's daughter, Princess Zhaixing, as your own.

31
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,550
A huge kindness like that

32
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,110
cannot be repaid by me in this life.

33
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,470
Earlier you were saying that you wanted to harm my family.

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,310
But in reality, you feared Your Majesty would condemn me.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,029
You wanted to save us.

36
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,349
But all I want is Zhaixing never knowing her family background

37
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,590
and being safe for life.

38
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,969
You killed someone and committed a capital crime.

39
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:19,010
So I will have to execute you.

40
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,429
I got my revenge.

41
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,290
There are no regrets.

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,189
Brother, rest in peace.

43
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,370
Young Master.

44
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,408
Well played. Go and collect your bounty.

45
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:25,050
Thank you.

46
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,348
Isn't that the scary wolf monster?

47
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,228
How come you are like this now?

48
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,349
So pitiful.

49
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:40,129
When you were playing with me, weren't you arrogant!

50
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:47,749
A monster has feelings?

51
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,129
Feel sad?

52
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,649
You don't know, right?

53
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,909
Your Xing'er is never coming back.

54
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,609
She was the one who gave me this bell.

55
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,308
You are like this already.

56
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:05,010
Of course, she would choose to save herself.

57
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:07,229
She sold you out.

58
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,649
If it wasn't for her,

59
00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:12,390
I couldn't have this bell.

60
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,069
How was I supposed to know

61
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,950
it would lead me to you?

62
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,629
Hurts, doesn't it?

63
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:54,990
Blame yourself for believing in Zhaixing!

64
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,870
Look at that.

65
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,509
At this point, did she come to save you?

66
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,090
Did she? Did she?

67
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,649
The wolves!

68
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,349
Shoot! Shoot!

69
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,349
Bastard! Go away!

70
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,489
Run!

71
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,649
Shoot him! Now!

72
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:21,510
Help! Help!

73
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,710

- Save Young Master!

75

- Pull me up!
- Young Master!

76
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,730
Nice shot.

77
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,349
Shoot him to death!

78
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,508
If he gets away again, His Majesty will not leave us alone!

79
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,230
Shoot!

80
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,950
Stop!

81
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,850
Stop! Stop!

82
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,269
His Majesty has found out the truth.

83
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,789
He isn't the murderer!

84
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,850
Everybody, stop!

85
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,250
Stop!

86
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,510
Shut up!

♫ Wait for me, falling down for you ♫

[Ma Manor]

95
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,590
How dare you!

96
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,289
I asked your sister to seek you with my orders to stop the arrest!

97
00:11:19,289 --> 00:11:22,069
And you, instead, broke her leg.

98
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:25,350
She's still in a coma.

99
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,309
Guilty as charged!

100
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,288
Husband, Jun'er was trying to protect himself.

101
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:34,108
Besides, if Zhaixing hadn't lied to him—

102
00:11:34,108 --> 00:11:35,749
That's enough!

103
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,869
Your Majesty, I'm sorry for the embarrassment.

104
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,529
Ma Jun,

105
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:50,149
after today, you're coming with me to the border.

106
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,130
You'll be trained to be a soldier.

107
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:56,590
Search the mountains first thing in the morning.

108
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,549
You must save Wolf Boy and get him back!

109
00:11:58,549 --> 00:12:00,570
That won't be necessary.

110
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,150
He's just a savage.

111
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,549
Lead your army back tomorrow morning.

112
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:09,429
And as for Wolf Boy,

113
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,309
I'll send someone to search.

114
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:14,570
Living or dying is fated.

115
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,849
If he disappears and cannot be found, that's his fate.

116
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,189
Hang the head of the traitor

117
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:32,810
on the gate of the city to warn the others.

118
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,590
Zhaixing,

119
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,170
are you okay?

120
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,769
Dad.

121
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,089
Dad, where's Wolf Boy?

122
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,470
We haven't found him yet.

123
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,389
It's too dark now.

124
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,350
Darkness has covered the whole gorge. You cannot even see your fingers.

125
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,930
It's hard to search around.

126
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,749
His Majesty has ordered that our Ma family can only focus on the city affairs and border protection.

127
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,930
We should stay out of it.

128
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:12,150
But His Majesty has also promised to send people to search at dawn.

129
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:14,709
It's too late!

130
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,748
He was so badly injured and he fell into such a deep gorge.

131
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:21,730
If no one's going to save him, he will die!

132
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,111
No!

133
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:27,388
Zhaixing, your leg is injured. It's not healed yet.

134
00:14:27,388 --> 00:14:33,328
Dad, we hurt him and the innocent wolves.

135
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:36,649
We can't just leave him alone and let him die.

136
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,308
I will beg His Majesty now.

137
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:40,508
Beg him to allow us to search for him!

138
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,969
- No.
- Dad!

139
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:45,370
- No!
- Dad, let me go! I'm going to save Wolf Boy!

140
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,429
- Zhaixing!
- Dad!

141
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,950
I know you want to protect him.

142
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,889
But I want to protect you

143
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:55,150
and our whole family.

144
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:59,350
What happened with Housekeeper Wang has put our family in danger.

145
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,149
If you disobey the decree now,

146
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,669
then we will be doomed.

147
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,508
My effort to secretly search for you did not go in vain.

148
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:24,450
Good.

149
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,749
That look in your eye is good.

150
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,509
Wild enough.

151
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:35,569
From now on, your life belongs to me.

[Command]

153
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,309
I am bestowing you this nobility token.

154
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,429
I am the emperor.

155
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:52,069
Maybe you don't understand that yet.

156
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:57,889
But I can give you everything you want.

157
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,989
Keep it quiet.

158
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,730
No one can know that I found Wolf Boy.

159
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,050
Pretend to search again tomorrow.

160
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,668
Yes, Your Majesty.

161
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:26,630
Right now, inside and outside the kingdom, in the light and in the dark,

162
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,349
I have enemies everywhere.

163
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,029
Moreover, the neighboring Jin Kingdom is getting stronger every day.

164
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:38,349
I need to hire talents.

165
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:43,089
So Your Majesty is adopting this boy for future use?

166
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,429
As long as he makes it through my tough training,

167
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:50,789
I want him to be a real wolf,

168
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,690
inside and out.

169
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,469
Your Majesty, the cure for him has some serious side effects.

170
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,869
Wolf Boy, I was wrong.

171
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:16,949
Please quickly come back, Xing'er.

172
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,710
[8 Years Later]

173
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:37,109
The Feudal Young Mistress' wedding is a big thing in town.

174
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,790
- Hurry up.
- Help me here!

175
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,908
Don't slack off while Feudal Lord is away.

176
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:43,169
- Go, go.
- Slow down!

177
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:45,148
Go help in the back if you're done here.

178
00:18:45,149 --> 00:18:47,249
- Make it quick.
- Yes.

179
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,649
Greetings, Feudal Young Mistress!

180
00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:10,969
With you being the acting Feudal Lord, may I ask you something other than important city affairs, like about your marriage?

181
00:19:10,969 --> 00:19:14,129
You've been asking me that over and over again.

182
00:19:14,129 --> 00:19:17,409
Go ahead. What is it today?

183
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:22,689
These are the lucky dates your future husband's house chose for you.

184
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:25,670
Please choose one.

185
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:30,088
All are lucky days. Any one would do.

186
00:19:31,149 --> 00:19:33,548
You are knowledgeable,

187
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:36,830
but you don't know the business between men and women.

188
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,309
They chose the lucky days for you to choose out of following customs and showing respect,

189
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:46,510
but there is truly something more to it.

190
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:50,470
They're just afraid I'll be having my period on my wedding day.

191
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,590
That's why I must choose a day to avoid that.

192
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,788
Young Mistress, since you know, why...

193
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:58,590
To tell you the truth,

194
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,289
I will break off the engagement.

195
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,989
What?

196
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,929
Your future husband's family is from the House of Shen,

197
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:11,789
a family that produced a first-ranking deputy minister of the Right Division of the Department of State Affairs!

198
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,950
If you do so, how would Feudal Lord explain it to them?

199
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:19,949
If you do so, no one would dare propose marriage to you from now on!

200
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,830
That is what I want.

201
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,428
I've kept this from you. My mistake.

202
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:31,089
But everything is just a show that I devised with the House of Shen.

203
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,470
The more real, the better.

204
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,709
These years, people come and propose marriage to me every day.

205
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,668
Very annoying.

206
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,148
So from the start, after I accepted their marriage proposal,

207
00:20:43,149 --> 00:20:48,750
I confessed to Shen's young master that I'd break off the engagement midway and ruin my reputation.

208
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,410
So no one would propose marriage to me again.

209
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,189
And our house has helped them before.

210
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:56,930
So he agreed.

211
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,029
Then... what should we tell Feudal Lord?

212
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,749
Father has urgent business in the capital.

213
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,169
And when he returns, I'll explain it to him myself.

214
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:09,949
Young Mistress!

215
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:12,330
Just handle the necessary matters!

216
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,290
[Suyang, Royal City of Yang Kingdom]

217
00:21:22,989 --> 00:21:24,769
Near the border between the two countries,

218
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:29,540
Yang Kingdom's State Stabilizing Marquis, Xiao Gui, is rampantly recruiting soldiers and stealing assets

219
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,350
to continue conquering the lands of Jin Kingdom.

220
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,029
Xiaobao! Xiaobao!

221
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,350
Eunuch Zhan, we must see His Majesty and ask him to rescind his order.

222
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,189
State Stabilizing Marquis may have committed treason, but it shouldn't involve his family.

223
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:59,189
Generals, His Majesty has been worrying over this issue and harmed his health.

224
00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:01,750
He fainted earlier this morning.

225
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,249
The royal physician is treating him now.

226
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:09,890
He specifically said that this is a critical moment and no one must interfere.

227
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,709
The Marquis's family is being surrounded by His Majesty's troops right now.

228
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,268
It's urgent!

229
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,009
General, when the physician is done,

230
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:22,789
I will be sure to report right away.

231
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:24,850
Thank you, Eunuch.

232
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,109
A court order is like a mountain. A royal decree is like the sky.

233
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,988
State Stabilizing Marquis Xiao Gui and his family have been unloyal and conspired with the enemy.

234
00:22:38,988 --> 00:22:40,869
He harbors intentions to overthrow the regime.

235
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,028
Immediately surround the Marquis Manor!

236
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:46,510
- Respect this!
- What conniving with the enemy? We are wronged!

237
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,988
- We will not surrender!
- Not surrendering?

238
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:52,650
Let him in!

239
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:55,428
Marquis!

240
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,029
- Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
- Marquis!

241
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:02,149
- Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!
- Marquis!

242
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:05,288
- Quiet!
- Lord Marquis!

243
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:07,668
Surrender and you will live.

244
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,849
If not, Marquis will be executed!

245
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:13,869
Do not surrender!

246
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,428
His Majesty clearly wants me dead.

247
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:21,730
No matter what, I will die!
[Xiao Gui, State Stabilizing Marquis]

248
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,190
Uncle!

249
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,329
Do not surrender even until death!

250
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:27,250
Rescue him!

251
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,610
Marquis!

252
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,909
There's a wolf!

253
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,310
Duke Bo is here!

254
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,630
Greetings, Prince of Bo!

255
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,989
For eight years, Wolf Boy, who thought he was betrayed by Zhaixing,

256
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:57,349
underwent rigorous training to become the cold-blooded Prince of Bo.

257
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:01,189
He was tricked and exploited by Chu Kui.

258
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,730
His Majesty has slightly recovered.

259
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,608
Generals, please enter.

260
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,349
Greetings, Your Majesty.

261
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:51,188
Rise.

262
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

263
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,529
We risk death to plead with Your Majesty to show mercy.

264
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,669
Please think twice.

265
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:08,810
Third Prince, Prince of Bo, is here for an audience!

266
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

267
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:45,309
Rise.

268
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:48,348
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

269
00:27:56,249 --> 00:28:01,589
As you all know, I have a foster son.

270
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:04,889
I treat him like my own.

271
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:08,829
He's been staying in the palace for a long time.

272
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:14,749
In recent years, I've had him do some important matters for me.

273
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:20,290
But border officials like you and a lot of other ministers have not seen him yet.

274
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,589
Why not get to know each other today?

275
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,410
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

276
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,989
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

277
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:32,870
You are excused.

278
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,889
Your Majesty.

279
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,100
State Stabilizing Marquis Xiao Gui has been dealt with according to law.

280
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,050
This...

281
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,530
Nice.

282
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:51,589
I think all of you are getting old.

283
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,489
Good.

284
00:28:53,489 --> 00:28:57,290
In governing the world, one must employ both harsh and gentle means.

285
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,390
Your benevolence and the courage of Prince of Bo are

286
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,069
all my favorites.

287
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:13,050
As long as you are loyal, I will make it worthwhile for you.

288
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,069
Feudal Lord, how did it go?

289
00:29:21,069 --> 00:29:24,669
We have decided to give up our military power.

290
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:31,090
Maybe that's the only way to protect my family and Kuizhou City.

291
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,989
Feudal Lord, the Ma Family Army only follow your lead.

292
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:41,168
If you hand over the military power to the Chu's, I'm afraid the troops won't agree.

293
00:29:41,168 --> 00:29:43,010
My mind is made up.

294
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,590
And His Majesty has ordered to divide the Ma Family Army.

295
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,650
Go to the border immediately

296
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,530
and tell them that they are now serving the imperial court.

297
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,109
I'm going to take Jun'er back to Kuizhou.

298
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:00,789
- Feudal Lord, I would never let you—
- That's a military order.

299
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:03,109
You cannot disobey it.

300
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:04,669
Yes.

301
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:23,750
Greetings, Emperor Father.

302
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:39,530
You've done an excellent job.

303
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:46,530
That's my boy.

304
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,988
Rise. Come.

305
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,789
Among my many princes,

306
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:02,829
you are my most trusted one.

307
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:10,650
The only thing that concerns me is that you might still have a weakness.

308
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,788
I want you to go back to Kuizhou. How about it?

309
00:31:17,788 --> 00:31:19,630
I will obey your command.

310
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,850
Right now, I can't let Ma Ying live.

311
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:38,010
But his daughter, Ma Zhaixing, might be of help in the future.

312
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:40,070
[Prince of Bo Manor]

313
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,488
I'd heard the owner would make their wolves' teeth into lucky charms.

314
00:32:29,488 --> 00:32:33,629
So, I asked an artisan to make you a wolf tooth necklace.

315
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,989
It can protect you along the way.

316
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,970
[Hai Die, Night Fiends]

317

[Wen Yan, Night Fiends]

318
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:02,509
- Wen Yan. Greetings, Master.
- Hai Die. Greetings, Master.

319
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:04,189
Where's Mo Xiao?

[Mo Xiao, Night Fiends]

00:33:17,449 --> 00:33:19,470
Greetings, Master.

322
00:33:27,269 --> 00:33:29,349
Mo Xiao was able to enter without being sensed.

323
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:31,010
You have improved.

324
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:35,549
You two need more practice.

325
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:36,769
Come with me.

326
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:38,669
Yes, Master.

327
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,709
There's a new mission for Night Fiends.

328
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,028
His Majesty has ordered us to go to Kuizhou and spy on Ma Ying.

329
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:51,029
Yes, Master.

330
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:59,209
With the State Stabilizing Marquis being executed, Jin's crown prince took advantage of it

331
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:03,530
and conquered the towns taken by the Marquis before.

332
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:07,668
He rectified the repressiveness aura and implemented a benevolent rule,

333
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:14,250
allowing the places to slowly thrive, welcoming an auspicious and peaceful life.

334
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,170
Take your pick, Sir. They are cheap and sweet.

335
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,520
[Ma Manor]

336
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,869
Xiao Feng, do people know about me breaking off the engagement already?

337
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:25,269
Yes.

338
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,788
But there are still some men who would like to propose and are waiting to see you.

339
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:34,509
Seriously?

340
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,189
You're smart and beautiful. Everyone knows it.

341
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:43,449
You may have broken off your engagement, but most people think that the Shen Mansion is not good enough for you and

342
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,449
that is why you stopped it in time. They are instead hailing you for it.

343
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,449
In order to find a mate, the mantis is willing to be eaten by the female mantis.

344
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:58,209
No matter what you do, you just can't stop them.

345
00:35:00,529 --> 00:35:03,609
Fine. Let's carry the thing through.

346
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:08,229
I'm going to let them know that they will only get nothing but despair by proposing marriage to me.

347
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,389
There is no hope for anyone.

348
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:15,009
Let's go meet them.

349
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,089
Yes.

350
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,510
Gentlemen, please take your seats.

351
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,529
Thank you, Feudal Young Mistress.

352
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,789
Young Mistress, this is the son of the deceased Minister Qi of the Department of State Affairs.

353
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:42,389
Young Mistress.

354
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:47,308
This is the son of Governor Liu of Luzhou Province.

355
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:52,549
And that's Xianjin Generalissimo Qiao's son.

356
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,610
Hello, Princess.

357
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,650
Xiao Feng has told me why you are here.

358
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,649
You're all from famous families with remarkable backgrounds.

359
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:04,069
Along the way, you must have seen the city and people here.

360
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:08,049
If you have any advice, please let me know.

361
00:36:08,049 --> 00:36:11,730
But if you gentlemen are here only to propose marriage,

362
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,249
I have to refuse you.

363
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:17,130
So it's true.

364
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:23,109
I've heard it before that you are never kind to the people who come to propose marriage.

365
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:25,049
You shut them out.

366
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:28,370
You even broke off your engagement.

367
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,330
You don't like them at all.

368
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,630
But we are good at everything.

369
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:41,389
Much better than that Shen Mansion lad or any other.

370
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,769
Feudal Young Mistress, if you have any tests, bring it on.

371
00:36:47,769 --> 00:36:50,130
- Xiao Feng.
- Yes, Young Mistress.

372
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:52,069
Bring it up!

373
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:06,550
Do you want us to make a poem out of these crates?

374
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:12,569
There are three butterflies in one of these three crates.

375
00:37:12,569 --> 00:37:17,790
If anyone can tell which one it is, we can talk about marriage.

376
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:22,309
The crates are tightly shut.

377
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:27,850
How shall we tell if there are butterflies in it or not?

378
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:29,890
With your ears.

379
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,689
Ears?

380
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:40,850
Everything in the world, whether it's the wind or butterflies, has a shape and sound.

381
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,590
The butterfly makes a sound when they flap their wings.

382
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,730
If you can hear it, you will know the answer.

383
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:55,988
That's strange. Someone in this world could actually hear it?

384
00:37:55,988 --> 00:37:58,170
I see.

385
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,289
Please wait.

386
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,569
Let's do this to break her arrogance.

387
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:08,089
I'm sure I can make her my concubine

388
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:11,470
so that we can make a name for ourselves.

389
00:38:15,149 --> 00:38:18,788
Gentlemen, have you made your choice?

390
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:39,189
Only after a long thought did I understand

391
00:38:39,189 --> 00:38:41,789
that this is about having both wisdom and courage.

392
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:45,310
You're testing our wisdom.

393
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:49,948
We'll each pick a crate. One of us would get it right.

394
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,869
In that case, only one of you would pass.

395
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:02,749
Everyone knows that proposing to you is extremely hard.

396
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:06,169
Coming here is more for the challenge.

397
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:11,049
As long as we pass it, it'll make us famous.

398
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:14,049
Whether we are going to marry or not,

399
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,449
it's worth it.

400
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:19,769
Yes.

401
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:23,450
Xiao Feng. Open them.

402
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,070
Yes.

403
00:39:27,629 --> 00:39:29,450
I'll go first.

404
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:38,069
Look at that. Young Lord Qiao, what a pity. Thank you for letting me win.

405
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,750
You didn't get it, too.

406
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,269
Two brothers, please open it.

407
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,869
Remember to attend my wedding.

408
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,590
This...

409
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:01,348
I knew early on that someone will come up with such a strategy.

410
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:03,670
It'll be missing the point.

411
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,730
If you could truly hear the wing-flapping sound of the butterfly,

412
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,949
you'd know they were all empty.

413
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,749
Feudal Young Mistress, you are making things hard on others.

414
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:18,370
May I ask who in this world can see the wind or hear

415
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,669
the sound of a butterfly flapping its wings?

416
00:40:22,669 --> 00:40:26,710
A wolf... probably can.

417
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:33,669
I also once thought it was impossible and would require extraordinary abilities.

418
00:40:33,669 --> 00:40:39,469
But after all these years, I slowly understood that it's not extraordinary.

419
00:40:39,469 --> 00:40:41,969
It's all about the heart.

420
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:44,009
If you want to be alone all your life, just say it.

421
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:51,570
No need to use that nonsense to make difficulties for me and humiliate us.

422
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,209
Okay.

423
00:40:53,209 --> 00:41:00,929
Then please go back and warn the others that I'll humiliate anyone who ever comes again to propose marriage.

424
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,330
Farewell.

Butterfly? Crates? Nonsense!

00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:11,369
Indeed. What kind of person is that?

428
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:13,489
I'm so tired.

429
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:21,048
Xiao Feng, if someone still comes tomorrow, just tell them I'm too sick to get up.

430
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,788
This test... Only that guy can pass.

431
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,550
But after all these years, we don't know if he's alive or dead.
