2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,600
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,200
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,800
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,000
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,200
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

13
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,400
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,500
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,800
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,200
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey (You took away what I care about and all my attention)  ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 44]

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,800
The girl wasn't that brave.

22
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
It wasn't because she was born brave

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,800
that she endured the pain.

24
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,200
It was because she was too timid.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,800
She cried a lot.

26
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,300
She cried when her mother passed away.

27
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,800
When her friends were gone,

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
she cried.

29
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,300
But then she realized

30
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,400
crying, weakness, and running away

31
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,400
would never bring back anything she had lost.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,800
Since she couldn't change her fate,

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,000
she changed herself.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,400
Her only choice was to move on.

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,000
She had to move faster than everyone else.

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,100
That was the only way to hide the fact

37
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,600
she was more afraid than anyone else.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Liu'er, remember, no one was born brave.

39
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,100
You will slowly grow stronger

40
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,800
from the fear you experience.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Someday,

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I believe you will be even braver than her.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
Sister Zhaixing, do you know that girl, too?

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,100
Give it back!

45
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,600
You're a bad guy!

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,500
I don't know her.

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,400
I only overheard Prince of Bo telling you her story.

48
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,300
It reminded me of some of my past experiences.

49
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,100
They were very much like hers.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Let's go.

51
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,800
This way, please.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
I, Chu Youwen, greet the King of Jin.

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
Even after several battles,

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,900
we still couldn't defeat your troops.

55
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,800
Now that we've met,

56
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,220
I can see you truly are a formidable warrior.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,400
I must thank you, Prince of Bo.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,200
You put the people's lives as priority

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
and were willing to be my ally.

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
You and the Qiannu Camp prisoners have just arrived recently.

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
How are you fitting in?

62
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,200
Very well.

63
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,400
I thank you for the shelter you provide.

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,100
I must thank you on everyone's behalf.

65
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,200
You are willing to aid me in ending the battle.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,900
I must thank you on behalf of all the people.

67
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,600
I am flattered.

68
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,200
I have a request to make.

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,600
Do tell.

70
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
If a battle breaks out between the two nations,

71
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,900
it must be a battle to end all battles.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,300
I believe that if the throne is succeeded by my fourth younger brother...

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,100
with Fourth Prince as ruler,

74
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,100
there will be peace between the two nations.

75
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,400
Our alliance must have brought struggles

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,100
to you in many ways.

77
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,600
Truth be told, you are right.

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,600
I understand how you must be feeling right now.

79
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I also know your concern for your fourth brother

80
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,400
and you don't want the people

81
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,000
to suffer the destruction of war.

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,000
If I offended you, I apologize.

83
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,200
I am actually quite happy.

84
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
It seems like the people have wronged you.

85
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,400
With Prince of Bo gone,

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,000
I can finally see your true nature.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,340
Before the alliance was formed, people doubted you.

88
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,600
But now I am even more certain

89
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,100
that you are the ally I need.

90
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,600
Your bond with your fourth brother is no surprise.

91
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,000
But for the people, I'll promise you.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Once Chu Kui's tyranny is over,

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
the agenda of this battle

94
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,600
will be to ensure peace between the two nations.

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,800
You care for all people.

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
I am impressed.

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,200
It's very easy.

98
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
Do you know why I always talk

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
and have meals with my sons?

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,000
I want to remind myself

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,400
that the common folks are very much like us.

102
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,700
They only need a place to call home.

103
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
But if you've made up your mind,

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
you shall be the general of the front line,

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,300
and join hands with Prince of Chuan for the greater good.

106
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
One more thing.

107
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,000
I can be considered an elder to you.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,300
Now that you're in Jin,

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,200
please do keep me company if you have the time.

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
We can take a walk together.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Sure.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,100
The Jin Army sent us some wine.

113
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,800
Leader took us with him and hunted on the mountain.

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,600
We're eating the bounties.

115
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,000
- This is delicious!
- Enjoy the food!

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
That... Let us

117
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,800
- drink to our leader's health!
- Sure!

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,200
Cheers! Cheers for our leader!

119
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
It's been a while since we had meat.

120
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Eat heartily. Come!

121
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Cheers! Let's drink!

122
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,900
The wine from Jin is too strong for me.

123
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,000
Indeed. The wine from our homeland is much smoother, right?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
Yes!

125
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,300
If we could have the roasted chicken my wife made,

126
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,000
it would be great!

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,600
In your dreams!

128
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,300
Wake up!

129
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,200
Our homeland... I don't know if we can ever go home.

130
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
I know.

131
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,800
It's been a while since I last visited my parents' graves.

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,400
I wonder if I can visit them before I die.

133
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,600
I also want to take my late father's belongings

134
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,400
back to the home I've never been to.

135
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Liu'er, we're not going back there.

136
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,400
We'll stay here, all right?

137
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,600
Yes!

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,000
We're not going back!

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,900
I'll take all of you home!

140
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,800
I've decided to ally with the King of Jin.

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,200
We'll minimize the number of casualties

142
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,600
and end Chu Kui's rule as soon as we can.

143
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,700
I'll give you back your homes.

144
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,000
Is this really happening?

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,800
We can go home?

146
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,200
Leader, are you telling us the truth?

147
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Don't you trust my capability?

148
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,200
No, that's not it!

149
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,800
We trust you!

150
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,000
Leader is taking us home.

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Come. Leader is taking us home!

152
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,700
We're going home!

153
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,200
- We're going home!
- This is great!

154
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Let's raise a toast to our leader!

155
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,600
- Come!
- Cheers!

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,900
Cheers!

157
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,400
After the work is done,

158
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'll go with you.

159
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,600
We'll pay respect to your parents.

160
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,000
There are some jars here.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,400
Let's use them for our bow-throwing.

162
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Let's have a few rounds of games.

163
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,400
- Loser drinks.
- Yes.

164
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Until we get drunk!

165
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Sure! The loser must admit defeat! Let's do this until we're drunk!

166
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Come! We'll drink to get drunk!

167
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,800
Cheers!

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,600
- You missed.
- You do it then.

169
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,500
You missed again!

170
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,000
Leader, why do you keep missing?

171
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Keep it going!

172
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
I got it!

173
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Nice!

174
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,600
Keep it going!

175
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,000
Can you not miss it for once?

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,700
Why don't you join us for a little while longer?

177
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,600
I never thought you would play pitch-pot with us.

178
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
You'll be living with me.

179
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,800
You'll get to know me better.

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,900
Leader, where did you get these beast traps?

181
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,700
I got them while I was hunting just now.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,600
I grew up with the wolves.

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,000
I saw them get wounded by these traps.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,400
So when I see one now, I disarm it.

185
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,000
Leader! You were raised by wolves?

186
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,600
Langshou Mountain of Kuizhou is where I grew up.

187
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
This is so cool, Leader!

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,000
It's no wonder your reflexes are so good.

189
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,200
So... you mentioned a girl that you met before you learned

190
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,200
how to talk like a human.

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
That girl sounds so interesting.

192
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
She actually accepted a kid who grew up with the wolves.

193
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,400
She even made you her friend.

194
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,000
Does that girl know how to disarm a beast trap?

195
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Wolf Boy!

196
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
It's all right, Wolf Boy.

197
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,100
Where is she now?

198
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
She is special and has a heart of gold.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,300
But she is gone.

200
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,400
Don't bother searching for her.

201
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,000
You must have heard.

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
Prince of Bo accepted the position

203
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
and joined hands with me.

204
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,700
Just now I sent some wine to the Qiannu Camp.

205
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,300
You've been writing for some time.

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,000
Take a break.

207
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,400
We are allies now.

208
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,700
We must take care of the Qianmu Camp.

209
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,400
Their houses are crude.

210
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,600
Check this for me.

211
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,000
Other than these necessities,

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,100
what else should we send them?

213
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,600
Zhaixing, it's been a while

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,900
since we've sat down and had dinner together.

215
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,300
We're both working on state affairs. We help each other.

216
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,400
Isn't that more meaningful than eating?

217
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,100
Zhaixing.

218
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,100
I feel like a husband and wife...

219
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,500
we are lacking something.

220
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,700
What is it?

221
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,800
What are you doing?

222
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,000
Nothing. Just some dirt.

223
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,500
Thank you.

224
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,400
I'll check if they need any other necessities.

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,300
Prince of Bo finally got convinced by the king to help us in the war.

226
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,000
We should ask Prince of Bo more about

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
how to break through Minzhou and Suyang.

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,700
Sure. Carry on with your work.

229
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,400
Remember to finish the tea I made.

230
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,500
Young Feudal Mistress.

231
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,000
Ma Jing, what is it?

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,500
When Ji Chong did this to you,

233
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,400
you should have tightened your lips

234
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
or just closed your eyes.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
What were you thinking?

236
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
And what is wrong with you?

237
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,700
Ji Chong didn't mean what you think it was.

238
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,300
My young mistress still doesn't understand how a relationship works.

239
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,800
And now Prince of Bo is back in the game.

240
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,700
I am worried Ji Chong's marriage with her will be affected.

241
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,100
Nothing, I said I was hungry.

242
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,000
Yao Ji, how was the investigation

243
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,800
by your men from Night Fiends?

244
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,200
Those from the Qiannu Camp are either dead or missing.

245
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,000
There is no evidence showing Prince of Yun was lying.

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,600
My health is getting worse by the day.

247
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,600
It's not improving.

248
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,400
Yao Ji, I must act while I can.

249
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,200
I must rebuild my authority!

250
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,800
I understand Your Majesty's intention.

251
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,600
There is a viable plan,

252
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
but the price is simply too great.

253
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,600
I don't care what it costs.

254
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,000
I must give it a chance!

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,800
We'll hold a ritual,

256
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,100
a prayer for your health and well-being.

257
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Make it happen tomorrow.

258
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,400
We must be patient.

259
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
We need a prosperous location to gather the aura.

260
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
If we could head for the Longevity Forest of Qitan,

261
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,000
the ritual could be carried out perfectly.

262
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Fine.

263
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Proceed with your plan.

264
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,600
Send a letter to the King of Qitan.

265
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,200
Inform him...

266
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,000
that I need to hold a prayer in the Longevity Forest.

267
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

268
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
As for the human sacrifices,

269
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,000
I suggest that the three subordinates of Prince of Bo from the Night Fiends

270
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,800
be our human sacrifice.

271
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,500
Execute them as a warning for Prince of Bo's betrayal.

272
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Those scoundrels by Prince of Bo's side,

273
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't mind killing them!

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, I will obey.

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
I'll proceed with the preparation of the ritual.

276
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,000
Three days from now, Your Majesty may journey to the Longevity Forest.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
Fine.

278
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,400
The ritual about extending His Majesty's life was all made up.

279
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,500
His Majesty's condition has made him too superstitious.

280
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,400
I must use this chance

281
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
to save Wen Yan and the others.

282
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,700
Mistress, Prince of Bo just betrayed us.

283
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
We're in the middle of a power struggle.

284
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Are you really going to risk your life to save the Night Fiends for Prince of Bo?

285
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,800
Maybe we should wait.

286
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,000
Prince of Bo is no longer under His Majesty's control.

287
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Saving the Night Fiends will remove all their worries.

288
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,800
As long as His Majesty still has them confined,

289
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,500
I'm afraid he might use them to deal with Prince of Bo in the future.

290
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Zi Shen.

291
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,800
Mistress.

292
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,200
I must meet up with Prince of Bo.

293
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,800
Keep an eye on His Majesty and Prince of Yun's every move.

294
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
As you wish.

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,700
A ritual?

296
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,800
Nonsense!

297
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:29,600
Does she think I wouldn't know any effort will be futile?

298
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Even now...

299
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Zhang Jin,

300
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,400
I only trust you and Yao Ji.

301
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,600
If we fail to extend my life,

302
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,700
tell me,

303
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:52,300
will you accompany me to my grave?

304
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,100
To be buried with Your Majesty is the greatest honor I could ask for.

305
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,500
I thank Your Majesty for this honor!

306
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,600
[Yun Royal Mansion]

307
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,200
Chuchu?

308
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
Chuchu?

309
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Chuchu?

310
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Your Highness.

311
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,500
Where is my consort?

312
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,000
Your Highness, Eunuch Zhang Jin came here this morning.

313
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,800
He said that His Majesty is not feeling well.

314
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,000
He needs Princess Consort to look after His Majesty.

315
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,800
She will stay in the palace for a few days.

316
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,300
Chuchu is not a physician! Why would they need her?

317
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,800
This is clearly a threat!

318
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,600
Your Highness, please calm down!

319
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,600
Send people to Feng Mansion immediately.

320
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,400
I want Official Feng here now!

321
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,200
Yes, Your Highness.

322
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,200
Princess Consort, we've arrived at the Lonely Village.

323
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,900
The prince has always been concerned about the people's life here at the Lonely Village.

324
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
He helped them build a garden

325
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,000
so they can grow food and sustain their lives.

326
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,600
I understand.

327
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,100
The home is only cozy when there is enough sunlight.

328
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,400
Install more windows for them.

329
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,900
Yes.

330
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,819
The weather has been unpredictable.

331
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:16,080
Houses like these can hardly withstand the weather.

332
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,499
Fortify the houses for these people.

333
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,720
As you wish, Princess Consort.

334
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,600
Young Mistress, if the prince knew you'd been helping with his work,

335
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,219
he would feel very happy about it.

336
00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:34,040
Bad news!

337
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,519
- Princess!
- Zhang Yuan.

338
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,719
Liu'er was disarming the beast traps with our leader,

339
00:22:40,719 --> 00:22:42,340
but he got himself hurt!

340
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,440
- What do we do now?
- But...

341
00:22:45,199 --> 00:22:47,399
Take him back to his house!

342
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:48,439
Yes!

343
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:51,500
Poor boy! He is so badly hurt.

344
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,540
Poor thing.

345
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,740
I need you to get me something.

346
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:06,499
To break through Minzhou, we need to focus on training the infantry.

347
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,739
Is something bothering you, Prince of Chuan?

348
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,460
Or did I offend you in some way?

349
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,959
I've known it would be like that. I've gathered the elite soldiers from the infantry camp.

350
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,539
We can inspect them later.

351
00:23:28,539 --> 00:23:32,560
You can train them with strategies for breaking through the enemies.

352
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,040
Impressive, Prince of Chuan.

353
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,619
Your action was swift.

354
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,280
I am impressed.

355
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,899
Indeed.

356
00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:46,060
I want peace for the world more than anyone else.

357
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,519
I don't want someone to work too hard on state affairs

358
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,080
and brush me off with some tea.

359
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:14,599
The princess might be busy,

360
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:18,019
but deep down she must care very much for you.

361
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,880
How so?

362
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,839
This is the Wandering Dew.

363
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:26,420
She only makes them for those she cares for.

364
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,820
You've had this before?

365
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,359
No.

366
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,719
When I was a boy,

367
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,080
whenever her father came home from work,

368
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,179
she would go up the mountain to gather the herbs.

369
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,880
Remember to finish the tea I made.

370
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,820
The scent is indeed refreshing.

371
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,199
Thanks.

372
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:05,699
If it wasn't for you,

373
00:25:05,699 --> 00:25:07,900
I wouldn't have known.

374
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,839
Don't mention it, Prince of Chuan.

375
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,239
Sometimes, you seem to know her better than I do.

376
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,140
Ever since we got married,

377
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,399
all I see in her is the woman who wishes the best for the world.

378
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,170
The once outgoing and carefree Ma Zhaixing I knew

379
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,210
has been gone for so long.

380
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:47,620
General, Chief Eunuch Shi relayed a message

381
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,619
that Liu'er was hurt.

382
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:55,259
Liu'er.

383
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,319
- Princess!
- You'll be all right.

384
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,660
Princess, look!

385
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,820
Are these the herbs you need?

386
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,960
No.

387
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,120
I'll keep searching.

388
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,599
I have some here.

389
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,319
Here is the herb.

390
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,180
Thank you.

391
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,480
General, it's like you could read her thoughts.

392
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,800
You knew exactly what she needed.

393
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,700
The beast trap, do you remember how to pull it out?

394
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,000
Liu'er, endure it a little.

395
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,940
We are helping you.

396
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,119
It's all right. It's opening.

397
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:27,479
Liu'er is losing too much blood!

398
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,660
What do we do, Young Mistress?

399
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,619
Zhaixing, do you need water?

400
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:44,780
Thanks, Ji Chong.

401
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,479
But water will reduce the effectiveness of the herb.

402
00:27:47,479 --> 00:27:49,399
We can't use water right now.

403
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,239
All right.

404
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:27,239
Let him sleep for a while.

405
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,960
Sister Zhaixing,

406
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,060
so you know how to disarm a beast trap, too.

407
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:40,860
You must be that very kind girl

408
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,019
who Leader misses so much.

409
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:49,860
I am not.

410
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,560
Now, sleep.

411
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,159
Let's go.

412
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll escort both of you.

413
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,820
Wait, General.

414
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:10,899
What happened today doesn't mean I still have an attachment to our past.

415
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:13,219
I just wanted to save the kid.

416
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,380
You and I will never see eye to eye.

417
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,299
But for the greater good,

418
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,519
I will set my grudge for you aside.

419
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,380
I hope you understand.

420
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,359
I know.

421
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:36,480
Zhaixing, was that necessary?

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,280
He and I may be allies for now,

423
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,959
but it's only temporary.

424
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:43,479
He still owes me for killing my father.

425
00:29:43,479 --> 00:29:47,719
My status right now is your consort.

426
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:52,940
Less distraction is better for all of us.

427
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,659
Zhaixing, you misunderstood.

428
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:01,259
- Back in Boxiang, Prince of Bo was—
- Your consort is right.

429
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:07,739
Our work aside,

430
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,380
what's left between us is only grudges.

431
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,079
It's a fact that will never change.

432
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,960
I was supposed to be dead.

433
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,380
I shouldn't even be here.

434
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,520
I shouldn't disrupt the peaceful life she wants.

435
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,259
What matters most is to end the war.

436
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:33,260
Let the people have peace in their life.

437
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,499
This is what Princess Consort wants.

438
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:45,359
As for other trivial matters that would torment her,

439
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:47,060
let's not bring them up again.

440
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,600
Am I right, Prince of Chuan?

441
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,880
I understand what you mean.

442
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,939
Take good care of Liu'er.

443
00:31:08,939 --> 00:31:11,699
Don't let him search for beast traps again.

444
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,920
Let's go home.

445
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:42,359
Eunuch.

446
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,439
Did you get what I asked?

447
00:31:46,439 --> 00:31:48,940
Yes, he is inside.

448
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,160
You are dismissed.

449
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,600
Yes.

450
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,019
The gold is here.

451
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,779
Do as I say.

452
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,900
Be buried along with His Majesty in my stead.

453
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,680
After all, we share a rather similar face.

454
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:37,120
Prince of Yun!

455
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,960
Aren't you curious why I am here at this moment?

456
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,339
Prince of Yun!

457
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,740
Have mercy on me!

458
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,519
Of course, I could let you go.

459
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,819
But if my father found out his loyal servant Zhang Jin

460
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,939
refused to be buried with him

461
00:32:56,939 --> 00:33:00,480
and hired someone with a similar face to replace him...

462
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,879
I think you know very well what awaits you.

463
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:07,820
Your Highness...

464
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,019
How did Your Highness find out?

465
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:13,600
When I was having the conversation,

466
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,820
there was no one around!

467
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,780
Your Highness must have many spies in this palace!

468
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,280
That's why you know everything!

469
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,859
I only lied because I wanted to live.

470
00:33:33,859 --> 00:33:36,200
Please have mercy!

471
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,059
I need you to do me a favor.

472
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,419
What happened today doesn't mean I still have an attachment to our past.

473
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,980
You and I will never see eye to eye.

474
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,420
How long have you been here?

475
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,939
Ma Zhaixing went through hell and fire to save you.

476
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,799
But she put you in this crude hut?

477
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,299
Is this all for revenge or to avoid gossip?

478
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,560
She and I are merely military allies.

479
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
That's all.

480
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,920
Not to mention she is now Prince of Chuan's consort,

481
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,980
while I am a prisoner of war.

482
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:45,660
This place is quite good.

483
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,099
It suits me.

484
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,780
After obtaining a second chance in life in Qiannu Camp,

485
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:00,339
all you want is to end the suffering for the people and help Prince of Xun ascend to the throne.

486
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,380
I told you.

487
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,640
You're not fit to lead the Night Fiends.

488
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,139
You are too kind for the job.

489
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:17,240
I arranged for the Night Fiends

490
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,200
to become human sacrifices for His Majesty's ritual.

491
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,019
When the time comes,

492
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:26,139
just work with me and all three of your people can be saved.

493
00:35:26,139 --> 00:35:30,320
The details of the operation are in the letter.

494
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,980
Take a look.

495
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,479
Those three are safe for the time being.

496
00:35:39,479 --> 00:35:43,639
As you said, two things worry you.

497
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:45,619
One is your fourth brother,

498
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,860
the other one is Mo Xiao and the gang.

499
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,480
First, we save them.

500
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,860
That's one less thing to worry about.

501
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,980
You'll then have more chances to save your brother.

502
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,540
Yao Ji, thank you.

503
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I am nothing now.

504
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:12,800
Why are you still helping me?

505
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:24,819
You and I promised to live and die as one.

506
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,939
But what really

507
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,360
is making you refuse to abandon me?

508
00:36:32,679 --> 00:36:34,460
Do you still remember?

509
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:39,260
You once told me

510
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,300
I wasn't alone.

511
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,879
See it however you want,

512
00:36:44,879 --> 00:36:48,939
but I do take this promise very seriously.

513
00:36:49,479 --> 00:36:51,220
Remember.

514
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,999
You're not alone.

515
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
I'm here for you.

516
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,099
From that moment on,

517
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:05,460
I'd decided

518
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:09,500
you're my only...

519
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:17,759
family.

520
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,279
We're a family.

521
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:24,819
We shouldn't give up on each other.

522
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,980
Or perhaps it was my wishful thinking.

523
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,760
We grew up together.

524
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,439
We went through so much together in the past.

525
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,940
You read me just by looking in my eyes.

526
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,139
We are more than just family.

So he takes after Your Majesty on this.

541
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,719
Father Emperor, I am here to visit you.

542
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,340
I wonder what your conversation was about?

543
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,420
You two seem to be having fun.

544
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,239
I was just talking about Your Highness's hobby.

545
00:39:42,239 --> 00:39:46,660
I was told His Majesty used to like wood carving.

546
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:49,019
I never knew this before.

547
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,920
Recently I've been feeling better

548
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,159
and have a better appetite.

549
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:58,320
But I am still an old man.

550
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,299
My strength and sight are not what they used to be.

551
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,640
I can't carve anything myself.

552
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,199
But you are still strong, my son.

553
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:09,919
You can easily carve anything you want.

554
00:40:09,919 --> 00:40:14,460
Chuchu told me you were carving an eagle statue.

555
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,620
You must be aiming to soar high above the sky.

556
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,640
How ambitious of you.

557
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,520
Not at all, Father Emperor.

558
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,640
I was merely doing it to kill time.

559
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,839
Chuchu, don't you think your husband is a little tense?

560
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:35,519
His Highness has always taken Your Majesty's words very seriously.

561
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,460
He often tells me that sharing Your Majesty's burden was a great fortune for him as your son.

562
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,259
I have always noticed his filial piety.

563
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:45,960
I will never forget.

564
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,139
I'm planning to do something for the two of you.

565
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:53,359
Thank you, Your Majesty.

566
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,400
Chuchu, the miscarriage took a toll on your health.

567
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,119
You haven't had a child since.

568
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,639
I plan to have Yao Ji prepare acupuncture treatment for you to help with recovery.

569
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:05,199
No!

570
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,360
Why?

571
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:14,580
Are you worried I might cause Chuchu more harm?

572
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,020
Not at all.

573
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,720
But I already had an imperial physician give Chuchu therapy.

574
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,559
She's been taking the medicine for quite a while.

575
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,860
The physician advised us to take the medicine continuously for months.

576
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,939
The medication can't be combined with other treatments.

577
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:28,639
Otherwise, it will hinder the recovery.

578
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:33,460
It's just for a short period of time.

579
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,440
Prince of Yun, Chuchu is a brilliant girl.

580
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,319
I'm very fond of her.

581
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,340
I hope she can stay here with me.

582
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,819
Do you mind?

583
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,500
I wouldn't dare.

584
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,919
Your Majesty, it's time for your medicine.

585
00:41:57,919 --> 00:41:59,679
Bring it here.

586
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,900
I'll test the medicine for Your Majesty.
