[Episode 36]
[Boxiang]

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,670
Our scouts have reported that Prince of Bo has deployed his troops.

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,370
It is exactly as our king predicted.

23
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,169
My old man has foreseen

24
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,569
that judging from how freakish Chu Kui can be,

25
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:52,990
as long as we strike first and win a battle,

26
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,490
we can enrage him into attacking us.

27
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,869
Now, Prince of Bo must be executing his orders.

28
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:07,929
He's using his best soldiers to conquer Boxiang.

29
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:12,529
But our own elite troops,

30
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,529
General Wang Rong and the Ma Army, are also deployed around Boxiang.

31
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:22,530
Boxiang will be easy to hold, but hard to attack.

32
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,770
- That's why this battle...
- Will be an endurance battle.

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,070
We just need to defend the city.

34
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,568
With our king supplying us with food and information,

35
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,689
we have a secure backing

36
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:39,330
and Chu Kui would never expect that Prince of Bo's troops

37
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,230
can't even conquer a mere city.

38
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,510
Then, fueled by his embarrassment and frustration,

39
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,690
he'd deploy all his troops here.

40
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,690
By then, my old man will lead a huge army

41
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,170
and surround Chu Kui from behind.

42
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,970
The king is truly impressive.

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,830
He knows everything about Chu Kui's actions, mindset, and temperament.

44
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:10,170
Chu Kui will go down for sure.

45
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,128
Your Highness!

46
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,049
Your Highness, Prince of Bo's troops are here!

47
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,249
What? This fast?

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,890
His army is right in front of the city gates.

49
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,829
What will be... will come.

50
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,050
[Boxiang]

51
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,189
Send a messenger in.

52
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,329
I'd like to chat with Young Feudal Mistress Ma herself.

53
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,550
Yes, Prince of Bo.

54
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,788
- Tell the archers to be prepared.
- Yes, Your Highness!

55
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:20,009
General!

56
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,610
Your Highness.

57
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,310
Your Highness, I have important news.

58
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,409
It has to do with this battle.

59
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:33,390
What's going on, Prince Wang?

60
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:36,268
They're my allies. Just tell us.

61
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,930
May the heavens bless Jin.

62
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,129
The unbeatable Prince of Bo actually has a fatal weakness.

63
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,330
Your Highness!

64
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:52,049
We received a letter from Prince of Bo's troops.

65
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,350
Prince of Bo sent a letter through his messenger

66
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:02,269
that he wants the princess to meet him outside the city tomorrow morning.

67
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:04,808
He said it concerns all under Heaven.

68
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,989
He also promised that the princess will return safely.

69
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,009
However, if the princess is too timid to meet him in person,

70
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,369
when the hour passes, he will lead his troops to attack the city.

71
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:19,968
Let him attack then!

72
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:22,469
Why must we let Zhaixing take the risk?

73
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,189
I'll go.

74
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:32,980
Prince Wang, please inform Prince of Bo's messenger.

75
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,089
No, Zhaixing.

76
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:37,950
If you go, you'd be entering the lion's den.

77
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,110
You need to enter the lion's den to catch the lion.

78
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,408
Now, he is inviting me to meet him as a commanding general.

79
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,849
I'm sure he wants to persuade me to surrender

80
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,489
and stir my resolve rather than pull any dirty tricks.

81
00:06:53,489 --> 00:06:54,848
No.

82
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,089
What if Prince of Bo goes against his word?

83
00:06:58,089 --> 00:06:59,890
I will not agree to this.

84
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,450
How can I let you take the risk alone?

85
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,629
Then, will you agree,

86
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,830
will you be willing to lower yourself and be my personal guard instead?

87
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,510
Follow me to meet Prince of Bo?

88
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,869
Fine, then.

89
00:07:21,869 --> 00:07:24,189
It's settled.

90
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:29,269
I'd love to see what Prince of Bo is really up to.

91
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:37,489
Zhuiri, I know you must be laughing at me. Right?

92
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,889
In the end, I still have to listen to everything Ma Zhaixing says.

93
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,410
I'm no longer the person I once was.

94
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:50,869
I had a whimsical and carefree life.

95
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:54,589
I was free to do anything.

96
00:07:57,089 --> 00:07:59,269
But when you love someone,

97
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,770
I guess that's the price you pay.

98
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,030
That's why I stopped wandering around like a vagabond

99
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,848
just to stay by her side.

100
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:15,529
No matter what she does in the future, I won't stop her.

101
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,809
I will grant her every wish.

102
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:34,309
Although a battle is impending,

103
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:41,550
but the breeze is still calm and heartwarming.

104
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,870
Is that so?

105
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,630
Why do I think that

106
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,630
this wind is blowing madly instead?

107
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,488
Look.

108
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,650
Your hair is messed up.

109
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:21,510
Let's get back to the important stuff.

110
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,389
Why do you think Prince of Bo wants to meet you alone?

111
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,610
I think he's trying to frighten me

112
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:38,430
so I can understand how daunting a real war can be,

113
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:41,489
and how many people will die on the battlefield.

114
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,450
He will use this to break my resolve.

115
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,949
But he doesn't know that

116
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:50,350
once the Wolfbone Flower is activated,

117
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,609
we can reduce the number of casualties to the minimum.

118
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,589
So, no matter what,

119
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,169
we must delay Prince of Bo's attack to the day after tomorrow,

120
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,149
when the Wolfbone Flower is complete.

121
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:08,090
Actually,

122
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,410
the real battle has already begun.

123
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:17,529
Exactly.

124
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:25,190
Ji Chong, get me some butterflies.

125
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,250
Butterflies?

126
00:10:31,609 --> 00:10:33,509
Take it as

127
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,770
my first gift for him.

128
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,670
Your Highness, good news!

129
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:11,369
Your Highness, Military Marquis Liu Shouguang's 30,000-heavy cavalry has arrived.

130
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:14,830
Also, Prince of Bo will meet Ma Zhaixing before the battle

131
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,210
to shake and break her resolve.

132
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,710
Good!

133
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,570
With the heavily armored cavalry

134
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,769
and Prince of Bo's knowledge of Ma Zhaixing's weaknesses,

135
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,550
I shall not worry about losing the battle.

136
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,668
Mistress, here's your favorite golden flower tea.

137
00:12:04,669 --> 00:12:06,209
Put it down.

138
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,488
Zi Shen, I have a question.

139
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,549
Out of all our patients in a locked-in state,

140
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,128
is there anyone whose eyes seem to notice

141
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,749
what's going on around them?

142
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:24,509
Mistress, don't even say they can see anything.

143
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,329
We've gathered so many patients like that,

144
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,350
and we did everything we could,

145
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,190
but none of them showed any reactions.

146
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,349
Besides, if they can see what's going on around them,

147
00:12:38,349 --> 00:12:41,670
that means they're not vegetables.

148
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,629
He's not a vegetable?

149
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:49,549
Mistress, has Fourth Prince showed any reactions?

150
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:54,029
Other than the king, who else visits the prince the most?

151
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,990
That would be the prince's cousin, Major Yang Hou.

152
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,880
Keep a low profile and observe Yang Hou.

153
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,531
See if he's doing anything out of the ordinary.

154
00:13:10,531 --> 00:13:12,389
Yes, Mistress.

155
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,969
I have many friends, so I know how to gather information.

156
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,269
Prince of Bo is about to battle.

157
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,569
I hope nothing goes wrong.

158
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,150
Looks like your gait has grown much steadier.

159
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,770
Your fighting skills have improved by leaps and bounds.

160
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,249
Once you train longer,

161
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:23,710
perhaps you may be my match, barely.

162
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,230
Is that so?

163
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,489
But I seem to see

164
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:32,150
no improvements in you.

165
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,230
All you know is still wagging your tongue to brag.

166
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,360
I can't help but feel uninterested.

167
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,870
You seem to be overly confident

168
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,409
for a common fighter like you.

169
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,890
These are scabbards of the Ma Army.

170
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:03,389
I'm sure you can recognize them.

171
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,030
Zhaixing, be steady.

172
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,330
Don't forget what we agreed upon.

173
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,129
We're here just to meet Prince of Bo

174
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:18,750
and see what farcical tricks he has under his sleeve.

175
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,629
I only want to advise you with good intention.

176
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,070
If you want to send some spies over,

177
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,410
please don't choose the weaker ones.

178
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,630
This morning,

179
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,710
- I'd personally captured several soldiers from the Ma Army.
- You–

180
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:41,389
Prince of Bo! Prepare to die!

181
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,250
We agreed not to fight in this meeting.

182
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,510
I do not wish to become the laughing stock of the entire world.

183
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,710
And if we do fight,

184
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,969
you will be the one dead.

185
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,330
General Ma.

186
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,710
Prince of Bo.

187
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,690
I will find a way to save them.

188
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,409
Those soldiers were captured

189
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:51,010
all because of you.

190
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,908
You have always been cruel and callous.

191
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,310
You even killed Zhaixing's family.

192
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,829
When did you become so sentimental?

193
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,290
Your speech is akin to how a crocodile sheds fake tears.

194
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:11,209
Zhaixing, don't waste your breath on him.

195
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,089
You said you're here for all under Heaven?

196
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:20,410
I think you're just trying to shake her resolve.

197
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,868
Zhaixing, let's go.

198
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,290
Ma Zhaixing!

199
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,730
Are you going to be this selfish

200
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,729
and ignore the lives of your soldiers?

201
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,269
Then, when we battle tomorrow,

202
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,670
I will order my troops

203
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,409
to spare the Jin Army, Wang Rong, and the like.

204
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,870
But killing the Ma Army

205
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,109
will be our top priority.

206
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,029
Tell me then!

207
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:07,270
Why are you trying so hard to torture me?

208
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,950
Simple.

209
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,710
Surrender.

210
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,249
Then, I will promise

211
00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:22,769
to stay away from you

212
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,369
for the rest of my life.

213
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,169
How preposterous.

214
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,090
Are you trying to win without a battle?

215
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,190
My conditions will be valid until noon.

216
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,910
After that, I will spare no one.

217
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:44,150
Even if my troops were to die altogether,

218
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,390
we will never let go of any soldier from the Ma Army.

219
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,249
That includes him, Ma Yehan,

220
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,890
and your favorite, Ma Jing.

221
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,110
You do know

222
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,590
I do what I say.

223
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,109
Are you telling the truth?

224
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:22,010
Ma Zhaixing, don't believe him.

225
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,130
Two days.

226
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,030
I will give you a reply in two days.

227
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,890
Two more days?

228
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,510
I heard that the King of Jin is a decisive man.

229
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,909
Does he need that long to decide whether to battle?

230
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,890
Don't tell me

231
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,989
your king isn't in the city.

232
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,129
Prince of Bo, stop your nonsensical talk.

233
00:19:58,129 --> 00:19:59,729
The princess is concerned

234
00:19:59,729 --> 00:20:03,090
that this is the season for butterflies to metamorphose.

235
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,609
The battle will disturb the forest and the butterflies.

236
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:12,510
That's why she ordered if a ceasefire can be possible, try to have one.

237
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,329
The butterflies, you say?

238
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,709
I almost forgot that back at Langshou Mountain,

239
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:34,229
you loved gazing at butterflies.

240
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,510
To think a princess can be so sentimental.

241
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,549
I like butterflies.

242
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:47,409
It has nothing to do with you or Langshou Mountain.

243
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,170
Fine.

244
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,670
For the sake of the butterflies,

245
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,110
I'll give you two more days

246
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:05,389
to decide whether you will battle or surrender.

247
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,620
After all, the butterflies were once my favorite, too.

248
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,569
To me, a day doesn't pass

249
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,431
without reminiscing about what happened in Langshou Mountain.

250
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:27,870
When I close my eyes,

251
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,310
I can vividly see

252
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,449
each and every tree in the mountain.

253
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,149
Unfortunately, when I open my eyes,

254
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,430
I can hold on to nothing.

255
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,029
Isn't that correct, Ma Zhaixing?

256
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,129
Two days later, I shall arrive at the city gates

257
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,329
and wait for your reply.

258
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:31,929
Not bad, General Ma.

259
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:33,510
Brilliant acting.

260
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,549
Our rehearsal last night really paid off.

261
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:42,710
General, do you think Prince of Bo will really believe what I just said?

262
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:49,429
Also, Your Highness, are we really waiting for the butterflies?

263
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,590
I must thank both of you for catching the butterflies

264
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,810
and releasing them before the meeting.

265
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,849
Additionally, it's as if these butterflies do belong here,

266
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:05,229
and Ye Han doesn't look like a liar.

267
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:09,710
I think we will not invite Prince of Bo's suspicions.

268
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,530
If he really bought it, we can pacify him for two days.

269
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,089
By then, our Wolfbone Flower will have been prepared.

270
00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:21,269
It was you who came up with this plan.

271
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:25,310
Speaking of which,

272
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,170
I did learn this from the cruelest person in the world.

273
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:36,829
He once taught me...

274
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:40,810
Remember, when a battle breaks out, it's either death or victory.

275
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,869
You need to be cunning and deceive your enemy.

276
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:50,949
This time, I, Ma Zhaixing, will not give in to my feelings.

277
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,590
Prince of Bo sent a message saying that Ma Zhaixing

278
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:02,290
is nothing but an empty shell.

279
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,890
A few snide remarks from him was all it took to shake her resolve.

280
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,729
Yao Ji, you once said

281
00:24:08,729 --> 00:24:12,610
that Ma Zhaixing is Prince of Bo's nemesis.

282
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:18,570
Looks like she's not that much of a hindrance anyway.

283
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,050
Your Highness, you are blessed with a good life

284
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:23,449
and you have Prince of Bo's loyal support.

285
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:26,989
Of course, you do not need to worry about her.

286
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:31,529
Prince of Bo even suggested that I fight on the front lines myself

287
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:34,249
so I can motivate the troops

288
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:37,589
and conquer the city easily.

289
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:40,890
Yang Hou, what do you think?

290
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:46,410
Your Highness, I think you absolutely can fight on the front lines.

291
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,030
Very well!

292
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,848
Zhang Jin, pass my order.

293
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:53,968
Tomorrow morning, I shall fight on the front lines of Boxiang.

294
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:56,189
Yes, Your Majesty.

295
00:24:56,189 --> 00:25:01,630
Your Majesty, do you think Fourth Prince can follow as well?

296
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,529
I observed that ever since you started feeding him medicine yourself,

297
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,670
his illness is showing improvement.

298
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,488
In my opinion, we should bring him along.

299
00:25:12,489 --> 00:25:15,870
Then bring Youzhen with us.

300
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:20,489
When we conquer Boxiang, I shall kill that darned woman,

301
00:25:20,489 --> 00:25:25,329
Ma Zhaixing, right in front of him.

302
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:28,249
Yes, your wish is my command.

303
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,949
Guard the entrance.

304
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:49,569
Do not let anyone enter.

305
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,930
If the king comes, greet him loudly so I may hear.

306
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:56,609
- Understood?
- Yes, Major.

307
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,950
Your Highness, it is I.

308
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,608
Thank you, Cousin.

309
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:25,589
Is everything ready?

310
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,449
Did any mishaps happen?

311
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:29,848
Don't worry, Your Highness. I have been absolutely meticulous.

312
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,770
The king is not suspecting anything.

313
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,609
Tomorrow, we will advance to the front lines of Boxiang.

314
00:26:35,609 --> 00:26:41,068
Right now, I have sent my men to conceal themselves among the Yang Troop.

315
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:45,990
When you sound the call, they will act.

316
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,488
However, it must have been tough on you.

317
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:50,809
To think you had to act like a vegetable the whole day.

318
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,790
No matter how tough it is,

319
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,410
as long as I can avenge my big brother,

320
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,650
everything is worth it.

321
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,569
You are doing a just deed.

322
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,369
You will succeed.

323
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,829
Usually, that old guy is always on his guard,

324
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,409
suspicious of everything.

325
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,690
We have no room to strike at all.

326
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,570
Now that a battle is impending,

327
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,790
he will solely concentrate on the King of Jin.

328
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,170
Since he is battling external forces now,

329
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,870
he will lower his guard against us.

330
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,409
Whether we succeed or not depends on this one plan.

331
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,049
This is our last chance.

332
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,969
Yes, Your Highness.

333
00:27:28,969 --> 00:27:33,290
When the battle begins, I will not let you down!

334
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:42,169
You have traveled the entire night, Father Emperor. Are you doing well?

335
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:44,010
Rise.

336
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,609
Thank you, Father Emperor.

337
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:51,869
For this battle, I have brought you a 30,000 heavily armored cavalry.

338
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,910
I shall conquer Boxiang.

339
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,910
Well? In your opinion,

340
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:07,810
will Ma Zhaixing surrender tomorrow?

341
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,149
Father Emperor, judging from Ma Zhaxing's personality,

342
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:17,929
since she is supported by the enemy, she will not surrender easily.

343
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,969
But I believe Ma Zhaixing's resolve must have been shaken.

344
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:29,410
Do you think she will sacrifice the whole Ma Army merely for her personal interests?

345
00:28:31,489 --> 00:28:33,829
The battlefield is violent.

346
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:37,670
How can a mere woman like her handle it?

347
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:42,489
Now, the more merciful she is,

348
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:46,929
the worse the Ma Army will suffer from her actions.

349
00:28:46,929 --> 00:28:51,840
Prince of Bo, confusing Ma Zhaixing

350
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,890
was a brilliant tactic.

351
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,410
Thank you, Father Emperor.

352
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,189
I will pay any price to avenge Fourth Brother.

353
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:07,990
Good.

354
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,969
I have decided that tomorrow morning, you will lead our Three Armies

355
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,649
and summon our undercover soldiers

356
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,410
so we can muster all the strength we need to quash Boxiang.

357
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,310
Yes, your wish is my command.

358
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,089
To think Chu Kui is here now.

359
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:37,910
I'm afraid tomorrow will be the day Prince of Bo strikes.

360
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:41,590
Our scouts reported that

361
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,810
Chu Kui has brought a 30,000 heavily armored cavalry.

362
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,910
Their army will be stronger than ever.

363
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:53,010
Eldest Brother, thank you for extracting the Wolfbone Flower.

364
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,929
When Prince of Bo attacks tomorrow, once he loses his ability to battle,

365
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,169
I shall lead my troops to exterminate his army

366
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,209
down to the last soldier.

367
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,910
Juyao, about tomorrow's battle,

368
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:13,329
I have already discussed it with the princess.

369
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:20,529
Since Chu Kui is among Prince of Bo's troops now, he is within our reach.

370
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,368
Our objective is to capture the enemy's leader.

371
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,770
It's not just Prince of Bo, but also Chu Kui himself.

372
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:31,329
We need an elite army

373
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,328
to strike when we battle with Prince of Bo's troops.

374
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,390
They must strike as fast as the wind and pulverize Chu Kui's camp.

375
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,209
If they succeed, we can capture Chu Kui alive.

376
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,070
And this mission...

377
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,510
is yours to handle.

378
00:30:56,849 --> 00:30:59,970
Tomorrow will be the day we battle Prince of Bo.

379
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,270
Without me here, what about you?

380
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:06,248
I must stay here to entice the enemy;

381
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,349
or else, Prince of Bo will grow suspicious.

382
00:31:08,349 --> 00:31:09,609
No.

383
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:13,170
Before the war ends, I will not leave you.

384
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,750
Ji Chong!

385
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,970
No one is more important than you.

386
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,449
Zhaixing, if anything happens to you,

387
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:24,290
even if I win the whole world, so what?

388
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,389
There's no better candidate.

389
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:30,530
Among us, Military Marquis Wang's forte is the cavalry,

390
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,109
and mine is defense, not offense.

391
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:36,820
Juyao, judging from the current situation,

392
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,290
only you can handle this task.

393
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:43,989
You...

394
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:49,829
So you've already decided to force me into battle.

395
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:51,809
Don't worry, Juyao.

396
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,209
We will protect the princess on your behalf.

397
00:31:54,209 --> 00:31:57,368
Prince of Bo won't even hurt one single hair of hers.

398
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:02,669
Juyao, this battle is our greatest chance

399
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:05,129
of winning the entire war.

400
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:10,010
Fine.

401
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:16,650
I'll win this battle, then.

402
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:18,890
We'll travel around the world.

403
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,129
Do you remember your promise?

404
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,069
Fine.

405
00:32:32,069 --> 00:32:35,869
I believe everyone will take good care of the princess.

406
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:38,968
Tomorrow, we will pulverize the enemy's troops.

407
00:32:38,969 --> 00:32:41,489
I don't care what challenges await us.

408
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:45,570
I will slaughter them all!

409
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,509
Slaughter them!

410
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,109
Slaughter them!

411
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,830
Why have you come at this hour?

412
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:59,349
Tomorrow, you must not let your resolve shake.

413
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:03,609
Yao Ji, don't worry about me.

414
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,249
I just want you to treat my brother.

415
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:10,969
His life is more important than mine.

416
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:13,390
Perhaps, when you return triumphantly,

417
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,929
your dear brother will be awake.

418
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,300
Good.

419
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,000
That gives me another reason

420
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,400
to kill Ma Zhaixing.

421
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,400
Tomorrow, we will advance to the front lines of Boxiang.

422
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,400
When you sound the call, our men will act.

423
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,300
No matter how tough it is,

424
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,200
as long as I can avenge my eldest brother,

425
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,500
everything is worth it.

426
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Prince of Bo, the more you are willing to sacrifice for Fourth Prince,

427
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,100
the more you can't let him know the truth.

428
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,000
Your Majesty,

429
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,000
I deserve to die.

430
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,600
Yao Ji, what do you mean?

431
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,100
Master.

432
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,600
Have you readied our men inside the city?

433
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,800
As you have ordered,

434
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,700
everything is ready.

435
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,500
Please be mentally prepared for tomorrow's battle.

436
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
[The Battle of Boxiang]

437
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,800
Ma Zhaixing!

438
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Two days have now passed.

439
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,000
I am here at the city gates to obtain your reply.

440
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,300
Will you surrender?

441
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,800
- Give me the arrow.
- Yes, Your Highness.

442
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,800
Fight, fight, fight!

443
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,000
I understand.

444
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,800
So this is your reply.

445
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Your Highness, brilliant shot!

446
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,400
Today, we must kill him.

447
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,700
Master, it's time to sound the call for our men inside the city.

448
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,000
What time is it now?

449
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Daybreak is almost over.

450
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,600
After daybreak comes morning.

451
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Fourth Brother should be taking his medicine now.

452
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Your Highness!

453
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,800
Youzhen.

454
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,600
Father Emperor, hand over the jade seal.

455
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,800
Then, I will spare you!

456
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,600
What are you doing?

457
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,200
My eldest brother must have blessed me from the heavens

458
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,500
to let me awaken at the ancestral temple

459
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,400
and let me know the truth about everything!

460
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Your Highness, time is precious.

461
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Focus on important matters.

462
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Get the jade seal so you can take command!

463
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,500
The jade seal?

464
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,400
I sent someone to send it back to Suyang.

465
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,900
You liar!

466
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,200
My child, I don't need to lie.

467
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,500
Since I already know...

468
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,200
Your Highness!

469
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,600
Your Highness!

470
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Men!

471
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,600
- Attack him!
- Stop!

472
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,100
You...

473
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Don't be surprised.

474
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,000
Looks like you knew it all along.

475
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,000
Yang Hou,

476
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,000
how dare you?

477
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Stop!

478
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,600
Yang,

479
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,400
if you don't want to end up like the traitors outside,

480
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,600
tell me the truth.

481
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,200
Who else are your accomplices?

482
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,600
Who else? Speak!

483
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,400
Don't tell him!

484
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,800
Tell me, and I will spare your life!

485
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,600
- Speak now!
- Don't tell him!

486
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
Prince of Bo.

487
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,700
Prince of Bo?

488
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,700
Don't tell me Prince of Bo has been setting me up.

489
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,800
He tricked me to leave my temporary palace

490
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,400
and fight at the front lines.

491
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,300
That's right.

492
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,000
His soldiers are here.

493
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,500
Prince of Bo's soldiers are all here.

494
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,300
You all wanted to kill me right here.

495
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,000
Get up!

496
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,200
Tell me.

497
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
Has Prince of Bo led his army back to the capital to conquer it?

498
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,200
My third brother is not that despicable!

499
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,600
You may have trained both Eldest Brother and Third Brother,

500
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,800
but you have never understood them!

501
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,000
Your heart is always filled with suspicion and conflicts!

502
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,700
Impudent whelp!

503
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,900
If Third Brother wanted to rebel, you would've been killed by now!

504
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:18,900
Prince of Bo, you have my troops now.

505
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,400
What are you trying to do?

506
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,200
Master!

507
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,600
If you take one step further, the enemy's archers may shoot you!

508
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,200
Only he is advancing.

509
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,400
What are they planning exactly?

00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,100

♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

512
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:45,000
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

513
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:54,600
I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

514
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,800
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

515
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:07,200
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,200
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

517
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,400
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

♫ Forever being together ♫

♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫
