♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,900
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,110
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,230
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,330
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,860
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,160
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,253 --> 00:01:33,182
[Episode 21]

21
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,000
Yao Ji greets Your Highness.

22
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,119
You were the expert physician His Majesty mentioned?

23
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:17,859
You can heal my chronic ailment?

24
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:21,839
As long as Your Highness follows my instruction.

25
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:26,959
You have my word that it will take three to five days at most.

26
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,980
The ailment of your legs will be cured.

27
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,720
I am counting on you.

28
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,240
However, what should I do now?

29
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,819
Take off your clothes.

30
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,059
Physician, I hope you make it clearer in the future.

31
00:02:56,059 --> 00:03:00,580
I don't want others to misunderstand us.

32
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,000
The reason why I ask Your Highness to take off your clothes

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,459
is to make sure your legs can be soaked in the medicinal foot bath.

34
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,579
Both your legs had been badly hurt in the past.

35
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,459
Over the years, the condition has gotten worse for your right leg.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,939
Both your legs must be soaked for at least an hour.

37
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:47,159
Physician, what's in the footbath?

38
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,759
Why do I feel like something is crawling on my feet?

39
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,319
Master, what is it?

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,759
Nothing.

41
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,560
I feel a sudden unease when I think of Zhaixing.

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,220
Is it because our target knew Her Highness?

43
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,439
Does that affect you?

44
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,620
Which proves that I still have

45
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,699
the unnecessary weakness in my heart.

46
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:36,080
Go! Press on!

47
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,299
That was just one of the ingredients for your foot bath.

48
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:48,839
I never expected it would startle Your Highness.

49
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,579
You should have told me.

50
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:57,700
How would that make it less daunting for you?

51
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,858
The treatment doesn't hurt as much as the injury,

52
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:06,779
but it's no easy task. Your Highness must endure.

53
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:09,840
That's all for my treatment today.

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,340
I am going home.

55
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,220
If Your Highness just leaves like this today,

56
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,420
you will be collecting my dead body in five days.

57
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:33,539
His Majesty ordered me to cure your ailment within five days.

58
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,140
Should I fail, I will be punished.

59
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,320
Which means for the next five days Your Highness can't leave the palace.

60
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,620
Nor are any visitors allowed here.

61
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,740
Otherwise, even I can't be certain your ailment will be cured.

62
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:57,599
Then, how about you come with me to Prince of Bo's manor?

63
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,979
The whole room is surrounded inside and out by my favorite camellias.

64
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,099
I feel safe and relaxed while I am here.

65
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,739
Which makes this place the best location for your treatment.

66
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,340
Not to mention Prince of Bo probably wouldn't want to see me.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,120
You and Prince of Bo know each other?

68
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,179
Before His Majesty adopted Prince of Bo as his son,

69
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,039
we basically spent every day together.

70
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,859
We messed with each other.

71
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,940
But of all people in the palace,

72
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,879
no one knows him better than I do.

73
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,080
You said Prince of Bo wouldn't want to meet you,

74
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,900
but you knew him very well?

75
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,020
Was it because the two of you

76
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,540
were in a relationship?

77
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,220
Your Highness misunderstands.

78
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,660
He and I weren't in love.

79
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,820
But back in the days, we had some disputes.

80
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,420
We were too young and naive.

81
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:17,699
But since that moment on, he and I have never seen eye to eye again.

82
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,920
I see.

83
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:28,739
But I promised Prince of Bo I would await his return.

84
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,620
If I stay here any longer, I will be breaking my promise.

85
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,859
Unless I have to, I really don't want to break any more promises.

86
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,019
Your Highness once broke a promise with Prince of Bo?

87
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,700
It was when we were still kids.

88
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,660
I promised Wolf Boy I would keep him safe,

89
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,180
but in the end I failed to keep my promise.

90
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:03,360
Prince of Bo is no longer the Wolf Boy from years ago.

91
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,719
He doesn't need anyone's protection.

92
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,020
He will not feel any pain over a broken promise from Your Highness.

93
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,579
Perhaps Your Highness is overreacting.

94
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,220
Prince of Bo once told me the same thing.

95
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,479
He is no longer Wolf Boy.

96
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,620
Perhaps I am the only person who still thinks of him

97
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,899
as the kind and innocent Wolf Boy?

98
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:32,479
Your Highness, other than Prince of Bo's face,

99
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,819
do you still see a resemblance of Wolf Boy in him?

100
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,279
Did Wolf Boy dislike plants?

101
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,760
Did Wolf Boy kill with swords?

102
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:58,500
Or did he kill so heartlessly on the battlefield and turn the river red with blood?

103
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:06,980
Or did he arrive at the Imperial Court covered in blood

104
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,420
and terrifying the others?

105
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,638
Enough. I've had enough.

106
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,220
This might sound offensive to you.

107
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Highness may know Wolf Boy very well,

108
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,499
but not Prince of Bo.

109
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:30,300
Prince of Bo admitting he was Wolf Boy

110
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,939
might bring you some solace,

111
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:36,240
but he is no longer the Wolf Boy you knew.

112
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:46,320
Your Highness,

113
00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:49,959
please take your medicine.

114
00:10:15,939 --> 00:10:17,439
Here.

115
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:21,579
Father, don't you think this is too much food

116
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,939
to have a drink with General Ma?

117
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:27,618
General Ma hired a painter for Prince of Bo.

118
00:10:27,619 --> 00:10:33,059
If I make any mistakes, General Ma's effort would be for nothing.

119
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:35,780
That would make me feel so embarrassed.

120
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,159
We should prepare more food for the drink

121
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,639
to make up for any error that might happen.

122
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:44,698
It must be General Ma.

123
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:46,499
I'll open the door.

124
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:48,299
Hong'er, go to bed.

125
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,739
I'll get the door.

126
00:10:50,739 --> 00:10:53,179
All right, go to bed now.

127
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,519
It's bedtime.

128
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:13,939
General Ma.

129
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,100
We need water here!

130
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,200
Help!

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,300
Water!

132
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Hurry! Water!

133
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Someone is trapped here!

134
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
What happened?

135
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,800
General Ma, someone is trapped inside.

136
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
They likely won't be able to make it out.

137
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
How did the fire even start?

138
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,800
Everyone has been guessing it might be Mr. Fang's daughter.

139
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,500
Yesterday, the two of them had a fight on the street.

140
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,100
They might have had another argument and knocked over the candles!

141
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,600
Stop watching. Put out the fire!

142
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
Hurry!

143
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,600
Help!

144
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,000
Nicely done.

145
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
You did well.

146
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
Please rest well, Father.

147
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,300
I shall take my leave now.

148
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,200
Why are you so eager to leave?

149
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,600
Why not have some tea with me?

150
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Regarding Ma Zhaixing...

151
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,000
Well, how should I tell you?

152
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Zhaixing?

153
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,200
What happened to her?

154
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,700
Ma Zhaixing is fine.

155
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,600
But for the next few days, she must stay inside the palace.

156
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,400
I hired an expert physician in order to treat the injury of her legs.

157
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,200
I appreciate your kindness for Zhaixing.

158
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,700
May I pay her a visit?

159
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
The physician advised us

160
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:43,200
no one is allowed to visit before her legs are fully healed.

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,400
And coincidentally now is the time for you to lead troops to Beiliao River.

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,000
Send some provision to Zhen'er.

163
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,600
He has no prior experience in military duty.

164
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,400
I am worried he might get himself into trouble.

165
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,300
I shall ready the troops and provisions tomorrow and we'll set out the day after.

166
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,200
Very well. Go on.

167
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
I take my leave.

168
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,400
Emperor Father, when did you start to appreciate camellias?

169
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,800
As I remember,

170
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,200
you find this flower pure for its look.

171
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,100
But it's unable to withstand sunlight,

172
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,400
making its nature unpredictable.

173
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
The flower is also known as Guillotine Blossom.

174
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
It brings bad overtones.

175
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,100
But it isn't me who likes this flower.

176
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,300
Father,

177
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,400
is the physician treating Zhaixing someone that I know?

178
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,800
Exactly as you think.

179
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,200
I released Yao Ji.

180
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
What have I done to anger you, Father?

181
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll gladly accept my punishment.

182
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,800
You misunderstood.

183
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,500
My only intention is to treat Zhaixing's injury.

184
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,100
But throughout the land, only Yao Ji alone has the ability to heal her.

185
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,700
I didn't tell you beforehand because I knew you would overreact.

186
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,600
I do not trust that woman!

187
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,000
Trust me.

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,800
Once you've returned from the border defense, I assure you

189
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,600
I will return a fully healed Zhaixing to you.

190
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,500
May I have permission to have a word with Yao Ji before I set out?

191
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,100
I can pass on your message.

192
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,700
But whether she agrees to see you is entirely up to her.

193
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,200
After all, you've been enemies for many years.

194
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
Correct?

195
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,100
Much appreciated, Emperor Father.

196
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,900
I take my leave now.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,600
The kind does not come here.

198
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Those who come aren't kind.

199
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Yao Ji is the best physician there is,

200
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
but she holds a grudge against Prince of Bo.

201
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,200
She cannot be trusted.

202
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Had I known I was taking Her Highness to Yao Ji,

203
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,200
I... I would have stopped them.

204
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,700
How?

205
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
It was His Majesty's order.

206
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,600
Wen Yan.

207
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Yao Ji is using poisons to cure Princess's leg.

208
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,600
Will they work?

209
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,300
Master, it can work.

210
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,000
Using poisons for medication can be an effective treatment.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,800
However, do you really believe

212
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,700
Yao Ji would be willing to cure Her Highness?

213
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I don't think His Majesty

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,900
has any reason to hurt Zhaixing.

215
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,900
Perhaps His Majesty wouldn't.

216
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,700
But what about Yao Ji?

217
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,900
She holds a grudge against you.

218
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Would she not use this chance to get her revenge?

219
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,100
When we first joined the Night Fiends,

220
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,000
on our first mission,

221
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Prince of Bo and Yao Ji were a perfect team.

222
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,900
They would risk anything for each other.

223
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,200
But then...

224
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,600
they became the worst enemies.

225
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:21,600
They were both competing for the leader of Night Fiends back then.

226
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,500
Prince of Bo won with his prowess.

227
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,800
But out of anger, she tried to assassinate him which got her into prison.

228
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,100
Back then, Prince of Bo was

229
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,700
so powerful he barely had any flaws.

230
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,100
But now Yao Ji has Her Highness as a hostage.

231
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,600
Is she going to use this as leverage against Prince of Bo?

232
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Does she want Prince of Bo to feel the pain of loss?

233
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Back then...

234
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,000
Prince of Bo won.

235
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,200
But now,

236
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,500
can he still overcome Yao Ji, this unsettling enemy?

237
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,800
Your Highness, it's time for your medicine.

238
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Rest well afterward.

239
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I can't fall asleep.

240
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,200
Are you missing Prince of Bo?

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,100
Or are you not used to living here in the palace?

242
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,700
I've been thinking about what you said.

243
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:56,200
What exactly... is Prince of Bo's nature?

244
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,500
I was worried once you found out

245
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,200
I was the fearsome Prince of Bo

246
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,300
and not the Wolf Boy you knew,

247
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,000
you would be disappointed.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If Prince of Bo told you so,

249
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,700
then the answer is clear enough.

250
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,500
There should be no doubt.

251
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,200
Physician,

252
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,600
I was told medicine not used correctly could cause poisoning.

253
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
Or vice versa, am I right?

254
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,700
Whether the medicine could poison or heal is decided by those who uses it.

255
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,000
And for me, whether it was the innocent Wolf Boy or the cold and heartless Prince of Bo,

256
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,900
they are one and the same.

257
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,200
One cannot replace the other. They are inseparable.

258
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Fancy words are always so enchanting.

259
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,400
Wolf Boy is aggressive, but deep down he has kindness in him.

260
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Prince of Bo may be unemotional,

261
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,200
but he could spend the afternoon playing pitch-pot with children.

262
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,500
His forehead was flicked swollen but he didn't even blink once.

263
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
Have you seen that side of Prince of Bo?

264
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,600
That side of him is indeed new to me.

265
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I even find it unbelievable.

266
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,100
If Your Highness is using this to convince yourself,

267
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,100
then so long as you're happy.

268
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,400
Physician, please do me a favor.

269
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,300
Let me see Prince of Bo.

270
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,400
It won't take long, only for a moment.

271
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
Fine.

272
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,800
I'll invite him myself tomorrow morning.

273
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,200
Your Highness,

274
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,200
will you take your medicine now?

275
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,600
[Bo Royal Manor]

276
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,800
Tomorrow morning, we'll set out for the border to aid my brother.

277
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Wen Yan, are the provisions ready?

278
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,200
Ready.

279
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I'll be taking Mo Xiao with me.

280
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,400
You and Hai Die will stay here.

281
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
Watch over the princess.

282
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,700
Keep me posted on everything.

283
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,600
Yes.

284
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,200
Master!

285
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,000
Master, the chamber's door is open.

286
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,800
I'll check right away.

287
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,160
Is this how you welcome an old friend?

288
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,999
Yao Ji!

289
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,879
You are no friend of mine!

290
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,820
You dare poison us!

291
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,060
They aren't your friends anyway.

292
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,039
Calm down.

293
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,280
Prince of Bo, it's been so long.

294
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,098
You really seem different now.

295
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,659
Shut it. Antidote!

296
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:48,500
Wash them off with clean water within two hours.

297
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,979
Otherwise, their hands

298
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:55,339
are as good as crippled.

299
00:22:55,339 --> 00:22:57,699
- Get some water now.
- Yes.

300
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:59,779
Master, stay cautious.

301
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:05,320
Why are you here? Where is Zhaixing?

302
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,580
Where is your Wolf Bow?

303
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:12,600
Do you think you can use her as leverage against me?

304
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,419
You're wrong.

305
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,420
Ma Zhaixing has influence over the Ma Troops.

306
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,239
She is of great use to us. You'd better not hurt her.

307
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,458
If you so much as touch her, you'll pay dearly for it.

308
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:25,859
Remember that.

309
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:28,499
You cherish the Wolf Bow.

310
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:31,060
You couldn't bear to use it.

311
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,499
But why is it gone now?

312
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,279
Did you give it to someone?

313
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,939
Stop playing coy with me.

314
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,020
Release Ma Zhaixing now!

315
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:43,759
Prince of Bo, you think too highly of me.

316
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,259
I am a prisoner.

317
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,099
How can I even hurt your princess consort?

318
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:04,099
Has Ma Zhaixing seen this side of you?

319
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,039
If she saw this,

320
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,739
I doubt she would still think of you as her innocent Wolf Boy.

321
00:24:11,739 --> 00:24:13,859
What did you tell her?

322
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,119
What do you want me to tell her?

323
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,560
Do you want me to tell her

324
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,800
touching the Wolfbone flower will bring you immense pain?

325
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,499
And that pain will make you go berserk?

326
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:32,439
Or do you want her to find out His Majesty killed her father yet you knew nothing?

327
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,940
Silence!

328
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,180
Do you really think your father

329
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:45,699
released me only to treat her injury?

330
00:24:45,699 --> 00:24:50,080
If I die here, Ma Zhaixing dies as well.

331
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,100
What do you mean? Explain yourself.

332
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,840
His Majesty still doubts your loyalty.

333
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,180
He is afraid your love for Ma Zhaixing will make you betray him.

334
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:14,639
So he secretly ordered me

335
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:19,580
to poison your beloved Ma Zhaixing to keep you on a short leash.

336
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,779
He needs the Ma Army.

337
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,680
He would never do this.

338
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:28,719
Is that so?

339
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,999
The poison won't take effect immediately.

340
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:33,940
But had I not told you,

341
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:37,519
both you and the Ma Army would never know about it.

342
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,579
And every month, I'll use Ma Zhaixing's treatment as an excuse

343
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,280
to stop the poison from spreading by using a medicinal foot bath.

344
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,239
Otherwise, the poison can kill her at any time.

345
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:56,680
Why are you telling me this?

346
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,879
What is your motive?

347
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,679
I want you to hand over your title as Night Fiend's leader.

348
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,080
What?

349
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:16,920
You want to set out tonight?

350
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,659
Yes, Father.

351
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:21,039
Fourth Brother left in a hurry.

352
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,320
He didn't bring enough equipment and provisions with him.

353
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,239
I plan to set out tonight.

354
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:31,099
You do share a deep bond with your brother.

355
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,340
You may do as you wish.

356
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,200
I... I'll go pay Zhaixing a visit first.

357
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,260
I'll set out afterward.

358
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,039
Zhang Jin.

359
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,218
Yes, Your Majesty.

360
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:48,738
Keep an eye on Prince of Bo.

361
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,940
See if he will leave with Ma Zhaixing.

362
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,039
He made a sudden change to set out tonight.

363
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:24,399
He must be in a hurry to take Ma Zhaixing and look for a cure for the poison for her.

364
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,939
A sudden change of mind doesn't mean he changed.

365
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:36,580
Your Majesty, trust is not based on words but actions.

366
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:41,819
Yao Ji, even now you still believe

367
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:44,200
Prince of Bo would never betray me?

368
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,338
I am certain of it.

369
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:53,179
If Prince of Bo was willing to give up everything he has over a mere woman,

370
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:57,160
a soft-hearted man like him is not qualified to be my rival

371
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,099
nor Your Majesty's son.

372
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:04,779
Not unless I have evidence of his betrayal.

373
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:10,779
Otherwise, I will never believe the boy I raised myself

374
00:28:10,779 --> 00:28:15,259
was actually an ingrate.

375
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,059
Go.

376
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:24,259
We're headed for the border.

377
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,338
Your Majesty.

378
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,218
I saw Prince of Bo moving in secrecy.

379
00:28:44,219 --> 00:28:47,399
He left the palace with a veiled woman.

380
00:28:48,219 --> 00:28:50,218
This is outrageous.

381
00:28:50,219 --> 00:28:52,540
He did intend to pull off a swap.

382
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,960
He took her with him.

383
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,960
Go to Ma Zhaixing's lodge.

384
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,720
Greeting, Emperor Father.

385
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,600
At ease.

386
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,859
I am ready to head for Taibao Battalion.

387
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:43,640
May I know why you summoned me at this moment?

388
00:29:48,979 --> 00:29:51,019
You won't be going.

389
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:55,880
Your brother never needed anything.

390
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:01,079
Yao Ji, come out.

391
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,700
Come.

392
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:25,920
I ordered you to leave the palace

393
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,599
because I wanted to see if you would betray me

394
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,640
and use the opening to take Ma Zhaixing with you to cure her.

395
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:39,858
Yet you got so impatient.

396
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:43,219
You decided to set out at night

397
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:47,480
and even used a servant as a decoy

398
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,680
so Ma Zhaixing could leave secretly.

399
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,539
Once that was done, Prince of Bo would think

400
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:02,879
I would work with him to fool His Majesty after the princess was saved.

401
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:07,020
He thought his plan was flawless.

402
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,979
So my own son

403
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,159
can no longer be trusted.

404
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,940
Father.

405
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,738
I know you didn't.

406
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:27,460
All of this was merely my speculation.

407
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,359
I was worried you would have such a plan.

408
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,560
However I was wrong.

409
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,410
Last night, I went to Ma Zhaixing's room and to my surprise...

410
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,420
Your Majesty?

411
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,679
Why are you here?

412
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,420
I had a thought about having dinner with you and Prince of Bo.

413
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,239
Where is he?

414
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,019
Your Majesty,

415
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,699
just now Prince of Bo and Hai Die sent me some clothes for the night.

416
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,760
They've returned to the manor already.

417
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,120
Prince of Bo, I hope you won't blame me.

418
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,399
I wouldn't dare.

419
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:36,618
All of this was because I made you worried.

420
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:38,179
All right.

421
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,840
Stop sulking.

422
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,979
Ma Zhaixing was never actually poisoned.

423
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:49,139
I know. She is the only woman you've fallen in love with.

424
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:52,859
Had I really chosen to poison her,

425
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:57,779
would I be too cruel to my own son?

426
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,039
I only wanted you to remember

427
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,639
that between the two of us,

428
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:06,639
there must never be a lie.

429
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,979
All right.

430
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:16,179
Take Ma Zhaixing with you and return to your manor.

431
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,500
Much appreciated, Emperor Father.

432
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,900
Oh right! I must remind you.

433
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,200
If Youzhen reports that the Taibao Battalion

434
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,400
is the King of Jin's stronghold as I previously suspected,

435
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,800
when the time comes the Ma Army will be sent to attack them.

436
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,000
You must keep an eye on Ma Zhaixing.

437
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,900
She is the key to maintaining the troops' morale.

438
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,400
We can afford no mistake in this matter.

439
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Yes, Father.

440
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,400
Now go.

441
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,100
Were you waiting for me?

442
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,600
Rather than saying it was a test from His Majesty,

443
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,600
perhaps it's better to say I want to know if you've changed.

444
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,800
You didn't lose your goal because of Ma Zhaixing.

445
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,200
You are still the Prince of Bo I know.

446
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I wasn't disappointed.

447
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,900
Or perhaps,

448
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,800
you knew all along this was a test.

449
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,600
I don't understand what you're saying.

450
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,400
Why did you allow a mysterious woman into Zhaixing's room?

451
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,800
Zhaixing has no clothes to change into.

452
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,600
I asked Hai Die to do me a favor.

453
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,900
How was that a problem?

454
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,600
In that case,

455
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,100
why must she sneak around wearing a veil?

456
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,700
You said so yourself.

457
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,600
Other than me,

458
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,400
Zhaixing wasn't allowed to see anyone.

459
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,100
I did what I must to avoid causing you any trouble.

460
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,800
What if His Majesty went back on his word?

461
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,200
What if he did order me to poison Ma Zhaixing?

462
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,900
If he did it,

463
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:34,400
I would have to accept it.

464
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Very well.

465
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,800
Prince of Bo is still the same as always.

466
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,600
If you lost your gambit because of Ma Zhaixing,

467
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,700
I would be disappointed.

468
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,600
I am glad

469
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,100
Prince of Bo didn't change because of her.

470
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
She is not worth it.

471
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,900
If you have the time,

472
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,200
why don't we catch up in my room tonight?

473
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,300
If I were to be there,

474
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
it would be to take your life.

475
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,200
Don't worry.

476
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,200
You will have plenty of chances.

477
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,100
Life is boring if I don't have you as my rival.

478
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,800
Zhaixing!

479
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,500
Why are you here?

480
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,800
Are you here because of Wen Yan?

481
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Now is not the time. We must go.

482
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,200
Wait!

483
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,100
What about the treatment for my legs?

484
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,700
I plead for Yao Ji and my father agreed to change the treatment.

485
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,600
Yao Ji taught Wen Yan the method.

486
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,800
You may finish the treatment at home.

487
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,100
For real?

488
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,200
That's much better.

489
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,900
Physician Yao Ji won't suffer for the result.

490
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Actually, His Majesty does care for me.

491
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,300
That was why he ordered to have my legs treated.

492
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,200
I will never forget His Majesty's kindness.

493
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,100
I will never let you leave my sight again.

494
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,100
Your Highness,

495
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
you...

496
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
What's the matter?

497
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,200
I was too worried about you.

498
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:21,100
Also, I was worried Yao Ji's dosage would take a toll on you.

499
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,400
But... we can now go home.

500
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,800
Yes, let's go home.

501
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,400
I could feel the unease from his hug.

502
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,100
But he chose not to say it, so I didn't pry.

503
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Life in the palace is too depressing for him.

504
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,500
I only hope when we are together, he is happy.

505
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,000
I'll raise a toast.

506
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,500
Cheers. Let's welcome Commandery Princess home.

507
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,100
Come!

508
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,800
Commandery Princess's return this time

509
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,200
was a great escape from the unimaginable danger!

510
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
We were all worried sick.

511
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,800
Wen Yan, am I right?

512
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,000
I just left to have my legs treated.

513
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
What danger could there be?

514
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,500
Right! You made it sound grim.

515
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,400
What Mo Xiao meant was,

516
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,100
while Her Highness was away, Prince of Bo was in a bad mood the entire time.

517
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,600
We were scared of him, so that worried us greatly.

518
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,900
Indeed.

519
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,200
Mo Xiao,

520
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,800
you made Her Highness think she had us worried.

521
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,100
She could feel bad over it.

522
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,400
Now drink as your punishment.

523
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,800
I... Right.

524
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,200
I... I must have been drunk.

525
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,600
The moment I get drunk, I start talking nonsense.

526
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,700
I'll drink as my punishment.

527
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,200
Let's change the topic.

528
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,600
Let's talk about something happy.

529
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:59,800
Master, do you remember the time when we were at the Flower Inn?

530
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,700
That night...

531
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Flower Inn?

532
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,500
Flower Inn?

533
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,100
Isn't that the place where people can pick any blossom they like

534
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,800
and find joy as sweet as honey?

535
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,400
That's the place.

536
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Zhaixing, I went there with Mo Xiao because...

537
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,400
You were there for the honey?

538
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
I know.

539
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,600
Now I understand why you avoided mentioning your past.

540
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,200
I am full.

541
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
Carry on without me.

542
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,600
But I haven't finished speaking yet.

543
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,300
Speak about you stinky men.

544
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,800
Not you, of course.

545
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,000
I am full as well.

546
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,500
Master, we were at the Flower Inn for a case...

547
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,900
Say another word and you're dead.

548
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,200
I...

549
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,100
We welcome Lord Grand Diviner.

550
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,000
I, Zi Shen, congratulate master for her release

551
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000

[Grand Diviner Palace]

553
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Is Zhaixing asleep?

554
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,000
Master, Her Highness is asleep.

555
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
How did you find out the treatment was a test from His Majesty and Yao Ji?

556
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,200
When did you find out?

557
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,600
Ever since Yao Ji pretended to make a deal to treat Zhaixing's legs.

558
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,900
I knew something was off.

559
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,500
Think about it.

560
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,400
Yao Ji has been my nemesis.

561
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,800
Why would she agree to betray His Majesty to assist me so easily?

562
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,700
Also, I could betray her anytime and she wouldn't be able to rise again.
