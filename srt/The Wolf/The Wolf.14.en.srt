[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,650
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:21,020
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
 (I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,160
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,300
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
 (Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,850
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
 (I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,120
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,600
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,070
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,410
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,240
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,860
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,090
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,900
[Episode 14]

21
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,140
So these eight years were just a nightmare.

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,119
Nightmare?

23
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,140
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,320
Nothing.

25
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,467
Prince of Bo.

26
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,970
Xing'er!

27
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,048
I'm Wolf Boy.

28
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,109
You are not.

29
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:18,610
You're a tool of Chu Kui.

30
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,429
You and Ma Zhaixing

31
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,869
have never had the fate to be together,

32
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:07,529
but only the deep hatred that could never be solved.

33
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,509
In order to protect you from being hurt by Chu Kui,

34
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:25,590
I could only push you away from me cruelly.

35
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,510
Master.

36
00:04:49,109 --> 00:04:51,103
A few days ago,

37
00:04:51,103 --> 00:04:54,713
I was too kind to Ma Zhaixing.

38
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:56,759
It misled all of you.

39
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,680
Starting from today,

40
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,739
be ready in your position.

41
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,440
No personal affairs.

42
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,259
Keep a distance with Ma Zhaixing.

43
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,380
Commandery Princess has a deep affection for Master.

44
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,740
It's normal that you were tempted by her.

45
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,258
Everything was fine.

46
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,519
Why do you give such an order, Master?

47
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:19,620
Have you forgotten who the ones were that destroyed Ma Manor,

48
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,923
or have you forgotten that

49
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,540
Ma Zhaixing is just a hostage?

50
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,740
Princess Consort of Bo is just a method of controlling her.

51
00:05:33,799 --> 00:05:37,079
I had nearly forgotten it as well.

52
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,599
I'm sorry to ask if the order is being given

53
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:43,560
for the reason that worrying Commandery Princess would immerse herself deeper

54
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,780
and hurt herself in the end?

55
00:05:48,299 --> 00:05:50,599
Affection with no happy ending

56
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,800
shouldn't have its beginning.

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,840
I was just emotional.

58
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,680
If a mess is caused,

59
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,040
I won't be able to explain to His Majesty.

60
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,800
From now on, both of us will keep a distance.

61
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,360
It's the best option for Ma Zhaixing and also me.

62
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,840
But it won't be easy for Commandery Princess to give up her feelings for you.

63
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,779
Let her see the true color of me

64
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:27,979
and she'll give up very soon.

65
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,030
[Break (off)]

66
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,100
Commandery Princess, you didn't have enough sleep yesterday.

67
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,800
It's still early now. And you have already woken to make these for His Highness.

68
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,879
Don't you feel tired?

69
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,499
Why do you look so happy?

70
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,819
Back then, I couldn't understand why my aunt always kept smiling

71
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,359
when she cooked for my dad who had returned from an expedition.

72
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:55,479
But I know the feeling now.

73
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,899
It's a joy to do anything for your loved one.

74
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,179
You've changed!

75
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,560
You used to be competitive in everything you did.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,060
You always strived for your best.

77
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,679
But since you've met with His Highness,

78
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,000
you've become gentler.

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,999
Becoming more like a lady.

80
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,639
I've always been gentle.

81
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,978
I just didn't reveal it in the past.

82
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,739
Really?

83
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,040
What has happened?

84
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,698
Where does this paper kite come from?

85
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,000
Commandery Princess, this kite belongs to a kid.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,578
This paper kite dropped onto the roof of the manor somehow.

87
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,419
The kid is crying anxiously at the door now.

88
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:58,519
I'll take it. Bring me a ladder.

89
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,079
Yes.

90
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,419
- Hold it for me.
- All right.

91
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,858
Commandery Princess, be careful of your legs.

92
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:08,018
Don't worry.

93
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:11,620
Back then when I was at Langshou Mountain, my tree-climbing skill was tops.

94
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,579
This roof is lower than the trees that I climbed before.

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,419
Be careful.

96
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,960
Take it.

97
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,339
The string of this paper kite is broken.

98
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,140
The kid will be very sad if he sees this.

99
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,339
How about this? You head to buy the same paper kite like this one

100
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,959
and return it to the kid?

101
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,139
All right, Commandery Princess.

102
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,739
Your Highness.

103
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,660
You took so much effort just to pick up a broken kite?

104
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,839
I don't wish to see the kid disappointed, so I didn't think much of it.

105
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,739
Although the string of this paper kite is broken, it can still fly

106
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:11,100
after replacing it with a new one.

107
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,199
Your Highness, have you ever flown a kite?

108
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:17,479
Commandery Princess, are you talking about a different thing with me?

109
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm not talking about the kite. I'm talking about you.

110
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,479
As Princess Consort, how can you be so unrefined?

111
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:27,379
Did you take the prestige of the imperial family into consideration?

112
00:09:27,379 --> 00:09:30,739
If your behavior just now gets spread by the servants,

113
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:33,939
His Majesty will blame me for not teaching my wife well.

114
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,618
You're right, Your Highness.

115
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:37,719
I'll be careful next time.

116
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,880
Please calm down your anger.

117
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,580
Princess.

118
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,540
Your Highness, this is the breakfast that I prepared specially for you.

119
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,199
What's wrong with him?

120
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,800
His Highness probably didn't get enough sleep

121
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,000
that makes him in a bad mood.

122
00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:13,180
Indeed my actions just now were out of line.

123
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:25,779
Tomorrow, you'll lead the troops and depart to Qitan.

124
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,698
Bring back the agreement of borrowing soldiers as fast as possible.

125
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,640
And also, welcome Fourth Prince.

126
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,279
I obey your order.

127
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,519
By the way, you should bring along Ma Zhaixing

128
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,700
when you fetch You Zhen this time.

129
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,698
Imperial Father, borrowing soldiers is a big matter.

130
00:10:43,699 --> 00:10:46,219
Why should I bring along Ma Zhaixing?

131
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:51,019
This time, you are going to pass by Kuizhou.

132
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:54,299
You can go over there with her.

133
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,458
By then, give her some favors.

134
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:00,800
In this way, your relationship with her

135
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,240
will become closer.

136
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,919
Obey the order for the journey.

137
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,560
You may leave now.

138
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,780
I obey your order.

139
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,938
Zhaixing will be in danger.

140
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:21,499
I must find a way to have her leave here as soon as possible.

141
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:37,020
Hai Die, are you preparing the clothes of His Highness for the journey?

142
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:38,979
Let me do it.

143
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,759
This is my duty.

144
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,799
No need to bother you, Commandery Princess.

145
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,320
Hai Die, I feel that you, Mo Xiao, and Wen Yan

146
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,039
seem to be avoiding me these few days.

147
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,700
Do you all know

148
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,800
the reason why I am being treated abnormally by His Highness?

149
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,960
You're thinking too much into it, Commandery Princess.

150
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,259
Since it's your request, I'll just obey.

151
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,779
Just leave it to me.

152
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,919
You may leave for your matter first.

153
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,419
Yes.

154
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,959
Cloak.

155
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,800
Cloak.

156
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,579
What else?

157
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,499
Calligraphy and copybooks.

158
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:00,159
Break.

159
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,480
Commandery Princess!

160
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,159
Commandery Princess! Commandery Princess!

161
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,739
Why is this word again?

162
00:13:12,739 --> 00:13:16,240
Why does this word keep appearing in front of you?

163
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,739
Commandery Princess, this word brings you bad luck.

164
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,080
Because of this word, it worsens your relationship with His Highness.

165
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,200
That's just nonsense.

166
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,120
A few days ago, when you were celebrating Double Seventh Festival,

167
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,779
the red string between you and Prince of Bo had inexplicably broken.

168
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,120
Also, this morning, you prepared breakfast for His Highness.

169
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,580
And you picked up a kite with its string broken

170
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,359
which made Prince of Bo displeased.

171
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,959
I don't think those were coincidences.

172
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,580
That's all because of the "broken" word.

173
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,240
It brings bad luck.

174
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,979
Commandery Princess, show me your hands.

175
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,138
- Why?
- Just show me.

176
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,859
I told you to throw this red string away, didn't I?

177
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:16,959
Don't you feel that Prince of Bo has been very weird these days?

178
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,479
That's why I think that it was caused by this broken red string.

179
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:23,578
I've been thinking about it for some time.

180
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,379
That must have been caused by it!

181
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,659
So, I went to Yuelao Temple
(T/N: Yue Lao is the mythical god under the moon that unites people in marriage)

182
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,220
and requested the temple master to retie it.

183
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,919
Besides that, I drew a divination stick there,

184
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:36,419
praying that Yue Lao always blesses our Commandery Princess

185
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,740
to obtain love from the prince as soon as possible.

186
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,660
Thank you so much, Ma Jing.

187
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,939
Don't mention it.

188
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:52,739
Hopefully, the Yuelao temple can make the wish come true.

189
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:57,599
Otherwise, I don't know what I could do to mend our poor bonding

190
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,400
in the coming journey.

191
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

192
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,299
Your Highness has returned!

193
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Prince of Bo is coming. I'll go pack up the things for you.

194
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,959
What are you doing?

195
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,599
Recently, Your Highness has been busy with the expedition.

196
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:56,960
Princess Bao Na has always liked scented things from the Central Plain.

197
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,359
I have prepared a superfine perfume for Princess Bao Na and the king.

198
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:06,819
The king does like scented things, but he only likes musk.

199
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:08,479
If Commandery Princess doesn't know this,

200
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:11,499
your good intention will turn out to be a foolish act.

201
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,840
Fortunately, the perfume that I prepared is musk.

202
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,660
I went to the Ministry of Rites and checked the previous

203
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,380
presents that the court gifted to them in the past.

204
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,340
I learned about their favorites.

205
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,680
I hope that it will be helpful for your mission.

206
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,360
I know that you are very smart.

207
00:16:43,059 --> 00:16:45,259
But women shouldn't interfere with court administration.

208
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,399
It's strictly prohibited according to the imperial rules.

209
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:52,719
Are you trying to put me at a disadvantage?

210
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,819
I'm sorry for not taking much into consideration.

211
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,779
Don't get mad, Your Highness.

212
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,340
We'll depart by tomorrow.

213
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,620
Although it's an order from His Majesty,

214
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,018
I hope that Commandery Princess won't take it upon yourself

215
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:12,019
to make any decisions.

216
00:17:12,019 --> 00:17:16,259
Don't disturb any of my affairs without my instruction.

217
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,760
Go rest now.

218
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,040
Yes.

219
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,460
When what should be broken does not break,

220
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,759
it will lead to disaster.

221
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,720
[Yun Royal Manor]

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,380
You did really well on the matter of Princess Bao Na.

223
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,720
You managed to help me to withdraw myself.

224
00:18:01,219 --> 00:18:05,319
This time, I still have to rely on you

225
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,560
in assassinating Prince of Bo.

226
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,479
Prince of Yun has just experienced chaos.

227
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:21,280
Now is not good timing.

228
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,000
Why must you attack Prince of Bo again at this moment?

229
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:26,739
There's no better opportunity than now.

230
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,018
Prince of Bo's skill is exceptional.

231
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:31,200
Moreover, he has spies around the capital.

232
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,159
It's not easy to kill him.

233
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,379
But once he leaves Imperial City,

234
00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:38,460
even if he has exceptional skills,

235
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,039
being all alone, he can't escape from me.

236
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,480
It seems that Prince of Yun must take Prince of Bo's life by this time.

237
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,379
I have nearly died once.

238
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,519
Nothing will hold me back now.

239
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,719
You must figure out a way to get into Prince of Bo's troops.

240
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,680
Prince of Bo is very doubtful of anyone.

241
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,159
Do you have an idea of how to hide your identity?

242
00:19:05,219 --> 00:19:06,939
Don't worry, Prince Yun.

243
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,480
There will be someone I know in the troops tomorrow.

244
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,459
I'm confident to make use of her to approach Prince of Bo.

245
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,279
Someone you know?

246
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,560
Will she ruin my matter?

247
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:21,639
Don't worry, Prince of Yun.

248
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:24,840
That person is just an entertainment tool and also a stepping stone of mine

249
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,540
along the way to success.

250
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,660
I have seen many capable people.

251
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,840
But I've never met someone

252
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,979
who could be so relaxed while talking about

253
00:19:36,979 --> 00:19:40,000
a plan to assassinate a prince.

254
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,399
Ji Chong, you're either born to be not afraid of death innately,

255
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:49,419
or of an extraordinary birth to the world.

256
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:52,239
All you want is the outcome.

257
00:19:52,239 --> 00:19:56,180
Are you going to make friends with me?

258
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,700
According to your plan,

259
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,519
I've already sent someone to keep in touch with a troop of Jin.

260
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,179
Just like what you said, they are willing to ambush him halfway

261
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:08,180
and join hands with me to assassinate Prince of Bo.

262
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:10,320
What you need to do

263
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,820
is make Prince of Bo leave the others and stay alone.

264
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,639
And assassinate him.

265
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,060
Come.

266
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,879
After it's done, I'll reward you a lot.

267
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,160
I need a lot of money urgently.

268
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,920
If it's a success,

269
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,319
the amount given has to depend upon my request.

270
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,060
What do you think, Prince of Yun?

271
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,919
As long as you can eliminate Prince of Bo and clear this load off my mind,

272
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,379
I wouldn't regret giving you everything.

273
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,119
How generous you are!

274
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:59,159
But I wonder about your relationship with that troop of Jin.

275
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,840
How can you make them join hands with me?

276
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,960
That's nothing.

277
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,100
Not only a troop of Jin,

278
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,359
I can join hands with anyone.

279
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:12,419
I have a bundle of friends from different backgrounds

280
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,200
at any place around the world. We always keep in touch.

281
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,040
Moreover, this is a deal.

282
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,780
I only keep money in mind, not a person.

283
00:21:25,554 --> 00:21:29,100
[Yun Royal Manor]

284
00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:47,360
What an interesting lady!

285
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,419
It's time to play with you.

286
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,638
Master, this is our current location.

287
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:18,179
We're estimated to arrive in Kuizhou in two days.

288
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,719
Master, can we let the soldiers drink some water before we depart?

289
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:35,399
As per your order, I've already sent someone to the hostel where we will stay tonight.

290
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:48,778
How is it? Unexpected, right?

291
00:22:48,778 --> 00:22:51,658
Are you happy? Are you surprised?

292
00:22:51,658 --> 00:22:53,740
It's you.

293
00:22:57,019 --> 00:22:58,459
Why are you here?

294
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,759
I'm here to see you.

295
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,419
Trespassing into the imperial troops is a capital crime.

296
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,939
Are you worrying about me?

297
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,019
- I–
- Don't worry. Prince of Bo won't be able to do anything about me.

298
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:11,160
Don't make a joke.

299
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,138
I'm not here to collect debts today.

300
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:15,359
Can't you be happy?

301
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,379
How is the road situation ahead?

302
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:21,260
Master, I've sent a few soldiers to explore.

303
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,030
They will come back to report later.

304
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,638
It'll be a long journey. If you get bored, I, as the horse expert, can tell you some jokes.

305
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,359
You mean, you are a horse expert?

306
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:31,799
Yes.

307
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:33,800
Who is that person?

308
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,119
Why is he here?

309
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,599
Master, his name is Ji Chong.

310
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:40,480
He's a horse expert recruited from among the common people.

311
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,359
He will be in charge of managing the horses and the horse riders of this journey.

312
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,859
By the way, Ji Chong is the one who was rewarded for saving Princess Bao Na.

313
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:50,359
That's why he knows Commandery Princess. I've checked his background.

314
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,019
Ji Chong helped the court at that time, which breaks the rules of his occupation.

315
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,040
In order to survive, he became a horse expert.

316
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,019
He meets the requirements of the court.

317
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:03,539
As a horse expert, he should behave well.

318
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,300
As long as you are unhappy along the journey, I'll chat with you.

319
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,879
Your Highness, I have something to report to you now.

320
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:18,300
- He is Ji Chong.
- I know his background.

321
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,200
But the duty of a horse expert is not chatting with Commandery Princess.

322
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,492
Ji Chong greets Your Highness.

323
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,699
Your Highness, I think you've misunderstood him.

324
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,730
He's here to tell us that there's danger on this route.

325
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,850
He advises us to change the route.

326
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,119
That's just one-sided words.

327
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,980
Why should I believe his words?

328
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,679
I can prove it to Your Highness that I'm not lying.

329
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,280
This is Zhuiri.

330
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,419
It's a very intelligent Golden Eagle that I've trained for years.

331
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,718
A few hours ago, I sent Zhuiri to fly within a hundred miles and checked the topography.

332
00:25:05,718 --> 00:25:09,780
And I got to know that the road ahead is impassable.

333
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,439
How can you prove it?

334
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:19,058
Master, the sentries ahead reported to us that the gorge a hundred miles away

335
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:21,818
has collapsed due to the continuous heavy rain. It's impassable now.

336
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:24,599
So we have to change the route traveling to Kuizhou.

337
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,780
Ji Chong, you're amazing.

338
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,319
Your golden eagle is really awesome!

339
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,338
Thank you for your praise, Prince of Bo.

340
00:25:38,339 --> 00:25:44,460
It's my pleasure to be able to help Prince of Bo and also Princess Consort Bo.

341
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,540
Wen Yan, spread my order.

342
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,519
Take the detour from the southwest to Kuizhou.

343
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:52,400
I obey your order.

344
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,459
Apart from being a horse expert,

345
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:03,740
I order you to use your golden eagle to check the route for us and report it to Mo Xiao.

346
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,520
Prince of Bo, I apologize for having to reject you.

347
00:26:07,639 --> 00:26:11,859
Ji Chong, this is a good opportunity to serve the prince.

348
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:18,220
Unless Your Highness can give me an extra 50 taels of silver.

349
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,160
Since that's extra work to do,

350
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,560
I would accept it if it earns me money.

351
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,219
100 taels.

352
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

353
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,079
Prince of Bo, Ji Chong is very wise and has great martial skills.

354
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,400
Moreover, he has Zhuiri with him. He can do it. He...

355
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,700
He... He will be able to assist us and we can reach the destination safely.

356
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,200
Thank you for your kind words, Commandery Princess.

357
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,300
But you shouldn't praise another man in front of the prince.

358
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,760
No wonder he's jealous and unhappy.

359
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,839
He's not jealous at all.

360
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:07,340
He is blaming me for being nosy.

361
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:11,779
I've been heard that His Highness and Commandery Princess were very much in love.

362
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,659
But why is it different from what I've seen just now?

363
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,780
What happened to both of you?

364
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:20,739
I've no idea as well.

365
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,519
Maybe I'm not doing well enough.

366
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,839
It would be good if you were not in a close relationship with him.

367
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:47,039
If not, you would be heartbroken one day when Prince of Bo dies faraway from his home country.

368
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,280
Set off!

369
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:04,099
[Kuizhou]

370
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,300
[Feudal Master Mansion]

371
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,160
I've been waiting for days.

372
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,500
Is the Prince of Bo and Princess Consort of Bo still coming or not?
[Feudal Master Li- New Feudal Master of Kuizhou]

373
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,018
They will be here.

374
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:21,818
Feudal Master, you've forgotten. It was unplanned to stay at Kuizhou for days.

375
00:28:21,818 --> 00:28:23,659
But it was arranged specially by His Highness

376
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:25,919
for Commandery Princess. What good intentions!

377
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,279
It can be seen that Commandery Princess Ma is doted on a lot by His Highness.

378
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,358
When one of the family members is crowned, the other family members get the advantage, too.

379
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:41,119
Although Commandery Princess has lost her home, every place in Kuizhou is the place where she could rely on.

380
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,539
I spent a lot of taels to obtain this position of Feudal Master.

381
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:50,039
This time, I could meet with the one the emperor favors, Prince of Bo.

382
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,199
As long as I treat Prince of Bo and Commandery Princess to their liking,

383
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:59,160
I will be wealthy some day.

384
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,639
You are right.

385
00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:03,338
Being nice to Commandery Princess is akin to being nice to the Prince of Bo.

386
00:29:03,339 --> 00:29:07,159
That will bring you more benefits, too.

387
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,080
Your Honor, the troops of Prince of Bo are on their way here.

388
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,338
They are coming? Hurry up!

389
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:19,899
Get ready to welcome Prince of Bo and Commandery Princess.

390
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,400
Yes.

391
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,800
Greetings to Prince of Bo and Commandery Princess Zhaixing.

392
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,619
It's been a long journey for you to arrive here.

393
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,759
Prince of Bo and Commandery Princess Zhaixing,

394
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,179
you may rest in the Feudal Master Manor.
[Feudal Master Manor]

395
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,220
After having a rest, we'll have a welcome feast for Prince of Bo.

396
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,579
You only need to serve me alone.

397
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:04,119
I will stay in the Feudal Master Manor.

398
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,098
Kuizhou is Commandery Princess's home.

399
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:09,680
She hardly has the chance to return.

400
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,679
I'm sure she can't wait to return to Ma Manor.

401
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:15,260
I allow her not to stay at my side.

402
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,400
Your Highness never hides your affection for Commandery Princess.

403
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,960
Such a deep affection!

404
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,959
That's a fortune for Kuizhou and also for me.

405
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:32,519
Your Highness, this is your first time in the city of Kuizhou.

406
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,059
There's a mountain outside of the city, called Langshou Mountain.

407
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,859
It's known for wolves.

408
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,019
Since Your Highness likes wolves,

409
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:42,759
would you like to walk with me on the mountain?

410
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,059
I'm not here to have a trip.

411
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:50,418
If you want to walk around, you may go by yourself.

412
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:54,639
Prince of Bo, here.

413
00:30:59,739 --> 00:31:01,940
Watching the wolves together?

414
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,040
I can only say that has quite the picturesque charm.

415
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,239
If you were to add watching snakes and eating scorpions,

416
00:31:10,239 --> 00:31:11,780
it would have been perfect!

417
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:16,979
The way Commandery Princess uses to express love is really fresh and unique!

418
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:20,019
You make me feel ashamed.

419
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,539
Continue your laughing.

420
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:29,779
Now, aside from both loving wolves,

421
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,699
I can't think of any other hobbies that we share.

422
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,980
You are too clever and rational

423
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,999
which makes you forget that Prince of Bo is also a normal man.

424
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:50,818
No man likes their woman to be overly smart.

425
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,540
Then, what kind of woman does a man love?

426
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,039
Men love those very feminine.

427
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,399
Do you mean that Commandery Princess is going to dance the Princess Dance in tonight's banquet?

428
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:13,619
Yes.

429
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:16,579
That dance is a sword dance of the troops of Ma

430
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,939
that used to be performed for celebrating success.

431
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,619
But who knows when it turned out to be a common dance for the girls in Kuizhou?

432
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:30,120
Gradually, it became a dance that must be performed during festivals and welcoming guests in Kuizhou.

433
00:32:31,499 --> 00:32:37,059
I've heard Prince of Bo had once let the soldiers dance it

434
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,899
on the battlefront to celebrate their victory.

435
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:44,819
Perhaps His Highness likes the behind story of the dance as well.

436
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,200
Feudal Master Li, think of it carefully.

437
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,100
Commandery Princess is the daughter of Kuizhou.

438
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,160
If we could let Lady Bo dance the auspicious Princess Dance,

439
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,299
Prince of Bo would be very happy with your consideration.

440
00:33:08,022 --> 00:33:09,700
You're right.

441
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,699
- Me?
- This is a good idea.

442
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:13,839
- If it's performed by...
- Me?

443
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,979
The Commandery Princess herself. It means that the whole Kuizhou is giving blessings for a successful journey.

444
00:33:20,859 --> 00:33:24,239
His Highness will definitely appreciate my wise action.

445
00:33:24,239 --> 00:33:26,039
What a good idea!

446
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:27,978
How is it?

447
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,600
My idea is not bad, right?

448
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,579
You really know everything!

449
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,378
Unluckily, you miscalculated one step.

450
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:41,200
Every girl in Kuizhou can dance it gracefully,

451
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,119
except me.

452
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,999
You're the daughter of a general.

453
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:48,800
Why can't you dance?

454
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:51,779
My legs were injured before this.

455
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,260
So my dad never allowed me to dance it.

456
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,139
Ma Zhaixing, think carefully.

457
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:02,859
Prince of Bo is a warrior.

458
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:06,738
I'm sure he can't resist such an encouraging Princess Dance.

459
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:09,500
If you can make it

460
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,919
and encourage the troops, and pray for a smooth journey,

461
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,160
Prince of Bo will be very touched

462
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,600
by your intentions.

463
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:24,959
Commandery Princess, there are still a few hours left.

464
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:29,358
I believe that it's not difficult for such a clever princess as you to learn.

465
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,700
It'll be meaningful if I can make it.

466
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,538
Not only will Prince of Bo be happy, but I can also bless my dad in Heaven.

467
00:34:35,539 --> 00:34:36,900
Thanks a lot, Feudal Master.

468
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,239
Don't mention that.

469
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,220
Commandery Princess, please.

470
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,479
Go ahead.

471
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:56,340
Let Prince of Bo put all his attention on you.

472
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,299
So I will have time to do my thing.

473
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,100
This is the seal of Princess Bao Na.

474
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,079
And also a handwritten letter that imitated her handwriting.

475
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,680
Those are the things you requested.

476
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,839
You can be disguised as a soldier of Qitan

477
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,138
and hand this over to Prince of Bo.

478
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:50,519
Naturally, he will go alone and head to the location where we can ambush him.

[I have something important to tell Your Highness. Meet me at Fuhu Forest. Please come on time. - Bao Na]

480
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,700
By having these things, I can confirm that Prince of Bo will fall into our trap.

481
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,618
You could even get these things.

482
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,419
You're really amazing!

483
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,919
I'm guessing that you're the one who was hired by Prince of Yun.

484
00:36:12,919 --> 00:36:15,379
Why don't you appear in person?

485
00:36:15,379 --> 00:36:18,560
As long as you got the things to carry out your mission,

486
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,859
what I look like is none of your business.

487
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,900
General Cheng,

488
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:31,619
you and your followers are first-class assassins in Jin.

489
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,519
Promise me not to miss.

490
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,459
You recognize me?

491
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,020
The sound is familiar.

492
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:53,818
Having the chance to meet with Prince of Bo in the city of Kuizhou

493
00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:56,120
is all thanks to Feudal Master.

494
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,560
Don't mention that.

495
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,980
But I'm still worried about it.

496
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,719
As the three of you had been refused by Commandery Princess Ma for her hand in marriage,

497
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:11,680
I'm worried if Prince of Bo will get mad because of that.

498
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,740
As you know, His Highness really dotes on Commandery Princess.

499
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,259
You've worried too much, Feudal Master.

500
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,138
It's us who should be embarrassed.

501
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:22,578
We're here with two purposes.

502
00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:24,899
First, to please Prince of Bo.

503
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,840
Second, to congratulate Commandery Princess Ma for having such good fortune.

504
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:33,299
She made the right decision to refuse us back then.

505
00:37:33,299 --> 00:37:36,700
Yes. In order to have a better future,

506
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,261
- we can feign stupidity .
- Yes.

507
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:42,740
We're willing to do anything for Commandery Princess Ma.

508
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,600
Young Lords, you are so flexible to the situation.

509
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,460
Young Lord, it will be a very important night

510
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,899
for all three of you and me.

511
00:37:56,899 --> 00:38:01,759
To be a success or not, it all depends on tonight.

512
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:05,730
You three, I've prepared a special gift

513
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,919
for Prince of Bo tonight.

514
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,879
I'm sure that Prince of Bo will be very happy.

515
00:38:10,879 --> 00:38:12,538
Feudal Master Li, you've worked hard.

516
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:17,759
We prepared some small gifts as subsidies for today's expenses.

517
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,240
Please accept them, Feudal Master Li.

518
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,840
Master, the three of them were refused by Commandery Princess in the past.

519
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,199
The one who gave money is Young Lord Qi, son of the late minister.

520
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,660
The next is Young Lord Liu, son of the governor of Luzhou.

521
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:40,401
The last is the descendant of a great general, Young Lord Qiao.

522
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,880
Welcome, Prince of Bo.

523
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,340
There are so many anecdotes about Ma Zhaixing.

524

525
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:55,899
Prince of Bo. Please...

526
00:38:55,899 --> 00:38:58,139
Please have a seat.

527
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,239
Be careful.

528

Your Highness.

529
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:10,160
The great businessmen and also those from

530
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,259
the wealthy families of the city of Kuizhou are excited to join the festivities,

531
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
since they heard this banquet

532
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,940
is going to be held to welcome Prince of Bo.

533
00:39:22,379 --> 00:39:24,079
That's good.

534
00:39:27,899 --> 00:39:32,239
Thank you, Feudal Master Li and every gentleman, for welcoming me in Kuizhou.

535
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,800
I'm very happy tonight.

536
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:38,199
The court still needs your support,

537
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:41,540
either financially or providing food in the coming war with Jin.

538
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,360
Prince of Bo, it's our pleasure to contribute

539
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,019
to Your Highness and also the court.

540
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,959
We would appreciate it.

541

Let's pay respect to Prince of Bo.

542
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,619
Respect, Prince of Bo.

00:39:58,959 --> 00:40:00,220
Good wine!

544
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:03,479
Feudal Master Li, thank you for your effort.

545
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:05,138
Your Highness,

546
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:09,899
I've prepared a unique Princess Dance of Kuizhou for you.

547
00:40:09,899 --> 00:40:12,280
It'll be performed by the daughters of Kuizhou,

548
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,859
as a blessing to your victory.

549
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:16,880
The dance is known for its auspicious blessing.

550
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,159
It suits our purpose.

551
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,859
We shouldn't wait any longer for that. Have a seat.

552
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:23,619
Music!

553
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,279
Your Highness, are you satisfied with the arrangement?

554
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,100
Great!

555
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,740
Isn't that Commandery Princess Ma?

556
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,719
Commandery Princess Ma is performing the dance for her future husband.

557
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:52,999
She's so considerate!

558
00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:17,098
Your Highness, Commandery Princess has practiced the dance repeatedly.

559
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,859
She tried her very best in doing it especially for you.
