♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

[The Wolf]

21
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,900
[Episode 10]

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,600
I didn't expect the cold-faced Prince of Bo to be so popular.

23
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,400
The little princess was just being mischievous. Don't take it seriously.

24
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,488
Who said Princess Bao Na was being mischievous?

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,200
It's more like being unreasonable.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
What did Princess Bao Na do

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,500
that shocked both Your Second Highness and Prince of Bo?

28
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,800
If you want to keep talking about the princess,

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,800
then I'm going first.

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,900
Your Highness!

31
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Is Princess Bao Na really that annoying?

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,800
It's my first time seeing His Highness so anxious.

33
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
My third brother was once bitten, now twice shy.

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,800
Commandery Princess, Princess Bao Na will be here in five days.

35
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,400
I have a suggestion for how Prince of Bo can successfully borrow her troops,

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
but I need your help.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Your Highness, wait for me!

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,100
Your Highness, slow down!

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,800
My leg!

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What are these boxes?

41
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,000
Master,

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
these are greeting gifts from the princess.

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
There's also a letter for you.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Princess Bao Na is such a sincere person.

45
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Wen Yan,

46
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
read what the letter says.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,400
Princess Bao Na wrote this many pages?

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,800
It seems like her feelings for Prince of Bo are very deep.

50
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
You're very talkative today.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,600
Princess, don't worry about him.

52
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,599
Master, I'm done reading.

53
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
You just need to answer my questions.

54
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,200
Don't say anything if I don't ask.

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,900
Yes.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
What are those four scrolls?

57
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,500
Princess Bao Na wanted you to see what she looks like now after three years,

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,600
so she asked the painter to paint her in the four seasons.

59
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,400
Princess Bao Na is very pretty and graceful.

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,600
Did she also write the Chinese on these paintings?

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,200
You're right, Princess.

62
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Her Highness wrote the Chinese herself.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
She spent the past three years learning

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,300
how to say and write Chinese for my master.

65
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,200
Her letter also said

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,600
that she hopes my master can hang the four paintings

67
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,400
in the living room, study, bedroom, and practice room,

68
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,300
so that you can see her everywhere.

69
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,200
Princess Bao Na really loves our master.

70
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,700
What are those four boxes?

71
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,278
Those are filled with your favorite meat jerky from Qitan.

72
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,000
The princess remembered.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They are deer jerky, beef jerky, fish jerky,

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
lamb jerky, and wild boar jerky.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
She specially sent them.

76
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,100
What is this? Why is it half-eaten?

77
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,000
This is the jerky eaten by my master back then.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
The princess couldn't bear to throw it away,

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,900
and kept it for the past three years.

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
She also didn't let anyone touch the room you stayed in, and kept it

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
like how it was when you left.

82
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,000
This little princess's way of love is pretty crazy.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Princess Bao Na really did some crazy things.

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If she knew about the marriage agreement between the princess and our master,

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,200
who knows what earthshattering ruckus she would do?

86
00:05:57,359 --> 00:05:59,559
It seems as if His Second Highness's suggestion is right.

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
In order to successfully borrow troops,

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,200
we should hide the marriage agreement from her for the three days she's here.

89
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't agree.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want her to truly give up

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,600
after her visit this time.

92
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,200
You can't do that!

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,300
Your Highness, just as you've seen,

94
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,200
Princess Bao Na's love for you hasn't decreased

95
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,600
and has only increased these few years.

96
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
That also means she is a rash and stubborn girl.

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,400
You can't provoke her.

98
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,100
Master, I agree with the Commandery Princess's opinion.

99
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,800
The emperor hasn't announced the marriage agreement to the people.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
Hiding it won't be hard.

101
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Besides, it's just three days.

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
It is a win-win solution to keep the princess happy when she comes

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,200
and when she leaves.

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
Do you want me to let her do whatever she wants?

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Do you all know what she did to me back then so that I wouldn't leave?

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,200
She put laxatives in my tea,

107
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,700
and for a while, all I could do was lay in bed.

108
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,500
In the end, I had to flee with my second brother.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,800
In that case, if we don't hide it, then there will be an even bigger mess.

110
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,400
Princess Bao Na is stubborn and spoiled as Second Highness said...

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
Your Highness, I want to ask you

112
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,000
to work with us for the bigger picture,

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,400
so that we can borrow troops.

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,600
Work with you?

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,500
Is my marriage agreement something to hide?

116
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Wen Yan, what else did the letter say?

117
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,200
Your Highness, the princess has a few more requests.

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,700
First, her room must face the east.

119
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,200
Second, all the decorations in her room must be bright red.

120
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
That's her favorite color.

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,600
Is she treating herself as the bride?

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,600
Third, the princess likes fresh flowers,

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,600
so her room must be filled with peonies.

124
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,900
She wants to be like a peony, loved by everyone like how they love the flower.

125
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,400
What month is it now?

126
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,200
Where are we going to get peonies?

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Fourth, the rouge she wants is the Flower Moon rouge.

128
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,200
If she doesn't have it, she won't go out all day.

129
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,500
- Fifth...
- Stop.

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,600
Wen Yan, make a copy of the requests and send it to the Yun Mansion.

131
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
Ask Second Prince to send someone to decorate based on her asks.

132
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,100
- Hai Die. Mo Xiao.
- Yes!

133
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,600
Put the presents away, and go do as I asked.

134
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,200
Yes, Commandery Princess.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,800
Commandery Princess, where are you going?

136
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm going to convince Prince of Bo.

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Convince?

138
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,800
You're still trying to convince me?

139
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm here to negotiate with you.

140
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,500
Negotiate?

141
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,500
If Your Highness agrees to hide the agreement, and also

142
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,200
puts up the paintings of Princess Bao Na,

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,900
then I will drink the medicine.

144
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,600
Are you threatening me?

145
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,600
In any case, I won't stop until I reach my goal.

146
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I also won't leave.

147
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,600
You've been like this since little,

148
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
always wanting your way.

149
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
How do you know?

150
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,600
I've had this bad habit since I was young and I can't change.

151
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,800
I know you feel wronged.

152
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,700
I also know this is inconsiderate of me.

153
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,600
But there are still five days until the princess is here.

154
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,400
If we can think of a better way in the next five days,

155
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,600
then we won't need to hide the marriage.

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,000
How about that?

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Fine.

158
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,000
I promise.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,900
Drink the medicine.

160
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
Wait!

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,000
You have to do something first.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Hang the paintings up.

163
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,700
Didn't you say there were still five days?

164
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,600
Do I need to hang them up now?

165
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
Then I won't drink the medicine.

166
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the lost handwritten script from Suo Jing

167
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,800
that I've looked for for years.

168
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,700
How did you find it?

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,700
I spent all afternoon

170
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,700
and walked every single street in the imperial city.

171
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,400
You first used logic

172
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
to try and convince me,

173
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,900
and now you're making an emotional appeal to win me over.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,600
The emperor should send you to borrow troops.

175
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Thanks for the compliment.

176
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,800
But unfortunately, you are the only one

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,800
that can win Princess Bao Na's heart in this world.

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,000
No one can replace you.

179
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,000
Hurry and drink the medicine.

180
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,819
Before I promise you,

181
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:50,440
you need to agree to do something for me.

182
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,630
[Bo Royal Manor]

183
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,759
Harder.

184
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,760
Use more strength. Did you not eat?

185
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,539
The dough will never be ready if you knead like that.

186
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,139
Ma Jing, the more I think about it, the odder it seems.

187
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:17,100
I think Lord Bo is playing a prank on me.

188
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,798
He wanted me to make fried sugar pastries all of a sudden.

189
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,978
Do you think he's distracting me on purpose so that I can't take care of the princess's matters?

190
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:29,319
If you think that, then you're misunderstanding Prince of Bo.

191
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,259
Princess, do you know what holiday it is?

192
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:34,200
What?

193
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,899
It's the Double Seventh Festival! (T/N: Often called the Chinese Valentines Day in which girls would pray for a good husband and newlywed couples would pray for a happy marriage)

194
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,478
Fried sugar pastries are made for the festival,

195
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:43,959
and used when worshiping the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

196
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,860
You tie the pastries with red string,

197
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,790
or stuff it inside the pastry

198
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,279
and give it to the one you love.

199
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,478
Then you use the red string to tie your fingers together.

200
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,190
That way, you won't ever be separated from the one you love

201
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,200
for the rest of your life.

202
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,190
Using the pastries to celebrate the festival

203
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,438
is a tradition you should follow as the princess consort-to-be.

204
00:13:09,438 --> 00:13:11,220
Hurry and do it.

205
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:22,660
Auntie, am I doing this right?

206
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,580
Pinch it like this.

207
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,919
Teach me more. How do I make the pastries?

208
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,599
Here, here. Sprinkle some flour.

209
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,740
Some flour.

210
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,739
- Like this?
- Like that.

211
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:36,459
What? No more complaining?

212
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,519
You're suddenly this excited to make them?

213
00:13:40,359 --> 00:13:42,700
Squeeze it like this.

214
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,139
- Just like this.
- Commandery Princess, something's wrong!

215
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,198
Princess Bao Na is here. She's in the front yard.

216
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:49,600
What?

217
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:52,580
Wasn't she coming in five days?

218
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,999
I already sent someone to the palace to notify Prince of Bo.

219
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:59,739
What's wrong with this princess? Is she here as a surprise attack?

220
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,779
Hurry. Let's go welcome her. Hurry.

221
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,979
Princess Bao Na is so pretty.

222
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:26,780
A small, quiet, charismatic girl like her

223
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,720
isn't at all like the

224
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,370
unreasonable girl in the letter.

225
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,598
Brother Prince of Bo! The Bao Na you've been thinking about,

226
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,319
dreaming about, and worrying about is here!

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,120
Forget I said anything.

228
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,239
Brother Prince of Bo, I'm here to give you a surprise!

229
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,559
Don't step on that!

230
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,699
This is the silk that resembles the bridge of magpies between us. (T/N: the bridge in which the Cowherd and Weaving maid cross to meet annually)

231
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:17,540
Besides Prince of Bo, no one else can step on it.

232
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,410
Get off!

233
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,799
I, Ma Zhaixing, greet Your Highness, Princess Bao Na.

234
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,940
Brother Bo definitely cares about me,

235
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:38,800
or else he wouldn't ask the servants to do our hand bow.

236
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:45,239
Keep throwing the petals! Who told you to stop? Keep going!

237
00:15:45,239 --> 00:15:46,798
Princess, we don't have enough petals.

238
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,960
Then go get more!

239
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:53,639
That cook over there, go get me all the flowers in the mansion.

240
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,918
Princess, there are no flowers in the manor because the Prince of Bo doesn't like them.

241
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,980
You mean Brother Bo doesn't like flowers?

242
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,619
It that true?

243
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:09,960
If you don't believe me, you can look around the mansion.

244
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,459
Was my information inaccurate?

245
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, no.

246
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,320
Brother Prince of Bo really doesn't like flowers.

247
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,019
Didn't you guys hear? Pick them up now!

248
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,120
If Brother Bo gets mad, I'll punish you all!

249
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,640
You, Tall Guy, and you, Shortie, help them!

250
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,459
Do it! What are you looking at?

251
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,699
Hurry, all of you!

252
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,399
That's strange.

253
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,939
Where is my Brother Bo?

254
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,999
Princess, we didn't know you would arrive early.

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,999
Prince of Bo is still in the palace and we sent someone to get him.

256
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,980
Why don't you wait in the front hall instead?

257
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:11,999
Brother Bo and I are just like the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,699
We have to go through so many obstacles to see each other.

259
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,639
You and you, keep laying down the silk!

260
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,599
We'll wait for Brother Bo inside.

261
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,839
Why can't I step on it?

262
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:37,859
Why can't I?

263
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:42,780
Princess Bao Na's stubbornness is really extraordinary.

264
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,780
She's so hard to deal with.

265
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,078
She's dressed like a lion dancer.

266
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,979
Oh, no!

267
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,800
We forgot to hang up the paintings.

268
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:58,878
We've decorated the guest palace according to Princess Bao Na's requests.

269
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,950
The court has notified the officials to not speak of your marriage arrangement to the princess

270
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,360
for the time being.

271
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,059
Thank you, Second Brother.

272
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,720
When Princess Bao Na arrives, I will go welcome her.

273
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,680
Brother, you and Prime Minister will wait at the imperial residence, along with the emper–

274
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,130
Master!

275
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,759
Master, something's wrong.

276
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,260
Go ahead.

277
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,138
Princess Bao Na arrived early. She's at the manor already.

278
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:38,239
Prince of Bo, hurry and go back.

279
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:40,920
Third Brother, I'll go with you.

280
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,340
Princess, please tell me why you're upset.

281
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,100
What's your name?

282
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,499
Ma Zhaixing.

283
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,419
Give me your hand.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,919
This is how you write your name, right?

285
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,880
Exactly.

286
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,399
Then it's your fault!

287
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,540
I learned to speak and write Chinese so well,

288
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,399
but where are the paintings of me?

289
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,399
Why aren't they displayed?

290
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:51,238
You guys are backstabbing, being two-faced,

291
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,598
and doing whatever you want. Is that right?

292
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,879
Your Highness, those four paintings were hung up in Prince of Bo's suite already.

293
00:20:02,879 --> 00:20:07,018
If you'd like to hang them in the hall, I'll send someone to get them now.

294
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:10,639
Why didn't you say so?

295
00:20:10,639 --> 00:20:14,020
It turns out Brother Bo really cares about me.

296
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,939
I thought he didn't even look at them.

297
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:21,079
Bring it here.

298
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:28,300
I want to give this treasured painting to Brother Bo myself.

299
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:35,759
Even though the beautiful paintings I sent earlier were one-of-a-kind,

300
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,760
they can't compare to this priceless painting.

301
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,639
This painting has the white horse and black ox we worship.

302
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,438
Legend says that a heavenly being rode the white horse to the east of the Futu River,

303
00:20:46,438 --> 00:20:49,759
and a heavenly woman rode the black ox carriage down along the Yangtze River to Mu Ye Mountain.

304
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:51,999
The two rivers met, and the two of them met and married.

305
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,820
They gave birth to eight sons, and those eight sons were your ancestors.

306
00:20:57,418 --> 00:21:00,260
From then on, you believed that you were descendants of the heavenly gods,

307
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,579
and sincerely worshiped the black ox and white horse.

308
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,719
Ma Zhaixing,

309
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:11,119
what's your relationship with Brother Prince Bo?

310
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,280
Based on your aura and knowledge,

311
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,340
you're definitely not just a servant in the Bo Royal Manor.

312
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:26,918
- Your Highness. I am Bo Mansion's... Princ–
- Guest!

313
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:31,139
My family fell on hard times, and Prince of Bo kindly took me in.

314
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,500
Brother Bo's friend is my friend.

315
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,698
Ma Zhaixing, let me ask you.

316
00:21:40,698 --> 00:21:47,000
Has Brother Bo liked another girl these past few years?

317
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:55,459
Prince of Bo has never liked another woman.

318
00:21:55,459 --> 00:21:57,419
- That's great!
- Wait, Princess.

319
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,279
I'm quite dirty all over.

320
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,719
Indeed you are.

321
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:08,560
But I'm not worried if you live together with him looking like this.

322
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:16,399
Oh right. What did you do to get so dirty?

323
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:21,580
Your Highness, I was making pastries.

324
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,800
Fried sugar pastries for the Double Seven Festival?

325
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,179
Teach me! I want to make it for Brother Bo!

326
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:38,420
Princess, look. Your silk isn't long enough to reach the kitchen.

327
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,700
Besides, the kitchen is very messy.

328
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:44,680
I'm worried that your beautiful clothes will get dirty.

329
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:51,639
That is a problem.

330
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,060
Got it!

331
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,318
You! Come here.

332
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:03,180
Come here.

333
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:10,718
I'm allowing you, Ma Zhaixing, to temporarily become the noble me,

334
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:12,759
and make pastries on behalf of me in the kitchen.

335
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,799
Then it's as if I made them. It's the perfect solution.

336
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,839
Princess.

337
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:37,840
I finally understand why my master ran away at night back then.

338
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,839
This Princess Bao Na is so unreasonable and arrogant.

339
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,819
I know everyone feels bad, but let's just bear with it for a few days.

340
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,060
You're the one being wronged!

341
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,139
It's His Highness.

342
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,099
Why is our special princess upset again?

343
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:07,119
The tea is too hot?

344
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,299
Too cold?

345
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,360
Or is the teapot the wrong color?

346
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:15,679
Are you sure this is your best tea?

347
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,459
If not, then I don't want to drink it.

348
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:20,640
Then let her die of thirst!

349
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,639
After all these tries she finally decided to drink the tea she brought.

350
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,140
You're still smiling?

351
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,639
You're her stand-in right now, making pastries for her.

352
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:39,619
- I found–
- You found a way to rule Bao Na?

353
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,780
I've discovered that I'm actually pretty good at cooking.

354
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,338
Look. It looks good, right?

355
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:53,038
You didn't make that. Bao Na did.

356
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:59,260
You made it. You made it. You did.

357
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,838
Princess Bao Na, it's been a long time.

358
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:15,598
Brother Bo, you're finally back!

359
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:18,240
I waited for you for so long.

360
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,580
Where's Zhaixing?

361
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,719
I don't like you anymore.

362
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:26,438
We haven't seen each other for three years, and you're asking about another woman.

363
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,898
Come! Let's go home.

364
00:25:30,898 --> 00:25:32,620
Princess, please wait.

365
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:37,739
Prince of Bo is asking about Zhaixing because he wants to know if she served you well.

366
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,879
Third Brother, is that so?

367
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:46,100
Brother Bo is still the same, quiet and not talkative.

368
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,770
Just like three years ago when you left without saying a word...

369
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,470
I was very upset and sad for a long time.

370
00:25:52,479 --> 00:25:55,379
But then I realized that you must've been scared

371
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:59,020
to say goodbye in person because you would be too sad, right?

372
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,240
I can't remember what happened three years ago.

373
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,379
That's okay! You shouldn't keep unhappy memories in mind.

374
00:26:06,379 --> 00:26:10,079
I like to see Brother Bo smile happily.

375
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:17,159
I prepared this just for you.

376
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,460
It's a priceless treasure.

377
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,839
Open it and look. You'll definitely love it!

378
00:26:26,199 --> 00:26:28,199
Thank you, Your Highness.

379
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,918
Third Brother, open it and see.

380
00:26:31,918 --> 00:26:34,520
Don't disappoint Her Highness.

381
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,198
It's okay. It's not urgent.

382
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:41,399
It's more of a surprise if Prince of Bo waits until he's alone to open it.

383
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,139
Then you'll know my intentions.

384
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,438
Brother Bo, we haven't seen each other for a long time. Don't you have anything to tell me?

385
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,980
I do.

386
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,700
Is You Zhen doing well?

387
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,679
Your Fourth Brother is living really well.

388
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,860
If you're worried, then go back to visit him with me.

389
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,879
Greetings, Second Prince and Third Prince.

390
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,639
Princess Bao Na has waited for a long time.

391
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:22,219
These are the fried sugar pastries the princess made herself.

392
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,540
Prince of Bo, please try them.

393
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,919
I made these myself.

394
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,599
Brother Bo, eat it while it's hot.

395
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,660
Is it good?

396
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,219
Really good.

397
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:48,479
These are the best pastries I've ever had.

398
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,238
That's great!

399
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:54,339
Then it wasn't a waste for me to come early all this way.

400
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:58,159
- Why don't I...
- I came for something personal.

401
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,919
If you want to discuss other things, then I will go to the palace

402
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,838
and see the emperor in person after the festival.

403
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:06,590
Your personal matters... ?

404
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,870
Prince of Bo,

405
00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:15,199
the silk you're stepping on is our bridge of magpies.

406
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,379
Bridge... of magpies?

407
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:23,540
You also ate the pastries I made just now.

408
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,920
Do you still not get it?

409
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,839
I traveled overnight to come just so I could spend the Double Seventh Festival with you.

410
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,420
Also, I don't want to stay in the guest palace.

411
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,800
I want to stay at the Bo Royal Manor.

412
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,680
[Bo Royal Manor]

413
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,399
We can finally take a breath now.

414
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,039
Commandery Princess, you're so smart.

415
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,420
You kept the engagement secret.

416
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:10,419
Or else, Princess Bao Nao would've blown up the entire Bo Manor.

417
00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:12,999
Hopefully, His Highness can handle her.

418
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,279
I want to stay here!

419
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,121
This is Commandery Princess Zhaixing's room. Princess, your room is on the other side.

420
00:29:17,121 --> 00:29:21,078
I don't care. I only want to stay in this room.

421
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,679
But...

422
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:28,419
Princess, the guest room they've prepared faces the east,

423
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,060
where you can bow to the sun.

424
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,940
Your room is closer to the Prince of Bo's suite.

425
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,159
The Prince of Bo is my sun.

426
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,700
Who cares if I'm facing east or not?

427
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,559
Do you not want us to have a happy ending?

428
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:52,099
Since it's what the princess wants, then I'm willing to switch rooms.

429
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,779
Ma Jing, pack up our things.

430
00:29:56,379 --> 00:29:58,339
Go.

431
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,260
Princess, please wait here.

432
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:08,639
Someone went to the guest palace to pick up what you asked for.

433
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,859
Your beloved horse and troops are also resting at the guest palace.

434
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:16,720
As a guest of the manor,

435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,739
why do I somehow feel like

436
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:24,760
you are the hostess of this place?

437
00:30:29,979 --> 00:30:31,279
I...

438
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,799
Just kidding!

439
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,479
I know it's because you don't want to stay here for free,

440
00:30:35,479 --> 00:30:39,839
so you're helping with the servant work. Right?

441
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,659
I'm done packing.

442
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,618
Princess, please. I'll be going now.

443
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,780
Sis, wait!

444
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,500
I have a gift for you.

445
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,580
I saw that you were always frowning and looked a bit tired.

446
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,879
This Flower Moon rouge will help your complexion look better and glow.

447
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,040
Thank you, Princess.

448
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,478
Why does she annoy me so much?

449
00:31:22,479 --> 00:31:26,919
Can't she think about who is causing you to age a few years?

450
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,199
Age a few years?

451
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:34,560
I... Do I really look that bad?

452
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,219
Compared to Bao Na, I do look tired.

453
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:03,959
That's right.

454
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,119
Say it again.

455
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:11,380
You're the prettiest.

456
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,379
That's more like it.

457
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,259
Who is it? I'll go look.

458
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,699
Your Highness.

459
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:30,019
I'm... really busy all of a sudden.

460
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:33,058
Really busy. I'm going to go first.

461
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,999
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

462
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,960
Sorry to be making you stay in the guest room.

463
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,060
Don't be sorry.

464
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,280
Isn't it the same regardless of where I stay?

465
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,460
Besides, it's nice here, too.

466
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:08,139
You're not upset that we can't spend the Double Seventh Festival together?

467
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,759
It's just a holiday.

468
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,118
The most important thing is to fulfill Princess Bao Na's wish

469
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:16,198
and have a happy Double Seventh Festival.

470
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:19,620
If she's in a good mood, then she'll go see the emperor,

471
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,940
and we'll clearly know if the Emperor of Qitan will lend his troops.

472
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,019
You really see the bigger picture.

473
00:33:27,019 --> 00:33:30,180
These next few days, I will do as you said

474
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,279
and take care of Princess Bao Na well

475
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,719
so that she has a happy festival.

476
00:33:35,719 --> 00:33:37,239
You have to!

477
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:40,999
If the princess is happy, then you can successfully finish

478
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,500
the mission the emperor gave you.

479
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,280
You go rest. I'm leaving now.

480
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,780
Your Highness!

481
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,560
I'm not done yet.

482
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,718
Your Highness, when you get back to your room,

483
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:00,539
remember to hang up the painting Princess Bao Na gave you.

484
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,659
Just in case she checks suddenly.

485
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,978
Your Highness, don't forget!

486
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,320
I'm not sure if Princess Bao Na will like these dishes.

487
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,000
Who cares if she likes them or not?

488
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,000
Where's the Prince of Bo?

489
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,260
Did you sleep well last night, Princess?

490
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,879
I did.

491
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,279
That's good.

492
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm really happy that you care about me this much.

493
00:34:47,439 --> 00:34:50,260
Why are you two together?

494
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
Our rooms are close.

495
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:57,878
Brother Bo is embarrassed.

496
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:01,120
He was waiting for me at my door this morning.

497
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:09,120
Your Highness and Princess, please eat.

498
00:35:12,439 --> 00:35:14,379
It hurts.

499
00:35:14,379 --> 00:35:15,799
What happened?

500
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,099
I must have hurt my right hand on my way rushing

501
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,439
here to see Brother Bo.

502
00:35:22,439 --> 00:35:27,180
I really can't eat now.

503
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,779
Brother Bo,

504
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:33,120
feed me.

505
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,859
- Why don't I do it instead?
- It's fine. I'll do it myself.

506
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,339
The emperor heard that you came early

507
00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:57,880
to experience the Double Seventh Festival,

508
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,539
so he decided to wait until the holiday was over

509
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,619
before calling you to the palace.

510
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:05,679
I didn't expect His Majesty to be so reasonable.

511
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,439
Then after breakfast, Brother Bo,

512
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:11,499
will you take me to walk around the imperial city?

513
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:20,139
I will go with you wherever you want to go.

514
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,979
Sis Zhaixing, you come with us, too.

515
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,438
She's busy and can't come with us.

516
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:29,839
Here.

517
00:36:32,379 --> 00:36:35,999
That's right. Lord Bo, spend time with the princess.

518
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,219
I hope you have a good time.

519
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
- Mo Xiao.
- Master

520
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,900
- Prepare the carriage.
- Yes, sir.

521
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,658
Sis Zhaixing, we're going to leave now.

522
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:18,499
I really admire Prince of Bo for his "I'll take one for the team" spirit.

523
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,060
Feudal Young Mistress.

524
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,579
Feudal Young Mistress! What's wrong?

525
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,220
I don't know why,

526
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,020
but I feel stuffy inside and a little dizzy.

527
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,379
Want a steamed bun?

528
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,540
No. I'm going to rest in my room

529
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:45,600
and lay down for a bit. I'll be fine soon.

530
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,479
But what a waste if all this food is left over?

531
00:37:50,479 --> 00:37:52,560

Young Lord, buy a sachet for the girl you like.

538
00:38:06,139 --> 00:38:07,478
How do you like the sachets?

539
00:38:07,479 --> 00:38:08,839
They're really pretty.

540
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,300
Why do you think our master didn't bring the Commandery Princess along, too?

541
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:18,199
Does he really want to be alone with Princess Bao Na?

542
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,039
Are you dumb?

543

Our master is worried that the Commandery Princess can't wouldn't be able to bear it

with her leg wound, so left her at home.

Miss, would you like a sachet?

546

It smells so good!

547

Brother Bo, come closer. Smell it.

Brother Bo, do you not like these things?

549
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,720
I can take a look.

550
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:50,579
Mister, take a look.

551

The Double Seventh Festival is almost here.

Why don't you buy a sachet?

553
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,719
You have good taste!

554

This style is our most popular.

555

The embroidery is detailed and the scent unique.

If you have a girl you like,

557
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,539
you can give her this to show your feelings towards her.

558
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,400
If she's the daughter of a noble family

559
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,160
and also a little boyish, will she like it, too?

560
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,659
What do you mean?

561
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,259
I've sold this for over ten years, and haven't yet heard of a girl

00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,719
that doesn't like perfume sachets.

Look over there.

There's someone creepy.

It's Commandery Princess!

567
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,420
Why is she there?

568
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:48,182
Don't go over there

569
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,942
and ruin her cover.

570
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,039
Commandery Princess must be worried

571
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,659
that His Highness will be eaten alive by Princess Bao Na

572

Should we tell him?

574
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,759

Use this money if you want to buy something.

I'll come to you in a bit.

579
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:19,500
Why are you giving me money and not the perfume sachet?

580
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,239
Princess, Prince of Bo must want to give you a surprise.
