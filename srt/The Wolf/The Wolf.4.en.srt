♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

- Wen Yan.
- Sir.

22
00:01:34,131 --> 00:01:36,010
Look for a place to rest.

23
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,870
Yes, sir!

24
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,870
With thin skins and big fillings!

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,869
Buns!

26
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,509
Master, how about we have some tea while resting?

27
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,359
Meat buns!

28
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,820
Candied hawthorns!

29
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,659
Feudal Young Mistress, the Feudal Young Master of Tongzhou City, Young Lord Gu, requests to see you.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,599
The young lord must be here for a marriage proposal.

31
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,710
Our Feudal Young Mistress is terribly sick right now.

32
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,420
[Gu Qingping - Young Feudal Lord of Tongzhou City]

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,390
In that case, who is...

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,830
All right.

35
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,320
I shall treat everyone equally.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,420
How other suitors leave, you experience the same, too.

37
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,120
Young Lord, this way, please.

38
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,079
There are three wooden boxes here.

39
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,719
Only one has colored butterflies in it.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,930
Please answer the question, Young Lord.

41
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,829
Does the Feudal Young Mistress like butterflies?

42
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,269
And what of it?

43
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,060
Our Feudal Young Mistress loves flowers and greenery, butterflies, and the wind.

44
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,789
She loves everything in this world. Young Lord, you will never be able to impress her.

45
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:00,440
Please leave.

46
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,190
There are no butterflies in any of these boxes.

47
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,320
I believe I am correct.

48
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,469
All three boxes have a strong camphor smell.

49
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,220
It must have been made from Camphor wood.

50
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,879
However, butterflies are extremely afraid of the camphor smell.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
Once they get in, they will never live for long.

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,570
If the Feudal Young Mistress truly loves butterflies, then she will never place them inside.

53
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,109
Everything in this world, as long as you look into it carefully,

54
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,030
you will gain an answer from it.

55
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,780
Also, I did not come here for a marriage proposal.

56
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,429
This letter is from my father, who wishes to talk to the Commandery Princess, of Kuizhou City,

57
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:40,750
about the granary relief;

58
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,719
thus addressing me to send this mail.

59
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,060
He told me to hand this letter to the Commandery Princess myself without fail.

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,670
My apologies for being rude earlier.

61
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,420
It was my mistake for not asking about your intention first.

62
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,360
I hope you don't hold it against me, Young Lord.

63
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,589
I have heard that in the Ma family, a direct proposal is as hard as nails.

64
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,780
I certainly did experience the welcome today.

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,000
Usnea herb?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,109
Good insight, Young Lord.

67
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:14,860
This is our Feudal Young Mistress's favorite flower.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,160
Well, I do not like it.

69
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,619
Usnea herbs can only live by clinging to others. It cannot live on its own.

70
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:27,280
Just like a man's life, who needs to cling to others to live.

71
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,879
Life is a personal thing.

72
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,440
We should not let ourselves be tied down because of others.

73
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,919
Since the letter has been received, I shall take my leave.

74
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,000
Young Lord, you have come from afar. Why not take a rest in the manor for a bit

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,650
and drink some mint tea?

76
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,670
It is the flavor of our Feudal Young Mistress's favorite tea.

77
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,270
Much appreciated.

78
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,190
But since the Commandery Princess used a difficult box question to chase someone away,

79
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,390
then she must really not want to be disturbed.

80
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,760
I am also not someone who likes to trouble others.

81
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,450
I shall leave.

82
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,890
Feudal Young Mistress, that young lord from Tongzhou is not a bad choice.

83
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,330
Pretty knowledgeable and has his own ideas and personality.

84
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,509
Not overbearing.

85
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,760
Plus he is unpretentious.

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,270
You think too much.

87
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,919
He is a taken man.

88
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,389
There is no need for him to fawn over other ladies in the first place.

89
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,399
No. I have looked into him.

90
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,039
He is the same as you.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,269
Each day, he is either training the soldiers or dealing with politics.

92
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,229
He has the admiration of many ladies,

93
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,069
but he always uses busy affairs as a reason to reject them.

94
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,450
What a cold-blooded man.

95
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,940
Why don't you marry him then?

96
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,119
Princess! The young lord is the best man that I have seen.

97
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:01,759
He is correct.

98
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,390
No one should let themselves be tied up forever, right?

99
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,170
Otherwise, do you plan to become an old lady as you wait many years

100
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,920
for Wolf Boy who has never contacted you to come back?

101
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,340
When he fell into the valley, you searched for him relentlessly

102
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,069
until you wrecked your body.

103
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,269
Your wounded legs have still not even properly healed.

104
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,620
If he were still alive...

105
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,550
he would have appeared earlier.

106
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,410
If possible... How much I hoped that

107
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,380
the one who fell down the valley wounded that year was me.

108
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,670
I do not wait.

109
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,730
Nor do I have the qualifications to.

110
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,260
He trusted me so much,

111
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,670
yet I betrayed him.

112
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,830
If he is not dead,

113
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,110
he must have left far.

114
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,130
Away from me... who was the misfortune in his life.

115
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,250
Forgetting about everything.

116
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,830
Feudal Young Mistress, please do not blame yourself.

117
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,829
You chased him away back then due to the circumstances.

118
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,220
Not out of your own volition.

119
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,820
Whether it was my own volition or not, is not important.

120
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,130
He, who was oblivious about everything, must have truly been hurt.

121
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,250
If he is still alive,

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,680
I just hope that he can live a peaceful life,

123
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,880
like in the past when he loved to eat meat buns,

124
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,920
loved to steal candied hawthorns from others.

125
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,090
I hope he still believes in all the good and kindness in this world.

126
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,540
If... there is a virtuous woman by his side,

127
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,900
unlike me, who is arrogant,

128
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,070
that would be even better.

129
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,490
How come it turned into me, the Feudal Young Mistress, comforting you?

130
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,200
Dealing with those young lords is really extra frustrating.

131
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,500
Let's go. Accompany me for a walk.

132
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,949
Incidentally, let's buy a gift for Daddy on the way,

133
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,350
to please him when he returns.

134
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,840
Yes.

135
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,570
Two meat buns, please.

136
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,489
Here. Thank you for your purchase.

137
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:19,410
Please enjoy it.

138
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:21,450
Buns!

139
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,949
Delicious Buns!

140
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,140
Master, do you want to eat something?

141
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,940
Those meat buns look good. I will go buy some for you.

142
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,190
I am not hungry.

143
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,790
Buns!

144
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,690
- Candied hawthorns!
- Come buy some buns!

145
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,109
Candied hawthorns!

146
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,789
Delicious meant buns!

147
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,109
Candied hawthorns!

148
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,669
Fresh meat buns!

149
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,149
Have a candied hawthorn!

150
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,789
I heard that Kuizhou City's candied hawthorns are very famous.

151
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,710
Should we have some candied hawthorns?

152
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,670
If you are that bored, then go look for something to do.

153
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,370
Are you an idiot?

154
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,109
The master eating candied hawthorns,

155
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,200
do you not think that image would be good?

[Free of charge]

157
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,579
Master! Interesting, interesting.

158
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:15,150
This shop posted an advertisement stating, "It's free!"

159
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,669
Honorable guests, please do not misunderstand.

160
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,199
Beside it, there is an anagram.

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
It was left by our Feudal Young Mistress Ma during the lantern festival last year

162
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,909
when she passed by here.

163
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,420
Only those who solve the mystery can eat for free.

164
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,340
[Looking at my mate, his foot has four toes.]

165
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,709
[He has the appearance of a beast but a kind heart, ]

166
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,319
[a suitable person as my husband.]

167
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,330
Guess a word.

168
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,150
What word is it?

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,469
Master, I have found it.

170
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,640
There is a Wan An Restaurant in front. We can stay there.

171
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,760
"Wolf."

172
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,350
Guest?

173
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,330
The answer to the mystery is "Wolf."

174
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,840
But a wolf does not have four toes on all of its legs.

175
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,669
Really?

176
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:12,880
Your Feudal Young Mistress thinks she understands wolves, but not everything.

177
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,220
Someone who is a show-off.

178
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,340
Not to mention arrogant.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,149
Wen Yan, Wen Yan!

180
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,110
Is the answer to the mystery really a "Wolf"?

181
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,880
The word "Wolf" has a beast character on the left,

182
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,589
and the word "Kind" from "Kindness" on the right.

183
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,469
Meaning it has the appearance of a beast with a kind heart.

184
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,399
Also, the "Kind" could mean "Beloved."

185
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,450
Otherwise known as "Mate" or "Husband."

186
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:40,879
It seems like the master guessed it right.

187
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,829
Quick, let's follow him. Stop chit-chatting.

188
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,599
We guessed the answer. So it is free, right.

189
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,999
Just as I thought.

190
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,130
Anyone who tries has no mystery they could not solve.

191
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:21,240
Feudal Young Mistress!

192
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Feudal Young Mistress! Feudal Young Mistress.

193
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,669
Uncle Liu, how is the business these days?

194
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,519
Thanks to the Feudal Young Mistress's help, it is doing very well.

195
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,029
I need to tell you, Feudal Young Mistress, that your anagram,

196
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,810
had just been solved earlier!

197
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,079
Just now, there is a young master who actually answered the word "Wolf."

198
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:45,400
He surprisingly said wolves do not have four toes on all of its legs.

199
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,350
He even said that the Feudal Young Mistress does not know everything about wolves.

200
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,690
It is true that not all the wolves' legs have four toes.

201
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,000
Only their hind legs.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,100
It looks like this person knows a lot about wolves.

203
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,789
Uncle Liu, where is he?

204
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,180
I am willing to make friends with him.

205
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,450
I am afraid he already left.

206
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,519
I almost forgot to tell you some good news.

207
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,029
Shopkeeper Fang's Wan An restaurant

208
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,879
is inviting someone to play shadow puppets again.

209
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,349
I heard even the stage has been built.

210
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,149
Feudal Young Mistress, do you not like shadow puppets a lot?

211
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,220
Should we go take a look?

212
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,610
Fine.

213
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,960
[Wan An Restaurant]

214
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Shopkeeper.

215
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,130
Coming! Coming!

216
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,639
Honorable guests, will you be dining or staying the night?

217
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,089
Staying the night. Prepare your first-class wing.

218
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,440
My master does not like to be disturbed.

219
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,450
Your restaurant does not need to entertain guests for a while.

220
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,010
This money will be enough for you to last for a whole lifetime.

221
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,319
I have failed to see what was in front of me,

222
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,109
not realizing the visit of an imporant guest.

223
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,740
Honorable guests, please follow the staff to the second floor's first-class wing.

224
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,819
Please. Honorable guests, please follow me.

225
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,640
Shopkeeper Fang.

226
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,669
Feudal Young Mistress.

227
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,550
Closing the store so early?

228
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,030
Lady Xiao Feng, all the restaurant has been reserved today.

229
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,029
That is why we are closing the store.

230
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,589
Who would have thought that in a small city like Kuizhou,

231
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,180
there is someone who is willing to pay so much.

232
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,810
- How about we come back the next day?
- Feudal Young Mistress!

233
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,550
Shopkeeper Fang, can't you please accommodate?

234
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,309
The Feudal Young Mistress just wants to take a look at the shadow puppet's stage. Is that okay?

235
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,839
Of course, I will accommodate the Feudal Young Mistress.

236
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,549
This way please, Feudal Young Mistress.

237
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,150
Thank you, Shopkeeper Fang.

238
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,149
We will not stay for long.

239
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,299
You should go and do your job. No need to mind me.

240
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,810
All right.

241
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,470
Xiao Feng, you should wait outside.

242
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,120
I want to be alone.

243
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,860
Yes, Ma'am.

Who was playing the show a while ago?

297
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,880
It is my daughter, Hong'er.

298
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,580
Hong'er?

299
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,300
Father.

300
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,970
Hong'er.

301
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,180
You are Hong'er?

302
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,950
Was it you who played the show earlier?

303
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,350
Hong'er, tell the guest.

304
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,070
Don't you like the story about Wolf Boy and Xing'er since you were young?

305
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,760
Yes.

306
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,850
A huge fire many years ago

307
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,490
turned her into this state.

308
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,800
The kids all laugh at her.

309
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,040
However, since young, she has always loved

310
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,900
the story about Wolf Boy and Xing'er.

311
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,430
She always says that

312
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:42,700
even Wolf Boy can find Xing'er as his friend.

313
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,830
One day, she will definitely find a true friend as well.

314
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,300
Father, they all said Hong'er is a monster.

315
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Preposterous.

316
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,000
Hong'er, one day, definitely,

317
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,999
you will be like Wolf Boy.

318
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,580
You will find someone who really likes you.

319
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,920
If you are really thinking about your daughter's well being,

320
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,680
then tell her,

321
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,920
not to believe in this story.

322
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,430
Humans are unpredictable.

323
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:15,730
No matter who gets close to your daughter, they will one day betray her.

324
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,640
Ultimately, she will be the one who suffers.

325
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,429
If you do not want to get looked down on by others,

326
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,940
then force yourself to grow stronger.

327
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,280
Stronger than anyone else. That is the rule of survival.

328
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,810
Dad has decided to retire.

329
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,740
Actually, letting the court handle the Ma Family Army

330
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,430
can erase the king's doubt,

331
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,160
and also regain the reunion of our family in exchange.

332
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,590
Isn't that a good thing?

333
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,470
Father is correct.

334
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:01,759
However, everyone knows that the Ma Family Army is resilient.

335
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,799
They only obey Father's orders.

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,720
If Father decides to return your military power this time, one must carefully

337
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,590
consider not to let the king have any doubts about the Ma Family Army's loyalty.

338
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,230
Who would have thought that my daughter would have such clear thinking?

339
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,940
If you were a man, you would definitely be a great help to Father.

340
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:28,099
Unfortunately, from now on, the Ma family can only take care of Kuizhou City.

341
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:34,060
I've prepared to officially hand down the position of the Feudal Lord to your brother.

342
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,520
Jun'er has followed me for many years and has grown a lot.

343
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,060
Now, the person whom I am most worried about is you.

344
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,990
You can not possibly stay in Kuizhou City your entire life.

345
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,980
Father,

346
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,990
you know about me breaking off my marriage?

347
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,630
Zhaixing,

348
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:03,400
do you still hold grudges against me?

349
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,779
You purposely broke off your marriage and chased away all the marriage proposals.

350
00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:11,060
Father knows everything about it.

351
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,510
If for this life,

352
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:16,180
you do not get married because of Wolf Boy,

353
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,560
then Father will only owe you forever.

354
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,230
Father, how could I hold grudges against you?

355
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,640
That year you stopped me from saving Wolf Boy

356
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,919
because you were worried about me incurring the wrath of the emperor,

357
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,069
it is I who owes you forever.

358
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,799
I only made you worry.

359
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,940
Is this all true talk from the heart?

360
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,810
Then promise Father.

361
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:46,200
From today onwards, forget about Wolf Boy.

362
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,460
Look for a good family and give birth to many healthy kids.

363
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,489
Let father experience the feeling of being a grandfather, playing with his grandchildren.

364
00:23:55,489 --> 00:23:59,380
This is Father's only wish now.

365
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,160
[Ma Manor]

366
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,340
Feudal Young Mistress.

367
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,770
It is late, why are you not asleep yet?

368
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,559
I have talked to the restaurant's owner.

369
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,720
Xiao Feng knew Feudal Young Mistress liked this, so I bought it.

370
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,090
Also, I have found the person who solved the mystery of "Wolf."

371
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,150
The owner of the teahouse said he is staying in a restaurant on the western side of town.

372
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,179
Feudal Young Mistress, you want to get acquainted with that person who loves wolves, correct?

373
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:55,810
How about we look for him at the restaurant tomorrow?

374
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,610
Xiao Feng,

375
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,190
I will go tomorrow.

376
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,430
But that will be my last time doing something for Wolf Boy.

377
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,640
Feudal Young Mistress, what is the matter?

378
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,770
Nothing.

379
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,000
All this time I have been feeling remorse about what happened that year.

380
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,800
But I forgot that maybe it will hurt Father's feelings.

381
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,150
It is time for me to let go.

382
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,370
If tomorrow, after meeting the person who solved the mystery

383
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,840
and if he is not in any way connected to Wolf Boy,

384
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,610
then...

385
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,950
I will really give up.

386
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,640
From then on, I will not utter anything about Wolf Boy.

387
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,080
Xiao Feng, the person who solved the mystery and loves wolves is inside?

388
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,329
Feudal Young Mistress, please go in. Xiao Feng will not bother you.

389
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,280
Honorable guest,

390
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:09,570
are you the one who solved the anagram's mystery?

391
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,799
Nay.

392
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,560
But what I wanted to solve the most is the burden in your heart.

393
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,630
It is you.

394
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,030
You and Xiao Feng must have plotted this together.

395
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,010
In that case,

396
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,580
excuse me for not playing along with you guys.

397
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,220
Feudal Young Mistress, please wait.

398
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,150
Going on like this is just worthless torture on yourself.

399
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,780
I understand that feeling.

400
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,740
Some past needs to be forgotten but it's hard to do so.

401
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,870
Because I was once the same.

402
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:53,620
Xiao Feng told me you never let go of the copper bell

403
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,840
for the sake of one boy who was friends with the wolves.

404
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,680
All these years your heart has never been free.

405
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,370
It could not help but remind me of

406
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,340
the woman I can never forget.

407
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,080
At that time, we had mutual feelings for each other,

408
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,460
yet she died of an illness.

409
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,920
That is why the young lord made yourself busy with work,

410
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,560
never making acquaintance with any lady.

411
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,840
Young Lord, you are someone who values feelings.

412
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,580
No.

413
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,990
I am an unfilial person.

414
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,940
Because of how I was, even on her death bed, my mother was depressed.

415
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,680
She never stopped worrying about me.

416
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,670
Does the Feudal Young Mistress wish to follow in my footsteps and regret things when they are too late?

417
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,180
Master, I have increased the number of nightwalkers dispatched from each of the states to ten strong men.

418
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,440
They have now settled in Kuizhou City.

419
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,020
Good.

420
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,970
Notify everyone. Make sure to keep watch on Ma Ying's actions.

421
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,250
Understood!

422
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:04,460
Father, you and Mother have never told me about how you guys met.

423
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,090
Usnea herbs live by clinging onto others.

424
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,510
Mother adores it very much,

425
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:19,000
meaning she must believe in you and cling to you for a lifetime?

426
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:25,440
Usnea herbs have another name, known as "The Queen."

427
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,760
"The Queen"?

428
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,039
Are you saying that Mother is the daughter of a king?

429
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,230
You can interpret it as your mother's expectation for you.

430
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,300
She hoped that even though you are a woman,

431
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,020
you can still live like a king.

432
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:08,970
Within the Ma family, your mother rarely went out

433
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,760
and never got into strife with anyone.

434
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,020
She is not a normal woman.

435
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,500
She was of noble birth,

436
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,680
from a prestigious family.

437
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,330
Chu Kui knew that Wolf Boy had a kind heart,

438
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,079
and was worried that he would not be able to complete the assassinating mission.

439
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,949
That is why he hid the orders of assassinating the whole Ma family from him...
[Ma Manor]

440
00:32:28,949 --> 00:32:33,000
...directly ordering the nightwalkers to do the deed.

441
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,700
Do it!

442
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,460
Who is outside!

443
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,959
- Father.
- Zhaixing, stay inside.

444
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:32,750
Father will take a look outside.

445
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,320
Father!

446
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,000
Father! Father!

447
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:51,399
- Father, let me out! 
- Zhaixing, do not come out no matter what! It is dangerous outside!

448
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,380
Father! What in the world is happening?

449
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,560
Father!

450
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,940
Father!

451
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,460
Father!

452
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,920
Father!

453
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,169
- Zhaixing, hurry up and leave!
- Father!

454
00:35:13,169 --> 00:35:16,119
- Do not come over here!
- Father!

455
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:39,440
Father!

456
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,180
Father!

457
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,500
Father!

458
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,510
Father!

459
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,900
Father!

460
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,280
Who are you guys?

461
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,600
[Kuizhou]

462
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,640
The Feudal Lord's family was massacred last night!

463
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,920
Look! The general of Ma Family's Army has returned!

464
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,540
General!

465
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,830
Where is the Feudal Lord?

466
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,869
The-The Feudal Lord's corpse is at the back.

467
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,590
I shall prepare the coffin right away.

468
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:59,499
- Bring me to him!
- Yes! Yes!

469
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,870
Is there anyone in the family who is still alive?

470
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,470
The young master and Madame's
corpse have been confirmed.

471
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,709
Only, Only a few burned bodies in the Commandery Princess's room are unidentifiable.

472
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:13,199
Everyone from the family has passed. The Commandery Princess's is most likely the same.

473
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,429
Who did it?

474
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:19,980
Such gruesome work...

475
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,219
My Lord. We have arrived.

476
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:49,100
Feudal Lord,

477
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,260
I have come late.

478
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,300
May the Feudal Lord bless me, Ma Xiehan, to avenge your death.

[Jin]

480
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,400
Let the Ma Family Army think that the Jin Kingdom was the perpetrator.

481
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,990
The King of Jin!

482
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:46,120
- Anyone here!
- Present!

483
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,900
I will stay back here to arrange for the funeral of all of Ma's Family.

484
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:51,330
You depart as soon as you can, and as fast as possible,

485
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,850
to report the issue, to the court and Ma family army.

486
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:55,730
Yes!

487
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,600
Master, we did not act on our own last night.

488
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,290
It was the emperor. He was worried about your attachment to Kuizhou City.

489
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:06,260
Hence, without telling you, he gave us a second order.

490
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,529
Assassinate Ma Ying's family. Leave only Ma Zhaixing alive.

491
00:39:09,529 --> 00:39:12,800
Afterward, make the Jin Kingdom take all the blame.

492
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,620
Master! Master!

493
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:28,460
Master.

494
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,940
According to the emperor's plan, the Ma Family Army really did think

495
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,769
the assassination of Ma Ying this time, the perpetrator behind it, is the Emperor of Jin.

496
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:37,619
You two, depart as soon as you can, look closely at the Ma Family Army.

497
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:39,090
Then, what about Ma Zhaixing?

498
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,660
Wen Yan and I will bring her back.

499
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,159
Yes. We shall take our leave.

500
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,460
Master!

501
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,300
Commandery Princess Ma's condition is not good.

502
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,130
Not only did she hit her head hard, she also witnessed everything.

503
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:58,759
Such a terrible emotional scar, any normal person would stay unconscious for days

504
00:39:58,759 --> 00:40:00,260
or may even never wake up again.

505
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,130
What I want to know is your method!

506
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,519
How she will be able to wake up?

507
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,210
The herbs provided by the temple's abbot are not enough.

508
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,370
However, I know of several herbs that might work.

509
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,009
- Then go fetch them.
- Then...

510
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,500
Then the Commandery Princess...

511
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:16,260
I will look after her.

512
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,870
Yes!

513
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,160
So you are Xing'er.

514
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,030
I regret it.

515
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,499
I regret being friends with you. Regret taking you down the mountain.

516
00:40:52,499 --> 00:40:54,949
Do you know that you are a monster?

517
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:58,730
How can I be friends with a monster?

518
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,950
If you do not leave soon, I will send someone to catch you,

519
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,359
catch your wolf mother and your wolf siblings.

520
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,079
Brute! Go away!

521
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,270
Don't you know?

522
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,670
Your Xing'er will never return.

523
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:20,610
Because this bell is what she gave me.

524
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,030
Wolf Boy, there're still a lot of good people in this world.

525
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,120
I trust you. You trust me.

526
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,560
We trust in each other.

527
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,980
So you are the Ma family's commandery princess.

528
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:51,220
No wonder that year, you betrayed me and went to the Ma family's soldiers.

529
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,840
Now, I am Prince of Bo

530
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:58,140
and you are of the Ma family.
