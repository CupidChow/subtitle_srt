2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,710
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,840
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,110
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,210
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,430
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:31,940
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,150
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,640
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,240
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,420
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,240
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,350
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,510
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,920
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,160
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,410
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:24,650
♫ You know who I am ♫

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,959
[Episode 30]

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,680
We have never blamed you.

22
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,639
As long as you're fine, we're all fine.

23
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,699
Stop blaming yourself.

24
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:47,380
The Ma Army will always stay loyal to you.

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,278
May the heavens bear witness to our loyalty!

26
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,960
If we do not take revenge for the Ma Family, we swear not to live!

27
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,259
You...

28
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,659
You're making me feel so embarrassed.

29
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:03,860
Young Mistress.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,980
But, Young Mistress, I say, you trying to hack the old horse earlier

31
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,779
- was going overboard. But you're worse.
- Exactly.

32
00:02:14,779 --> 00:02:17,479
To think you dumped our young mistress right into the water.

33
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,040
- I...
- You're really too much.

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,139
Zhaixing, I didn't want to do that.

35
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:27,219
But it was for your own good.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,359
I had to endure the pain.

37
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,239
Such earnest thoughts put into it...

38
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,220
Wait! What are you trying to do?

39
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,580
Hear my order!

40
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,059
I order you two to throw Ji Chong into the water!

41
00:02:46,059 --> 00:02:46,840
- Yes, Young Mistress!
- Ma Zhaixing!

42
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,379
Ye Han, go!

43
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,139
What are you doing?

44
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,039
Into the water!

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,599
Ma Zhaixing!

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,499
Ma Zhaixing, you...

47
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,320
During the morning court meeting today, I was told that

48
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,598
the new king of Qitan will be coronated soon.

49
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,878
Their envoy also sent us an invitation.

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,919
This should be a joyous occasion.

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,260
However, I feel uneasy about this.

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,120
I heard that the new king

53
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,719
was held as a hostage prince in the past dynasty for many years.

54
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,799
Is this true?

55
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:08,020
Royal Father, it is indeed so.

56
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,639
However, we do not need to worry.

57
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,279
After all, Jin is not an ally of Qitan.

58
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,740
They didn't invite Jin as well.

59
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,259
Rightly spoken.

60
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,720
Perhaps because too many things have happened recently,

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,219
I have been feeling uneasy.

62
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,079
Prince of Bo, I command you

63
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:31,238
to depart for Qitan tomorrow.

64
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:34,620
Other than joining the coronation ceremony,

65
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,620
you must help me ascertain the new king's plans.

66
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,060
The Night Fiends and Youzhen shall accompany you.

67
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:49,539
I will abide by your command, Emperor Father.

68
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,819
Your Majesty, Young Feudal Mistress Ma requests an audience.

69
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,559
Ever since I stepped into Taiyuan, I have made one blunder after another—

71
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:20,780
Do you know what happened to the guards of Tangxing Garden

72
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,239
who failed in their duties?

73
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,060
I meted out a harsh punishment of 20 floggings.

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,638
I am to be blamed for everything!

75
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:33,959
I beg you to punish me alone.

76
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,679
Please don't punish the innocent.

77
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:40,600
You're the same as that brat.

78
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,299
You care about affection and loyalty.

79
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:45,038
You treat the people around you better than you treat yourself.

80
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,159
You would rather be punished than see them suffer.

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,220
A general like you may win hearts easily,

82
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,840
but you won't win any wars with your troops

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,799
because you will have too many concerns.

84
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,440
After so many years of battling in war,

85
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,479
the only general who I truly admire is our enemy, Prince of Bo.

86
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,820
That's because he is firm.

87
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,719
On the battlefield, death and fear are everywhere.

88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,238
Only a disinterested spirit can judge the situation calmly

89
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:21,279
and command what needs to be done.

90
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,119
Once you care too deeply for something,

91
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,680
that would be the beginning of your defeat.

92
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,999
Prince of Bo...

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,019
is the most cold-hearted person I've ever seen.

94
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,680
Once you make a mistake on the battlefield,

95
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,719
the price you pay amounts to thousands of lives.

96
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:44,099
This is why I do not tolerate mistakes.

97
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:50,290
However, I will give you a special chance

98
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,060
to redeem yourself.

99
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,780
Thank you, Your Majesty.

100
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,700
I shall redeem myself from my mistakes.

101
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,500
Please stand up.

102
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,980
Now, there is a chance for you to redeem yourself.

103
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,699
And only you are up for the task.

104
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,959
I understand that you know Princess Bao Na of Qitan,

105
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,260
and you two are close.

106
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,130
I hope you can sabotage their treaty with Yang

107
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,580
regarding lending their troops.

108
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
If you agree to this,

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,400
you can redeem yourself

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,659
and ruin their military plans.

111
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:41,719
Then, it won't be long before you can finally

112
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,819
wage war.

113
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,480
I shall do my best.

114
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,430
I will not disappoint you.

115
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,809
Hold your horses.

116
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:56,849
There is a huge challenge ahead.

117
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:01,110
You are likely to meet Prince of Bo there.

118
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,289
They are important guests in the coronation.

119
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:08,440
You must focus on the big picture.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,618
Despite the presence of your enemy, Prince of Bo,

121
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:13,940
you must not attack recklessly.

122
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:19,560
Otherwise, it will ruin my chances of allying with Qitan.

123
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:24,800
I shall take note.

124
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,339
I will inform you of our plans.

125
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:31,680
However, if you decide to not proceed,

126
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,820
I shall not force you.

127
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,299
There may be perils ahead but I must take the risk.

128
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,900
I am willing to bet it all.

129
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,299
I've heard enough big talk.

130
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,960
You need to use action to prove your determination.

131
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,920
Your Highness, you've been pacing around the room.

132
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,460
It's even enough to make a few rounds around Taiyuan.

133
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,679
Zhaixing has been gone for hours.

134
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,840
That old guy must be making her life difficult.

135
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,800
That old guy may look calm and composed,

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,020
but he's a heartless wretch.

137
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:16,359
No. I need to find her.

138
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:19,899
Your Highness!

139
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,118
I'm fine. Stop making a ruckus over me.

140
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:26,778
I can hear you from outside, cursing your father.

141
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,040
Is there even a son like you?

142
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,139
Young Feudal Mistress, thank goodness you're back.

143
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,701
If you still didn't return,

144
00:09:33,701 --> 00:09:37,240
the prince was going to burn the entire palace.

145
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,079
Are these birthday noodles?

146
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,739
Happy? Surprised?

147
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,260
Why didn't you tell me today was your mother's birthday, too?

148
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,539
But luckily, Ma Jing told me.

149
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:58,520
That's why I got Chief Eunuch to prepare another serving.

150
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,319
Thank you, Ji Chong.

151
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,600
My mother must be happy to see this from above.

152
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,600
Zhaixing, did that old guy make your life difficult?

153
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,719
The king gave me a chance to redeem myself.

154
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:26,400
I will set off for Qitan tomorrow

155
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,740
to attend the new king's coronation

156
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,419
and sabotage their military treaty.

157
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:32,759
That's great!

158
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:36,579
Since you're close with their princess who's a righteous lady herself,

159
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,460
if she knows what Prince of Bo did to you, she will help you.

160
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,960
You can't.

161
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,139
Ma Zhaixing,

162
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,759
that old guy is setting a huge challenge for you.

163
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,801
Since both Yang and Qitan have signed a treaty,

164
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:55,160
why would they break their alliance over a few righteous words of Princess Bao Na?

165
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,040
Both of you are so naïve.

166
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,859
Bao Na is just a starter.

167
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:06,619
She's not part of the king's plan to turn the situation around.

168
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:08,900
Then, what is he planning?

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,339
I'm not telling you for now.

170
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,500
You'll know by then.

171
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:18,740
Looks like that old guy has really changed.

172
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,540
Not only did he give you a chance to redeem yourself,

173
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,879
he even divulged his plans to you.

174
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,180
Fine, I won't ask further about the plan.

175
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,140
I'll let you go, too.

176
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,380
But are you really ready?

177
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:38,739
You will meet Prince of Bo there.

178
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:43,420
But I think you're not fully prepared to meet him now.

179
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,280
Are you trying to fight a hopeless battle and get yourself killed?

180
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:48,978
Young Mistress,

181
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:51,259
I think the prince has a point.

182
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,820
You're not ready to meet Prince of Bo yet.

183
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,980
How long will it take before I'm fully prepared?

184
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,119
Even before I was ready for anything,

185
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:08,700
fate made Wolf Boy leave me,

186
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,579
and I learned about Chu Kui's conspiracy.

187
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,779
How will things be different even if I'm prepared?

188
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:15,419
I can only face it.

189
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,539
If I do as you say,

190
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,800
then I can only stay at Prince of Bo's mansion

191
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,539
and live amidst Prince of Bo's lies.

192
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,740
For my father's sake, for the Ma Army,

193
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,959
and for the Kingdom of Jin,

194
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,879
I must go.

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,419
Fine. I will go with you, then.

196
00:12:37,859 --> 00:12:39,540
We've already included you.

197
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,259
You must go with us.

198
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:50,819
Master,

199
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,920
we can depart for Qitan's Muye Mountain first thing in the morning.

200
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,819
This time, Hai Die and you will accompany me.

201
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:58,978
Leave Wen Yan behind.

202
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,779
Yes, Your Highness.

203
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:54,559
Just a few more hours more,

204
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,739
and we'll reach Muye Mountain.

205
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,260
I'm not hungry.

206
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:10,219
How can you fight on a hungry stomach?

207
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,760
Even if that's not mentioned in military books,

208
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,920
don't you know about that?

209
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:29,479
Young Feudal Mistress.

210
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,778
Your Mistress, look!

211
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,659
There are so many fish there!

212
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,220
They're skipping out of the water.

213
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,759
This is my first time seeing this.

214
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,678
Could this be an ill omen?

215
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:42,739
- Are we going—
- Don't be superstitious.

216
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,439
Get ready.

217
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,318
Yes, I was spouting nonsense.

218
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:47,719
All nonsense.

219
00:14:47,719 --> 00:14:49,720
I've got a foul mouth.

220
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,779
What's taking them so long?

221
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,960
Sister Zhaixing!

222
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Sister Zhaixing!

223
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,978
Princess.

224
00:15:24,979 --> 00:15:28,039
I read in your letter that you want us to meet here.

225
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,978
That sounds so mysterious.

226
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:32,919
Are you trying to surprise Brother Bo?

227
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,420
But why are you traveling with this guy?

228
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,299
If Brother Bo knows about this, he'd get so jealous!

229
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,600
Princess, I have a favor to ask of you.

230
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,940
I hope you can agree.

231
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,099
Sister Zhaixing, don't do this!

232
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,178
Why the formalities?

233
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,778
Just tell me.

234
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,520
Seeing you like this gives me a bad feeling.

235
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,240
What happened between you and Brother Bo?

236
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,599
I...

237
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,419
I'll tell her.

238
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,878
To think Prince of Bo has been deceiving you all along.

239
00:16:29,878 --> 00:16:32,099
You loved him wholeheartedly,

240
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:34,900
but he deceived and used you.

241
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,999
Sister Zhaixing, you must be in pain.

242
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,679
When it comes to suffering,

243
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:44,799
I'm no stranger to it.

244
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,859
When my mother died,

245
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:50,519
when Wolf Boy had to leave,

246
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,700
when my dad was killed,

247
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,619
and this.

248
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:03,879
Princess, don't cry.

249
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,479
Sister Zhaixing,

250
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:09,579
you have so many memories with him.

251
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,138
You love him so deeply.

252
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:13,480
How could he do this to you?

253
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,018
When I think about how I loved Prince of Bo in the past,

254
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,879
I feel so embarrassed now.

255
00:17:17,879 --> 00:17:21,400
I didn't know he was a shameless two-faced man!

256
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,720
To me, Prince of Bo is nothing but a nemesis.

257
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,779
Sister Zhaixing, you saved my life once.

258
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:34,960
That makes you my sister,

259
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,579
and me, your kin.

260
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:48,079
Bao Na, thank you.

261
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,319
Since we're sisters, why do you need to thank me?

262
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:55,778
Princess, since Zhaixing has a good sister like you,

263
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,039
revenge is not impossible anymore.

264
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:04,540
Actually, we are here today to ask you for your help.

265
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,119
We'd like to meet your royal brother.

266
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:09,299
My brother?

267
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:11,659
Princess Bao Na,

268
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,580
we are here today to stop your king from lending his troops.

269
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:21,760
My brother indeed dotes on me.

270
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,579
But I was the one who pestered my royal father to sign the treaty.

271
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,000
In the end, my royal father and the eight chieftains agreed to sign.

272
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,300
If we're breaking the contract now...

273
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,100
it would be really tough.

274
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:40,301
But if it's just letting you meet my brother,

275
00:18:40,301 --> 00:18:43,240
I can still manage that.

276
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,139
Servants!

277
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,319
This guy's letter...

278
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,760
I think I shouldn't address a prince as "this guy."

279
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,580
But I can't help it!

280
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,579
He asked me to prepare clothes for a female servant and soldiers in his letter.

281
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,979
I was puzzled at the start.

282
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:07,319
But I understand now!

283
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,439
Jin isn't allied with Qitan yet.

284
00:19:10,439 --> 00:19:14,998
If we were to enter Qitan, we need to conceal our identities just to be safe.

285
00:19:14,998 --> 00:19:17,279
That's very considerate.

286
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:18,378
Very well.

287
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:20,739
My servants will bring you to a secluded place to change your clothes.

288
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,659
After that, I'll bring you to meet my brother.

289
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,819
Let's go.

290
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,819
Third Brother!

291
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,960
Right after this forest is Muye Mountain.

292
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,499
The grand coronation will be held right there.

293
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,178
Prince of Bo. Fourth Prince.

294
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,138
Our horses are tired.

295
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:52,918
Why don't we rest for a while and continue at night?

296
00:19:52,918 --> 00:19:54,318
No! No!

297
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,918
They worship the sun.

298
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:58,980
If we reach there after the sun sets,

299
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,840
they will tease us for sure.

300
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,259
I see.

301
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,178
I was against it when you were sent as a hostage.

302
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,840
But it seems that Father Emperor has made the right choice.

303
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,498
That's right.

304
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,660
But I must thank the old king of Qitan.

305
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,580
His son was also a hostage prince in the previous dynasty.

306
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,579
That's why he understood me.

307
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,939
Bao Na used to bully me all the time.

308
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,630
Luckily, the old king was there,

309
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,580
and he was impartial and just.

310
00:20:31,779 --> 00:20:35,200
Third Brother, regardless of what happens in this trip,

311
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
just count on me.

312
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,018
Even if Bao Na messes around, I'll make her grovel at my feet.

313
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,139
So, you just need to relax and play the part of the new king's distinguished guest.

314
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,880
- Mo Xiao.
- Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,138
Pass my order.

316
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:57,139
We'll take a short break here.

317
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:03,319
Two hours later, we will set off and meet the new king.

318
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:07,620
Yes, Your Highness.

319
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,379
His bow, please.

320
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,079
Third Brother, now, you can bring your warrior wolves

321
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:17,418
to run about in the forest and hunt.

322
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,960
Anyway, just take this as a pleasure trip.

323
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,999
Since you've planned everything, I shall do as you say.

324
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,579
You people really look the part!

325
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,100
Let's go!

326
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:49,479
Move!

327
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,859
These threads do fit nicely.

328
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,500
Look at me.

329
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,880
You look like a Qitan soldier now.

330
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,500
- What is that?
- Princess!

331
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,658
Stand guard!

332
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,638
- Protect Young Feudal Mistress!
- Yes, Sir!

333
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:09,998
- Protect the Princess!
- Protect Young Mistress!

334
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:21,459
Got it!

335
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,720
The prince got him!

336
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,570
It's fine now. It's a wolf.

337
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,969
Ji Chong, you're so good at shooting.

338
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:40,248
This isn't a normal wolf. It's Prince of Bo's warrior wolf!

339
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:45,809
This means Prince of Bo is either nearby,

340
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,730
or has reached Muye Mountain.

341
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,389
Ji Chong, shoot it again!

342
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:51,870
Make Prince of Bo grieve for the loss of his warrior wolf!

343
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,409
You do it.

344
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,269
Sister Zhaixing, can you?

345
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,309
Don't worry.

346
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,050
I will kill this wolf with my own hands.

347
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,449
Princess, let's leave the forest.

348
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,429
She can handle this.

349
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:36,690
Come on! Let's leave the forest.

350
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,410
You made Sister Zhaixing kill Prince of Bo's warrior wolf.

351
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,910
Isn't that too cruel?

352
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,969
This is just for starters.

353
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:55,770
If she can't even handle this,

354
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,920
if she can't even bear to hurt Prince of Bo by killing his wolf,

355
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,020
how will she face him in the future?

356
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,269
How will she fight this hard battle?

357
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,129
Come on! Let's go back.

358
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:00,010
To think someone saved you.

359
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,249
I only know one person in this world

360
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,630
who would save a wolf.

361
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:46,128
Over here. We're going back.

362
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,790
It was a servant from Qitan who saved my warrior wolf?

363
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,609
Who is she?

364
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,089
The coronation will be held three days later.

365
00:26:08,089 --> 00:26:10,349
Before this, the eight chieftains and other guests

366
00:26:10,349 --> 00:26:12,010
will come to present their gifts.

367
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,770
My royal brother has been busy dealing with the guests.

368
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,670
He must be swamped.

369
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,690
But I will find a way to let you meet him.

370
00:26:22,709 --> 00:26:25,909
Bao Na, thank you.

371
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:29,548
Sister Zhaixing, I beg you.

372
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:32,310
Don't make me hear you thank me again.

373
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,310
I can't do much for you.

374
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,550
It's still up to you if you can change my brother's mind.

375
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,070
No matter what challenges are up ahead,

376
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,309
I will overcome them.

377
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:51,149
Right now, Ji Chong is the one who needs to overcome challenges.

378
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,190
Since I can't bring so many soldiers around, I had to send him

379
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,770
to clean horse manure in the barn to conceal his identity.

380
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,750
When he heard that, he looked as if he could kill someone.

381
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,548
Sister Zhaixing, wait here.

382
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:07,749
I'll just go in to inform my royal brother.

383
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,129
I'll bring you in later.

384
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,829
Very well.

385
00:27:24,469 --> 00:27:25,948
Why are you still dilly-dallying?

386
00:27:25,949 --> 00:27:28,029
There are so many guests waiting to be entertained.

387
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,629
Don't slack off.

388
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,949
Move.

389
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,188
I have a cold.

390
00:27:32,189 --> 00:27:35,449
If I spread it to the important guests, it would be terrible.

391
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,549
I know what to do.

392
00:27:55,069 --> 00:27:58,030
Why is this lady wearing a veil?

393
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,369
She has a cold.

394
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:05,310
She doesn't want to spread her cold around,

395
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,150
so she covered her face with a veil.

396
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:10,929
Very well, then.

397
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,749
Hurry up and serve Prince of Bo wine.

398
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,648
Now. Go.

399
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,590
Stop trembling!

400
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,049
Your Highness Prince of Bo!

401
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:39,249
Your Highness, pardon us.

402
00:28:39,249 --> 00:28:41,748
She's new here. She's not familiar with the rules here.

403
00:28:41,748 --> 00:28:43,349
Go out!

404
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:45,249
Yes, Your Highness.

405
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:52,170
She stays.

406
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,970
Yes, Your Highness.

407
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,249
Sister Zhaixing!

408
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,490
Sister Zhaixing!

409
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,089
Greetings, Princess Bao Na.

410
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,450
Have you seen a servant girl outside the golden tent

411
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,950
who looks like a newbie, around this height, and rather pretty herself?

412
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,430
I did.

413
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,849
Where is she?

414
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:28,030
She is now serving Prince of Bo in his tent.

415
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,849
I held you here not to punish you.

416
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:39,050
Do not fear.

417
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,790
I just need to confirm something.

418
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:58,170
Sister Zhaixing!

419
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,209
Sister Zhaixing!

420
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:04,509
Sister Zhaixing!

421
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:10,109
Sister Zhaixing? Sister Zhaixing?

422
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,530
That's strange.

423
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,449
I heard from the servants that Prince of Bo's tent is here.

424
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:19,548
I thought Sister Zhaixing would accompany you.

425
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:20,948
Sorry to disappoint you.

426
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:24,449
Zhaixing did not come with me this time.

427
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,510
Prince of Bo, you and Sister Zhaixing are inseparable lovers.

428
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:35,170
Won't you miss her from such a long parting?

429
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,050
I was concerned that the trip may exhaust Zhaixing,

430
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,050
so I made her stay at home.

431
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,670
She especially told me to relay her apologies to you.

432
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:51,690
I wonder if you're so caring because you dote on Sister Zhaixing,

433
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:54,890
or is it just so you can seek other ladies?

434
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:57,049
True.

435
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,910
You know me well.

436
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,930
It does feel great when Zhaixing isn't around.

437
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,690
Then, shall I send a few slave women to serve you tonight?

438
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,449
As you like.

439
00:31:10,449 --> 00:31:11,530
That sounds marvelous.

440
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,930
You...

441
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,410
All men are just the same.

442
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,969
And I thought you were different from ordinary men.

443
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:22,109
I thought you loved Sister Zhaixing with your whole heart.

444
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:26,050
To think you're just another philanderer yourself.

445
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,290
I pity Sister Zhaixing now.

446
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,810
You may not know this, Princess.

447
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,609
Men are different from women.

448
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,670
They get bored easily in a relationship.

449
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,209
When they love someone, their love is true.

450
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:47,329
And when they don't, it's true as well.

451
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,590
Brother Bo, if you ever betray Sister Zhaixing,

452
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,749
I will not sit aside and watch.

453
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:06,110
I hope you mark my words.

454
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,749
I will.

455
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,050
I need more servants now.

456
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,270
I'm taking her with me.

457
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:16,789
As you wish.

458
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,510
Did he recognize you?

459
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,470
I think not.

460
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,149
If he did, he would've exposed me right away.

461
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:41,249
He wouldn't have lied to you in front of me.

462
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:42,890
That was a close shave.

463
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,468
If I hadn't reached there in time, Prince of Bo would've exposed you.

464
00:32:45,469 --> 00:32:47,489
Just my luck.

465
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,489
Sister Zhaixing, my brother said he will meet you.

466
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:52,290
You should change your attire.

467
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:53,950
I've prepared a tent for you.

468
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:56,489
You can meet him later.

469
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:57,889
Very well.

470
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:02,510
You mean you've met Bao Na?

471
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,068
So, she knows what happened between you and Ma Zhaixing?

472
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,630
Whether she knows or not, it's not important.

473
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,510
Only the king's attitude matters.

474
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:13,270
Fourth Prince, the king is waiting for you and Prince of Bo.

475
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,770
This way, please.

476
00:33:19,229 --> 00:33:20,929
Youzhen!

477
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,690
It's fine.

478
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,730
Ever since I woke up today, I've been welcoming guests and envoys.

479
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,449
Now, I finally have some free time to listen to Han music.

480
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:46,508
Your Majesty, are we disturbing your break?

481
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:48,549
Youzhen, what are you talking about?

482
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,249
We're family.

483
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,269
Come, sit.

484
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:12,250
Youzhen, I am glad to see you after such a long parting.

485
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:16,949
But have you honored the promise you made to me when you left?

486
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:21,769
Your Majesty, we've just met, and you're already asking me about my studies.

487
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:24,850
You know I've never liked books.

488
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,270
Even touching them gives me a headache and sends me to sleep.

489
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,349
You did promise me.

490
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:35,308
A man always honors his promise.

491
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:37,209
I shall test you now.

492
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:41,090
- I... Well...
- Listen up.

493
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:45,448
If the ground is a pipa and the roads are its strings,

494
00:34:45,448 --> 00:34:48,010
who dares to pluck?

495
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,308
If the sky is a chessboard and the stars are its pieces,

496
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:55,930
the kings shall duel.

497
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:59,249
Good! Perfect!

498
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,569
Your reply is enthusiastic and high-spirited.

499
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,208
You are indeed as famous and talented as they say.

500
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:08,909
Thank you for your compliment.

501
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:12,190
Your eminence spreads throughout the world as well.

502
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:16,729
- Sit!
- Sit!

503
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,788
Your Majesty.

504
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:22,669
My third brother knows that you love poetry and paintings,

505
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,469
so he searched for them everywhere.

506
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,548
He even had to beg their owners just so he can present them as your gifts.

507
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:31,069
Men, bring the gifts in!

508
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:45,530
Enjoy your gifts, Your Majesty!

509
00:35:55,249 --> 00:35:56,928
This is a music score for the poem, Youlan.

510
00:35:56,928 --> 00:35:58,888
We learned that you have been searching for it for years,

511
00:35:58,888 --> 00:36:00,770
so here it is.

512
00:36:04,649 --> 00:36:07,110
Thank you, Prince of Bo.

513
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,169
A reminder, Your Majesty.

514
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:12,989
Certain things should be let go once they are old.

515
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:15,290
You should not hold onto them.

516
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,569
Those drums from the previous dynasty hold no meaning to us anymore.

517
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:29,909
It's just that I haven't disposed of them yet.

518
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,220
Compared to the drums,

519
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,240
I appreciate your gifts more, Prince of Bo.

520
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,409
Zhaixing! Calm down.

521
00:36:44,409 --> 00:36:46,129
Prince of Bo is now in my royal brother's tent.

522
00:36:46,129 --> 00:36:49,309
If you go in now, you'd be walking into a trap.

523
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,448
I understand your concerns.

524
00:36:51,448 --> 00:36:54,548
But now, I've come up with a plan to deal with Prince of Bo.

525
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:56,589
Please trust me.

526
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,749
Bao Na, please go in and inform your royal brother.

527
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:06,669
Otherwise, we would miss this opportunity.

528
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,070
But...

529
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:12,228
Zhaixing, are you really equipped with a plan?

530
00:37:12,248 --> 00:37:14,269
This isn't out of impulse, right?

531
00:37:14,269 --> 00:37:18,230
I promised you that I won't rashly engage in direct conflict with Prince of Bo.

532
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,769
But this is different.

533
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,610
If Prince of Bo leaves, we would miss the best opportunity.

534
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,348
Bao Na, I beg you.

535
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,010
Very well, I shall inform him.

536
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:40,989
Zhaixing, is your plan related to the strange phenomenon we saw on the way here?

537
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,850
Good guess, Ji Chong.

538
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,650
It's just as you said.

539
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,049
Preposterous!

540
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,869
Can't you see that I have important guests now?

541
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:56,730
How can I meet your friend now?

542
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,629
I'll do it later.

543
00:37:58,629 --> 00:38:02,229
Royal Brother, we can't wait anymore. It's now or never.

544
00:38:02,229 --> 00:38:04,730
Who do you think your friend is?

545
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,009
Why must I meet her now?

546
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:10,749
This is very disrespectful towards Prince of Bo and Youzhen.

547
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,609
It's not.

548
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:15,809
Prince of Bo knows her, too.

549
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,510
She's an old acquaintance of Prince of Bo.

550
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:24,689
I'm curious as to which acquaintance you mean.

551
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,308
Prince of Bo, look forward to it.

552
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:33,190
Who knows whether you'd feel happy or worried to see her?

553
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:34,669
Very well.

554
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:39,970
Since Prince of Bo doesn't mind, Bao Na, bring your friend here.

555
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:42,109
Yes, Royal Brother!

556
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,530
Here.

557
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,189
Cheers.

558
00:38:58,019 --> 00:39:00,359
Brother, my friend is here!

559
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:29,258
This is my best friend in Jin Kingdom, whom I mentioned to you.

560
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,819
Prince of Chuan, Li Juyao.

561
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:34,400
Bao Na, you...

562
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,099
When did you go to Jin?

563
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,020
How did you meet him?

564
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,759
I didn't.

565
00:39:39,759 --> 00:39:45,259
In fact, I met him all because of Prince of Bo himself.

566
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,860
Isn't that right, Prince of Bo?

567
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,498
You're confusing me.

568
00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:53,298
Why would a Prince of Jin appear in Yang?

569
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:55,458
How is this related to Prince of Bo?

570
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,778
Isn't it interesting?

571
00:39:56,779 --> 00:40:00,040
The world never fails to surprise us.

572
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,500
Greetings, Your Majesty.

573
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,379
While the kingdom of Jin is not an ally of Qitan,

574
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,139
but the Princess and I are close friends,

575
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,360
so I am here to congratulate you.

576
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,258
The gift I meticulously prepared for you is still on the way here.

577
00:40:11,259 --> 00:40:14,018
I will present it tomorrow during the ceremony.

578
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:18,218
Since you are Bao Na's friend, you have my hospitality.

579
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:19,978
Forget about the gifts.

580
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:24,560
You are not our ally after all.

581
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,018
Your Majesty, why don't you decide to accept the gift or not after you see it?

582
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:32,419
Bao Na, who is this?

583
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:34,820
She...

584
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,299
She is the daughter of General Ma Ying,

585
00:40:37,299 --> 00:40:39,080
Ma Zhaixing.

586
00:40:39,779 --> 00:40:42,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

587
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:48,339
The Prince and I are here to especially congratulate you on your coronation. We wish you long-lasting blessings.

588
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,738
We risked our lives to come here to advise you for the sake of the world's citizens.

589
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:54,179
I hope you can pardon my rudeness.

590
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,780
You are Ma Ying's daughter?

591
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:59,980
Why are you with the Prince of Jin instead?

592
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,979
Your Majesty, the Ma Family Army has allied with Jin now.

593
00:41:02,979 --> 00:41:05,339
They must have come with ill intentions.

594
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:08,298
I hope you can expel them from your kingdom at once!

595
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,999
Wait!

596
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:12,679
The Ma Army has defected?

597
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:16,538
Prince of Bo, why didn't you mention this at all?

598
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,498
These selfish men cast my father's lifelong service aside.

599
00:41:22,499 --> 00:41:24,978
Not only did their emperor order Prince of Bo to kill my father,

600
00:41:24,979 --> 00:41:27,999
he even tricked me to marry this nemesis of mine

601
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:30,080
so he can control my father's troops.

602
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:36,218
The Chu's will eventually dispose of their interdependent allies

603
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:38,520
once their purpose has been served.

604
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,560
Prince of Bo, is she speaking the truth?

605
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,399
Everything she said is true.

606
