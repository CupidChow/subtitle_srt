00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,750
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,860
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,990
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,180
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,260
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,920
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,120
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,520
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:33,039
[Episode 28]
As long as I withdraw my troops,

21
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:35,579
the archers will leave, too.

22
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,540
Prepare the horses!

23
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,060
When we reach five li away from here,

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,920
we will release Ma Jing.

25
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,220
Ma Jing will come back safely, won't she?

26
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,219
She will.

27
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,779
If Prince of Bo goes against his word,

28
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,299
I shall drench the entire kingdom of Yang in blood.

29
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,040
You've changed.

30
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,659
You've missed so many opportunities to kill Prince of Bo because of Ma Zhaixing.

31
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:13,218
Have you forgotten that Royal Father told us to never easily trust the enemy?

32
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:15,759
- If Father knows about this—
- Eldest Brother,

33
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:18,100
she is Ma Zhaixing's own kin.

34
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:23,380
Even if that old guy rules with an iron fist,

35
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,740
the laws of Jin have never mentioned

36
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,578
anything about abandoning someone in need.

37
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,350
Without our royal father's order,

38
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,050
do you think I can deploy the Jin Troops myself?

39
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:34,259
Find him.

40
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,259
Join forces to rescue Ma Zhaixing and the Ma Army.

41
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,660
We must protect the scions of a loyal general.

42
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,179
Juyao, what Royal Father told you—

43
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,919
If you still want to bring up the past,

44
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,539
to find an excuse for that old guy,

45
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,580
then we might as well not talk.

46
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,858
You have left home for seven years.

47
00:03:56,859 --> 00:03:59,260
Since you were willing to follow me back to Taiyuan,

48
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,418
you must miss our father, too. Right?

49
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:03,280
Wrong.

50
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,460
I'm going back to Taiyuan only for Ma Zhaixing's sake.

51
00:04:09,139 --> 00:04:11,360
The world is vast.

52
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,499
Only the Kingdom of Jin

53
00:04:13,499 --> 00:04:16,819
can be the final resting place for her and the Ma Army.

54
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:19,520
But you do know that deploying troops to rescue Ma Zhaixing

55
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,939
and taking her troops in is creating dissent in our kingdom.

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,019
It was Royal Father who went against all odds for you.

57
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,840
The old guy did the right thing.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,520
The Ma Army won't let him down.

59
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:00,699
My Lord, Ji Chong and his troops did not go after us.

60
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,780
We are safe now.

61
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,280
They should be thankful that our master showed mercy.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,520
If it weren't because we couldn't deploy more archers in time–

63
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,258
Master, we could have defeated the troops of Ma and Jin today.

64
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,800
No.

65
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,939
If we did deploy our archer troops,

66
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,920
Ji Chong and his army would have noticed.

67
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,940
That would have placed Fourth Brother in further danger.

68
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,879
Stop harping on how you're doing this for me.

69
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,380
I never wanted you to kill Brother Ji Chong and Sister Zhaixing.

70
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,040
Your Highness, Prince of Bo was trying to save you.

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,640
Can't you see who your enemies are?

72
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,439
When I just returned home,

73
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,441
Sister Zhaixing was still your consort

74
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,139
and Brother Ji Chong was still my close friend.

75
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,479
It's only been a few months.

76
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,120
Why are they my enemies now?

77
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:59,259
My dear brother, I lack wisdom.

78
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,640
Can you explain it clearly to me?

79
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,299
You don't have to know all these.

80
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:11,920
It was my fault that you were held hostage

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,860
and placed in danger.

82
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,740
Are you treating me like a kid again?

83
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,140
Fine! Since you won't tell me, I'll go back and ask Father Emperor!

84
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:24,819
Your Highness!

85
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,599
Hai Die, guard Fourth Prince.

86
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,399
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,819
Mo Xiao.

88
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,419
Yes, Your Highness.

89
00:06:37,819 --> 00:06:39,419
Your Highness.

90
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,060
This is Ma Zhaixing's bow.

91
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,998
I find it a nuisance. Return this to her.

92
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:58,620
Do you think Young Feudal Mistress would want a murderer's possession?

93
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,240
She would.

94
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,859
She's itching to kill me with this bow.

95
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:07,060
If she doesn't want it, dispose of it.

96
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,100
Move.

97
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,439
Brother, it's been hours.

98
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,499
I've sent some men to scout the area.

99
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,859
Prince of Bo's archers have withdrawn.

100
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:54,500
Why don't you lead the troops back to the camp first?

101
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,439
We will rendezvous later.

102
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,600
Fine.

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,579
Please be careful, then.

104
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,779
Young Feudal Mistress, why don't you go back with General Li and rest up, too?

105
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:32,340
I shall wait here.

106
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,980
No.

107
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,680
I want to see Ma Jing back, safe and sound.

108
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,700
Only then can I be relieved.

109
00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:45,078
- Brother Ye Han.
- Yes, Young Mistress.

110
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:50,059
I have dragged all of you into this situation.

111
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:52,540
Why do you say that?

112
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,240
Please don't, Young Mistress.

113
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,379
All of us are willing to sacrifice ourselves for you.

114
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:03,240
I shall remember this.

115
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,339
From today onward, I, Ma Zhaixing, and the Ma Army

116
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:14,940
pledge loyalty to the King of Jin and you, Prince.

117
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,669
I'd rather you call me Ji Chong.

118
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:21,049
It sounds better.

119
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:23,769
The Ma Army have now pledged loyalty to Jin.

120
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:25,850
We now work under you.

121
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,409
We must address you respectfully.

122
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,648
Those are just trivial formalities.

123
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,009
And they should be followed.

124
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,250
Did my true identity make you distance yourself from me?

125
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,430
Or was it the truth of your father's murder

126
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,970
that is making you push everyone away?

127
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:54,389
Zhaixing,

128
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,870
I am still the same person that I was.

129
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,349
I haven't changed.

130
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,970
How can that be?

131
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,889
The Ji Chong whom I knew

132
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:11,129
was a vagabond, a bounty hunter.

133
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:13,270
Now, the person in front of me

134
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,530
is a dignified prince from Jin.

135
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,829
Ever since I knew about the truth,

136
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,150
everything has changed.

137
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,889
- Zhaixing.
 - Young Feudal Mistress!

138
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:39,389
Ma Jing!

139
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,750
Young Mistress!

140
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,630
Young Mistress!

141
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,849
Young Mistress, how are you?

142
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,029
Are you injured?

143
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:53,129
I'm fine.

144
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:55,569
What about you? Are you hurt?

145
00:10:55,569 --> 00:10:57,390
Did Prince of Bo torture you?

146
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,168
I'm fine and well. Everything's good.

147
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:04,089
By the way, Prince of Bo said that he doesn't want this wolf bow anymore.

148
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,170
You may do whatever you want with it.

149
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,479
What did he mean?

150
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:15,220
Does he think Zhaixing would want his garbage?

151
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,699
Prince of Bo said that one day, Young Mistress will use this bow to kill him.

152
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,938
What a shameless man.

153
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,339
Just throw this away!

154
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,740
No!

155
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,240
Why do you want to keep an item he gave to you?

156
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:49,920
In order to prove that I no longer love him,

157
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,700
I once swore to this bow.

158
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,520
I said that I would use it

159
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,679
to avenge my dead family

160
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,079
so my father can rest in peace.

161
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,200
Zhaixing,

162
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,220
from now on, this vendetta is no longer just about you and the Ma Army.

163
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:25,460
We are now sworn enemies with them.

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,419
The Kingdom of Jin shares your woes.

165
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,820
No.

166
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,838
The King of Jin is waging war against Chu Kui for the sake of world justice.

167
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,379
Meanwhile, the feud I have with Prince of Bo

168
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:41,739
is of my personal concern.

169
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:47,359
I must kill Prince of Bo with my own hands.

170
00:12:47,359 --> 00:12:51,279
I miss the girl who squabbled

171
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:56,939
and joked around with me.

172
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:08,939
She's dead.

173
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:39,639
Youzhen?

174
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,179
Greetings, Father Emperor.

175
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:46,200
Let me take a good look.

176
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,698
You were kidnapped by those bandits.

177
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:49,099
You're not hurt, are you?

178
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,379
No, I am not hurt.

179
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I was just shocked by what had transpired.

180
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,320
Zhang Jin, summon the imperial physician.

181
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,330
No need!

182
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,648
You just need to answer a question.

183
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:04,449
That would be enough.

184
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:07,809
Father Emperor, Fourth Brother simply heard some rumors.

185
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,529
You need not take heed.

186
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,170
I shall bring him back to rest.

187
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,210
Are they rumors?

188
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,109
Or is it a guilty secret?

189
00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:23,609
Silence!

190
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:27,429
Let him speak.

191
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:32,650
I'd love to hear what it is that scared him so.

192
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,249
Allow me to ask you this.

193
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,568
Were you the one who killed Ma Ying and his entire family;

194
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:42,369
then left Sister Zhaixing alive out of fear of

195
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,551
being unable to control the Ma Army,

196
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,929
just to use her to control the Ma Army?

197
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,389
Then, you set the King of Jin up to cover your heinous crime?

198
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,569
Are you interrogating me?

199
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:54,250
Calm down, Father Emperor.

200
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,090
Pardon his ignorance.

201
00:14:58,574 --> 00:15:00,850
Let go of me!

202
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,249
He ruined your life.

203
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,510
Why are you still hesitating?

204
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,049
Father Emperor!

205
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,329
Insolent child, kneel!

206
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,749
Kneel and apologize to your third brother!

207
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:22,688
The entire world may curse him, but you can't!

208
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:24,730
You can't!

209
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,689
Insolent child!

210
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,330
Men!

211
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:36,470
Come!

212
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,050
Drag this insolent child to Xun Royal Mansion

213
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,008
so he can reflect on his doings!

214
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,849
Without my orders, no one may release him!

215
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,969
Take him away!

216
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,669
Don't touch me! I will walk by myself!

217
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:50,070
You! Take him away!

218
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:57,970
Calm down, Father Emperor. Fourth Brother is immature.

219
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,109
How is Ma Zhaixing now?

220
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,469
I am sorry.

221
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:13,710
I couldn't kill her in time.

222
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:18,089
She was saved by the Ma Army and the Jin Army.

223
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:22,609
And Ji Chong is actually the youngest son of the King of Jin, Li Juyao.

224
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,310
What?

225
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,889
To think he is the son of the King of Jin.

226
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:33,309
He tried so hard to sneak into my kingdom.

227
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,789
What does he want?

228
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,469
It's my fault for keeping my guard down.

229
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:42,729
Ma Zhaixing is a lucky girl indeed.

230
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,749
Now she has Jin to back her up!

231
00:16:46,749 --> 00:16:48,328
I don't understand.

232
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:50,590
How can a lone woman like her

233
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,649
help Jin in any significant way?

234
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:56,629
Forgive my incompetence.

235
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,569
We're reaching Taiyuan soon.

236
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,269
Young Feudal Mistress.

237
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,690
[Taiyuan]

238
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:27,940
It wasn't long ago that I misunderstood the King of Jin.

239
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,370
But now, Taiyuan is our resting place.

240
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,790
I find this an irony.

241
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,390
Young Mistress,

242
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,010
please don't harbor such thoughts.

243
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:56,870
Think about it.

244
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,408
We managed to find out the truth behind the Ma Family massacre

245
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,710
and leave unscathed.

246
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,429
We have Ji Chong to thank for it.

247
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,669
Your encounter with him

248
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:12,389
must have been a blessing from the late General Ma.

249
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:16,389
What Ji Chong did for me and my troops

250
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:19,169
is truly immense.

251
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,650
Oh, right, Young Mistress.

252
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,309
Why do you think Ji Chong left the palace seven years ago?

253
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,328
Now that he's back, instead of staying in the palace,

254
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:34,429
he chose to stay with us in our camp outside the city.

255
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:36,730
Why did he choose to do so?

256
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,210
[Taiji (Supreme Ultimate) Palace Hall]

257
00:18:58,329 --> 00:19:01,710
Your Majesty, enjoy your dessert.

258
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,310
You may leave.

259
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,010
I shall execute your orders.

260
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:14,510
I take my leave.

261
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,249
Shall we ask him?

262
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,049
Of course.

263
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,208
He's here!

264
00:19:24,209 --> 00:19:25,328
Ask him!1

265
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:26,350
You go!

266
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:28,089
This is about the youngest prince we miss so much!

267
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,808
Go ask him!

268
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,770
Come out, all of you.

269
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,610
I have no time to play hide-and-seek.

270
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,768
What a coincidence, Chief Eunuch! You're here!

271
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:41,969
Chief Eunuch, has the king forgiven the youngest prince?

272
00:19:41,969 --> 00:19:43,789
- Can he come back now?
- That's right.

273
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,630
Can we start cleaning his room now?

274
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,048
- Can we start preparing?
- Can we?

275
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:49,470
When is he coming back?

276
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,428
I've reminded you time and again.

277
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:58,369
You ladies should speak softly.

278
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,009
Slowly.

279
00:20:01,009 --> 00:20:03,910
Elegantly.

280
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,457
You shouldn't be hollering.

281
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:09,110
Back to the point.

282
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,289
His Majesty has said that we don't have to clean that brat's room.

283
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,409
He's not coming back to stay anyway.

284
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,309
So, it seems that His Majesty has not forgiven the prince yet.

285
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,850
So, did he smash the bowl of snow fungus soup that you brought him again?

286
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,890
Oh, now this is interesting.

287
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,910
His Majesty didn't say a word today.

288
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,589
I myself have been serving him for decades.

289
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,530
Until now, I still can't fathom his thoughts.

290
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,148
This should be a good start.

291
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:45,229
The snow fungus soup is the king and the prince's favorite food.

292
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,131
But when the prince left seven years ago, whenever

293
00:20:48,131 --> 00:20:52,148
we serve that soup, the king would smash the bowl in frustration.

294
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:53,188
- Isn't that so?
- Exactly.

295
00:20:53,189 --> 00:20:54,668
He'd always do that.

296
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:58,440
While the king was silent today,

297
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,260
at least he didn't smash the bowl.

298
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:01,928
Yes, that's great! He didn't.

299
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:07,069
Most importantly, even though the king has forbidden so many things,

300
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:12,148
he has never forbidden the prince from returning.

301
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,188
That means the prince can come back!

302
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,250
That's great! That's right.

303
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,569
If you ask me, the king is missing his son.

304
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,830
Taiyuan looks so quiet.

305
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,188
You can't even see a single hawker around.

306
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:43,889
There's a lot of soldiers around, though.

307
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:47,509
But the people seem to be on good terms with them.

308
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:51,249
We're at Taiyuan's main road.

309
00:21:51,249 --> 00:21:52,788
The market is somewhere else.

310
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,470
Also, in Taiyuan,

311
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:57,750
every adult man must join the army,

312
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,290
unless they are the family's only son or handicapped.

313
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:07,149
Looks like the rumors about Taiyuan not having any beggars is true.

314
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:11,069
The king's mandatory service is successful.

315
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,770
Indeed. If that old guy sets his mind to it,

316
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,850
there's nothing he can't do.

317
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,169
Now that I have witnessed this,

318
00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:23,970
it is indeed so.

319
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,650
While I hate complimenting him, I have to admit

320
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:34,429
that the old guy has brilliant strategies.

321
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,269
He started with reorganizing internal affairs,

322
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:39,509
decreasing the taxes, and lightening the people's burdens.

323
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:44,268
He also put a halt to corruption so that everyone in Taiyuan

324
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,530
can live a peaceful life amidst the chaotic world.

325
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:50,610
But no one is perfect.

326
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,870
Once you meet that old guy,

327
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,009
you will see how arrogant and stubborn he is.

328
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,590
He's akin to this road.

329
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,289
Stiff and dull.

330
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,270
What happened between you and the king?

331
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,390
He gave a military order to behead me.

332
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:21,010
What? Behead you?

333
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,350
Is that the young marshal?

334
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,110
Just kidding.

335
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,530
Look at your shocked faces.

336
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,530
Who would joke like that?

337
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,549
- It is him!
- It is!

338
00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:35,930
Young Marshal, you're back!

339
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,549
- Young Marshal!
- You're back!

340
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,111
The young marshal is back!

341
00:23:39,111 --> 00:23:41,508
- Ke Lang.
- We missed you!

342
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:42,870
You're Ke Lang?

343
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,508
I didn't expect that you'd remember me.

344
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:47,649
Back then, these soldiers and I got together because of you.

345
00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:50,389
The king is still waiting for Prince of Chuan to return to the palace.

346
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:51,849
Ever since you left,

347
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:56,509
I thought we would never meet again.

348
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:57,769
Indeed.

349
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,070
Looks like you're living the good life now.

350
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,590
Now that you're a leader of the city garrison army,

351
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,230
your mother must be relieved.

352
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:11,050
When the Chuanlong Army lost you, most of us were deployed to build the palace.

353
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,650
But we refused, so we came here.

354
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:18,169
Young Marshal, everyone here misses you.

355
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,550
- Yes, us, too!
- We miss you!

356
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,630
I shall remind Prince of Chuan to stop delaying.

357
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,950
No need.

358
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,749
Judging from Juyao's personality, the more you force him,

359
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,029
the more he'd retaliate.

360
00:24:32,029 --> 00:24:33,229
Just wait.

361
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,029
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Stay here, please.

362
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,169
Young Feudal Mistress, look.

363
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:42,709
The prince is well-loved by his people.

364
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,189
It's the same as how you were back in Kuizhou.

365
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:47,429
- How are you?
- Everyone's doing great.

366
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:51,409
Yeah. You seem to be drunk.

367
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:52,289
I remember now!

368
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:53,349
You still remember that?

369
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,050
Exactly.

370
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:00,428
A warrior wolf!

371
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:03,049
Ma Jing, did you see that?

372
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,709
Where? I can't see it.

373
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,148
Were you mistaken?

374
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,830
Impossible.

375
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,669
I'm sure it was a warrior wolf.

376
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:15,350
Prince of Bo must be spying on us.

377
00:25:17,389 --> 00:25:19,909
Young Mistress, where are you going?

378
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:21,650
Young Mistress!

379
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,730
Young Mistress!

380
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,268
Ma Jing, what's wrong?

381
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:30,870
She said she saw Prince of Bo's warrior wolf.

382
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,908
Preposterous!

383
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:33,869
How can there be a wolf in Taiyuan?

384
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,810
What a farce!

385
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,189
Brother, if I remember correctly,

386
00:25:38,189 --> 00:25:40,028
this road leads to the market. Right?

387
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:41,640
Then, you should remember

388
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,369
that horses are barred from galloping in the market.

389
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:47,389
The market is full of people now.

390
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:49,969
Your Young Mistress Ma is about to get into trouble.

391
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,349
Ke Lang, bring the soldiers to stop her from the other side.

392
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,428
Yes, Young Marshal!

393
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,288
Follow me! Get into position, now!

394
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:00,229
Young Mistress Ma is already breaking the law upon arriving.

395
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,530
Let's see how you will explain this to Royal Father.

396
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,290
Ji Chong!

397
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:14,370
Ji Chong! Ji Chong!

398
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,650
Master.

399
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,148
Hai Die, go to the Fourth Prince's mansion and pass my order.

400
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,909
Recall the palace guards monitoring him.

401
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:28,148
Yes, Your Highness.

402
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:30,029
- Mo Xiao.
- Yes, Your Highness.

403
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:32,070
Send a spy to Taiyuan.

404
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,668
I want to know Ma Zhaixing and her troops' whereabouts.

405
00:26:34,669 --> 00:26:37,249
Report to me instantly if there is any news.

406
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:39,289
Your wish is my command.

407
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,030
Are you fine?

408
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,008
Young Feudal Mistress, that was a ridiculous mistake.

409
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,830
You mistook a hunting dog for a wolf

410
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,889
and created a mess in the market.

411
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:08,570
No matter how much you hate Prince of Bo, you should at least have sane judgment.

412
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,729
Eldest Brother, cut it out.

413
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,230
You can protect her as you like.

414
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:20,309
But those merchants who had their stalls run over are suffering from great losses.

415
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:22,789
They have lost all their income today.

416
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,649
Ke Lang, help the people rebuild their stalls.

417
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,590
Then, report the number of losses to me.

418
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,490
Yes, Young Marshal!

419
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,490
Your Highness, I am at fault for today's happenings.

420
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,670
I shall bear all responsibility.

421
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:54,889
My brother has been cleaning up a lot of your messes before this, am I right?

422
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:58,369
Your Highness! Please don't say that!

423
00:27:58,389 --> 00:28:02,070
The princess is just traumatized by Prince of Bo.

424
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,770
That's why she was paranoid that he'd set an ambush here; hence, her mistake.

425
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:08,370
She wasn't like so in the past.

426
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,970
Ma Jing.

427
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,269
Enough.

428
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:15,169
We have delayed long enough.

429
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:17,449
Can we meet the king now?

430
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,230
Zhaixing, this insolent prince

431
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,410
can only come this far with you.

432
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:29,590
But don't worry.

433
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,429
I'm a capable man.

434
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,370
If something happens to you inside this palace,

435
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:37,329
even metal walls won't stop me from breaking in.

436
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,409
Thank you, Ji Chong.

437
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,949
- Ma Jing.
- Yes, Young Mistress.

438
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:51,549
Please go back to our camp first.

439
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,970
Royal Father, Young Mistress Ma requests an audience.

440
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,549
Greetings, Your Majesty.

441
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,309
It has been a long journey for you.

442
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,730
You must be exhausted.

443
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,509
No, not at all.

444
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:46,350
I must thank you and the crown prince for saving me.

445
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:50,289
How are your troops?

446
00:29:50,909 --> 00:29:54,848
Your Majesty, the Ma Army and I have settled down.

447
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:58,730
Our thousands of soldiers are ready to kill your enemies on the battlefield.

448
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,230
Juji.

449
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,309
Escort Young Feudal Mistress Ma back to her camp to rest.

450
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,469
This way, Young Mistress Ma.

451
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,449
Your Majesty.

452
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:13,530
I have heard about what happened when you entered the city.

453
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:17,029
My worries have now been confirmed.

454
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:20,570
My father is worried that your history with Prince of Bo

455
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,570
will give rise to hatred and affect your judgment.

456
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,249
This is a military taboo.

457
00:30:25,249 --> 00:30:28,989
As expected, when you saw a dog that looked similar to Prince of Bo's warrior wolf,

458
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,130
you lost your composure.

459
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,629
Pardon my ignorance.

460
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,590
I have committed a serious military mistake.

461
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,269
I beg you, Your Majesty, to give me another chance.

462
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:55,730
That old man must be giving Zhaixing a hard time.

463
00:30:57,549 --> 00:30:59,570
I need to help her.

464
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,070
Who's this?

465
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,769
Someone's scratching his butt here.

466
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,169
It's you.

467
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,829
I thought you were the legendary Xia Yu who didn't go home despite

468
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,730
passing his house three times just to remedy the Yellow River flooding.

469
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:23,550
Have you finally realized where your home is?

470
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:27,029
Darn...

471
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:31,590
Dear Chief Eunuch, I've missed you.

472
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,668
I heard you say darn.

473
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:35,770
And you miss me?

474
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,189
I thought you were so scared of the king

475
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:41,509
that you were not coming back anymore.

476
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:43,350
What a joke!

477
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,909
Why would I be scared of that old guy?

478
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:49,489
You seem to be having a rough life out there.

479
00:31:49,489 --> 00:31:52,109
Don't you even know you've torn your clothes?

480
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,650
Other side.

481
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:57,349
Yes, raise your arm.

482
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,469
Yes, come here.

483
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,350
See, it's right here!

484
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,850
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

485
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,609
- Go easy on me, please!
- Go easy?

486
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:15,149
Now, I'm itching to hang you up and beat you like a punching bag!

487
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,388
It's been seven years since you left.

488
00:32:17,389 --> 00:32:19,669
We had no news from you.

489
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,909
If you die out there,

490
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:24,309
who's going to bury you?

491
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,989
Who'd care about you?

492
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,508
You brat! You heartless boy!

493
00:32:29,508 --> 00:32:32,810
Chief Eunuch, that's enough.

494
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:34,490
I'm alive and well now, see?

495
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,548
You're alive and well?

496
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:38,870
Let go of me!

497
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,109
Chief Eunuch.

498
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,709
Come, follow me.

499
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,869
If I don't let the king beat you to a pulp today,

500
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,308
you can change my name!

501
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,390
Wait, Chief Eunuch!

502
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,629
I'm not going to see that old guy!

503
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,129
You're not? You can't choose!

504
00:32:54,129 --> 00:32:55,229
Move!

505
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,409
- Chief Eunuch!
- Move!

506
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:05,210
For now, your priority isn't to attack the enemy,

507
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,690
but to heal your wounds.

508
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,590
But...

509
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,350
I have waited so many years to uphold justice.

510
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,049
Is it not possible for you to wait any longer?

511
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,269
Attacking the enemy kingdom is the same as waging war.

512
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:22,870
We cannot afford to be reckless.

513
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,010
The enemy is stronger than my six royal troops combined.

514
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,989
Besides, your troops were just hurt by the miasma.

515
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,550
Shouldn't they be recuperating, too?

516
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,250
When it comes to a dire war like this, don't you have

517
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,949
any sense of judgment left in you?

518
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:45,990
If you let your emotions lead you as you fixate yourself on revenge,

519
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,469
this would not only worry me and our allies,

520
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,830
it would also be a disgrace to General Ma Ying himself!

521
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,029
Your criticism is just, Your Majesty.

522
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:00,669
I realize my errors now.

523
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:03,449
You need to gather sand to build a tower.

524
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,789
The ability to command an army

525
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:09,989
does not form overnight.

526
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,530
You should go back and study the art of war.

527
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,309
You may leave now.

528
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,670
I take my leave.

529
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:45,429
Looks like this Young Feudal Mistress Ma isn't as astute as Juyao described.

530
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,349
She loses her composure easily.

531
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:49,670
She can be very headstrong.

532
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:55,709
Be it headstrong or tough,

533
00:34:55,709 --> 00:34:59,129
since that brat sees highly of her,

534
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:02,050
I'd like to see how capable

535
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,949
this young lady is.

536
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:08,629
Chief Eunuch, I'm not meeting him!

537
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,409
You brat.

538
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,029
This way.

539
00:35:16,229 --> 00:35:18,929
You're still the best, Chief Eunuch.

540
00:35:18,929 --> 00:35:21,829
I'm just concerned that the king won't want to see you.

541
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,508
If I rashly take you to his side...

542
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:25,670
Sit.

543
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,530
The guards will surely drag me out of this palace.

544
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,429
To think I'm doing this for you.

545
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,369
It's not worth it.

546
00:35:37,749 --> 00:35:39,349
Food!

547
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,630
Ever since my mother passed away,

548
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,910
I never had this anymore.

549
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,770
Eat up.

550
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:00,390
Fourth Madam loved lilies,

551
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,569
and the king loves snow fungus the most.

552
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:08,830
As for you, you've always loved eating pears.

553
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,948
Back then, your mother often made sweet soups like this.

554
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:19,010
She said this soup represents you, your father, and her.

555
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,929
Sometimes, when the king and you weren't in Taiyuan,

556
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:25,689
she would make this soup

557
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:28,290
and think about both of you.

558
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,749
Your Highness,

559
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:39,069
both you and the king have a stubborn temper.

560
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,369
You've been clashing and fighting with each other for seven years.

561
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:48,910
You may not be tired of it, but your father is.

562
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:52,229
For the past seven years,

563
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,468
he has never touched this soup.

564
00:36:54,469 --> 00:36:58,268
When he heard that you were coming back today, he actually drank it.

565
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,149
What does this mean?

566
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,629
It means he has forgiven you.

567
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,010
He's just embarrassed to say so.

568
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:14,069
Since you're back, just apologize to your father.

569
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:17,449
Patch up with him.

570
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:20,969
You should know that for the past seven years,

571
00:37:20,969 --> 00:37:25,590
the king has never ordered to repeal your regal title.

572
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,670
Even before you reached Taiyuan,

573
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:34,649
you were permitted to deploy the Jin Army to save Young Feudal Mistress Ma.

574
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:37,349
The palace is heavily guarded.

575
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:40,409
You leave and go as you like.

576
00:37:40,409 --> 00:37:45,449
Do you know who gave you such a privilege?

577
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,849
Your Highness, I earnestly ask you

578
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:00,810
to please change into this attire to meet the king.

579
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:07,590
No way.

580
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:10,490
That would mean I'm giving in to that old man.

581
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:17,110
If that's the case, let me ask you this, Your Highness.

582
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,670
With your identity as Ji Chong,

583
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:25,530
are you really capable of saving the Ma Army and Young Mistress Ma?

584
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,470
Come back here! Do not go to Ji Chong!

585
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:08,390
Young Mistress, your hand is injured. It's bleeding!

586
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,449
Have you forgotten what the king said?

587
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,228
Do not let your emotions lead you.

588
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:15,389
Otherwise, we would bring dishonor to the troops and my father!

589
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:17,788
Can you stop listening to everything the king says?

590
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,829
If you continue practicing like this, you'll collapse soon.

591
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:23,089
But you still can't go to Ji Chong!

592
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:25,290
He's helped me enough.

593
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,090
Announcing the arrival of Prince of Chuan!

594
00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:51,109
Is this really Ji Chong? He's different now.

595
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:54,509
Oh my. I've never seen you in this appearance.

596
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:57,390
You look like a shining dragon!

597
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:23,189
- Greetings, Prince of Chuan.
- Greetings, Prince of Chuan.

598
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,330
Get up.

599
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:38,509
Zhaixing, stop staring.

600
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:39,990
I'm still me.

601
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,330
Listen. I reclaimed my title

602
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,530
just so I can conveniently approach you from now on,

603
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,949
not because I've patched up with that old guy.

604
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:53,470
I've heard about how you were aggrieved by that old guy.

605
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,190
Your Highness, I didn't suffer any grievances.

606
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:59,690
It was me who was too reckless.

607
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:05,309
I must make use of my time to master archery and the art of war.

608
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:10,089
I will prove to the king that I can lead the Ma Family Army.

609
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:18,509
Look at you.

610
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:21,250
If you continue your impetuous behavior,

611
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,870
your plan will backfire.

612
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,250
Even if you train for 100 years,

613
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,090
you won't defeat Prince of Bo.

614
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:35,268
If you need a teacher, someone is ready to serve you.

615
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:39,548
Our youngest prince was a great general of the Jin Army.

616
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:44,649
Be it strategy, archery, or cavalry, he is nothing but top-notch.

617
00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:45,829
That's right.

618
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,930
Back in the streets of Yang,

619
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,180
didn't you see Prince of Chuan and Prince of Bo

620
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,290
in an archery showdown?

621
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,149
So, I think if you want to command the troops,

622
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,670
Prince of Chuan will be your best teacher.

623
00:42:06,789 --> 00:42:10,569
Prince of Chuan, I humbly request you to teach me the ways of battle

624
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,390
so I may avenge my father in the future.

625
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,070
I indeed can teach you archery,

626
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:23,549
but you have to listen to me.

627
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,560
