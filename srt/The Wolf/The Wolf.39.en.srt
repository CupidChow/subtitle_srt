[The Wolf]

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,400
[Episode 39]

20
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
Good morning.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,800
I chased him away.

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,000
This is Lord Bo we're talking about.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,500
He wouldn't lose so easily.

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,000
That depends on how badly hurt he got from the battle of Boxiang.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
What is the meaning of this?

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,100
Do you think I can't beat him?

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,200
At least not winning without being injured.

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,600
Why didn't you dress the wound sooner?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was hoping you would help.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,500
You're leaving without a word.

31
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,000
But I can't return unscathed.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,800
I appreciate this.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,700
What's wrong?

34
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,800
Are you not happy to see me here?

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Something that still confuses me.

36
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,800
What happened during the battle of Boxiang?

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,500
As you can see,

38
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
the Wolfbone Flower caused Lord Bo's defeat.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,300
So when he woke up to find out his troops had been defeated,

40
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,800
he saw that you were unconscious, so he took the chance.

41
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,400
He took you away as his hostage.

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,700
He threatened us.

43
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,400
I sent Zhuiri after you.

44
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,800
Then I found your location.

45
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
Is that all that happened?

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,500
That's all.

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
It was my fault.

48
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,600
I fell from the horse during the battle of Boxiang.

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,300
Blame yourself for overworking over the battle plans.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,600
We should go back.

51
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,700
We shouldn't let others wait.

52
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
Come.

♫ Hiding one's weakness ♫

♫ We are all like trapped beasts ♫

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,000
♫ Having no freedom ♫

61
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,400
See you in the next lifetime, Ma Zhaixing.

♫ No matter how painful or how much love there is, don't say it ♫

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,900
♫ Watching you but I can't move forward ♫

66
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,600
Sir? Sir?

67
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,600
Sir, you must not take this shortcut.

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
There is a man-eating tiger on the mountain.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Indeed.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,200
The place I am headed for is a den of beasts.

71
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
But at least...

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,300
I won't have to do the beast's bidding again.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,900
Sir?

74
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,489
This man is insane. He wants to get himself killed.

75
00:06:01,489 --> 00:06:05,200
♫ Personally burying this warmth ♫

76
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,600
♫ My heart is crashing ♫

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,000
♫ Can you catch me ♫

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,900
My resolve is now emboldened by my success.

79
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,800
Nothing will stand in my way again.

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
Please inform my arrival.

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,400
I wouldn't dare. Please come in.

82
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,900
Imperial Father, I am here.

83
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Father, I've learned my mistake.

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,700
I thought being confined to the Imperial Mausoleum was the worst suffering I had endured.

85
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
But then I was told

86
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,600
that you had run into danger on the battlefield.

87
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,700
I was so worried but I couldn't do anything.

88
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,600
Then I finally realized...

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,900
if I couldn't carry out my duty as a son,

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,200
that would be the worst torture the world has for me!

91
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,700
Emperor Father!

92
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,000
I would gladly give up my life to keep you safe.

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,400
Please forgive me.

94
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,000
Allow me to be your bodyguard. Let me protect you at all times!

95
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,900
Chuchu,

96
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,200
I have never forgotten the pain

97
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,400
of losing our child.

98
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,200
I only need more time.

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,600
Your Highness,

100
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,600
the consort has been praying at the Jiguang Temple lately.

101
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,300
The temple is not far from here.

102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,000
Perhaps I could request for her to return.

103
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,400
Not for the time being.

104
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,200
Chuchu has a kind heart.

105
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,800
If she comes back,

106
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,400
she will ask for me to save Lord Bo.

107
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,700
We'll wait until I can secure my place in the court and finish off Lord Bo.

108
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,900
Yes.

109
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,200
Once Your Highness becomes the regent, we'll send soldiers after Lord Bo.

110
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,400
I doubt Lord Bo can get away this time.

111
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Juyao sent Zhuiri back with a letter.

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,500
The princess is safe.

113
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,300
They are on their way back here.

114
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Emperor Father, in that case, why do you still look concerned?

115
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,000
I am sure you know what worries me.

116
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,400
I've seen so many battles over the years.

117
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
This is by far the most baffling battle!

118
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,200
Lord Bo saved the princess right in front of all the soldiers.

119
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,900
Shouldn't they be at each other's throats?

120
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,689
People are starting to suspect the Princess's love for Lord Bo was reignited.

121
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:23,408
They are worried the princess might become a traitor just as Lord Bo did before.

122
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,089
King of Jin,

123
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,689
the princess is a symbol of belief forged with the soldiers' lives.

124
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,529
But the battle at Boxiang has struck doubts into our ranks!

125
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:35,650
At this rate,

126
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:38,209
the soldiers' morale will be shaken.

127
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,108
Emperor Father, once the rumor gets out and ruins the princess's reputation,

128
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,669
the situation will get out of hand.

129
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,849
The sun is scorching. We'll take a break here.

130
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,630
We've been traveling day and night. I didn't notice your face had become red from the sunlight.

131
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,470
You can take my cape.

132
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,249
Never mind.

133
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,030
A leaf will do just fine.

134
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,229
The sun has been scorching lately.

135
00:13:02,229 --> 00:13:04,549
Yet you seem fine with it.

136
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:07,669
Using the leaf was Lord Bo's idea, right?

137
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,509
Was that too hard to answer?

138
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,950
Yes, he taught me this.

139
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,209
Had I been hurt on the way,

140
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:23,610
he would have lost this bargaining chip.

141
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,349
Perhaps.

142
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,630
We'll carry on.

143
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,208
People are waiting for you to raise morale.

144
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,409
After all, you are Jin's symbol of belief.

145
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,409
Master, a report came in.

146
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,589
Master, is it from Lord Bo?

147
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:00,370
What did he say?

148
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,209
"A bond for life. Meet me at Hanshui."

149
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,590
What are you doing?

150
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,130
Learn the truth.

151
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:34,229
Wolf Boy and Xing'er are no more.

152
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:38,429
No!

153
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,689
Fortunately...

154
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,589
You came.

155
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,969
I have questions for you.

156
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,390
Did you spare that scout on purpose?

157
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,909
Using Wolfbone Flower was part of your plan?

158
00:15:32,909 --> 00:15:35,309
So that when you died, not only would

159
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,070
Ma Zhaixing not be hurt at all,

160
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,909
she would be overjoyed.

161
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,670
I spared that scout.

162
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,709
I won't keep it from you. You would find out anyway.

163
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,650
You admitted your crime.

164
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,968
Aren't you worried that I came here to capture you?

165
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:54,609
I have no plan to escape.

166
00:15:54,609 --> 00:15:56,590
You're the Grand Diviner.

167
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,989
Apprehending me is only part of your duty.

168
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,530
In that case, why are we even meeting?

169
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,250
I wouldn't blame you if you chose not to come here.

170
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,989
But since you're here, it means our destinies are intertwined.

171
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:17,170
I won't lie to you.

172
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,350
I even have a request to make.

173
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,490
Ever since you were a kid you've never bowed down to anyone.

174
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,329
I've been waiting for the lone wolf

175
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:49,010
to bow down to me and beg me for help.

176
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,609
You've finally done it today,

177
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,429
but I feel not the slightest joy.

178
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,569
Tell me.

179
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,790
What do you need from me?

180
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,149
Chu Kui appointed you the Grand Diviner.

181
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,830
I'm certain you know where Fourth Prince is.

182
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,509
He was imprisoned by His Majesty.

183
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:18,090
His Majesty covered up Fourth Prince's attempt to abdicate him.

184
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,170
He told me if you chose to come back,

185
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,649
Fourth Prince will be spared.

186
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,510
I am somewhat responsible for this.

187
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,450
Fourth Prince is under house arrest.

188
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,830
His life is at stake.

189
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,430
Which is why I must trade my life to save him.

190
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,800
If you return now you are as good as dead.

191
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,329
My request for you

192
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,089
is for you to take care

193
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:56,549
of my brother, Wen Yan, and the others after I die.

194
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,669
Chu Kui has always loved my fourth brother.

195
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:02,289
After I return, a life for a life...

196
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,810
Enough!

197
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,509
Does your life mean nothing to you?

198
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:11,109
Why should you give up your life for them?

199
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,810
If I can save all of them

200
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,480
with my life,

201
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,629
then it's worth it.

202
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,149
What about Ma Zhaixing?

203
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,649
You've done so much for her.

204
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,709
Does she still not forgive you?

205
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:36,809
I never wanted her to forgive me.

206
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:39,889
So you chose to atone for your sin with death?

207
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,789
You wanted to sever your love.

208
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,293
But on the battlefield,

209
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,930
you risked your life to save her.

210
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,470
You clearly–

211
00:18:55,160 --> 00:19:00,169
It's clear that all you cared for was her all along.

212
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,470
Go to Ma Zhaixing.

213
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,190
Fourth Prince and

214
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,189
the Night Fiends

215
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,149
will be well taken care of.

216
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,890
If there was any love left

217
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,300
between Zhaixing and I,

218
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,789
it would only be my wishful thinking.

219
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,350
That is...

220
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,009
the best outcome I hope for.

221
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,530
Yao Ji,

222
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,429
my request

223
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,090
will surely cause you a lot of trouble.

224
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,069
But of all the people in the world,

225
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,250
you're the only person

226
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,810
I can count on.

227
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,748
Farewell. Take care.

228
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,410
Stop!

229
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,970
You said our destinies are intertwined.

230
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,770
If you die,

231
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,610
what should I do next?

232
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:16,210
Because our destinies are intertwined,

233
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,029
I asked.

234
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:26,140
♫ Even if there’s another undercurrent rushing over,
I won't disintegrate ♫

235
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,289
I am leaving you

236
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,750
with my last wish.

237
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,510
Our destinies are intertwined.

238
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,209
As long as you stay alive, it's akin to me being alive.

239
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:52,150
♫ Hiding behind you, living forever in a universe you can't see ♫

240
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,220
♫ It won't hurt, it can't hurt, I will be the toughest rock ♫

241
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,610
This dagger was forged using the same meteorite

242
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:02,370
as Chu Kui's Chixiao Sword.

243
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,989
As I remember,

244
00:21:05,989 --> 00:21:10,370
you love it for its sharpness because it slices everything easily.

245
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,389
From now on,

246
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,700
this dagger will keep you safe.

247
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:26,810
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later,
I will be waiting here ♫

248
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:34,780
♫ Not gentle, cannot be sad, you don’t need to understand ♫

249
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,269
You told me that our destinies are intertwined.

250
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,830
Yet you want to die first and let me live alone.

251
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,929
I won't grant your wish.

252
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,030
Never.

253
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
[Suyang]

254
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,500
You shall not pass.

255
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,000
Please do me a favor.

256
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,300
Allow me into the city.

257
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,800
We have an order from the regent.

258
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
No one shall pass through the northern gate.

259
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
This gate is only for the capture of Lord Bo!

260
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,400
Use the other gates!

261
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,600
You insolent brat.

262
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
Listen up!

263
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,400
I am the man you're looking for!

264
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,100
You... You...

265
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,200
Lieutenant! Lieutenant!

266
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Surround him! Don't let him escape!

267
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,000
Left Lieutenant, it's been a long time.

268
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We once served the imperial court together.

269
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't want to make it difficult for you.

270
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Please take me to His Majesty.

271
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,800
I won't resist.

272
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,900
Be cautious.

273
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,000
He is dangerous.

274
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,200
Your Majesty.

275
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,600
Your Majesty, Lord Bo...

276
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,500
He came back alone to surrender himself.

277
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,300
Good.

278
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,400
Take him to prison.

279
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

280
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,800
We welcome your return, Princess.

281
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
It has been a long journey for you.

282
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,000
Thank you for your concern.

283
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,600
I am fine.

284
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,700
Juyao has informed me of the situation.

285
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,900
Lord Bo unexpectedly lost the battle.

286
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,000
He took you hostage. It has been a terrible experience for you.

287
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,500
We had failed our duty.

288
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:47,600
We couldn't stop Lord Bo from taking you.

289
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,500
My King, this is not your fault.

290
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,200
The battlefield is unpredictable.

291
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,400
We have no control over what could happen.

292
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,600
But Ji Chong managed to find me in time.

293
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,600
Lord Bo didn't succeed with his plan.

294
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,500
I wasn't hurt.

295
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,700
We were just informed.

296
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,600
Lord Bo has returned to the palace to ask for forgiveness, knowing he had nowhere to go

297
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,200
after losing the battle.

298
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
I doubt he can escape his punishment.

299
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,600
The battle of Boxiang took a toll on the enemies' morale.

300
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,700
We defeated Lord Bo. Chu Kui was heavily wounded.

301
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,800
It's a victory worthy of celebration.

302
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
Indeed.

303
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
He chose to surrender himself.

304
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,500
He chose to do the vile's bidding.

305
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,900
Lord Bo can go back and beg for his father's mercy.

306
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,400
But he shouldn't have taken the princess.

307
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,100
Thanks to him I had to face the soldiers' and generals' gossip.

308
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,200
Marquis, what happened in the base?

309
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,600
During the battle of Boxiang, the soldiers saw Lord Bo saving you in the battle and taking you with him.

310
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,200
But now you have returned unscathed.

311
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
The soldiers are left confused.

312
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,600
They... They thought...

313
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,200
They thought Lord Bo's love for you had been reignited.

314
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,400
Marquis, that can't be true.

315
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you mean the princess needed to die by Lord Bo's blade to prove her innocence?

316
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
You–

317
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,300
Father, please allow Zhaixing to return to her room.

318
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,100
Let the imperial physician check her health.

319
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,400
She has suffered multiple injuries throughout the journey.

320
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,000
She is exhausted.

321
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,700
Allow me to join the planning of retaliation.

322
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,900
Princess, please return to your room.

323
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,200
King of Jin.

324
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,700
But...

325
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,800
I want all of those who badmouthed the princess brought to me now!

326
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,600
- Ma Jing.
- Young Feudal Mistress!

327
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,400
Young Feudal Mistress!

328
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:19,000
While you're away, I couldn't sleep or eat not knowing if you were safe.

329
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,100
How was it? How are you doing?

330
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,400
I am fine. Don't worry.

331
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,200
We'll save this for later.

332
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Tell me.

333
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,100
What do the people think about my abduction?

334
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
It's just some gossip.

335
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,600
You need not pay attention to them.

336
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
What do they say?

337
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
They said...

338
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,200
They said something about your past relationship with Lord Bo.

339
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,400
It was awful.

340
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,600
Prince, please don't blame the soldiers for their concern.

341
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,800
Lord Bo saved the princess from imminent death.

342
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,000
They witnessed the whole thing.

343
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,300
It's wavered their trust for the princess.

344
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,200
During the battle, thousands of lives were at stake.

345
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
The princess was the general of the three armies.

346
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,100
People trusted her with their lives.

347
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,200
In the next battle, the soldiers would be worried that...

348
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,400
Marquis, do you think

349
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,400
Zhaixing was as baffling as Lord Bo,

350
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,000
that she would risk raising suspicion on the battlefield?

351
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,600
Lord Bo...

352
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,500
might still love the princess.

353
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,400
He didn't kill her on sight. He took her away.

354
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Nonsense!

355
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,600
The princess fought fiercely at Boxiang.

356
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,500
She was almost killed by the enemy.

357
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,200
And this is what you think of her?

358
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,400
Father, do you see it that way?

359
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,000
I trust the princess,

360
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,800
but if she is leading the army,

361
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,000
she can't afford to raise any doubt.

362
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,600
Fine.

363
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,400
I get it.

364
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
A wedding!

365
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Will it be able to end all the rumors circling around?

366
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,000
You suspect Ma Zhaixing still loves Lord Bo.

367
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,400
You fear it could waver morale.

368
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,300
Let me prove you all wrong with a marriage.

369
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,400
I am going to marry Ma Zhaixing!

370
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,700
Those people have tongues but no brains in them.

371
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,000
Don't be bothered by the rumors.

372
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
It's human behavior.

373
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
I don't blame them.

374
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I was taken by Lord Bo

375
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,800
and returned unscathed days after.

376
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,000
If it were you,

377
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,800
wouldn't you suspect something?

378
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,600
Young Feudal Mistress, what exactly happened?

379
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,200
I don't understand.

380
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,000
Before the battle of Boxiang,

381
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,100
I know very well what was on his mind.

382
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,000
It was either him or me.

383
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,800
But after the battle of Boxiang,

384
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,400
his actions and behaviors confused me.

385
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,600
He should have killed me,

386
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,300
but he never stopped protecting me.

387
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,100
We faced danger throughout the journey.

388
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,500
I was badly hurt and weak.

389
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,400
I would have died for sure had he not helped.

390
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,200
The cold-hearted Lord Bo was gone.

391
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
He was Wolf Boy.

392
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,000
I thought he had changed,

393
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,200
but it seemed like I was wrong.

394
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
You shouldn't try to understand me.

395
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,000
You shouldn't try to read my mind.

396
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,900
I've already become a monster you won't recognize.

397
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,800
You need to stay away from me.

398
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,800
You need to fear me.

399
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I can't see his reasons.

400
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,000
There is no reason.

401
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Lord Bo is an enemy of the Ma family.

402
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
But when I think about it,

403
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,300
even when he abducted me and had ill intentions,

404
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,000
it's undeniable that he saved my life.

405
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
He didn't let me go unconscious and die on the battlefield after falling from my horse.

406
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,900
Right?

407
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,600
That was the case.

408
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,400
But that doesn't change the fact he is the reason people doubt you.

409
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,200
Princess!

410
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,300
This is driving me insane!

411
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,600
They are ridiculous!

412
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
The prince...

413
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
What happened?

414
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,600
A wedding.

415
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,800
I don't even know if that person would agree.

416
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,200
When did you come here?

417
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,300
When you've sighed for the 371st time.

418
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,200
is this the orange sent as tribute from the South?

419
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,600
Why is the orange so small?

420
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,800
There was a drought this year.

421
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,500
The crop was poor,

422
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,600
so the fruits aren't as big.

423
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,600
It's not as sweet, either.

424
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,700
No.

425
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,700
I think it's good.

426
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,600
The orange is here, so we must accept it.

427
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,200
Many things go against our will.

428
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,400
But those are within our reach.

429
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,500
Why not be content with it?

430
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:28,800
Maybe you have an option better than the orange.

431
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,300
No.

432
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,000
At this moment, this is the best option.

433
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,600
Just now,

434
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,000
I was told of the people's concern for my abduction.

435
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I blame myself for this.

436
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,500
I told myself I mustn't let them down again.

437
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,800
And there are the soldiers of the frontline.

438
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,100
I can't afford to let them doubt my allegiance.

439
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,000
I am the princess.

440
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
I must live for them.

441
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,200
Thank you.

442
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,800
You have helped me so many times.

443
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,400
Thank you for everything you did today.

444
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,300
Thank you for sacrificing your marriage

445
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,000
to preserve my reputation and fulfill my wish.

446
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,800
What I hate the most

447
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,300
is to hear the word "thank you" coming from you.

448
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,300
At a time like this,

449
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,500
why are you still so courteous?

450
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,600
We'll start preparing today, hold the wedding tomorrow.

451
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,400
Are you okay with that?

452
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,300
Sure.

453
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,300
Thank you for being willing to marry Juyao to maintain the soldiers' faith.

454
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,700
King. Prince. Formality is not needed.

455
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,200
But...

456
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,700
Prince, this is rude.

457
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,500
How is this rude?

458
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,300
What's rude is to ruin a person's reputation with no proof.

459
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,400
If it wasn't for them,

460
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,600
Zhaixing wouldn't have faced these gossips.

461
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,000
She wouldn't have to marry me to appease them.

462
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,600
Ji Chong.

463
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,400
I understand my son's concern.

464
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,600
He thinks this isn't fair for you.

465
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,800
I'm not sure what should be done.

466
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,600
I understand.

467
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,400
I don't blame anyone.

468
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,100
What's done is done.

469
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,900
We must resolve the issue.

470
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,500
But I hope both you and the prince will stop thanking me.

471
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,200
Your Highness, aren't these dolls adorable?

472
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,700
They are so cute. Just like you and the prince. Right?

473
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,800
They look good.

474
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Folks from Taiyuan heard the princess and prince were getting married.

475
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
They are all celebrating.

476
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,000
I know!

477
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,700
The princess' wedding is great news for the common folks!

478
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:37,500
Thank you, Heaven and Earth, for letting us meet and fall in love with each other.

479
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,600
Pin it on my hair.

480
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,600
But the color and the pattern don't match well.

481
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,400
It's custom.

482
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,800
But, Your Highness, it doesn't look good.

483
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,700
Just pin it. It looks nice.

484
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,300
Nonsense, it's hideous. See for yourself.

485
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,900
Of course, it looks good. It's nice.

486
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,200
All right! Do as the Princess said.

487
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,500
It's not like she never had a wedding in the Bo Royal Manor–

488
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,200
- What?
- A wedding?

489
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
She was married?

490
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,000
None of you have ever got married before, right?

491
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,200
Just do as I say.

492
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,000
Doesn't it look nice?

493
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,300
Your Highness, we'll leave you be.

494
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,300
You brat. Don't be so clumsy!

495
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,000
I am fine.

496
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,700
Seriously?

497
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,600
Ke Lang!

498
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,800
Where is the prince?

499
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,100
I don't know.

500
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,000
Is it urgent?

501
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I misspoke.

502
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,800
I made Her Highness upset.

503
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
I know the prince likes cheering her up.

504
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
Where is he now?

505
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
Don't bother him now.

506
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,200
He is quite busy right now.

507
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,000
He's got his hands full with work.

508
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,800
But you just told me you didn't know where he was.

509
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,700
And then you said he was really busy.

510
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,900
I...

511
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,000
He has always been busy.

512
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,400
He has tons of work to do. Right?

513
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,000
What is this?

514
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,400
Nothing! Nothing? Let me see it!

515
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,500
Let me take a look! All right. It's nothing!

516
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,000
Collection of 100 Flowers?

♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

519
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:31,800
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

520
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:41,000
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

521
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,300
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

522
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:53,600
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

523
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:00,600
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

524
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:08,000
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

525
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,600
♫ Forever being together ♫

526

♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

527
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:22,400
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

528
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,400
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

529
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:36,600
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫
