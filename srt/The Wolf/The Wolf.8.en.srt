[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,650
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,700
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,900
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,080
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,280
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,810
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:40,020
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,560
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,110
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,390
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,220
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,210
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,790
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,060

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,780
Its because this subject saw Second Princess Consort,

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,720
so I was surprised and too emotional.

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,940
Its because the Second Prince

23
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,200
is the benefactor I was searching for.

24
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,520
What a coincidence.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,290
Yes.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,800
Many years ago, His Highness came to Bozhou and dispersed grains for famine relief

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,210
and saved my uncle's life. It was like giving him a new chance at life.

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,900
I was thinking, maybe one day

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,850
I could personally thank His Highness.

30
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,700
I know how to make Bozhou dishes. If the Second Prince likes that,

31
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:21,190
then I can make it for him as repayment of gratitude.

32
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,270
Then that is the best of both worlds.

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,210
That way Uncle Guang can repay his debt of gratitude and Second Prince can eat something delicious.

34
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,340
I will tell Second and Third Prince now to stay for dinner.

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,720
Uncle Guang can cook as Younger Sister Zhaixing and I help.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,630
Younger Sister, what do you think?

37
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,150
You are so kindhearted, Older Sister. Naturally, I will listen to you.

38
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,510
Thank you, Princess Consort. Thank you, Commandery Princess Ma.

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,740
You and Second Prince are both good people.

40
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,230
Your descendants

41
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,520
will surely be able to

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,210
prosper for many lifetimes.

43
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,110
Thank you for your kind words, Uncle Guang.

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,700
I will go tell Xi right now.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,140
Okay. Then I shall take Uncle Guang to the kitchen to cook.

46
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,350
Even until now, you can't even find this person.

47
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,040
A bunch of good-for-nothings! A bunch of good-for-nothings!

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,100
Lord, just now, I found out from some common children

49
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,890
that they have seen the person in the painting before.

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,390
- Where is the person?
- They said that someone from the Bo Royal Manor took him back there.

51
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,330
Bo Royal Manor?

52
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,460
Order the soldiers to come with me to the Bo Royal Manor to capture that person!

53
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,180
Yes, Prime Minister.

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,440
Greetings, Your Highness.

55
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,210
Didn't I say to call me Second Brother?

56
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,760
Yes, Second Brother.

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,210
All right, all right. Hurry and sit.

58
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,420
How is it, my younger sister-in-law? You have just come but have you become accustomed to the manor yet?

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,350
I've become very accustomed to it.

60
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,150
He was originally worried since Third Younger Brother doesn't like to get close to others.

61
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,130
However, you have a bright personality.

62
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,570
It seems that Third Younger Brother is making an exception.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,370
My cold Third Younger Brother didn't give you any frostbite, right?

64
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,720
No. Prince of Bo has taken very good care of me.

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,780
Even the gifts I gave him

66
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,480
are extremely treasured by him.

67
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,880
My future husband, why don't you quickly tell Second Prince and his consort

68
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,170
how much you like the gifts I gave you?

69
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,870
My fondness for the gift is unimaginable.

70
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,090
It looks like you two have made progress.

71
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,830
How come it seems like there are hidden meanings to your words?

72
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,810
Perhaps His Highness is embarrassed to reveal anything.

73
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,800
Second Prince... Second Brother, could you tell me

74
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,870
what Prince of Bo likes so that I can do what he likes?

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,070
Ever since he entered the palace until now, his unchanging like, besides martial arts,

76
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,310
there is one thing that Big Brother taught him before.

77
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,630
Even until now, he has not changed.

78
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,420
What is it?

79
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,910
The famous paintings and calligraphies on the wall are his likes.

80
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,090
Prince of Bo especially likes the calligraphy from the previous dynasty.

81
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,280
So, the Prince of Bo likes the famous calligraphy from the previous dynasty.

82
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,050
Yes.

83
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,750
Guess what he likes to do when

84
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,710
he has nothing to do.

85
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,510
Could it happen to be practicing calligraphy?

86
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,160
You guessed it on the first try.

87
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,600
When I first guessed, I guessed archery.

88
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,060
Ever since Eldest Brother told him that practicing calligraphy is training the mind to be at peace,

89
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,560
it is the best way to release one's emotions without others noticing;

90
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,950
from then on, he fell in love with calligraphy.

91
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,410
I just so happened to have gifted him an inkstone!

92
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,300
Your feelings are really connected. That means you will live a long and happy life.

93
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,870
Then can I take a look at the inkstone you gave?

94
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,960
- No!
- No!

95
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,690
Older Sister Jing, I was out of line. Are you all right?

96
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,740
I'm fine.

97
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,680
Why not?

98
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,960
If you have any troubles, tell me. I will stand up for you.

99
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,600
Naturally, no.

100
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,750
That... Uncle Guang's Bozhou dishes should be done now.

101
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,610
It's best to have dinner while it's hot.

102
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,900
Prince of Bo, isn't that right?

103
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,950
If you are not against it, could we have dinner in the garden?

104
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,030
All right.

105
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,980
Wen Yan, go give the order.

106
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,910
Check the dishes that the person made. Nothing can go wrong.

107
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,530
Yes. I understand.

108
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,110
Third Younger Brother, aren't you overthinking?

109
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,740
Could it be that someone would poison me at your manor?

110
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,650
Second Older Brother, please.

111
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,830
Everything has been checked.

112
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,290
There's nothing wrong with the dishes.

113
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,040
Good. Then I shall try this droplet soup first.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,230
When it comes to droplet soups, besides my mother,

115
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,990
I really haven't had any that are to my liking.

116
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,740
How is it? Is it the taste that you miss?

117
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,310
This soup you made tastes exactly the same as my mother's.

118
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,970
In the palace, no one can create this flavor.

119
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,110
This is my first time drinking it.

120
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,010
Perhaps it is because Her Highness and I are both from Bozhou.

121
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,270
If you like it, then I'm happy, Your Highness.

122
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,210
Great! A great Bozhou person.

123
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,680
I should just invite you to my manor to be a cook.

124
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,090
That way I can drink this soup every day.

125
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,800
Thank you for your appreciation, Your Highness.

126
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,040
What a shame. I must rush back to Bozhou tomorrow.

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,840
I cannot stay in the capital for long.

128
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,430
However, I could teach

129
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,160
the servant at your manor how to make the soup.

130
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,400
The secret is the time and fire used to make the soup.

131
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,210
Also, you must use an old hen.

132
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay. I've received your teachings.

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,990
No wonder the cook at my manor has never made it well.

134
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,570
Prince of Bo!

135
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,290
Prince of Bo, the prime minister is here saying that a fugitive is here at the manor.

136
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,440
Someone! Capture him.

137
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,240
- Take him!
- Father?

138
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,750
What's going on?

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:56,380
Your Highness, this person is a wanted criminal.

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,610
He must have an ulterior motive for entering the manor and getting close to you.

141
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,110
He may possibly even be an assassin!

142
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,030
Prime Mister!

143
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:08,260
Your Highness, you have just come to the capital. You should know your place.

144
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,240
Don't obstruct me.

145
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,570
Once I have investigated and found the truth, then we can discuss it.

146
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,240
- Take him away immediately!
- Yes!

147
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,920
Father-in-Law, what exactly is happening?

148
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,370
That Lin Guang is so fragile. How does he look like an assassin?

149
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,000
That person claims to be your biological father.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,150
If it is according to what he says,

151
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,580
then you are not a prince

152
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,060
but the son of a fugitive.

153
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,400
There really is such a thing?

154
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,680
Yes.

155
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,370
When I was investigating the slaves,

156
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,790
I unexpectedly discovered that the prime minister was secretly investigating a fugitive by the name of Lin Guang.

157
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,100
Just when I was about to monitor the prime minister,

158
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,200
he brought a great number of soldiers to the Bo Royal Manor to capture the person.

159
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,880
We must not let Jing Xiang settle this matter in private

160
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,740
as it concerns the bloodline of the imperial family. I've to report to His Majesty right away.

161
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,990
This man must remain alive.

162
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,700
You are all dismissed.

163
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,290
Yes. Let's go.

164
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,040
Lin Guang.

165
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,590
You don't need to know what's written on it.

166
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:07,120
All you have to do is to sign it.

167
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,970
[Acknowledged by Lin Guang]

168
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,210
[Bo Royal Manor]

169
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,630
I've warned you before.

170
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,460
You should not take in any unidentified person.

171
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,590
Now that this person has attempted to assassinate Second Prince,

172
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,050
if His Majesty were to ask why you allowed an intruder in,

173
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,170
how are you going to explain it?

174
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,190
But when I first saw that man,

175
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,030
he was trying to protect a child from being bullied.

176
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,470
Even as a fugitive, he has a compassionate heart and wasn't afraid of trouble.

177
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,070
How could he be an assassin?

178
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,720
People are sinister. Commandery Princess Ma, it looks like you haven't realized

179
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,470
that this is the capital, not your small land of Kuizhou.

180
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,670
Every step you take here

181
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,520
may possibly be laid with hidden danger

182
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,900
that may cost you your life.

183
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,140
Are you awake and conscious now?

184
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,690
Or are you still unable to accept

185
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,790
the feeling of being betrayed by those you trusted?

186
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,630
But I believe...

187
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,990
that not all betrayals are intended to cause harm. Sometimes,

188
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,570
it may appear to be a betrayal of others,

189
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,250
when it's in fact a betrayal of self.

190
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,060
Reporting to Master.

191
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,420
His Majesty has sent an urgent command for Master and Feudal Young Mistress Ma to enter the palace to present yourselves in front of His Majesty at once.

192
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,980
It seems that the matter regarding Bo Royal Manor harboring a fugitive has caused His Majesty to fly into a great rage.

193
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,490
Prime Minister, the major said that when he followed orders to rush to your manor,

194
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,150
that assassin, dreading punishment, had already committed suicide by hanging himself.

195
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,820
Yes.

196
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,320
When I went to stop him, there was already nothing I could do.

197
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,010
Your Majesty, Prime Minister keeps saying that that fugitive was an assassin.

198
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,000
Without any evidence, how did he come to this conclusion?

199
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,370
Your Majesty, I found out through the oral confession of that slave.

200
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,700
I found out that he harbored hatred for Second Prince for being strict and unjust.

201
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,040
I immediately rushed there to capture him.

202
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,060
In addition, I searched his boots and found a dagger!

203
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,750
And this criminal, prior to committing suicide,

204
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,290
signed a confession and pleaded guilty!

205
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:57,410
Was it really like this? A measly fugitive slave

206
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,020
actually had the audacity to have the intention to risk his life to assassinate an imperial prince?

207
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,740
Your Majesty, it was exactly like that!

208
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,390
Even if you tore my body limb from limb with five horses,
 (T/N: Ancient Chinese capital punishment whereby a criminal was tied to five horses that went in different directions)

209
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,260
I would still not dare to deceive Your Majesty!

210
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,480
Reporting to Emperor Father, a few years ago,

211
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,510
I followed orders to investigate the matter of the army collectively hoarding food.

212
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,370
I did in fact give a few soldiers involved the penalty of being a slave forever.

213
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,720
Now, the assailant who attempted to assassinate me,

214
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,330
was in fact the person who was demoted to be a slave back then. The military department has the case files for reference.

215
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,490
It appears that this fugitive slave really did have the intention to assault.

216
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,060
When the major reported this matter to me, I also thought it was strange.

217
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,520
Now, the truth has finally been revealed.

218
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,120
It is fine as long as Second Prince is safe and sound. After all, you are my son.

219
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,400
From today onwards, your manor's guards need to be more strictly vigilant

220
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,040
in case of any contingencies.

221
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,410
Thank you, Emperor Father, for your concern!

222
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:03,320
- Major Yang.
- Your subject is present.

223
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,330
Behind this case was Prime Minister,

224
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:10,990
who was worried for my son, his good son-in-law.

225
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,650
Now that this case has been solved, settling the Imperial Court back down

226
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,190
is of the utmost priority. This matter must not be discussed again.

227
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,710
Yes.

228
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:27,590
Prince of Bo. Feudal Young Mistress. You had no knowledge of this person's identity and Bo Royal Manor had poor vigilance,

229
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,790
almost harming the prince's life.

230
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,010
Do you admit to your crimes?

231
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,710
Emperor Father, I failed to investigate. I ask Emperor Father to give me a punishment.

232
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,070
Your Majesty, this matter has nothing to do with Prince of Bo!

233
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,100
His Highness forbade me many times to take in someone of unknown origin.

234
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,910
I obstinately went my own way, causing this huge blunder!

235
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,080
I beseech Your Majesty to only grant a punishment to me alone!

236
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:59,880
This matter came from the Bo Royal Manor. Of course, Prince of Bo can hardly absolve himself of the blame.

237
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,060
Prince of Bo, I penalize you to repent for three months

238
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,410
and a fine of a year's salary.

239
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,600
- I accept your royal decree.
- Ma Zhaixing, hear my imperial decree.

240
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:17,240
You were hoodwinked by a person, ignorant and impervious to reason, resulting in a huge blunder!

241
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:23,810
I penalize you to kneel and repent in the Imperial Ancestral Temple for three days and three nights.

242
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,550
I accept your royal decree.

243
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,750
[Imperial Ancestral Temple]

244
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,470
What? Are you worried about Ma Zhaixing?

245
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:06,400
No, it is just that Ma Zhaixing still has some use.

246
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,920
I am afraid she cannot endure this, ruining our great plan.

247
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:15,360
Do not worry, I will not let her die.

248
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,430
Prince of Bo, your princess consort has ambitions.

249
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,620
You need to break her spirit,

250
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,810
make her be more obedient. Do not let her cause more trouble for me.

251
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,720
I understand.

252
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,540
Also, I want you, in this very moment, to use your identity as the head of the Night Fiends

253
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,470
to respond to me.

254
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,150
Does this case have any points of suspicion?

255
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,920
A huge place like Prime Minister's Manor

256
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,110
could not even keep watch over a felon.

257
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,730
They just let him commit suicide so easily.

258
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:02,720
Replying to Your Majesty.

259
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,860
When Lin Guang was entering the manor, Mo Xiao had already searched his body.

260
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,390
There was no sign of the dagger that Jing Xiang submitted.

261
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,090
Also, Bo Royal Manor is heavily fortified. There was no way he could have stolen a dagger from the manor.

262
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,820
There really is a cause for suspicion.

263
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,000
Then continue to thoroughly investigate.

264
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,540
Within three days, I want the truth.

265
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,930
Yes. I will obey your royal decree.

266
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,990
Feudal Young Mistress!

267
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,330
Stop! Who are you?

268
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:06,500
Military Master, I am Princess Consort of Bo's attendant, Ma Jing.

269
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,010
I wanted to send some clothes over for her.

270
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,240
His Majesty has dispatched the order that no one is allowed to go near her!

271
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,610
Get back!

272
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,410
Feudal Young Mistress!

273
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,840
Are you all right, Feudal Young Mistress?

274
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,880
Ma Jing.

275
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,910
Feudal Young Mistress, if your legs continue to kneel for three more days, I fear...

276
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,480
Do not worry! I will go look for a solution now!

277
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,860
You are forbidden from telling Brother Fengcheng!

278
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,910
You cannot, because of this matter,

279
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,670
ruin the relationship between the Ma Family Army and the Imperial Court,

280
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,730
implicating the Prince of Bo!

281
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,520
Feudal Young Mistress!

282
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,750
Ma Jing, this is an order! You must not resist it!

283
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,910
Why do you take the Ma Family Army into consideration in everything you do?

284
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:01,300
If you currently continue to kneel for another three days, your legs will break!

285
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,900
Somebody! Somebody! Is there anyone who can save my Feudal Young Mistress?

286
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,080
Her legs are not good!

287
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,030
Hurry up and go get someone to save her!

288
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,530
Hurry up and go! Somebody!

289
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,570
- Imperial Army Officers!
- Feudal Young Mistress!

290
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,810
If you dare to let her continue causing a ruckus, disturbing my repentance,

291
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,820
I will definitely report to His Majesty later that you neglected your duty!

292
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,300
- Feudal Young Mistress!
- Did you hear that? If you continue causing a ruckus, I will arrest you!

293
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,650
Get back immediately!

294
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,630
Feudal Young Mistress!

295
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,040
- Get back!
- Feudal Young Mistress!

296
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,610
Get back!

297
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,030
Get back!

298
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,020
Lin Guang's case seems suspicious.

299
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,220
Hia Die. Mo Xiao. Keep an eye on Prime Minister's Manor.

300
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,760
Report to me if anything happens.

301
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,390
- Yes.
- Yes.

302
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,640
Wen Yan, make a trip to the Major's manor.

303
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,180
Similarly, report to me if anything happens.

304
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,160
Yes, Master.

305
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,110
Lin Guang's corpse?

306
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,480
- They're disposing of the corpse to eliminate evidence.
- That's strange.

307
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,290
Let's follow them.

308
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,590
Hurry.

309
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,100
Hurry up! Hurry.

310
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,020
Faster. Hurry.

311
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,930
You know too much.

312
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,440
Don't blame me.

313
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:47,300
When Lin Guang was arrested, he did not resist at all.

314
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,870
Rather, he appeared to have no regrets.

315
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,220
It looks like the assassin really wasn't him.

316
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,190
If not, he would put up a fight instead of just surrendering.

317
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,930
Could it be that what Ma Zhaixing said is true?

318
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,830
Your Highness, Prince of Bo!

319
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,390
Your Highness, Prince of Bo!

320
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,690
Your Highness, Prince of Bo. Please come quickly to save our Feudal Young Mistress.

321
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,460
Every country has its laws. How do you expect me to save her?

322
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,300
But our Feudal Young Mistress cannot kneel for too long.

323
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,930
Your Highness, Prince of Bo, you probably don't know this. Back then, to save someone, Feudal Young Mistress

324
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,950
had her leg broken by Young Master Ma with a spear.

325
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,660
That was because she wanted to save someone known as Wolf Boy.

326
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,680
What did you say? Who did Ma Zhaixing want to save?

327
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,670
Feudal Young Mistress once had a good friend called Wolf Boy.

328
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,070
He was falsely accused of killing Xiahou Yi

329
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,500
and was being chased and hunted by the officers. In order to protect him, Feudal Young Mistress

330
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,900
pretended to betray him and said a lot of hurtful words to him.

331
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,180
But Feudal Young Mistress did that to force him to leave. That was all done to save his life.

332
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,250
Do you know that back then, in all of Kuizhou City, she was the only one who believed

333
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,290
that Wolf Boy wasn't a monster who would harm others.

334
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:21,090
Your life is in danger at all times. Is your life unimportant at all?

335
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,900
Leave!

336
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,680
Since it's dangerous here, just leave Kuizhou City!

337
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,300
Leave Langshou Mountain and go as far as you can!

338
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,730
Feudal Young Mistress intended to force Wolf Boy to leave Langshou Mountain.

339
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:39,400
But who would have known our Young Master would steal her copper bell

340
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,310
and use it to lure Wolf Boy to kill him.

341
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:45,390
Your Xing'er will never ever be coming back

342
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,270
because she gave me this copper bell.

343
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,440
The copper bell.

344
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,780
- It was stolen by your young master?
- Yes.

345
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,180
Prince of Bo, did you know this? At that time, when Wolf Boy was falling off the cliff,

346
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,700
Feudal Young Mistress really wanted to save him.

347
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,460
Wolf Boy!

348
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Stop it!

349
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,220
Stop it! Stop it! Please stop!

350
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,450
Feudal Young Mistress risked her life and tried to stop them from hurting Wolf Boy.

351
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,200
But Young Master Ma broke her leg.

352
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,260
She was badly wounded and was unconscious for several days.

353
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,360
Later, Wolf Boy disappeared.

354
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,720
From then on, Feudal Young Mistress' leg was injured

355
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,670
and never did recover to date.

356
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,470
Your Highness, Prince of Bo. I'm begging you

357
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,400
to go and save Feudal Young Mistress.

358
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,680
In this heavy rain, her leg will start to hurt again.

359
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,770
The physician said that if she injures her leg again,

360
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,220
she may never be able to stand up again.

361
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,860
Your Highness, Prince of Bo, I beg you

362
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,120
to please go and save Feudal Young Mistress.

363
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,600
But I believe that not all betrayals are intended to cause harm.

364
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,280
Sometimes, it may appear to be a betrayal of others, when it's in fact a betrayal of self.

365
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,250
Prepare my horse!

366
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,370
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

367
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:30,630
♫ Waiting for a star to fall
to see who its afterglow will illuminate  ♫

368
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:33,740
♫ Of the same kind as the banished  ♫

369
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,910
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense ♫

370
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:42,120
♫ But gentleness is always invincible  ♫

371
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,960
I am already used to viewing from high above
in the mountain alone♫

372
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,370
♫ Don't need any vast fame and power ♫

373
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:50,160
♫ During the day, sunlight lights up the road I walk on,
at night, my vision illuminates it ♫

374
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,420
♫ Except for the numbing solitary that makes me lose miserably♫

375
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,590
♫ I have yet to encounter any challenge that I find difficult ♫

376
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,110
♫ Even going against the tides, my vision is still steady,
manners is still fierce♫

377
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,460
♫ I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling ♫

378
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,160
Give it back to me. Give it back to me!

379
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,560
♫ Climbing mountains and cliffs ♫

380
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,330
I've clearly seen the genuine you.

381
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,030
♫ With no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder ♫

382
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,350
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

383
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,590
Here. A meat bun for you.

384
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,130
Don't move. Wolf Boy, you're so obedient.

385
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:23,620
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

386
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,950
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

387
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,640
I've also seen you, the one who trusts me.

388
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,020
I trust you and you trust me.

389
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,890
We trust each other. Do you understand?

390
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,480
No matter how I've changed,

391
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,460
you could still recognize me.

392
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,100
♫ I’m wasting my time aimlessly, with no one to urge me on ♫

393
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,980
Even if you're ugly, you still look ugly like him.

394
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,890
I want to see Wolf Boy now.

395
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,790
♫ Bringing me brightness, and letting me find
my way in the endless darkness ♫

396
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:07,510
You are in fact Wolf Boy.

397
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,520
Am I right?

398
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,160
Yet I've blindly misjudged you.

399
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,560
I've misjudged everything.

400
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,990
Xing'er, wait for me.

401
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:22,960
♫ You took away what I care about and all my attention ♫

402
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,080
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

403
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,360
Your Highness, Prince of Bo, please forgive me for not allowing you to pass as it's my duty.

404
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,480
Move aside! Zhaixing is my princess consort. Her leg has an old injury so she cannot kneel.

405
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,980
- If anything happens, I'll bear all the consequences!
- We're bound by imperial order. We can't let you pass.

406
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,340
Please forgive us, Your Highness, Prince of Bo.

407
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,740
Xing'er.

408
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,720
Wolf Boy is here.

409
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,720
Let's go home.

410
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,920
No one should act rashly! Hurry. Report to His Majesty!

411
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,190
Your Highness, thank you for your help.

412
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,790
Thank you for going against the imperial order to save Feudal Young Mistress and bringing her back.

413
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,310
Master, you may come in now.

414
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:27,800
Xing'er, get well soon.

415
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,760
Don't let me regret my mistake for the rest of my life.

416
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,890
Please give me a chance to make it up to you.

417
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,490
Reporting to Your Majesty.

418
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,100
Did something happen so early in the morning?

419
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,550
When Your Majesty was asleep last night, His Highness, Prince of Bo defied your imperial order.

420
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,500
In front of all the imperial guards,

421
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,340
he forcefully took Commandery Princess Ma back to his royal manor.

422
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:04,960
Tell him to come and see me.

423
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,600
Yes.

424
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:16,890
It's all right now.

425
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,360
No muscles or bones were injured. She should be fine after resting for a few days.

426
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,570
Ma Jing.

427
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,850
Here.

428
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:27,740
Take good care of your Feudal Young Mistress.

429
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,020
I'll investigate clearly about this case.

430
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,630
Yes, I understand.

431
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,600
Last night, was there any movement in the major's manor?

432
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,640
I investigated all night but found nothing out of the ordinary.

433
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,250
Master,

434
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,110
we finished investigating. There is more than meets the eye with Lin Guang.

435
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,050
Turns out, Lin Guang claimed to be the birth father of Second Prince. That's why there were people trying to kill him.

436
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:11,640
Second Prince and Prime Minister were afraid, and so they silenced him.

437
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,980
He claimed to be Second Brother's birth father?

438
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,900
Correct. Master, we investigated all night and discovered some files about the army and court slaves.

439
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,570
We discovered that 20 years ago, Lin Guang was a cook in the Bozhou Province Army.

440
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:24,730
And at this time, Second Prince's mother was also in the Bozhuo Army.

441
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,980
But Second Prince was birthed 10 months after she attended His Majesty.

442
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,000
If there is something strange, like Second Prince was born prematurely,

443
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,500
then that's why Lin Guang would make such assumptions.

444
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:43,680
This is Second Prince's birth date, indeed he was born prematurely.

445
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:54,400
Reporting, Your Highness, Prince of Bo. Eunuch Zhang came and said His Majesty wants to see you.

446
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,830
I should go and see His Majesty.

447
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,680
Prince of Bo, why did you

448
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,460
disobey my order and take away Ma Zhaixing?

449
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,910
I heard from someone that

450
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,810
Commandery Princess Ma's legs had an old injury.

451
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,710
If she kneels for a long time, her old injury would reoccur.

452
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,870
She would be crippled for life.

453
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,600
This would definitely not be something that the Ma Family Army would like to see.

454
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,030
It would be very hard for Emperor Father to exploit them to work for us then.

455
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:32,860
Why didn't you report it earlier?

456
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,340
It was at night. Your Majesty was asleep.

457
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,540
When I was investigating, she had passed out.

458
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,710
In the moment of desperation, saving a life was more important.

459
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,800
Today, I came here to ask for forgiveness.

460
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,820
Stand up.

461
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,650
I didn't know Ma Zhaixing had an old injury.

462
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,320
I almost ruined the chess piece that can control the Ma Family Army.

463
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,430
It's you who protected it in time.

464
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,610
Then, in the future, Ma Zhaixing

465
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,960
will listen to you more.

466
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,260
Then, this chess piece...

467
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,870
would be much easier to control.

468
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

469
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,480
I have something else to report.

470
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,100
I investigated Lin Guang's case.

471
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,160
There is indeed something suspicious.

472
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:32,090
Say it.

473
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,350
Your Majesty.

474
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,990
He was staying by his birth mother's side.

475
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,630
It's exactly the place I stayed in Bozhou Province.

476
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,860
You are saying that the Second Prince bloodline is impure?

477
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:07,060
And that Jing Xiang was afraid of the consequences,

478
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,560
so that caused him to kill and silence him. Am I right?

479
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,970
I wouldn't dare.

480
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,800
I think this is just Lin Guang's assumptions.

481
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,040
Second Brother's bloodline is without any doubt.

482
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,750
Your Majesty,

483
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,690
His Second Highness and the prime minister are in the imperial study requesting attendance.

484
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,540
You may leave now.

485
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,030
Yes.

486
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,180
- Greeting, Your Highness.
- Emperor Father.

487
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,980
You came.

488
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,610
Good, I also needed to talk to you about something.

489
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,540
Please explain.

490
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:02,110
Do you have anything to report?

491
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:06,590
Emperor Father, I wanted to ask for leniency for Ma Zhaixing.

492
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:10,020
Please forgive her mistakes.

493
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,010
Why?

494
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,560
Second Prince and I have a deep sense that Commandery Princess's ignorance can be forgiven.

495
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:18,420
Please forgive the wrongdoings.

496
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,880
Also... Also...

497
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,520
You don't need to be hesitant. Say it.

498
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,840
After Commandery Princess Ma committed the sin,

499
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,530
Third Brother's attitude was not to get involved.

500
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:31,570
It will be difficult because of Third Brother's status.

501
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,530
But, undoubtedly, his feelings were detached.

502
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:37,150
Maybe it can move the Ma Family Army's allegiance.

503
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,410
Ridiculous. Ignorant!

504
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,160
When I was sleeping at night,

505
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,240
Prince of Bo was worried that Ma Zhaixing's long kneeling would cause injury to her legs.

506
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,310
He already brought her into treatment.

507
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:58,610
He placed importance to the arranged marriage and took care of Ma Zhaixing.

508
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:01,340
There is nothing more to say on that.

509
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,540
But now that I see you two,

510
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,380
you came to ask for her leniency?

511
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,210
It's hypocritical.

512
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,520
Isn't it because of your own sins?

513
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,160
Please calm down, Your Majesty. I still don't know that was what had happened.

514
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,430
But I cannot bear Commandery Princess, she–

515
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,530
Absolute disgrace! Kneel down!

516
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,770
I thought you found your conscience

517
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,600
and wanted to carry your own sins.

518
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,260
I hadn't thought that you wanted to continue to withhold the truth from me.

519
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,370
Take a look. The thing I am holding onto,

520
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,320
it's Lin Guang's military secret file.

521
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,510
You might not know. That year, your mother

522
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,800
already told me.

523
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,560
Lin Guang and she were old friends.

524
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,910
Instead, I...

525
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,570
really appreciated her.

526
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,750
For her loyalty and honesty.

527
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,850
But you guys!

528
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,570
You were afraid of the assumptions of a slave.

529
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,220
But you dared to withhold the truth from me.

530
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,040
Emperor Father, I know I'm wrong.

531
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,730
Please calm down, Your Majesty. I deserve to die.

532
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,000
- It's all my fault, Emperor Father.
- Your Majesty, please have mercy.

533
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,510
Go, go, go.

534
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,560
The position of Prime Minister, I'll hand over to Major Yang for now.

535
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,030
As for any matters that Second Prince is taking care of right now,

536
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:46,620
will be handed over to Prince of Bo.

537

[Bo's Royal Manor]

538
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:55,260
Feudal Young Mistress, you're awake?

539
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,850
I...

540
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,590
Why am I here?

541
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,780
Did you forget?

542
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,530
You knelt for a long time last night and got soaked in the rain.

543
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,070
You've forgotten who selflessly broke into the Imperial Ancestral Temple like a warrior

544
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:15,450
to save you?

545
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,970
Who was it?

546
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,410
This person isn't anybody else. It is His Highness, Prince of Bo.

547
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,280
It's him?

548
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,320
You know what? In the future, I won't believe a word of gossip.

549
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,930
Feudal Young Mistress, hear me out. His Highness, Prince of Bo, heard you had an old injury and that you couldn't kneel for a long time.

550
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,330
He saw that it was raining so hard. He burst into Imperial Ancestral Temple without a care for himself.

551
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,380
He fought with many soldiers.

552
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:39,720
He rescued you by himself.

553
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,030
Why are you getting up?

554
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,390
If it's His Highness, Prince of Bo,

555
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,580
isn't he angry at me?

556
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,940
Doing this means that he disobeyed imperial orders.

557
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,600
- I need to go and find him.
- Feudal Young Mistress, you haven't recovered yet.

558
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,200
Feudal Young Mistress, are you awake?

559
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,180
Feudal Young Mistress, you cannot get out of bed for another four hours.

560
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:03,900
Prince of Bo is in the palace discussing matters with His Majesty.

561
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,920
He went to Imperial Ancestral Temple to save me. Will he be able to escape from harm?

562
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,310
If he wanted to escape from harm, it wouldn't be too hard for him.

563
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:13,600
The hard part is Feudal Young Mistress, how do you look at Lin Guang's case?
