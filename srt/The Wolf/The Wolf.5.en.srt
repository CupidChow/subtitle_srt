♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:19,010
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5

♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs)♫

00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:31,870
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder)♫

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,100
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,020
[Episode 5]

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,459
So you are the Young Mistress of the Ma family.

22
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,859
No wonder you abandoned me to the Ma Family Army back then.

23
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:44,420
Now, I'm Prince of Bo,

24
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:47,949
while you are someone from the Ma family.

25
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:10,800
Stand there. Who dares to trespass into Ma Mansion at this late hour?

26
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,759
Who is there?

27
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:25,560
I am the Young Feudal Master of Tongzhou.

28
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,970
I am friends with the Ma family's Young Mistress.

29
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,959
I heard about Ma Mansion's tragedy and came here.

30
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,820
The Feudal Young Mistress was burned to a crisp.

31
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,070
Her corpse is unrecognizable.

32
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,489
She is in one of these coffins.

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,200
The corpse is unrecognizable,

34
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,319
but how could Young Mistress's bronze bell be damaged by fire?

35
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,740
Has anyone here found Young Mistress's bronze bell?

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,619
I've searched Ma Mansion carefully according to the strategist's orders.

37
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,579
I didn't find any bronze bells.

38
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:15,579
In that case, I believe that the Young Mistress is still alive.

39
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,779
With Ma Mansion as the center,

40
00:03:17,779 --> 00:03:20,920
I will bring my men to search toward the South.

41
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,740
If it's as what you say,

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,280
we can definitely find Young Mistress with this clue.

43
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,820
Let's not waste time.

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,579
I will leave immediately and search toward the North.

45
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:33,440
If Young Mistress is found, you will be the one who has contributed the most.

46
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,939
I'm just worried about her safety.

47
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,120
Feudal Young Mistress Ma might wake up sometime soon.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,720
My Lord, you can question her later.

49
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,549
She is awake!

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,899
Feudal Young Mistress.

51
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,532
Young Mistress Ma.

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,213
She...

53
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,640
is not Ma Zhaixing.

54
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,070
She is just an empty shell.

55
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,219
Right now,

56
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,940
she is not Ma Zhaixing.

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,020
Princess Ma is probably suffering from Soul Separation Syndrome.

58
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,100
She experienced a huge mental trauma.

59
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,059
Her head was struck heavily as well.

60
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:05,779
Her mind and body couldn't take it.

61
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,960
It is like she lost her soul, totally severing any communications with the outside world.

62
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,940
If Young Mistress continues to skip her meals,

63
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,173
I'm afraid it will endanger her life.

64
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,549
Bring some water.

65
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,140
News from Ma Yehan!

66
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,800
The Feudal Lord and his family were annihilated by Jin!

67
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:45,039
Feudal Lord and his whole family are all dead?

68
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:49,572
They died in the hands of Jin's ruler!

69
00:05:49,572 --> 00:05:54,040
[Ma Jing, Ma Family Army]

70
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,679
Brother, we are just a few days away from Imperial City.

71
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:59,619
We can beg His Majesty to send the army to take down Jin!

72
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,700
An eye for an eye!

73
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,610
[Ma]

74
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Break camp immediately and head for Imperial City

75
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,760
to ask His Majesty to give the Ma Family Army justice!

76
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,680
Let's depart to punish the enemy!

77
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,240
An eye for an eye!

78
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,140
The reaction of the imperial court and the Ma Family Army

79
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,619
towards Ma Ying's death was just as I expected.

80
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,700
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

81
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,140
Everything is moving according to Your Majesty's plan.

82
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,140
The Ma Family Army has submitted a military plan.

83
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,520
They hope Your Majesty can attack the King of Jin.

84
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,399
They are willing to sacrifice themselves.

85
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,660
Using Ma Ying's death alone to exchange for priceless army morale,

86
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,599
it's worth it.

87
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,499
Yes, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:03,980
Regarding the Ma Family Army's return to the capital,

89
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,980
send Prime Minister Jing Xiang to welcome them.

90
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,560
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,960
Looks like the princess has no intention to survive anymore.

92
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,660
Even her body refuses to drink.

93
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,459
I'm afraid she will die soon.

94
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:46,609
The medicine has no effect.

95
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,540
If the medicine doesn't work, we will fight poison with poison.

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,019
That may work.

97
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,559
But a strong medicine like that...

98
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,419
I still need one more ingredient.

99
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,219
- What is it?
- Usnea herb.

100
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,140
Its medicinal effect is gentle but not weak.

101
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,139
It is able to neutralize her poison and protect her vital channels.

102
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,550
Without it, the princess might die here.

103
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,080
We need to hurry.

104
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,480
Where can we find the usnea herb?

105
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,279
There's a Xingyue (Star Moon) Mountain not far from here.

106
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,029
The terrain is rough. We might find it there.

107
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,180
Take care of the princess. I'm going to Xingyue Mountain.

108
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,300
My Lord, wait!

109
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,833
It's a bad idea to go to this mountain rashly.

110
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,359
Legend says that there is a huge tiger there that hurts people.

111
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,609
My Lord, are you sure you want to go?

112
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,560
It's been a while since I fought a tiger.

113
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,880
It's my first time fighting two at once though.

114
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,460
Carefully search the area and find any clues of the Feudal Young Mistress!

115
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,993
Yes!

116
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,759
Feudal Young Master, there's a temple ahead.

117
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:55,199
The horse outside looks like a warhorse of the army.

118
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:57,459
It's not the usual mount.

119
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,099
Be careful and scout it out.

120
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,432
Yes.

121
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,680
It's been a while since Master went to the mountains.

122
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,519
He should have been back by now.

123
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,970
Who are you? How dare you abduct the Ma family's Young Mistress?

124
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,930
[Command Token]

125
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:31,859
Looking at your outfit

126
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,620
and the seal of Tongzhou's Feudal Lord on you.

127
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,620
you must be a member of the Gu family of Tongzhou.

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,079
I am Gu Qingping, the Feudal Young Lord of Tongzhou.

129
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:46,979
Who are you?

130
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,320
The Dragon Command Seal is here.

131
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:56,160
We are His Majesty's envoys.

132
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,320
Your Honor is the royal envoy of His Majesty?

133
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,053
That's right.

134
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,699
- Leave.
- Yes.

135
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,120
Why would you be with the Feudal Young Mistress at this place?

136
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,780
His Majesty received a tip-off.

137
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,179
The Ma family might be attacked by the King of Jin.

138
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,220
That is why His Majesty sent us here.

139
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,499
Yet, we were still late.

140
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:27,940
Feudal Young Mistress Ma was rescued by us.

141
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:37,440
Thank you for your assistance in preserving Young Mistress Ma's life.

142
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
You knew her?

143
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm an old friend of hers.

144
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,120
We cherish each other.

145
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:53,580
Young Mistress Ma was struck on the head and is suffering from Soul Separation Syndrome.

146
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,859
Besides drinking medicine to cure it,

147
00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:00,899
if she has a close friend to talk to her, it might help to cure her.

148
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,199
Let's see if you can wake her up.

149
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:30,080
Let me accompany her alone for a while.

150
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,840
Her problem is my problem.

151
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,879
I will accompany her until she becomes lucid.

152
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,130
Feudal Young Mistress, I once told you that

153
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,739
I will bring you away from that sad place.

154
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,400
Bring you away from Kuizhou and go to a brand new place.

155
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,190
- My Lord.
- You are hurt.

156
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:18,392
Who is he?

157
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,779
The Young Mistress' old friend, the Feudal Young Lord of Tongzhou.

158
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,680
The Young Mistress hasn't eaten at all.

159
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,580
He said he is a trusted friend of hers.

160
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,640
So, he might succeed if he tries.

161
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,709
This is peppermint.

162
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:45,520
Indeed. It helps with refreshing the mind.

163
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,419
Give it to him.

164
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:50,952
Yes.

165
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:04,020
Here, Young Mistress.

166
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,470
You have to eat to regain energy.

167
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,510
She is eating!

168
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,893
Eat more.

169
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,313
Father...

170
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,920
Young Mistress, are you awake?

171
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,619
It's me. Do you still remember me?

172
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,859
Father...

173
00:16:55,859 --> 00:17:00,219
You want to return to Ma Mansion and see your father?

174
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,259
Young Mistress wants to return to Ma Mansion.

175
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,899
Let's send her back immediately.

176
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,520
Regarding this, we have to ask the envoy.

177
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,179
Your Honor.

178
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:22,119
What do you want?

179
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,460
The Feudal Young Mistress spoke just now.

180
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,139
She wants to return to Ma Mansion.

181
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:28,920
I think this will be beneficial to her illness.

182
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,420
That's impossible.

183
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,600
Please tell me the reason.

184
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,900
You don't have the right to know.

185
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,319
I'm her good friend. You saw it.

186
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:48,459
If not for me, how could she start eating?

187
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,033
Good. Keep feeding her.

188
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,720
You don't have to ask about anything else.

189
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,419
Your Honor, are you ordering me like a slave?

190
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:01,139
- So what?
- You...

191
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,359
My master is a special envoy appointed by His Majesty.

192
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,140
He has the Dragon Command Seal.

193
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,039
Whatever he says is His Majesty's command.

194
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,159
It's so strange.

195
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:23,299
When that Young Lord fed the princess water earlier,

196
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,380
she still wouldn't drink.

197
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:31,159
Don't tell me that the key to her finally eating

198
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,059
lies in Master's peppermint?

199
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,819
My Lord, how did you know that the Feudal Young Mistress likes peppermint?

200
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,119
I was just giving it a try.

201
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,239
I've got the usnea herb.

202
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,379
Make the medicine and feed it to her.

203
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:00,812
Yes.

204
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,479
What is the situation of the Ma Family Army?

205
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,879
According to my calculation,

206
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,279
they should be near Imperial City now.

207
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:16,600
The prime minister is here!

208
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:42,220
Even the prime minister is welcoming them in person.

209
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,019
Looks like His Majesty is really giving the Ma Family Army a great welcome.

210
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,579
The Ma Family Army's return looks to be proceeding normally.

211
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,499
General Ma,

212
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,419
it's been tough on your arduous journey.

213
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:06,379
I hope you can stay in Imperial City for a long time.

214
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:10,139
I will definitely treat you well.
[Prime Minister, Jing Xiang]

215
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:13,759
With my civil ability and your military prowess, we can assist each other

216
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,620
in serving His Majesty together.

217
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,059
Prime Minister, you are too polite.

218
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,453
Now!

219
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:32,440
General Ma! You... You are...

220
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:43,159
I don't mind sacrificing everything

221
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,720
to find the truth behind Feudal Lord Ma's death.

222
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,253
Do you think the Ma Family Army will easily believe

223
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,020
that the King of Jin is the murderer?

224
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,080
Ma Fengcheng, didn't you report to His Majesty

225
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,099
that Feudal Lord Ma left some writings at the crime scene?

226
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:04,219
Besides, no one in this world except for Jin

227
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,959
would dare to assassinate someone from the Ma family!

228
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:11,400
For more than ten years, King of Jin has been persuading the Feudal Lord to side with him.

229
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,979
He is someone who values talent.

230
00:21:13,979 --> 00:21:17,260
He will never harm the Feudal Lord that easily.

231
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,953
You!

232
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,639
This is serious.

233
00:21:28,639 --> 00:21:31,639
Let us do this. We will move separately.

234
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:33,600
Go back and report this to Master.

235
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,500
I will seek an audience with His Majesty.

236
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,280
Everyone here is willing to die for the Feudal Lord!

237
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:53,539
We will die for the Feudal Lord!

238
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:59,459
Your Majesty, the Ma Family Army is not saying that they suspect you.

239
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:03,759
But they hope that you can see them in person and swear an oath with your blood.

240
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,420
Only then will they believe that this case was done by Jin.

241
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,859
How capable of them.

242
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:20,040
They dare to blackmail me to swear an oath for their trust?

243
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,600
If I did that,

244
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:28,440
where will the might of the emperor go?

245
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,040
Do I have to swear such an oath to everyone from then on?

246
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,229
Reporting. Hai Die from the Royal House of Bo requests for an audience!

247
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,519
Your Majesty.

248
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,539
Is Ma Zhaixing still alive? Where is she?

249
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,200
Prince of Bo will be bringing her back to the city.

250
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,220
Go and assist him.

251
00:22:56,219 --> 00:23:01,159
He needs to come back immediately. Hurry.

252
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:02,640
My Lord!

253
00:23:03,999 --> 00:23:06,039
My Lord. It's bad!

254
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:08,220
The Ma Army refuses to easily believe that the murderer is the Jin Army.

255
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,820
They've captured the prime minister and are forcing His Majesty to meet them.

256
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,300
They even demanded to His Majesty to swear a blood oath.

257
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:20,240
Let's go. Bring the Feudal Young Mistress and leave immediately.

258
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,373
Where is she?

259
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:37,779
Could that Young Lord have disregarded Master's refusal and brought Young Mistress back to Kuizhou?

260
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,193
Mo Xiao, did you see anyone suspicious on your way here?

261
00:23:43,193 --> 00:23:46,539
The path I took is the one towards Kuizhou.

262
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:49,759
That Young Lord did not bring Young Mistress back to Ma Mansion.

263
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,259
Looks like that Feudal Young Lord of Tongzhou is not who he seems.

264
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:56,159
He must have an ulterior motive.

265
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,460
- Here.
- Drink!

266
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,600
- Congratulations to Young Master for saving the Feudal Young Mistress.
- Yes.

267
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,899
- Congratulations, Young Master.
- Congratulations, Young Master.

268
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,699
Here. Young Master, drink.

269
00:24:04,699 --> 00:24:06,112
Drink!

270
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,779
Those envoys truly believed that Young Master was there to bring Young Mistress back to Ma Mansion.

271
00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:15,700
- I'm sure they are looking for her now.
- Young Master is wise!

272
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,360
- Now, this Ma Family Feudal Young Mistress will be under the control of Young Master.
- That's right!

273
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,280
- Yes. Young Master is great!
- That's right.

274
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,860
- Young Master is wise!
- Young Master is wise!

275
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,679
Here.

276
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,840
Ma Zhaixing, if you are awake,

277
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,859
you will definitely ask why I did not bring you to Ma Mansion, right?

278
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,990
You should blame Chu Kui!

279
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:58,560
The Gu family worked for him for a lifetime but he betrayed us and removed our authority!

280
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,780
I did everything to get close to you

281
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:12,459
so I can coax you into siding with Jin and threaten the whole Ma family to surrender as well.

282
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:15,529
Unexpectedly, your family was destroyed by Jin first.

283
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:17,419
Luckily, you're still alive.

284
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,640
You will become my bargaining chip to ally with Jin.

285
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,139
Young Master, it is as you expected.

286
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:29,239
A group of imperial envoys is heading towards Ma Mansion now.

287
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,439
Great!

288
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:33,100
We will be long gone when they realize that they've been tricked.

289
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,050
Young Master is wise.

290
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,959
Young Master is wise!

291
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,219
You are really sick.

292
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:16,619
Why did you love someone who was raised by a wolf instead of someone normal?

293
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,119
Today, I will let you know

294
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,539
that I'm the real wolf.

295
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,379
I heard that when you drink

296
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,259
this Datura Wine,

297
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,020
you will develop illusions.

298
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,200
I will test it out on a zombie like you today.

299
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,300
Alright?

300
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:04,619
I am best at bringing under control

301
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:09,700
smug and self-righteous rich family daughters like you!

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:16,293
If I didn't deceive you, how could I discover your lair

307
00:28:16,293 --> 00:28:19,140
and see your intention of defecting to the enemy?

Why is the Datura Wine taking effect now?

310

Young Master! Young Master! Young Master!

311
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,090

Can you tell me what was the last memory that you remember?

363
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,112
I remember that

364
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:36,072
I was talking with my father that night.

365
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:37,833
Suddenly,

366
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:41,179
someone attacked Ma Mansion.

367
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:43,980
Father asked me to leave to protect me.

368
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,740
He started to fight with the man in black clothes.

369
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:52,000
I thought I would die with my father

370
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,119
but I was just knocked out.

371
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:01,900
We arrived at the last moment to defeat the assassin and save you.

372
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,310
But we couldn't prevent the tragedy from happening.

373
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:14,669
His Majesty received a tip-off.

374
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,460
He knew King of Jin would harm the Ma family.

375
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,640
Everything was...

376
00:34:25,352 --> 00:34:27,919
really the act of Jin?

377
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:29,613
Indeed,

378
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:32,919
it was not done

379
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,473
by Jin alone.

380
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:41,612
I believe the King of Jin and the Feudal Young Lord of Tongzhou,

381
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,859
Gu Qingping, had conspired together.

382
00:34:48,379 --> 00:34:51,300
My Lord, it is as you predicted.

383
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,139
I found a letter of treason with Jin on the corpse of that Young Feudal Lord of Tongzhou.

384
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,720
This as well. It's the Tiger Seal used by the Jin Army.

The Ma Family Army doesn't know about Jin's trickery.

397
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,939
They think that the annihilation of the Ma family was the doing of His Majesty.

398
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:22,773
They have already launched an assault on the capital.

00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:36,670
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

481
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:46,810
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

482
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:52,210
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

483
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:59,530
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

484
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:06,530
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

485
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:13,830
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

486
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,460
♫ Forever being together ♫

487
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,050
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

488
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:28,210
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

489
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:35,390
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

490
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:42,480
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

491
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,730
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

492
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:56,620
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

493
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:04,030
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

494
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:10,100
♫ Forever being together ♫

495
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,670
