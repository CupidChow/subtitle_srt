Commandant Xiahou has been assassinated!

25
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,600
Hurry and give chase! See who did it!

26
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Yes, General.

27
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,800
You two stand guard at the door. We will go chase after him.

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes!

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Father, how could this happen?

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,600
Commandant Xiahou was assassinated.

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Commandant Xiahou, he is the sworn brother of the emperor!

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,800
- Housekeeper Wang!
- Here.

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
How did this happen?

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
I was just about to serve the commandant

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,200
and saw the commandant fighting with the wolf monster.

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,700
In a flash, he was strangled to death.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
Feudal Master...

38
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,400
Feudal Master, it was all my fault.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,600
I should not have listened to the commandant's words

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,000
to go up the mountain and catch a young wolf

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
for the commandant to drink its blood to treat his illness.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,600
Perhaps it's because of this

43
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
that attracted the wolf monster down the mountain

44
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
and murdered Commandant.

45
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
The wolf monster has come down the mountain?

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,900
This matter we cannot conclude is the actions of the wolf monster.

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,400
However, the murderer is quite peculiar.

48
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,800
Its behavior is wolf-like, different from ordinary people,

49
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,100
walking on all four limbs on the ground, he saved the young wolf.

50
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,780
With one glance, I can conclude

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
he is just a young man from the wild.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
Father, there were hunters who eye-witnessed the wolf monster

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,200
saying he looks both wolf-like and human-like.

54
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,800
This definitely is the wolf monster. There is no mistake.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
His Majesty will arrive at Kuizhou City in a few days.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,400
We need to quickly investigate this matter and

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
find the real murderer before His Majesty arrives.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Adjutant General Ma, quickly arrange some men and horses

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,800
with full effects to search and investigate the truth.

60
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
This person can evade the guards and enter Ma Manor,

61
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
assassinating the Commandant Xiahou who is strong in martial arts,

62
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
so his skills must be extraordinary.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,800
You must be careful.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,700
This subordinate will immediately bring troops up the mountain to capture this savage.

65
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,200
You must be cautious.

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,200
He is a human but also exhibits the wildness of a wolf.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,800
If we cannot catch the murderer,

68
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
our Ma Manor will have no way to answer to His Majesty.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes.

70
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,070
Hurry! Prepare to go up the mountain.

71
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,800
- Fengcheng Brother, what happened?
- Young Mistress.

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Why is there such a large commotion?

73
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Young Mistress, something big has happened in the manor.

74
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
The wolf monster from Langshou Mountain has killed the commandant.

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,500
We have to immediately catch him to resolve the case.

76
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,200
That's impossible!

77
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
We suspect its the actions of the wolf monster

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,000
because we saw a young man with the behavior of a wolf.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,700
And his motive for killing the commandant was to save the young wolf pup.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
Why is the Young Mistress so anxious?

81
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,000
What does this have to do with her?

82
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,020
Feudal Master,

83
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,390
because of this death, so many problems have arisen.

84
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
It's all my fault , I should not have listened to Commandant Xiahou's command

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,100
to catch a young wolf for him to eat.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,900
Once we catch the monster, he deserves to be hacked into pieces.

87
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,900
He's not a wolf monster! Stop speaking nonsense!

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Zhaixing.

89
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Young Mistress.

90
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Father, there must be a misunderstanding here.

91
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
The boy with wolf-like behavior you guys have been talking about, he isn't some monster.

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,400
He only appears wolf-like

93
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,000
because he was raised by wolves.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,600
How do you know this,

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
unless you know him?

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,400
He is the friend I wanted to introduce you to.

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Now that it's come to this point, I will be honest with you.

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,400
The so-called wolf monster was actually a rumor planned and created by me.

99
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Ma Zhaixing, you tricked me!

100
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Hurry and explain.

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,400
I originally wanted to tell you the truth after the commandant left.

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
You–

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,600
I learned about hypnotic incense from Uncle Wang

104
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,200
which made people hallucinate, thinking it was a wolf monster

105
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,400
but we didn't want to harm anyone.

106
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I just wanted to protect the wolves

107
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
and not let them be harmed by hunters.

108
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Preposterous!

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,400
Your matter of creating fake monster rumors, I won't deal with now,

110
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,000
but he killed Commandant Xiahou and is a criminal of the imperial court.

111
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,600
I cannot be lax on this matter.

112
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,500
No!

113
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,200
Father, Wolf Boy definitely would not randomly kill people.

114
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Father, I'm begging you!

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Father, I'm begging you! Father!

116
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,600
Don't send troops up the mountain to catch him. He will be scared.

117
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,400
He has only just started trusting in people.

118
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Let me go to the mountains and I'll ask him how things really were, okay?

119
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Be quiet!

120
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,000
All of this is punishment for you teasing me!

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,600
That wolf monster undeniably murdered Commandant Xiahou!

122
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
Everything was personally witnessed by Father, Uncle Wang,

123
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
and many other people!

124
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,600
The ironclad evidence piles up mountain high!

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,000
He's right.

126
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,500
Could your own father lie to you?

127
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,800
T-This... Maybe...

128
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,200
Maybe there is some sort of misunderstanding in the middle of this?

129
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Perhaps he may not be a type of evil,

130
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,200
but can you guarantee

131
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
he is completely without a beastly nature?

132
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,000
Can you guarantee that, in order to protect that wolf cub,

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,400
he would not injure someone, or go as far as killing someone?

134
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I trust in him.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,400
Even though he has beastly instincts,

136
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
over the time that I have interacted with him,

137
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,600
he would never harm innocent people.

138
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Zhaixing, have you not messed around enough?

139
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
You deliberately spread rumors.

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,200
You have already made the entire Kuizhou City into a state of panic!

141
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,000
You also abused the public trust for your personal benefit, lied to your elders,

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,600
made the decision to seal off the mountain, and now someone is dead!

143
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
You also implicated His Majesty's sworn brother!

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Did you know that

145
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,800
this will only bring our Ma Family the fatal calamity of complete annihilation?

146
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
Yet at this time,

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,000
your position is still so biased like this!

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,300
I will not let you drag yourself into the middle of this anymore!

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,400
I must capture the wolf monster alive, enforcing the law impartially to deal with him!

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,400
If it is as he says it is, I will naturally give him justice!

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,800
If he really did murder Commandant Xiahou,

152
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
I will definitely let him pay with his life, and prove that our entire Ma family is innocent!

153
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Father.

154
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,000
- Wang Xiang!
- Feudal Master.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,200
Take her away!

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,000
Father! Father.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,800
- Take her away!
- Young Mistress!

158
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,000
- Father!
- Let's go.

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,600
- Father!
- Go!

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,300
- Father!
- Young Mistress!

161
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,400
Father, he's not a monster! He's merely just

162
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,600
a child that doesn't know anything!

163
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,200
Housekeeper Wang! Let me out!

164
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,600
- Young Mistress !
- Housekeeper Wang!
- Young Mistress!

165
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,400
Please just remain in the room and reflect. The situation has gotten out of hand.

166
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Please remain calm.

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Housekeeper Wang! Wait a minute!

168
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,800
Can you help me with something?

169
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,700
Can you tell me my father's plans?

170
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,400
Young Mistress, I am afraid I really cannot help this time.

171
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Feudal Master will enforce the law impartially to deal with him.

172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Housekeeper Wang! Housekeeper Wang, I have not finished talking yet!

173
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Come back!

174
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
Housekeeper Wang! Housekeeper Wang!

175
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Has Wolf Boy been injured? Is he frightened?

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,800
Housekeeper Wang! Housekeeper Wang, come back!

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,200
It's not that I don't trust my father.

178
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,800
But are you guys willing to trust

179
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,400
a child that has been raised by a wolf.

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
to be more kind and good than you or me?

181
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,390
Is there anyone who is willing to believe?

182
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,400
Let me out.

183
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Open the door! Open the door!

184
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Let me out.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,700
Someone, come!

186
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,700
Find that wolf monster!

187
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
It seems that the wolf's den is just up the front!

188
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,800
He is injured! He cannot get far!

189
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,800
There are footprints here!

190
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
We must not let him escape this time!

191
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Chase after that sound!

192
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,400
Hurry!

193
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,000
Over there! In front!

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,500
Keep up! Hurry!

195
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Over there!

196
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,200
We have caught him!

197
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Over there!

198
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Capture them all in one go!

199
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,200
The wolf pack is here! The wolf pack has come to save him!

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,800
Will there be wolf monsters?

201
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,200
Adjutant General, what should we do?

202
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,000
It is just an ordinary wolf!

203
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,600
We have nothing to be afraid of! That wolf monster does not exist!

204
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
Wolf packs fear fire! If we get attacked by a wolf pack,

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,200
just use fire to retaliate! If the situation is dire,

206
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,400
then shoot them to death! Today, we must capture the wolf monster!

207
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,200
We shall return to report our successful mission!

208
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,700
Yes!

209
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,600
The wolf pack has retreated!

210
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,200
Could it be this wild man can command the wolf pack of Langshou Mountain?

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
He is not an ordinary wild man! He can actually command a wolf pack!

212
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,900
Archers at the ready!

213
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,660
No!

214
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,500
Little Feng!

215
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,000
Young Mistress, are you all right?

216
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I am fine.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Little Feng, is there any news about Ma Manor capturing Wolf Boy?

218
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,000
No.

219
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,400
But there is a royal decree that His Majesty sent a messenger on a fast horse to bring here, stating that His Majesty is rushing here immediately.

220
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,500
I heard His Majesty also ordered Feudal Master

221
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,600
to be sure to capture Wolf Boy and kill anyone who resists.

222
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,190
I brought this on him. It is all my fault!

223
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,400
I should not have fabricated the legend of the wolf monster.

224
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
And even more so should not have brought him down the mountain!

225
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,800
- I brought this on him!
- Young Mistress!

226
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Young Mistress, do not keep blaming yourself like this!

227
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,800
Wolf Boy killing someone was not something you could have foreseen,

228
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,200
- nor was it something you wanted to see happen!
- There must be another unknown reason for this!

229
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,500
Otherwise, he definitely would not have harmed anyone!

230
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,000
Little Feng, when I gave him the wolf-tooth necklace,

231
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I promised him that I would protect him!

232
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He trusted me that much!

233
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,400
Unless you can prove Wolf Boy's innocence, otherwise, how else can you protect him?

234
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,800
I am just afraid that, before I have discovered the truth, Wolf Boy would have already been murdered!

235
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,910
At the moment, there is only one path we can take!

236
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Little Feng, can you help me?

237
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,800
Little Feng has grown up together with Young Mistress. Young Mistress has never treated me as a servant,

238
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,600
instead, caring for me as if I were your little sister!

239
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,200
For Young Mistress, I could be dealt with by the military law and I would not be afraid!

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,100
Good Little Feng! Thank you!

241
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,400
I must go up the mountain.

242
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I need to make Wolf Boy leave Langshou Mountain.

243
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,800
Young Mistress, the Ma Family Army has so many soldiers tracking him down on the mountain.

244
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,700
I think Wolf Boy might have already run away!

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,100
No.

246
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,800
When a wolf encounters danger, it will not flee or go into hiding.

247
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,200
What I fear the most is that

248
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,000
he will worry that I will not be able to find him, and will not run away no matter what!

249
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,100
Then what should we do?

250
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,500
We can only be ruthless and force him to leave.

251
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,800
Originally, the wolf pack had intended to attack,

252
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,400
to rescue him but then retreated back.

253
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
It was this Wolf Boy

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,400
that warned the wolf pack not to create conflict with us.

255
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,000
He would rescue wolf cubs by himself, sacrificing himself to protect his companions.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,600
I heard that this Wolf Boy has affection and a sense of loyalty. I did not believe it at first.

257
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,100
Now, I have really widened my knowledge.

258
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,400
However, he is the assailant who killed Commandant Xiahou after all.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,600
If he had not committed murder, I could guarantee,

260
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,800
if Feudal Master were to meet him, he would praise him for being first-class general material.

261
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
It is a shame!

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,600
I heard they captured the wolf monster!

263
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,000
That is the wolf monster?

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,900
That is him!

265
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
Xing'er!

266
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,400
Do not let him escape!

267
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wolf Boy!

268
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,000
Wolf Boy! Wolf Boy!

269
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Wolf Boy!

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Xing'er!

271
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,500
Do not move!

272
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,300
Stand there and wait for me!

273
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
How did you get your injuries?

274
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,620
I asked you, how did you get your injuries?

275
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Did you do something wrong again?

276
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,700
Were you disobedient again?

277
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Did you know,

278
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,500
right now, all the officials and soldiers in the city are trying to capture you?

279
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,000
Everyone is sure you killed someone!

280
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
You can no longer stay in Kuizhou City!

281
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,050
Tru...

282
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,500
st...

283
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,000
I trust you!

284
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,200
You trust me! We trust in each other!

285
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you understand?

286
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,600
I did say that!

287
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,900
Xing'er and Wolf Boy will trust in each other forever.

288
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,100
But, in this moment, so what if I trust you? So what if I do not trust you?

289
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,000
Your life could be in danger at any moment!

290
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,800
Is your life not important?

291
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,400
Go!

292
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,000
Since there is danger,

293
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,600
then leave Kuizhou City! Leave Langshou Mountain!

294
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
The further you go, the better!

295
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You do not need to stay here for me!

296
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,300
Listen well!

297
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,600
From this moment forth,

298
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,400
we have nothing to do with each other anymore!

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Do you understand?

300
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,150
Do not follow me!

301
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,730
You are not going to leave, right?

302
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,300
I regret it!

303
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,200
I regret becoming friends with you!

304
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,600
I regret bringing you down the mountain!

305
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,400
Do you not know that you are a monster?

306
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,300
How could I be friends with a monster?

307
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,200
Stop joking around!

308
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,300
What if someone were to find out

309
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,400
and think that I am associated with you?

310
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
If you still do not leave,

311
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
you will just drag me down!

312
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,000
You will implicate me!

313
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,700
Hurry up and get lost!

314
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,600
Get lost!

315
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,200
Wolf Boy...

316
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,400
is not a monster.

317
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,600
I am a human.

318
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,100
Xing'er trusts Wolf Boy.

319
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,030
Xing'er...

320
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,500
protects Wolf Boy.

321
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,300
Do not leave.

322
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,690
Stop deluding yourself!

323
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,600
I became your friend because I was lonely before.

324
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,500
I just wanted to treat you as a playmate.

325
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,420
A playmate raised by a wolf.

326
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,070
How strange! How special!

327
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,320
I don't need you anymore.

328
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,860
Get lost!

329
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,690
Get lost!

330
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,700
Get lost!

331
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,300
If you're still not going to leave,

332
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,790
I will have people catch you.

333
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,480
To catch your wolf mother and your wolf brothers.

334
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,130
Get lost!

335
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,680
Search the mountain! His Majesty will be personally arriving here in a few days!

336
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,720
If we cannot capture the wolf monster, the entire Kuizhou City will be implicated!

337
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,220
Yes! Quickly search!

338
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,510
Wolf Boy, don't come back anymore.

339
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,110
[Ma Manor]

340
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,610
I am useless. I had originally captured the assailant,

341
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,890
but I was neglectful in taking precautions.

342
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,110
I let him escape.

343
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,550
This youngster is different than other people.

344
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,850
I fear he may have godlike strength gifted by the heavens.

345
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:08,520
Then, I'll accompany you for tomorrow's search.

346
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,100
Father! His Majesty will be here soon.

347
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,970
You shouldn't leave the manor. How about I'll lead the search?

348
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,070
I'll support Brother Fengcheng.

349
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,090
I fought with the wild person before. I know his methods.

350
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,090
Now is the time to choose who to employ. I think that I can be of help.

351
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,740
That's good as well.

352
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,260
This way, you can also take this as an opportunity to get experience.

353
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,840
But... never act alone.

354
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,110
You need to follow Fengcheng's orders.

355
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:47,490
Yes, Father! Don't worry!

356
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,330
I'll listen to Adjutant General Ma and catch the wild man.

357
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,390
Go get ready.

358
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,890
Young Master, you've become more mature.

359
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:08,790
You were able to take the initiative and help Feudal Master.

360
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,270
You've forgotten.

361
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,390
Last time, I was spooked by that animal.

362
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,850
If I'm able to catch that beast and cut off his wolf head,

363
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,210
not only can I get awarded merit in front of my father,

364
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:27,460
and get that girl, Ma Zhaixing, mad as well.

365
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,910
Kill two birds with one stone.

366
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:49,320
Wolf Boy, whenever I ring this bell while going up the mountains,

367
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,800
you won't appear. Right?

368
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,890
You must've hated me.

369
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,440
♫ Nothing has changed ♫

370
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:06,850
But don't worry. The most important thing is that you've left Kuizhou City.

371
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,630
♫ You have never given up waiting for me ♫

372
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,140
♫ Looking past the starry night ♫

373
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,400
♫ Your gaze was firm and warm ♫

374
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,590
♫ You wanted to tell me ♫

375
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,630
♫ You will hug me firmly ♫

376
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,610
♫ Even not letting go of tears  ♫

377
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:41,610
♫ Don't let me drift like sand in the wind after being let go ♫

378
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:45,660
♫ I will hug you tightly ♫

379
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,690
♫ Like the universe opening its arms ♫

380
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:57,210
♫ Even if I'm not by your side ♫

381
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:05,690
♫ I have always been guarding ♫

382
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,040
♫ Nothing has changed ♫

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,630
♫ Still twinkling ♫

385
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,800
Young Mistress, His Majesty will arrive today.

386
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,270
Although Feudal Master allowed you to leave your room to greet them,

387
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:25,450
but he doesn't want you to bring up your relationship with Wolf Boy.

388
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,270
Or else, it will cause His Majesty to be more suspicious.

389
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:30,890
He will accuse you.

390
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,880
Don't worry, I won't let my father be worried.

391
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,450
I will help the emperor investigate properly.

392
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,840
I'll think of a way to prove the Wolf Boy's innocence.

393
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,390
Little Feng, what happened? Are you not feeling well?

394
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,750
I'm not sure, either. I don't know what herbs the kitchen used in the meals the previous day.

395
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:56,450
Whenever I smell that, I get nauseous and want to vomit.

396
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,510
Herbs from the kitchen?

397
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,880
Which one could it be?

398
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,440
I know! It's Li Hu.

399
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,270
Li Hu?

400
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:09,110
It's okay. Don't worry.

401
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,990
Its smell does cause people to have nausea.

402
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,640
It's just...

403
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,390
Little Feng! I need to go somewhere.

404
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,120
[Ma Estate]

405
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,960
Feudal Master, Adjutant General Ma left quite a while ago.

406
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,660
He will definitely be able to catch that wild person.

407
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,580
It's best if you go back and get some rest.

408
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,080
I'm just worried. If he can't catch the murderer,

409
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,240
then the emperor will be angered towards the citizens of Kuizhou City.

410
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,860
[Chu Kui, Emperor of Yang Kingdom]

411
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,350
Ma Ying!

412
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,970
You're still as skillful as you were back then.

413
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,670
I have to shoot several arrows in succession to take your life.

414
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,700
Greetings to Your Majesty. Long live, Your Majesty!

415
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,070
Long live Your Majesty!

416
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,060
I was not made aware Your Majesty was arriving early,

417
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,130
I was not able to welcome Your Majesty from afar.

418
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,260
- Please, Your Majesty—
- Xiahou Yi died in your manor?

419
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,770
- I'm willing to accept the punishment.
- Report to me when we go back in.

420
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,400
If you have any fault, I'll decide.

421
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

422
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,610
[Ma Manor]

423
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,570
Young Mistress, what are you doing in Commandant Xiahou's room?

424
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:34,520
I heard that these were the fighting marks left by the Wolf Boy and Adjutant General.

425
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,340
Young Mistress, Feudal Master has ordered that

426
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,330
no one is allowed to come in here before the emperor's personal investigation.

427
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,040
We should leave now.

428
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,700
Young Mistress, is there a problem with the soup?

429
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,600
No.

430
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,480
This is a very normal nourishing soup.

431
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,790
But this is the brilliance about it.

432
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:27,000
A savage with his bare hands

433
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,810
was able to enter Ma Manor without being noticed

434
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,170
and also murdered Xiahou Yi.

435
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,720
If you did not witness it,

436
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,110
I wouldn't even believe it.

437
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,920
Your Majesty, please forgive me for my dereliction of duty.

438
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,590
It resulted in such a regretful incident.

439
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:49,550
I thought the murderer was apprehended.

440
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,100
Unexpectedly, the murderer had great strength.

441
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Not only did he break the giant wooden cage with one hand,

442
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,800
he also managed to escape in an instant.

443
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,030
Is that the truth?

444
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:08,110
The world is big. It's hard to come across a genius.

445
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,800
I would like to go there and search.

446
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,210
To meet this unique young man with the agility of a wolf.

447
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,910
Ma Ying, get the horse ready and we'll leave immediately.

448
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

449
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,590
Your Majesty, please wait!

450
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,280
Stop! Stand back!

451
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,310
I am Ma Ying's daughter, Ma Zhaixing. Greetings, Your Majesty.

452
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,560
Zhaixing, you're being rude. Retreat immediately!

453
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,290
Father, I have something important to report to His Majesty.

454
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,600
You may leave.

455
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,570
Reporting to Your Majesty. This case is unjustified. The wolf boy is innocent.

456
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,660
The murderer is someone else.

457
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,230
Zhaixing, you cannot talk nonsense in front of the emperor.

458
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,850
Ma Ying.

459
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,850
I want to hear from you.

460
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,740
If you have evidence, I will be sure to be fair

461
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,040
and will not let the real criminal remain free and not be prosecuted.

462
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,580
If you are playing around,

463
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,090
I will severely punish you.

464
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,060
I understand.

465
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,560
Stand up and speak clearly.

466
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,570
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Zhaixing, get up!

467
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,720
Your Majesty,

468
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,750
the night that Commandant Xiahou was assassinated,

469
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,450
he had taken Li Hu and ginseng soup.

470
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,470
Those are regular herbs.

471
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,810
Is there anything odd about it?

472
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,870
This is where the assailant's cleverness lies.

473
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,490
Since these two are not poisonous,

474
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:48,370
there won't be any suspicions. However, if both are used at the same time

475
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,690
plus with adept knowledge in medicine dosage,

476
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:56,410
the commandant will suffer from blood flow disruption and lose all his strength.

477
00:34:56,410 --> 00:34:59,420
- Housekeeper Wang Xiang.
- Here.

478
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,130
In the manor, you are most familiar with medicine.

479
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:05,730
Just now, what the Feudal Princess said, was it true?

480
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,830
Yes.

481
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,260
If Commandant Xiahou really got poisoned,

482
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,980
there will be poisoning evidence on the body.

483
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,590
In order for the assailant to avoid that, he will use medicine

484
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:21,410
that will not show the poisoning evidence on the body.

485
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,870
But just enough to lose the ability to defend oneself.

486
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,630
At this moment, the assailant who originally may not have been able to overpower the commandant,

487
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,020
can use this opportunity to strangle him.

488
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,640
The murderer already knew that Commandant's death was discovered.

489
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,710
The Ma Family and the emperor will search for the real culprit.

490
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,020
Then, the culprit deliberately mystified the death,

491
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,950
by using Kuizhou's City legend about the Wolf Monster.

492
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,960
He made fake wolf marks that mislead people and made them misunderstand

493
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,670
that these were actions of the wolf monster.

494
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,380
The culprit must've not anticipated that it would be turned true and attracted the Wolf Boy.

495
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,430
What happened next was what my father saw.

496
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,860
You speak so surely.

497
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,740
So exactly who did this?

498
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:24,700
The culprit must be someone from the Ma family who is responsible for the medicated meal.

499
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,700
The Ma manor has fault in employing such people.

500
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,470
May I ask Your Majesty, for Father,

501
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,830
to investigate everyone who was in the kitchen that night.

502
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:38,410
Also, the people whom Commandant Xiahou met with.

503
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:43,320
The suspects who meet the criteria should only be 10 or so and we can further investigate to find the real culprit.

504
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,680
Your Majesty, I think my daughter's words are making some sense.

505
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,070
I will immediately send people to investigate this properly.

506
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,480
Men!

507
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,260
No need for the trouble!

508
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:07,090
I almost deceived every one of you.

509
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:13,310
I didn't think I would lose to a little girl.

510
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:17,200
Housekeeper Wang, why is it you?

511
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,880
It is me.

512
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,670
Bring him down!

513
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,970
Kneel!

514
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,310
In the whole Ma Manor, other than me,

515
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,700
who else understands about medicine and can have control over the meals?

516
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,210
Wang Xiang! You!

517
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,590
How could you be so cruel to harm a member of royalty and

518
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,790
implicate my Ma Manor into unfavorable conditions.

519
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:45,330
Xiahou Yi, that swindler.

520
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,600
I have an absolutely irreconcilable grudge against him.

521
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,160
My only regret is killing him so late.

522
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,300
XiaHou Yi and you have a grudge?

523
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,640
Back then, when the previous dynasty fell, it was agreed

524
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,250
if the Li family (of the Tang Dynasty) steps aside for you,

525
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,270
then you would not kill off the Li Clan.

526
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:14,190
Who would have guessed Xiahou, that evil bastard, guessed your real desires

527
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:18,530
and had the whole Li Clan locked in the palace.

528
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:21,500
Everyone was killed in the royal family.

529
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,490
If that swindler didn't die,

530
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,670
then it would be God being blind.

531
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,950
My plan was

532
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,180
to kill off that swindler first.

533
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,490
And then to let all people in the Ma Manor

534
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,120
to be implicated and suffer.

535
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,170
Your Majesty, this subject is at fault, I unknowingly took in a criminal of the last dynasty.

536
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,880
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

537
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,890
Ma Ying, you didn't even investigate. You almost caused trouble upon yourself.

538
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,990
Although the Xiahou Yi case is resolved,

539
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:05,190
however, you cannot escape punishment.

540
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,700
I want you to work to compensate for this crime for the rest of your life.

541
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,950
But for this person,

542
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:13,950
you should know what to do next.

543
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,770
I understand.

544
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,200
I will immediately take Your Majesty back to the palace.

545
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,220
No need.

546
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,250
You better check on the members of your household.

547
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,270
- Ma Ying.
-Yes, Your Majesty!

548
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,840
Your daughter is not too bad.

549
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,730
She is the green born of blue, but beats blue.
(T/N: the younger surpasses the elder)

550
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,960
Take care, Your Majesty.

551
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,260
His Majesty is going back.

552
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,330
Take care, Your Majesty.

553
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,520
Zhaixing, it's my fault for misunderstanding Wolf Boy.

554
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,780
Hurry, find your elder brother, and stop the arrest!

555
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,300
Yes.

556
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:22,840
But... I'm afraid Wolf Boy has long left Langshou Mountain ...

557
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,630
What if Wolf Boy didn't leave?

558
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:28,740
I'm afraid they might hurt him by accident.

559
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,300
Hurry! Hurry up and go save the Wolf Boy!

560
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,920
Hurry up!
