2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,300
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:31,900
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,100
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,800
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,200
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,300
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,300
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,900
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:12,100
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 31]

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,900
She was telling the truth.

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,400
Brother, now you understand what I meant.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,500
Lord Bo, on the prairies,

24
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,800
I have seen the mantis mate, and after promising their eternal love,

25
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,700
they would eat the other partner alive.

26
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,600
But to my surprise, even a prince like yourself

27
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,800
would act the same way those insects do.

28
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
If I remember correctly,

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,400
only the male mantis gets eaten.

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,600
It's been a long time. How are you lately?

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,600
I can never repay the affection you have shown me.

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,900
I cannot bring those you lost back to life.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,600
That's because I am Lord Bo.

34
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,300
I must make you my enemy.

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,400
If you seek revenge,

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,600
I'll be ready at all times.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,100
So breaking the alliance was your first step of revenge.

38
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Zhaixing.

40
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,800
My King, she said it.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,200
Rather than saying she was concerned for you and hence the advice,

42
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,600
she seems to have come to have revenge on me more.

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
She came with ill intent.

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,200
Princess Ma,

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
what I hate the most are liars.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,200
Your feud with Lord Bo has nothing to do with me.

47
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,700
I don't wish to be involved, either.

48
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,300
I understand your concern.

49
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,400
My hate for Lord Bo was never my motive to be here.

50
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
I spoke the truth.

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,600
I swear there was no lie.

52
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
This alliance won't end well for you.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Insolence!

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Ma Zhaixing, how dare you disrespect me on the day of my coronation!

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,100
Guards!

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,200
Please calm down, My King.

57
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,300
Please come have a look outside and you'll see if Zhaixing was telling the truth.

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,200
Princess Ma,

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,900
where is the sight you promised to show me?

60
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,000
My King, please look at the sky.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
What's wrong?

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,200
It's getting darker. Look!

63
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
- The heavenly hound is coming!
- Look!
(Folk legend: a heavenly hound eats the sun, causing the solar eclipse)

64
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,500
The sky is getting darker!

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,200
It's happening!

66
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,800
The plan you mentioned, was it related to the phenomenon we witnessed on our way here?

67
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
Well done, Ji Chong.

68
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,300
Just as you expected,

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,300
I've been studying military tactics.

70
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,000
As it says in the books,

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
knowing the surroundings helps secure the victory.

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,800
Before we departed,

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,400
I checked the ancient records regarding the cycles of solar eclipses.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,800
I found out the phenomenon was likely to happen soon.

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,689
I planned to use it to astonish the people of Qitan who worship the sun.

76
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:14,500
But on our way here, I witnessed an anomaly.

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,700
I knew my chance was certain.

78
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,200
Legend has it on the day of an eclipse, an anomaly is sure to take place.

79
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
I saw the same scenario as a kid.

80
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
In mere hours the eclipse will start to take place.

81
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Think about it.

82
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
For the King of Qitan, this prediction would be extraordinary.

83
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
I must seize this opportunity of our first meeting

84
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,200
to lower Lord Bo's morale.

85
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,600
We must strike preemptively.

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,600
This plan uses King of Qitan's weakness to bring Lord Bo down.

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,300
Brother, a solar eclipse is a bad omen.

88
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,200
The action of Yang must have angered the heavens.

89
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,600
That's why the eclipse is taking place right now.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Brother, Ma Zhaixing wasn't lying to us.

91
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,300
Strike the drums!

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:39,000
Drums of the King, defend the sun and moon!

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
Third Brother, what do we do now?

94
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,500
The people of Qitan worship the sun.

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,700
We never expected those two to foresee a solar eclipse.

96
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,500
Third Brother, I am afraid the king will blame us for what is happening now.

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:07:15,700
Drums of the King, defend the sun and moon!

98
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,800
When an eclipse takes place,

99
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,300
our drum beats will end it.

100
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,800
What is it taking so long today?

101
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
Is this really a bad omen?

102
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,400
Someone, bring the State Priest here!

103
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,200
My King, be patient.

104
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
I have a way to make the heavenly hound retreat.

105
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,300
Are you sure?

106
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
Please hand me the bow and arrow.

107
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,900
I'll shoot the heavenly hound down.

108
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
Bring the bow and arrow here!

109
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,400
Zhaixing, is Lord Bo really capable of breaking the eclipse?

110
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,900
Lord Bo really defeated the heavenly hound!

111
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,400
Nice. Nice shot!

112
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,300
Amazing!

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Lord Bo,

114
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,600
just one arrow from you chased away the heavenly hound.

115
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,800
You left me impressed.

116
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,700
I am flattered.

117
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,900
I simply wish to prove that the eclipse and wrath of Heaven was not caused by your action.

118
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,900
I must ask Princess Ma to stop spreading false rumors to alienate us.

119
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,000
Your demise will come from your own doing!

120
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,300
Princess Ma,

121
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,600
I respect you for you are Bao Na's friend.

122
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,800
I will allow you to leave after the ceremony is over,

123
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,000
but you must apologize to Lord Bo.

124
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,500
If you refuse, leave at once.

125
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,400
Zhaixing,

126
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,200
there is no need to apologize to that loathsome being.

127
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,300
Your apology is unnecessary.

128
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,800
You disguised as a servant and served me well.

129
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
I was very satisfied.

130
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,200
- My King.
- Zhaixing.

131
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,200
The princess and I have known each other a long time.

132
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
Although our bond is long gone,

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
but I must leave her with some honor.

134
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Not to mention her absurd actions today were all because of our past relationship.

135
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,500
However, I hope it all ends now.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,600
I want no more trouble from her.

137
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,900
If Lord Bo says so, I have no right to intervene any further.

138
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,000
Everyone, let's come into my tent and drink heartily.

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,300
Lord Bo, let's help ourselves with poetry and songs.

140
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
Surely.

141
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,100
This happens the moment I went away! Why didn't you keep your eyes on her?

142
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,578
Why are you blaming me now?

143
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:35,799
I lost sight of Sister Zhaixing after I left the tent!

144
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,900
Stop arguing!

145
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,819
It was all my fault.

146
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,019
Lord Bo recognized me when we were in his tent.

147
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,099
That's why he was prepared.

148
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,839
It was my fault.

149
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,579
I was too full of myself and underestimated him.

150
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,820
I shouldn't have boasted to the King of Jin.

151
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,279
Who knew that the moment I saw Lord Bo I got so nervous and failed so terribly.

152
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,819
Sister Zhaixing, this isn't your fault.

153
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:08,320
Lord Bo is simply too cunning.

154
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,078
And you! You should blame Lord Bo for this!

155
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:13,460
Stop bullying us girls!

156
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:18,638
You're right. Lord Bo shouldn't be so cruel to Zhaixing.

157
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,698
After all, she was Lord Bo's princess consort.

158
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,378
He should show some mercy.

159
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:25,178
Let us all hope Lord Bo will break the alliance

160
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,478
with the king and surrender without a battle.

161
00:12:27,478 --> 00:12:29,219
Maybe that's what you're after.

162
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,740
Wouldn't that be great?

163
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,419
That was too much!

164
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,279
Can't you see Sister Zhaixing is already feeling so upset and humiliated?

165
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,938
But, Sister Zhaixing,

166
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:46,439
there's something I don't understand.

167
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,598
How did Lord Bo manage to thwart our plan with the eclipse?

168
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:52,300
Was he really using magic?

169
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,919
He heard the wolf howling.

170
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,020
Wolf howling?

171
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,818
When the eclipse is ongoing, animals will notice the changes

172
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,159
when the sun and moon move in place.

173
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,740
When the darkness recedes and the light comes back,

174
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,399
the wolf will howl to mark the change.

175
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,079
Lord Bo must have heard the howling.

176
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,200
He timed the shot precisely.

177
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,039
I thought my plan was flawless,

178
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:23,918
but Lord Bo managed to overcome even the bad omen.

179
00:13:23,918 --> 00:13:25,660
He ruined our plan.

180
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,299
Perhaps he learned this growing up with the wolves.

181
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:31,000
That's why he knew

182
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,820
when the eclipse recedes, the wolf will start to howl.

183
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,138
The thought of it just makes me mad!

184
00:13:38,138 --> 00:13:40,680
Lord Bo is too smart to deal with!

185
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,219
Bao Na...

186
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,020
Even if you're angry, all you're doing right now is getting drunk.

187
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,370
No.

188
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,830
Hold this.

189
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,958
I may have failed to make my brother break the alliance,

190
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:01,239
but rooting for Sister Zhaixing and bringing her justice is still within my capability.

191
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:04,259
Bao Na, you mustn't be reckless.

192
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,099
It's too late.

193
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:08,719
I am already reckless.

194
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:10,498
Sister Zhaixing, you'll see.

195
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:13,059
I'll help you get back at him.

196
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,559
Princess!

197
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,278
Stay here. I'll bring her back.

198
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:19,740
Go.

199
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,239
Move everything out!

200
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:31,159
The table, chairs, pillows, blankets, and candles! Move everything out!

201
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,920
Leave nothing behind!

202
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,899
Princess.

203
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,719
What is this for?

204
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,838
But, Princess, if you take the blankets away,

205
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:47,638
how is Lord Bo supposed to sleep tonight?

206
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,139
He's right.

207
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,179
It's best for him to sleep in the wild and be eaten by the beasts!

208
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,360
Master.

209
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,139
We wouldn't dare to stop the princess.

210
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,399
Yelu Bao Na! What's gotten into you this time?

211
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,079
My way to welcome guests is based on the guests' personalities and manner.

212
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,859
For someone as despicable

213
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:22,419
as Lord Bo himself,

214
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,199
he deserves only an empty tent.

215
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,038
Yelu Bao Na! Aren't you afraid the king will find out?

216
00:15:29,038 --> 00:15:31,899
Go ahead and tell him. Do you think you scare me?

217
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:34,979
- You are insane! You are unreasonable!
- What did you say?

218
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,258
- I said you're crazy!
- I dare you to say that again!

219
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,980
- You're crazy!
- I dare you to say that again!

220
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,679
- Crazy woman!
- You!

221
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,419
Ji Chong, you're just in time.

222
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,339
Teach that rude Chu Youzhen a lesson!

223
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,159
Another has come to voice displeasure for Ma Zhaixing.

224
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,238
What?

225
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:54,619
Did she fail so many times that she's now too afraid to face me herself?

226
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:55,819
You...

227
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,079
Loser, let's settle the score.

228
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:08,419
I always wanted to beat you up.

229
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,020
Yelu Bao Na! Stop right there!

230
00:16:19,739 --> 00:16:21,818
- Fourth Prince, are you all right?
- Yelu Bao Na!

231
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:23,239
Wait!

232
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,059
What happened while we were away?

233
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:28,800
Why is Ji Chong here?

234
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,980
Is Commandery Princess here as well?

235
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,499
Is she here or not?

236
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,458
Do you think you're capable of protecting Ma Zhaixing by risking everything?

237
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,240
How ignorant of you.

238
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,999
I'm much stronger than you are.

239
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,439
I am a prince, too.

240
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:50,779
For Zhaixing, I am willing to give up all I have and even my life.

241
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,279
Do you have any idea how miserable she was in Jin?

242
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,638
She never smiled!

243
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:12,038
She barely slept!

244
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:13,539
She never ate any decent meals!

245
00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:16,279
She couldn't even rest after she fell ill!

246
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,820
Stop talking.

247
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,118
She suffered because of you.

248
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:29,839
She is obsessed with vengeance because of you.

249
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,600
You destroyed your Xing'er with your own hands!

250
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,840
Third Brother, watch out!

251
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,059
Stop!

252
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,119
Ji Chong, are you all right?

253
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:45,100
Ma Zhaixing, who do you think you are?

254
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,779
The moment you got humiliated you sent the Prince of Jin and Princess of Qitan to get back at me.

255
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,838
Why bother getting your revenge then?

256
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:55,819
Just hide under their protection and be the coward you are.

257
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,460
Ji Chong, let's leave.

258
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,138
We can't let him get away with this!

259
00:19:03,138 --> 00:19:05,580
I'm going all out today!

260
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,358
Guards, seize Lord Bo!

261
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:09,959
Yes!

262
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,339
Yelu Bao Na, you crazy woman! What do you want?

263
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,779
Since you're both as despicable, I don't mind stooping to your level.

264
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,458
Guards, being me the bow.

265
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,060
Yelu Bao Na, what's the meaning of this?

266
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,779
Sister Zhaixing,

267
00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:31,600
kill the man who has made you suffer.

268
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,918
Yelu Bao Na, are you insane?

269
00:19:38,918 --> 00:19:43,458
If you kill Lord Bo, the two nations will be at war with each other!

270
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,939
Lord Bo started the war.

271
00:19:45,939 --> 00:19:50,400
He humiliated my respected guest, which means he humiliated Qitan!

272
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,100
Sister Zhaixing, do it!

273
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,020
Sister Zhaixing, don't do it!

274
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,938
Sister Zhaixing, what are you waiting for?

275
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,039
He is the nemesis you've been wanting to slay!

276
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,098
Your father and family and Wolf Boy as well.

277
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:43,839
They all died because of him. Stop hesitating!

278
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,339
Father.

279
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,180
Ma Zhaixing,

280
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,219
you couldn't even kill my battle wolf.

281
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,260
Do you have the guts to kill me?

282
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,799
Release the arrow.

283
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,960
What are you talking about?

284
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,180
Sister Zhai Xing, you killed his battle wolf. Right?

Lord Bo, you won. Ma Zhaixing lost.

292
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:41,260
She lost because she isn't as cruel as you.

Do you feel proud for winning after all the odds were against her?

War has always been cruel. Send my message to Ma Zhaixing.

If she wishes to defeat me, if she wishes to fight on even ground,

she should stop asking for protection.

but you must never run away.

325
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,200
The worst is in the past now, right?

326
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,600
Whatever happens in the future,

327
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,500
nothing can get any worse.

328
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,800
I am glad you're pulling yourself together.

329
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,300
I was afraid Lord Bo's provoking might have disheartened you.

330
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,400
♫ Watching you but I can't move forward ♫

331
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,200
♫ Always in parallel, no intersection ♫

332
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,660
♫ My heart is crashing ♫

333
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,300
I may not possess the strength to stand against him,

334
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,200
but I am not that weak, either.

335
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,900
I must become stronger with my own effort.

336
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,100
I can't simply rely on you and Ji Chong.

337
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,300
Lord Bo said the same thing.

338
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,700
He said he would wait for you to become as strong as he is and fight him.

339
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,400
He does know you very well.

340
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,600
He knows my weakness.

341
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,100
Whether it be before or now,

342
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,400
Lord Bo and you understand each other like no one else.

343
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,000
It's just your imagination.

344
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Why would anyone want the enemy to understand them?

345
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,800
Hey, you, are you being jealous again?

346
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,300
I am worried Lord Bo knows Zhaixing all too well

347
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,200
and will use their past together against her.

348
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Sabotage the ceremony tomorrow.

349
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Thwart Lord Bo's plan to acquire military aid.

350
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,800
Have you already guessed that

351
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Princess Pingyuan is to be presented to King of Qitan at the ceremony?

352
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,600
I sent Ke Lang to keep an eye on King of Jin's Palace.

353
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,200
I ordered him to keep me posted on every activity.

354
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,800
Right after we departed,

355
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Her Highness left Taiyuan City soon after.

356
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,600
The dots can be easily connected.

357
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Who is Princess Pingyuan?

358
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,900
According to the King of Jin, your brother was held as a political hostage under the previous king.

359
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,400
The elder princess had shown him kindness.

360
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,900
Indeed. Life wasn't easy for my brother when he was held hostage.

361
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,600
A princess helped him.

362
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,300
That was why my brother fell in love with the cultures of the central plains.

363
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,800
Do you mean to say that was Princess Pingyuan?

364
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,200
Even if the Princess knew the King of Qitan, does it matter?

365
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
My brother never forgets to repay kindness.

366
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,800
Maybe after meeting the princess, he will change his mind.

367
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,500
Silly!

368
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Tonight the King of Jin will send his men to escort Princess Pingyuan here and meet us.

369
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,600
Let's discuss this at the camp.

370
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,400
I need you to tell me all the details.

371
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,700
It looks like a minor injury.

372
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,600
You're fine now.

373
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
But her wound...

374
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
goes much deeper than yours.

375
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,500
I hope that one day

376
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,000
she can overcome the wound I inflicted,

377
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
just like you did.

378
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,000
But to stand against Yang and to defeat me,

379
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,600
she is still too weak.

380
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,400
Right now,

381
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,300
she can barely protect herself.

382
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
How can she even defeat me?

383
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,800
Master.

384
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,400
As you expected, Ji Chong was acting suspicious.

385
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,600
We found out they were meeting a mysterious woman.

386
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
A mysterious woman?

387
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,300
Yes.

388
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,800
Master, as mentioned by Fourth Prince,

389
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,700
the prayer to Heaven will be conducted tomorrow morning at five o'clock;

390
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,200
the prayer for the King of Qitan to be safe.

391
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:10,000
During the ceremony, only the royalty of Qitan, tribal leaders, and we have the right to join.

392
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:16,600
The woman arrived at night. Could it be related to the tribute from Jin?

393
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,400
A timely hour for a prosperous day,

394
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,000
Heaven and Earth take form.

395
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,500
King of Qitan and the eight tribal leaders,

396
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,700
bow down and pay your respect.

397
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,200
Bow and present your incense.

398
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,800
The might reaches great distance!

399
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,000
Welcome the White Stallion and the Green Bison.

400
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,600
The deity of Heaven descends!

401
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,700
Protect Qitan from all disasters and misfortunes!

402
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,000
Make the nation prosper and the people free from illness!

403
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,500
Third Brother, I don't see Ji Chong and Zhaixing here.

404
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,400
It must be because they weren't qualified to attend.

405
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
They won't wait and do nothing.

406
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,800
They will take action.

407
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Third Brother, don't be paranoid.

408
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,100
After this, you must rise to the altar and accept the State Priest's blessing.

409
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
King of Qitan will present the sacred wine to you.

410
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
That is a great honor.

411
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,600
And trust me, no outsider was allowed in the previous ceremonies.

412
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
You earned the right with your heroic shot yesterday.

413
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,400
Remember, rise to the altar and accept your great honor.

414
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Princess Bao Na,

415
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,600
His Highness Lord Bo,

416
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,400
and Prince of Xun, please come to the altar.

417
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,800
Pray to the heavens!

418
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,600
Present the sacred wine!

419
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,900
Prayer is complete!

420
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,100
Lord Bo, please be ready.

421
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,600
Here it comes.

422
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,900
This is not possible.

423
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,700
Guards, bring me the person who's playing the pipa!

424
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,900
Greetings, My King.

425
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
Prince and Commandery Princess, at ease.

426
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Who is this?

427
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,300
She is a special tribute from Jin to you.

428
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,000
We have interrupted your ceremony.

429
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,700
I apologize for that.

430
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,800
But Princess Pingyuan hopes to present

431
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,400
her regards in person during the ceremony.

432
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,000
But she couldn't attend, so she only played outside the tent.

433
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,300
I hope you understand her goodwill.

434
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,700
Who did you say she is?

435
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,800
The royalty of the previous dynasty, Her Highness, Princess Pingyuan.

436
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
That is not possible!

437
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,600
The song you played with your pipa, what was the title?

438
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,000
My King,

439
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,400
ever since a young boy named the song "Melody of Pingyuan,"

440
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,100
the original title no longer matters.

441
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,700
What matters is the song has brought me a wonderful friendship.

442
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,600
[25 Years ago - Deep within the palace of the previous dynasty]

443
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,400
I want to go home!

444
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,600
Child,

445
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,200
sleep.

446
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
Don't be afraid.

447
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,500
I'm right here.

448
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,239
Young Master, you're finally awake.

449
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:22,219
If you still wouldn't wake up, Princess Pingyuan would have me punished.

450
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:23,719
Princess Pingyuan?

451
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:27,319
When you were ill, Her Highness disobeyed the order

452
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,638
and looked after you for one whole day without having any rest.

453
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,679
Before she left, she ordered me to take good care of you.

454
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,559
You must be starving. Have some food.

455
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:40,420
Princess Pingyuan?

456
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,119
From that day on,

457
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:45,539
I could hear the melodies of the pipa every day.

458
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:50,580
It was Princess Pingyuan who lived close by who played them for me

459
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,540
to ease my homesickness.

460
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:57,660
She ordered the servants to send me books and food

461
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,380
so I wouldn't feel lonely.

462
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,139
Back then,

463
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:07,599
I was merely a boy who was away from his home.

464
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,380
You exchanged notes with me so I could learn the culture of Qitan.

465
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,539
I learned much from you.

466
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,218
Yes! Yes, Yes!

467
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,280
That was the secret between Princess Pingyuan and I!

468
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,379
You really are Princess Pingyuan?

469
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:23,299
You're still alive!

470
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:26,240
Pardon my manners.

471
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,720
Fortunately, fate has favored me.

472
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,060
I am the last of the bloodline from the previous dynasty.

473
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,879
I was being sheltered by the King of Jin.

474
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,480
I've been hiding in Jin all this time.

475
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,498
If you are the princess from the previous dynasty,

476
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:44,680
why didn't you announce it to the world?

477
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,240
Lord Bo you must understand Jin's reason better than us.

478
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,659
Princess Pingyuan was afraid of being at risk again.

479
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,059
Your Highness, when I left the palace,

480
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:07,159
my greatest regret was never having the chance to see your face.

481
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,819
My King, Her Highness was scarred on the face

482
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,638
when the bandits of Chu massacred the people.

483
00:35:19,638 --> 00:35:22,219
So she must wear a veil.

484
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,498
I am sorry, Your Highness.

485
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:28,000
I didn't mean to bring up that tragic memory.

486
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,700
Not at all, My King.

487
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,619
I don't mind showing my scar to the people.

488
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:36,300
I simply do not want them to be scared by the scar.

489
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,140
The scar on my face serves as a reminder for me that I must live.

490
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,239
Brother, you always told us Princess Pingyuan took great care of you

491
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:50,399
that if there was a chance to repay her, you would risk everything to do so?

492
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:55,398
Bao Na, repaying past kindness and politics are two different matters.

493
00:35:55,398 --> 00:35:59,720
Not to mention the alliance was decided by the previous king.

494
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I am really glad to meet Princess Pingyuan once again.

495
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,400
But, Your Highness, your request...

496
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,019
I cannot help you with your request.

497
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,159
Other than that, I will gladly do anything for you.

498
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,799
Brother!

499
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:19,399
Bao Na!

500
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,460
All right, that's enough.

501
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:29,919
Prince of Chuan and Princess Ma, the tribute you sent me has brought me great joy.

502
00:36:29,919 --> 00:36:33,159
Your joy is what Jin wishes.

503
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:35,719
Very well!

504
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:41,359
King!

505
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,560
King!

506
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,140
Lord Bo.

507
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:50,819
I cannot join you for the lunch banquet.

508
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,899
Another day, perhaps.

509
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:55,040
My King, why?

510
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,498
Because my brother is going to have lunch with Princess Pingyuan.

511
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,259
Did you want to be their follow-along?

512
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,259
Why not?

513
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:06,480
If the king doesn't mind, Youzhen and I will attend.

514
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,879
Good! Very good!

515
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:12,579
Since Lord Bo doesn't mind, then let's have lunch together.

516
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:13,959
But–

517
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,360
Brother–

518
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:21,299
Lord Bo is even more brazen than me.

519
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,420
You–

520
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:35,498
Brother, why must we join them to embarrass ourselves?

521
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:38,960
You clearly knew Bao Na would make it difficult for us.

522
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,580
There is no reward without risks.

523
00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:49,158
I never thought that even after years, we would still have the chance to meet again, Princess Pingyuan.

524
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:52,099
My wish has finally come true.

525
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:54,779
Your Highess, to your health.

526
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,799
Everyone, cheers.

527
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:16,979
My King, do you remember this?

528
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:42,280
So the painter Chu Zhen didn't lie to me.

529
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,980
Brother,

530
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:48,000
what is this secret between you and the princess?

531
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:56,098
Bao Na, this dagger was our father's precious belonging.

532
00:38:56,098 --> 00:38:59,839
I left Qitan as a child of the previous dynasty.

533
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,580
Father gave me this dagger of his.

534
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,539
And before I returned home, I wanted to present this dagger to Princess Pingyuan.

535
00:39:12,419 --> 00:39:17,760
But unfortunately on the day I left...

536
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,999
Where is the Princess?

537
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,240
The Queen Dowager summoned her.

538
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,479
Who are you?

539
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:28,679
Who are you?

540
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:32,220
Why is a man inside the princess' palace?

541
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,800
I am Chu Zhen the painter. I'm here to draw her a portrait.

542
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,418
I want to see Princess Pingyuan's portrait.

543
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,319
I can finally see her face.

544
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,940
You haven't finished it.

545
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,379
It's almost done.

546
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,700
Come here tomorrow at the same hour. The portrait will be ready.

547
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,178
I can't wait that long.

548
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:56,719
I'm leaving the palace today. I'm going home.

549
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,839
Chu Zhen, will you please hand this dagger to the princess for me?

550
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,779
This is my parting gift for her.

551
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,179
Sure, I will.

552
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,200
Prince Yelu!

553
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,019
Where are you?

554
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,880
- The carriage is ready!
- I have to go now.

555
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,299
Little Prince,

556
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:17,919
although the portrait isn't complete,

557
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:21,099
but if you miss the princess, have a look at usnea herb.

558
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:23,620
That is her favorite plant.

559
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:29,579
But sadly, if we ever pass by each other on the street,

560
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,320
I won't recognize her.

561
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,738
Surely you can remember the bracelet on her right wrist.

562
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:35,360
A jade of three shades.

563
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,978
It's a token from the royal family.

564
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:39,139
That should help you recognize her.

565
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,740
All right.

566
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,779
I must thank the painter, Chu Zhen.

567
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:49,240
Thanks to him I learned that you like the usnea herb.

568
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,559
Your Highness,

569
00:40:56,559 --> 00:41:00,240
where is your bracelet?

570
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,159
I was carrying the dagger when I fled.

571
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:08,619
I must have dropped the bracelet somewhere.

572
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,680
So it was your doing, again.

573
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,760
My King,

574
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,501
the State Priest sent me here to inform you and the princess,

575
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,621
so you could be ready to set out for the ancestry shrine on Mu Ye Mountain.

576
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,379
Look at me.

577
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,160
I almost forgot about my duties.

578
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,139
Your Highness,

579
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,159
please excuse me.

580

581
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Bao Na, come with me.

- Safe journey, My King.
- Safe journey, My King.

583
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:50,359
Safe journey, My King.

584
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,719
Your Highness,

585
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:01,700
allow the prince and I to escort you back to the tent.

586
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,059
Very well.

587
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,919
You seem eager to leave.

588
00:42:08,919 --> 00:42:12,540
Are you too scared to be in the same room as me?

589
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:14,959
You are in Qitan.

590
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:18,680
Lord Bo, are you planning to take the princess' life to silence her?
