00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,790
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,070
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,160
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,230
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,940
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,060
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,840
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,969
[Episode 42]

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,518
I will replace him.

22
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:40,560
Your wish is my command, Prince of Bo.

23
00:01:58,839 --> 00:01:59,918
Hurry up! He's here!

24
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,940
Get ready!

25
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,419
Our whole family was killed by Chu Kui!

26
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,679
Since a son should pay for his father's debt, you can die instead of him!

27
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,438
Chief Warden, the riot inside has ended for now.

28
00:02:22,438 --> 00:02:24,359
It's almost done. Open the gate.

29
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,760
Yes.

30
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:40,479
All of you are animals!

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,119
How dare you punish our Prince of Bo illegally?

32
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,280
Besides Prince of Bo,

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,800
all the war slaves are to go out and get yourselves whipped tonight!

34
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,260
They didn't punish me.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,400
Prince of Bo, what's wrong with you?

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Why do you side with these slaves?

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,519
I heard everything when they beat you up.

38
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:11,719
This is the medicine you asked me to prepare.

39
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,420
Right?

40
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,840
You despicable man.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,780
You didn't fight back because you wanted to frame us.

42
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,758
I'm going out.

43
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:26,860
Stop Prince of Bo.

44
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:34,119
The others, you don't understand me

45
00:03:34,119 --> 00:03:37,100
or don't you want to live anymore?

46
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,638
- Quick!
- Get out!

47
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,558
Stand up! Why are you spacing out?

48
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:42,179
Can't you understand?

49
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:44,420
- Hurry up! Go out!
- Stop dilly-dallying!

50
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,700
Do you want to be whipped some more?

51
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,859
- Quick!
- Move!

52
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,039
Move! Quick!

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,919
You should thank me.

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,860
If I didn't get here on time, you would've been beaten to death.

55
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,820
I couldn't repay what I owe you.

56
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,019
I couldn't compensate for what they've lost, too.

57
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,279
What am I doing all of this for?

58
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:45,640
Prince of Yun's soldiers are guarding outside the camp.

59
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,059
I couldn't hear what Prince of Yun and Gu Ten talked about.

60
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,519
Yun Wang distracted me on purpose

61
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,220
because he wanted Gu Teng to make a move on Prince of Bo.

62
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,118
Prince of Yun used investigating the epidemic as a reason at first

63
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:07,518
to stop Mistress from interfering with Prince of Bo's matters.

64
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,120
Now, he is scheming to kill Prince of Bo.

65
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,439
- Why don't we inform His Majesty and say—
- No.

66
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,740
That is too rash.

67
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,939
First of all, we have no evidence.

68
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,500
Also, if there are any mistakes,

69
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,739
it will be hard for us to gain Prince of Yun's trust in the future.

70
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,299
Did anything happen at the capital?

71
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:33,680
It is quiet over Princess Consort Chuchu's place.

72
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,380
There's just one thing that sticks out.

73
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,359
The citizens of Imperial Capital were talking about warrior wolves escaping in groups.

74
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,000
They also said that

75
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,819
Prince of Bo was the one who controlled the warrior wolves to get revenge on His Majesty.

76
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,399
This is Prince of Yun's aim of spreading the rumors.

77
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,400
To His Majesty, he will have no choice

78
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,678
but to kill Prince of Bo even if he doesn't want to.

79
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,999
Mistress, the rumors are spreading fast.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,500
How should we clarify the truth?

81
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,319
It's too late.

82
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,178
Even you are out of ideas.

83
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,600
Prince of Bo will surely be dead this time.

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,078
I have to trouble you for tonight.

85
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:16,719
Just make do with this place.

86
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,040
It's no trouble at all.

87
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,620
We should keep a low profile anyway.

88
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,359
You bought information about Qiannu Camp from the bounty hunter?

89
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,159
The Qiannu Camp is heavily guarded.

90
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,639
It's more difficult to enter or exit it than going up to the sky.

91
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,260
We have to first find someone called Master Zhaoliu.

92
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,958
Rumor says that he loves money.

93
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,500
Looks like we have to spend some money

94
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,980
and pay him to bring us inside.

95
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,360
Be careful.

96
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,398
Robbery!

97
00:07:52,398 --> 00:07:57,019
Take... out... all your... money.

98
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,459
Trying to be a robber

99
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,820
when you don't even know your own capabilities?

100
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,959
Please spare our lives!

101
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,519
- Mister, please spare our lives!
- We had no choice!

102
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,960
Miss, please spare us!

103
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,318
Please spare our lives...

104
00:08:17,318 --> 00:08:18,719
Please spare our lives...

105
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,159
All of you are farmers, right?

106
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:24,439
Why are you not farming and have become robbers instead?

107
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,078
Don't mention that again.

108
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,479
All our harvest for this year was submitted to the court.

109
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,398
Robbers are everywhere.

110
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,300
We have nothing else to eat.

111
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,478
According to my knowledge, they have experienced a drought for the past few years.

112
00:08:41,478 --> 00:08:43,719
The citizens have lived a tough life.

113
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,379
They finally had a harvest this year but

114
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,239
it was collected as food for the officials.

115
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:52,499
- They have no choice but to rebel.
- Don't cry, my child.

116
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:57,879
What are you doing?

117
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,798
I've not eaten anything for days.

118
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,359
I have nothing to feed him.

119
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,338
I'm giving him my blood.

120
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:10,839
At least he won't cry of hunger.

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,539
- Don't cry, my child.
- Take this money.

122
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:28,219
It should be enough for your family to live for half a year.

123
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:30,320
- Thank you, Warrior.
- Thank you, Warrior.

124
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,199
- Thank you, Miss.
- Thank you, Miss.

125
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,620
Thank you, Miss.

126
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,918
Stand up and leave this place.

127
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,818
Thank you.

128
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:39,399
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

129
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,680
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,600
Let's go.

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,299
Don't cry, my child.

132
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,159
Let's buy something to eat.

133
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,798
Yes. We can buy food now.

134
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,959
Be nice, my child.

135
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,078
Let's go. Let's go.

136
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,019
I didn't expect the people here to live such a difficult life.

137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,919
How many nice citizens who abide by the law

138
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:13,040
have become that tyrant's sacrifice?

139
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,500
For these innocent people,

140
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,819
we have to end the war as soon as possible.

141
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,880
Looks like persuading Prince of Bo to ally with us is a must.

142
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,519
Ji Chong, did you notice it?

143
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,379
Ever since we came here,

144
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:35,340
we have been avoiding busy markets and crowds intentionally.

145
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,078
Yet we still often hear rumors about Prince of Bo controlling the warrior wolves to kill.

146
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,279
For the rumors to spread so fast,

147
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,239
I'm afraid someone is behind this.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,880
Prince of Bo's current situation is more dangerous than we expected,

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,000
but he knows nothing about it.

150
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,239
Just like Wolf Boy in the past.

151
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:09,080
Wolf Boy went down the mountain in the past because of you.

152
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:15,200
The current Prince of Bo might've already been feeling dejected and just allowing others to manipulate him.

153
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,319
Please help me get justice!
[Selling myself to bury my brother]

154
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
When Prince of Bo just reached the Qiannu Camp,

155
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,818
my brother was bitten to death by his warrior wolves!

156
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:29,880
- I'm sure he manipulated the warrior wolves to kill the innocent!
- Selling himelf to bury his brother?

157
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,339
- Please help me!
- Kid.

158
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:32,879
What's going on?

159
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,598
My only elder brother was bitten to death

160
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,779
by Prince of Bo's warrior wolves!

161
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:41,199
Prince of Bo can really control the warrior wolves.

162
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,759
Someone got bitten by warrior wolves when he appeared at the Qiannu Camp.

163
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:48,119
His Majesty should've killed Prince of Bo to prevent all this.

164
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,859
Yes. As long as Prince of Bo lives, we might even be the next to be killed.

165
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,459
See?

166
00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:57,999
Humans are so easy to be fooled.

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,200
He harmed the innocent!

168
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,598
I beg all of you!

169
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,678
I've sent Grand Diviner away.

170
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,459
Warden Gu, you can arrange the next step now.

171
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,480
Let Prince of Bo suffer completely beyond redemption.

172
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,599
Yes, Your Highness.

173
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,999
Prince of Bo is killing the innocent!

174
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,180
We are finally at the Qiannu Camp after traveling for so long.

175
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,258
According to the information I bought, Master Zhaoliu should be living in this town.

176
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:32,560
But he looks just like a kid in the portrait.

177
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,238
Why is he calling himself "Master?"

178
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,939
He's so arrogant.

179
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,759
Whatever.

180
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,141
As long as he is willing to help us.

181
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,459
Don't worry.

182
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,360
No matter how difficult he is,

183
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,500
no one can match me when I'm arrogant.

184
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,199
I beg all of you!

185
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,519
Pity me!

186
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,499
My brother died an innocent death.

187
00:12:58,499 --> 00:13:03,900
- I beg you all to give me justice!
- Ji Chong, do you not find this town's aura a bit weird?

188
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:08,718
It's daytime but there are no merchants and people around.

189
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,719
There are also soldiers patrolling.

190
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:12,680
Did something happen?

191
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:15,699
- It's weird.
- Give Prince of Bo the death penalty!

192
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:19,658
Don't let any more innocent people die an innocent death like my brother!

193
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,860
There's a child there. Let's go and ask him.

194
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,838
I lived together with my brother,

195
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:28,240
but Prince of Bo controlled the warrior wolves

196
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,180
to bite my brother to death.

197
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,238
Sir, Miss, please pity me.

198
00:13:35,239 --> 00:13:39,620
My brother was bitten to death by the warrior wolves!

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,040
You are Master Zhaoliu?

200
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,559
That's right.

201
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,739
I am Zhao Liuye.

202
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:05,459
Who are you? What do you want?

203
00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:10,179
You are Zhao Liuye and not Master Zhaoliu?

204
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,019
Looks like something's wrong with the information we bought.

205
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,678
You said your brother was bitten to death by the warrior wolves.

206
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,099
What do you mean?

207
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:22,678
There are wolf monsters appearing within 300 Li of Qiannu Camp.

208
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,399
That is why no one dares to come out anymore.

209
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,958
Nonsense! There are no wolf monsters in this world!

210
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,879
You are not from this town.

211
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,678
How can you be so sure?

212
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,019
Besides, you are not the one who decides whether the wolf monster exists.

213
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:36,880
Of course I know!

214
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,940
Zhaixing, let me talk to him.

215
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,920
Brother Liuye,

216
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,478
we have something to trouble you.

217
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,818
Who is your brother?

218
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,780
I hate it when people pretend to be close to me.

219
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,500
Zhao Liuye, let's make a deal.

220
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,999
Take us to Prince of Bo.

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,519
Prince of Bo?

222
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,358
Take us inside the Qiannu Camp.

223
00:14:58,359 --> 00:15:00,200
When we see Prince of Bo,

224
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:05,980
the money here will all be yours.

225
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,639
What is your relationship with Prince of Bo?

226
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,040
He is my enemy.

227
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,358
But he has something important on him.

228
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:14,080
I have to get it.

229
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:18,378
Do you think the Qiannu Camp is a place where you can come and go as you please?

230
00:15:18,378 --> 00:15:22,999
Besides, I won't even be alive to spend that money.

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,919
This is a job that only fools will accept.

232
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,819
You brat!

233
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,479
Zhao Liuye, your father is Zhao Jiu.

234
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:35,759
He was part of the vanguard of the Bo Army.

235
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,519
He disobeyed Prince of Bo's orders and was sent to the Qiannu Camp.

236
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,818
You have an elder brother who died in the Bo Army's camp a few years ago.

237
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,300
You have no other siblings.

238
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,358
So, who is this elder brother that you are trying to bury?

239
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,519
You investigated me?

240
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,358
Know your enemies well to win the battles.

241
00:15:54,359 --> 00:15:59,660
But that is actually too much just to defeat a kid like you,

242
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,259
but we don't really care to achieve our goals.

243
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:04,939
Zhao Liuye,

244
00:16:05,599 --> 00:16:07,739
if you don't help us,

245
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:10,879
we have no choice but to expose you to the Qiannu Camp's Chief Warden

246
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,839
and tell him that Zhao Jiu is your father.

247
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,640
I believe you will never see your father again.

248
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,799
I'll help you!

249
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,780
That's more like it.

250
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:23,558
What's the hurry?

251
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,980
The circumstances have changed.

252
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,079
This money will be yours once you've helped us.

253
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,439
Why are there adults like you who act like rascals?

254
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,660
So we can deal with kids like you who act like rascals.

255
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,879
Rascal.

256
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,300
Thanks for your praise.

257
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,158
When will you bring us to Prince of Bo?

258
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,478
The earlier you get it done, the earlier you will get your money.

259
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,280
What do you think?

260
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,279
We can see all of the Qiannu Camp from here.

261
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,139
Prince of Bo is over there.

262
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,100
Stay close to the one before you!

263
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,380
Work hard once you are full!

264
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,419
If you didn't tell me,

265
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,359
I wouldn't have recognized Prince of Bo.

266
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,799
What are they eating?

267
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,320
Leftovers that are a few days old.

268
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:29,438
Quick! You'll be working once you've finished eating!

269
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:30,478
Don't slack off!

270
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,478
Li Qian, you were wounded by the blast yesterday.

271
00:17:32,479 --> 00:17:34,719
You are heavily injured. Rest here.

272
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,799
Gu Teng won't see you. Be quiet.

273
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,340
Water.

274
00:17:49,239 --> 00:17:51,039
Water.

275
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,839
Water.

276
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,760
Military Protector Zhao is really nice.

277
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,519
Why are you hiding here?

278
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,879
Everyone is working.

279
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,598
How dare you slack off here?

280
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:31,899
Stand up! Stand!

281
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,600
Uncle Qiang!

282
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:39,199
Come over here, everyone!

283
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:44,679
Li Qiang.

284
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,820
How dare you.

285
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,479
You dare to slack off?

286
00:18:51,479 --> 00:18:53,919
Tell me. Who covered for you?

287
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,759
Chief Warden, I was injured yesterday.

288
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,240
I truly can't work anymore.

289
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
I have my own ways to make you speak the truth.

290
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,418
Tell me the accomplices who covered for you and you won't be punished.

291
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,958
None.

292
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:19,279
I have no accomplices, Chief Warden.

293
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:21,400
I have no accomplices.

294
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,780
Take off his clothes.

295
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,559
Don't be rash.

296
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,159
- Li Qiang is protecting us.
- Chief Warden!

297
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,698
- It will only make things worse if you go up there.
 - Chief Warden, I have no accomplices!

298
00:19:33,698 --> 00:19:36,799
If Gu Teng punishes us, none of us will escape.

299
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:37,919
Focus on the overall situation.

300
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,999
Tell us your accomplices.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,760
Chief Warden, I have no accomplices.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,620
Since you value your friendship,

303
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,339
I will grant your wish.

304
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:56,140
I let him rest.

305
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,580
Why is it him?

306
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,380
Exactly.

307
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,279
Why is he so nice?

308
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,919
- I'm sure he is pretending.
- He is pretending to lie to us.

309
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,998
He is pretending to lie to us.

310
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:07,999
Seems like I was too nice to you

311
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,800
and made you forget your place.

312
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,260
A slave disobeying his master.

313
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,199
I can punish you heavily.

314
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,858
I will brand the "slave" word on your body

315
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:25,339
so you will always be reminded of your own identity.

316
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:34,118
Chief Warden Gu, if you don't brand him today, you will be embarrassed.

317
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,778
- Right?
- Yes! Brand him!

318
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,650
Brand him!

319
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,610
Brand him!

320
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,440
Are you still pretending?

321
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,958
Brand him! Do it!

322
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,299
- Brand him!
- Is this all an act?

323
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:48,960
Hurry up!

324
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:57,170
Great!

325
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,259
Great!

326
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,399
That's so satisfying!

327
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:06,598
Yes! That's so satisfying!

328
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,939
It's so satisfying to see Prince of Bo suffer.

329
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:11,179
Right?

330
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,060
Great!

331
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,419
Aren't you Prince of Bo? You did well in branding him!

332
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,580
You are capable, Prince of Bo.

333
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,420
You didn't even squeal.

334
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,399
He will finish all the hard work today.

335
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,759
Don't return to camp before you finish!

336
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,799
Great!

337
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,000
Great! Great!

338
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:28,479
Looks like Prince of Bo has really changed.

339
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,300
Are you really enemies with Prince of Bo?

340
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,499
Why the long face when you see him suffer?

341
00:22:36,499 --> 00:22:37,940
You know nothing.

342
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,940
We are speechless because we are too happy.

343
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,159
Prince of Bo is doing all the slaves' work alone.

344
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,400
He will never finish everything by nightfall.

345
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
Looks like they are really trying to make him suffer.

346
00:22:57,699 --> 00:22:59,680
Quick!

347
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,440
It's so satisfying!

348
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,039
Let me tell you. Bo...

349
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,800
No, that beast.

350
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,780
Didn't he suffer at the quarry today?

351
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,500
When he got back at night, Gu Teng didn't even allow him to eat

352
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,438
and just shut him in the confinement room.

353
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,339
Great!

354
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,139
That's what he deserves!

355
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,359
Why do I feel guilty somehow?

356
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:56,859
What did you say?

357
00:23:58,439 --> 00:23:59,679
Let me tell you.

358
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,660
You can pity anyone for all I care,

359
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,060
but don't forget who that person is.

360
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,560
That is Prince of Bo.

361
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,319
Keep your pity to yourself.

362
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:16,078
Don't forget. He was crueler to us than Gu Teng.

363
00:24:16,078 --> 00:24:17,539
Right, Military Protector Zhao?

364
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,540
Right, everyone?

365
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,639
Yes! Exactly!

366
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,519
Exactly!

367
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,439
Military Protector Zhao,

368
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,380
are you pitying that monster as well?

369
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,319
I'm thinking why did he save Li Qiang.

370
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:35,379
This is totally unrelated to him.

371
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:38,019
Who knows what tricks Gu Teng and he are playing?

372
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,720
I think this is not as simple as it seems.

373
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,879
Gu Teng is obviously targeting Prince of Bo.

374
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:50,160
I suspect that Gu Teng intentionally framed him

375
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,300
for what happened previously.

376
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,920
Military Protector Zhao!

377
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,820
I don't care whether he did it without thinking

378
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,159
or felt compassionate suddenly.

379
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,599
Think about it. What can he make up for?

380
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:03,318
Think about it, Military Protector Zhao.

381
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:04,438
What did Chu Kui do to you?

382
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,420
What did he do to us?

383
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,180
What did he do to everyone? Am I right?

384
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,540
That's right!

385
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,118
Don't forget how your eldest son died!

386
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,279
He is the one who destroyed our family!

387
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,059
Why should we trust him?

388
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:18,920
You are right.

389
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,940
A person doing something good suddenly for once

390
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,759
can't prove anything.

391
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,919
Exactly.

392
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,039
Military Protector Zhao,

393
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,539
thank you for the water you left me.

394
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,720
This water flask is not mine.

395
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,358
Why are you looking at me?

396
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,059
It's not mine, either.

397
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,980
Don't tell me it's his?

398
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,699
I didn't expect only after losing everything

399
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:12,499
would I truly begin my redemption.

400
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,940
I can finally become the Wolf Boy in your heart step by step.

401
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,639
According to Gu Teng's habit, the slaves who talk back to him

402
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,958
will have to spend the night in the confinement room.

403
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,459
Make him serve as a warning to others.

404
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,679
The confinement room is behind the wood shack.

405
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,879
There's a small window.

406
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,619
Both of you can see Prince of Bo through there.

407
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,460
The information we got from the bounty hunter is exactly the same.

408
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,739
Gu Teng will go out every 15th of the month to have fun.

409
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,479
He won't return to the camp the whole night.

410
00:26:52,479 --> 00:26:53,821
Although Gu Teng is not here,

411
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:56,358
both of you only have two and a half minutes.

412
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,580
Not a second more.

413
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,999
I didn't expect a brat like you to be decent when you are working.

414
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,159
Compared to an old rascal, a brat is more useful. Right?

415
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,139
Am I right, Sister?

416
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,119
You brat. Can't I say anything?

417
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:12,358
- I—
- Stop it!

418
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,999
Let's get to work.

419
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,099
Liu'er, why are you here so late at night?

420
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:28,980
Who are these two?

421
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,279
Brother, I heard that Warden Gu was complaining about his cold bathing water last night.

422
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,519
I think that it might be a lack of firewood.

423
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,159
So, I went to cut a cart full of firewood today.

424
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,358
Hence, coming this late.

425
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,318
Both of them are my relatives.

426
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,639
They are staying at my house these past days.

427
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,219
I got them to help me.

428
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,919
You are a smart kid.

429
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,039
All right. Go in.

430
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,999
All right.

431
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,660
- Thank you, Brother.
- Open the gate!

432
00:28:00,439 --> 00:28:02,919
Prince of Bo will surely be in the confinement room tonight.

433
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,039
Hurry up.

434
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,820
I'll keep watch at the wood shack.

435
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,560
Be quick.

436
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,159
A princess of the previous dynasty

437
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,279
risking her life to come to the enemy's country.

438
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,580
Are you here to see a joke,

439
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,480
or are you here for revenge?

440
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,359
Prince of Chuan is near, right?

441
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,219
How did you know?

442
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,420
He will not allow you to do

443
00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:28,119
such a dangerous thing alone foolishly.

444
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,499
Idiot.

445
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:34,519
If I shout, you will be shot immediately.

446
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,220
Do you know that?

447
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,580
Prince of Bo, please stop being hostile.

448
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,200
I know everything about the War of Boxiang.

449
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,539
What did you find out?

450
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,679
Because of Crown Prince's death,

451
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:53,360
you decided to rebel at Boxiang with Chu Youzhen.

452
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,559
You abducted me to protect yourself

453
00:29:55,559 --> 00:29:58,259
and were banished to the Qiannu Camp to await your death.

454
00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:01,039
I've observed you for a whole day.

455
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,560
You have become different.

456
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,358
Now, you must know what Chu Kui is really like

457
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:09,520
and will not help him anymore.

458
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
Did you risk your life

459
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,679
just to tell me all this nonsense?

460
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,260
I risked my life to come here

461
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,970
to advise Prince of Bo to let go of your grudge temporarily

462
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:25,100
and become Jin's ally.

463
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,859
Help us overthrow Chu Kui's tyranny.

464
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:29,119
I'm afraid you've wasted your time.

465
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:33,260
I never thought of leaving since I entered this place.

466
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,200
Paying for my sins and waiting for my death here is the end that I deserve.

467
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,940
Leave.

468
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,159
If you want to redeem yourself, why don't you ally with Jin

469
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,559
and save more lives from the persecutions of war?

470
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,700
Are you crazy?

471
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,900
How can a person who is sick and injured like me save lives?

472
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,219
If you don't care about those lives, why did you

473
00:30:59,219 --> 00:31:01,319
stand up for those unrelated war slaves?

474
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:04,019
That is not the Prince of Bo I knew.

475
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,259
Don't be foolish.

476
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:14,919
Trying to be a hero and your ideals are very far apart.

477
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:19,699
The people around here are suffering and living a miserable life.

478
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:22,060
Even the people you cared about here at the Qiannu Camp

479
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,540
are also living in a tormenting situation.

480
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,200
You are the accomplice who caused this situation.

481
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,000
You clearly know that

482
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,679
these war criminals in Qiannu Camp will still die in the future,

483
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,040
no matter how much you help them.

484
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,800
Chu Youzhen failed in his rebellion and his life is in danger.

485
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:44,700
There's only one way to save the people you care about.

486
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,180
If you are willing to help Jin,

487
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,260
you can reduce the casualties.

488
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,000
Perhaps, we can fight a war without bloodshed.

489
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,139
We can also realize Crown Prince's unfulfilled dream.

490
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,019
A peaceful world.

491
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,480
Chu Kui loves to fight.

492
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,219
The King of Jin hates evildoers.

493
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,759
How can we have a war between both sides without bloodshed?

494
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:17,259
But the King of Jin was the one who asked me to save you.

495
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,339
You hate yourself for all the people you've killed

496
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,179
and I've seen too much bloodshed.

497
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:28,700
If a war breaks out,

498
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,019
none of us can stay out of this.

499
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,480
We might even lose the person that we care about the most.

500
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,560
Prince of Bo,

501
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,440
you have someone you'd protect with your life. Right?

502
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,219
You must have someone you care for.

503
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,800
Leave.

504
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:08,660
We have our own destinies.

505
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,119
I'm just a monster.

506
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,420
How can I fight my fate?

507
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,760
Since I've come here to Qiannu Camp,

508
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,680
I will then never leave.

509
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,519
Even more, I will not help the King of Jin

510
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,040
to fight with Chu Kui for the world's reign.

511
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,379
Are you content to be trapped here, humiliated by a vile person,

512
00:33:28,379 --> 00:33:30,979
and be seen as a monster for life?

513
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,880
Prince of Bo, you are not a monster.

514
00:33:39,699 --> 00:33:41,719
You are human.

515
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:43,919
Get lost!

516
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll call someone if you don't leave!

517
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,058
Time's up. Let's go.

518
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,358
Gu Teng is coming back soon!

519
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:03,598
Let's go!

520
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,180
Otherwise, none of us will be able to leave.

521
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,999
Let's go!

522
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,920
This is an ointment and a fire striker.

523
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:33,080
Within three days, if you change your mind,

524
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,380
you can send a signal with the fire striker.

525
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:39,120
Ji Chong and I will rescue you.

526
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,700
Rescue?

527
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,398
Liars!

528
00:35:39,399 --> 00:35:41,859
Both of you are here to rescue Prince of Bo!

529
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,400
- Liu'er.
- Liu'er.

530
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,419
Liu'er.

531
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,119
We didn't lie to you on purpose.

532
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:13,580
We didn't tell you the truth because we don't want you to get involved.

533
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,679
Zhaixing, forget about him.

534
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,178
You should be hungry. Come and eat something.

535
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:24,500
Ji Chong, come and apologize.

536
00:36:25,399 --> 00:36:26,999
Quick.

537
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,660
Why should I apologize to a kid?

538
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,739
Besides, we didn't really plan to lie to him.

539
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:39,319
Kid, to be honest, we are from Jin.

540
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:41,760
Isn't it obvious that we are the enemies of Prince of Bo?

541
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,039
We didn't lie about that.

542
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:43,958
Liars!

543
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:46,599
You said some very important item of yours is with Prince of Bo.

544
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,139
You have to take it back. Isn't that lying?

545
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,039
I do have something important that I have to get back.

546
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,718
That is Prince of Bo's heart.

547
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:55,740
Do you think it's easy to get that?

548
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:59,338
Ji Chong, don't cause trouble.

549
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:06,478
Liu'er, it's our fault for not telling you the truth.

550
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:08,159
Sorry.

551
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,760
Zhaixing, why do you keep apologizing to him?

552
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,299
Isn't he a liar, too?

553
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:16,878
I think the rumors spreading around town

554
00:37:16,879 --> 00:37:21,339
saying Prince of Bo can control the warrior wolves was started by him.

555
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,039
- Stop it.
- Yes! I said it!

556
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:27,339
I didn't lie. He is a monster.

557
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:29,479
Prince of Bo is not a monster.

558
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,878
You used rumors to make him a monster.

559
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:34,399
He also didn't control the warrior wolves to kill.

560
00:37:34,399 --> 00:37:36,158
He was Chu Kui's adopted son.

561
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,719
Chu Kui is the one who destroyed my family!

562
00:37:40,339 --> 00:37:43,339
But you shouldn't create rumors.

563
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:47,339
When I was a child,

564
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:51,120
I also created rumors to protect someone.

565
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,599
In the end, the rumors didn't protect him

566
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:58,700
and harmed more people instead.

567
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,920
That's your problem. Get out!

568
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,460
- Liu'er.
- Get out!

569
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,840
- Get out!
- Liu'er!
- Stop it!

570
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,479
I don't want to see you both. Get out now!

571
00:38:08,479 --> 00:38:10,880
- Liu'er!
- Leave!

572
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,560
Liu'er, you might not believe this

573
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,878
but rumors can really kill someone.

574
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:19,638
I don't want you to make a mistake and regret it later on!

575
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:20,839
Leave!

576
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,139
Liu'er! Liu'er, open up!

577
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,740
Listen to me, Liu'er!

578
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,159
- Zhaixing.
- Liu'er!

579
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:27,559
Let's leave for now.

580
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,238
He is currently angry.

581
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,739
He won't listen to anything we say.

582
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,539
Let's come back tomorrow.

583
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,179
Let's go.

584
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,440
Let's go.

585
00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:20,980
Are you thinking if Prince of Bo will change his mind?

586
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:32,079
You once told me that Prince of Bo had given up his butchering blade.

587
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,660
However, seeing a redeeming Lord Bo with my own eyes

588
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,859
is still surprising to me.

589
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,180
But he currently has no will to live and

590
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,539
wants to pay for his sins with his life.

591
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,539
I don't know how Chu Kui treated him.

592
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,040
But he called himself a monster.

593
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,360
It reminded me of Wolf Boy.

594
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,919
Although Chu Kui gave him the status of a prince,

595
00:40:03,919 --> 00:40:08,199
he was never in control of his own life and death.

596
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,199
Although Chu Kui saved him,

597
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:14,240
Chu Kui also treated him like a beast.

598
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,739
He should now be able to see

599
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,919
how he appears to other people.

600
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:24,379
He is not a human nor a wolf,

601
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,900
but a monster instead.

602
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,179
You didn't see him back at Langshou Mountain.

603
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:48,080
His eyes showed happiness and clarity.

604
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,420
He refused to leave the mountain

605
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,940
but I forced him to leave.

606
00:40:55,220 --> 00:41:00,260
Since then, he started to experience the treacherous world.

607
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,979
Now that I think about it,

608
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,439
he was never a monster.

609
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,139
The real monster was Chu Kui.

610
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:15,859
Chu Kui made him a monster to satisfy his desires.

611
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,299
We still have a chance to change his fate.

612
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:26,579
You were willing to temporarily put down your grudge.

613
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:29,339
I hope that Prince of Bo stops holding on to his opinions

614
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:31,420
and comes to our side.

615
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:45,920
After three days, if we can't get Prince of Bo's signal,

616
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,040
we will return to Jin.

617
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,720
I can't allow you to be in danger for too long.
