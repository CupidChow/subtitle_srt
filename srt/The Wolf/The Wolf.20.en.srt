[Episode 20]

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,739
I have an idea!

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,080
Just like when we were kids, we can hide ourselves under capes.

23
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,580
What do you think?

24
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,559
Isn't this Feudal Lord Li?

25
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:46,379
Hello, Feudal Lord Li.

26
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:48,419
Go! Go away!

27
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,400
What is he up to?

28
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,960
Had I known how hard it was to be a sentry,

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,240
I would have raised the salary of soldiers at the city gates.

[Low-grade garrison, Feudal Lord Li]

00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:08,979
Wait. No...

33
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,920
What is she doing with a strange man?

34
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,159
Here's my chance to redeem myself.

35
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,660
Stop there!

36
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,270
Feudal Lord Li?

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,029
Why is it you?

38
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:38,110
Why are you guarding the city gate?

39
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,668
Young Mistress, under broad daylight,

40
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:44,010
you're actually cheating on Prince of Bo behind his back!

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,109
You're being unfaithful by committing adultery!

42
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,970
I really cannot let this slide so idly.

43
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:53,449
Today, I'm going to arrest both of you and condemn you in front of Prince of Bo!

44
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,508
Lord Li, since we're both citizens of Kuizhou,

45
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,530
can't you just keep it a secret?

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,829
Besides, you've seen it with your own eyes before.

47
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,239
Prince of Bo doesn't love me at all.

48
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,079
So, can't you just let me find another love?

49
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,381
Young Mistress, honestly...

50
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:18,580
Well, I know Prince of Bo is kind of mean to you.

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,738
That day when he had Miss Lufu come over right in front of you,

52
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,939
I was outraged on your behalf as well.

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,309
However, that's not a reason for you to cheat on him!

54
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:29,889
Today, I'm going to redeem myself,

55
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,928
so that Prince of Bo can take back his order.

56
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,889
In that case, I'll be able to return to my position as this city's leader.

57
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,609
You adulterous couple!

58
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,510
Come! Follow me to see the officials.

59
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,530
Come! Come!

60
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,930
You!

61
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:45,330
Feudal Lord Li.

62
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,790
Your Highness.

63
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,669
Do you really dare to punish me?

64
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,208
I was totally lacking in perception!

65
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:52,488
I deserve the harshest punishment!

66
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:53,848
Please forgive me, Your Highness!

67
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:56,450
Didn't you just give us a big scolding

68
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,549
and call us an adulterous couple?

69
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,349
What a good speech!

70
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,770
Young Feudal Mistress and I have returned to Kuizhou to have an affair. Is there a problem?

71
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,089
No problem!

72
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,729
Go ahead and cheat!

73
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:09,188
No! I've got a foul mouth.

74
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:11,970
I'll strangle myself to death.

75
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,189
I'm strangling. I'm pressing very hard.

76
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,129
- Your Highness, forgive him.
- I'll choke myself to death.

77
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:19,070
I can't breathe.

78
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,910
I'll let it slide this time.

79
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,969
But if you let out the news that Young Mistress and I are back in Kuizhou

80
00:04:24,969 --> 00:04:27,010
to have an affair,

81
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,830
you'll be banished to the border area.

82
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,528
I wouldn't dare. I wouldn't dare.

83
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:33,729
I dare not.

84
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,970
Even if I die, I won't do it.

85
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,810
Wishing you a safe journey!

86
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,009
This isn't right.

87
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:48,129
The... His Highness doesn't like the princess, does he?

88
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:51,309
Why are they so loving now?

89
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,451
You haven't told me yet why Lord Li

90
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,929
was demoted to a garrison soldier.

91
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,430
He mistreated you.

92
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:07,650
So, at that time, although you said mean things to me,

93
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,029
you secretly stood up for me behind my back.

94
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,369
Watch out!

95
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:16,888
Stop running, Hong'er! Hong'er!

96
00:05:16,888 --> 00:05:18,689
Are you okay, Hong'er?

97
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,550
Come back with me and apologize to the guest.

98
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,949
No! They said I look hideous!

99
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,169
Father, you think I'm a monster, too. Right?

100
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,529
Otherwise, you wouldn't have told me not to stay in my room!

101
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,088
That's not what I meant.

102
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:34,630
It's because your temper is getting worse.

103
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,489
Even if the guests take a glance at you with no ill intention,

104
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,088
you'll chase them out with a broom.

105
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:45,489
At this rate, I'll have to close down my business.

106
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,528
Father, I don't want others to look down upon me.

107
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:51,149
I want to bully them before they bully me.

108
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:54,050
This is my philosophy of survival!

109
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,809
Hong'er! Hong'er! Come back!

110
00:05:55,809 --> 00:05:57,029
Don't run away! Hong'er!

111
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,849
The father and daughter are my old acquaintances.

112
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,248
Why did Hong'er's temper change so drastically?

113
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:06,170
I'll go over and see what exactly happened.

114
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,790
She became like this...

115
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,890
because of me.

116
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,629
It got in!

117
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:17,289
Great!

118
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,368
My turn!

119
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:19,889
Queue up!

120
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,291
Quick! Hurry up!

121
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,840
- No!
- My turn!

[Constabulary]

123
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,449
I really regret it.

124

Come again!

125
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:32,309
Back then, I told Hong'er not to believe in the story of Wolf Boy and Xing'er.

126
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,509
What can I do for Hong'er to go back to the way she was before?

127
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,730
I'll definitely hit it next time!

128
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,849
Listen to my instructions later.

129
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:42,990
Let me do it first!

130
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,968
No!

131
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,489
Next!

132
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,688
It's my turn! My turn!

133
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:49,090
Hurry up!

134
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,749
It went in!

135
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:54,330
Hong'er, long time no see!

136
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,269
Sister Zhaixing, why are you here?

137
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,930
This is Brother Wolf Boy.

138
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,649
Why doesn't he show his face?

139
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,089
Does he have an ugly scar on his face like me?

140
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,089
Hong'er, Brother Wolf Boy wants to let you know

141
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,950
that he was once like you.

142
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,989
People misunderstood him and treated him like a monster.

143
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,009
Just like you, he thought setting himself against everyone

144
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,989
would make him powerful enough.

145
00:07:24,989 --> 00:07:28,248
But ever since he was young, he never had any friends.

146
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:30,790
He was friendless and found himself all alone.

147
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,009
He was lonely.

148
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,808
So what if I don't have any friends?

149
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,448
Who needs friends? I can play by myself.

150
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:43,149
You can't do it. Let me try.

151
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:49,869
If I can make them play together with you,

152
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,470
you've got to promise me one thing. Okay?

153
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,649
They won't play with me.

154
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:02,649
Let's go, I need your help.

155
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,010
Come.

156
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,329
Hold it!

157
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,408
Hurry up!

158
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,110
Hurry!

159
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:11,769
My turn!

160
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,470
You can't do it.

161
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,288
Hong'er, we'll play pitch-pot, too!

162
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,929
However, the winner gets to flick the loser on the forehead.

163
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,610
Okay?

164
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,110
Good luck!

165
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,409
Hong'er, you're so great!

166
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,409
Wolf Boy, it's your turn.

167
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:33,829
Don't throw it in.

168
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,129
Hit harder!

169
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,089
Here.

170
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:39,928
Harder!

171
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,430
Right, hit him right here.

172
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:44,969
Children, would you like to play together?

173
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,329
Here. Hold it.

174
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,829
Stand behind me.

175
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:49,529
It went in!

176
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,769
How did you know the kids would want to play with Hong'er?

177
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:03,589
Children have the simplest and most naive thoughts.

178
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:06,330
They don't care about your appearance.

179
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,310
They express their emotions in a straightforward way.

180
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,568
When they see someone who can play games very well,

181
00:09:12,569 --> 00:09:13,928
they'll idolize that person.

182
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,169
Let me try. Let me try.

183
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:20,150
How did you know Hong'er could play pitch-pot?

184
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:23,329
She's just like me when I was young.

185
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,230
She always plays alone.

186
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,589
Hence, we're both experts at one-player games.

187
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:32,871
It got in!

188
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,249
She's very similar to me, too.

189
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:38,568
In this world, we are both being called monsters.

190
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,369
I'll try, too.

191
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,369
Your turn.

192
00:09:43,369 --> 00:09:45,509
It's in!

193
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,849
You two are not monsters.

194
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,289
People often judge a man by his looks.

195
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,310
Hong'er and you are the kindest people

196
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,049
I've ever seen in the world.

197
00:10:00,049 --> 00:10:01,209
You're good.

198
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,630
Brother Wolf Boy, come here!

199
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,009
Brother Wolf Boy!

200
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,368
Hurry! Get over here!

201
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:06,229
Brother Wolf Boy!

202
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:08,529
Hurry! Come here!

203
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,249
You can stop pretending now and show your real skills.

204
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:16,430
Or else, your forehead is going to hurt so much.

205
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,789
- Come over!
- Here.

206
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,769
Flick his forehead! Flick his forehead!

207
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,210
Get down! Hurry up!

208
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,630
Get down.

209
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,230
Hurry!

210
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,870
Missed it.

211
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,850
If you don't want anyone to look down on you, make yourself stronger

212
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,069
and stand above everyone else.

213
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,669
This is the philosophy of survival.

214
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:18,829
Hong'er, it's your turn.

215
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,849
Could it be you were not pretending from the start

216
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,650
and really couldn't aim it?

217
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:28,728
You're Prince of Bo.

218
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,769
Your arrow never misses its target,

219
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,370
but you couldn't even throw the stick into the pot.

220
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,509
Who says a good archer can play this game well?

221
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,610
What are you laughing at?

222
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,850
I won't laugh anymore.

223
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:57,609
Mr. Fang.

224
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,209
Hong'er, where have you been?

225
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,290
I was so worried!

226
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:10,149
Hong'er, what did you promise me on our way back?

227
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:13,409
Father, I'm sorry for being immature.

228
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:16,469
I promise I won't do it again.

229
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:18,629
As long as you behave well,

230
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,890
I'll never get angry at you.

231
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,109
Father, thanks to Sister Zhaixing, I finally made some good friends.

232
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,829
Is that so?

233
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:36,810
Hong'er, don't ever forget what I've told you.

234
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,189
Your scar will help you distinguish between good and bad people.

235
00:12:41,189 --> 00:12:45,728
Those who approach you willingly are sincere towards you.

236
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,928
As for those bad people who bully you, it's simply their fault.

237
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,830
You cannot become like them, do you understand?

238
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,089
Just like Little Wolf, I'll surely find someone like Xing'er

239
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:57,168
who will treat me well and stay with me forever.

240
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,650
Is that right, Sister Zhaixing?

241
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,430
You're so clever, Hong'er.

242
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:04,810
Thank you, Young Feudal Mistress.

243
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,210
Our Hong'er is so well-behaved and mature now.

244
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:14,550
I don't even know how to express my gratitude to you.

245
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,529
How about this?

246
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,130
I'll prepare some dishes for you.

247
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,089
Mr. Fang, it's no big deal.

248
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,589
I've business to tend to and so I've got to leave now.

249
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,670
Take care then.

250
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,210
Take care, too.

251
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,010
Be good.

252
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,168
Goodbye, Sister Zhaixing.

253
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,569
Goodbye.

254
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,990
Farewell, Young Mistress.

255
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,490
Let's go.

256
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,009
The man beside Young Mistress

257
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,128
is Prince of Bo, right?

258
00:13:53,129 --> 00:13:54,409
No, he's not!

259
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,510
Father, he's Brother Wolf Boy.

260
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,289
Who is Brother Wolf Boy?

261
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,089
Although Brother Wolf Boy has been wearing the hood,

262
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,009
I accidentally saw his face several times.

263
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,949
He's the big brother who reserved our entire restaurant

264
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:10,509
and told me not to believe in Little Wolf and Xing'er.

265
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,749
That scary man.

266
00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:19,849
How could Young Mistress be with him?

267
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:44,910
Master. Young Feudal Mistress.

268
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,210
Mo Xiao, why are you here?

269
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,650
I have finally found you two.

270
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,150
Does His Majesty know that I disobeyed him

271
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,589
and revealed my identity as Wolf Boy?

272
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,329
Exactly.

273
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,990
His Majesty is infuriated.

274
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,728
I've purposely come to warn Master.

275
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,970
When you get back to Imperial City, please be extra careful.

276
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,608
I was going to see the emperor after I get back to the capital

277
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,609
and confess everything anyway.

278
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:15,530
Turns out you were just consoling me last night.

279
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,628
I'll enter the palace with you.

280
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:21,010
We'll face the consequences together.

281
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,110
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

282
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:29,090
Let's go back to the palace.

283
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,550
Let's go.

284
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,210
[Ma Manor]

285
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,710
Stop!

286
00:15:37,489 --> 00:15:39,229
I have an urgent matter.

287
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,808
I need to see Young Feudal Mistress right now.

288
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,009
She isn't in the mansion.

289
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,808
- But I just met her.
- Met the Young Feudal Mistress?

290
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:45,649
Met the princess?

291
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:48,729
Beside her stood a dangerous person.

292
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:52,809
Mr. Fang, why have you come here?

293
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:53,849
Adjutant General Ma.

294
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,209
No, General Ma.

295
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,009
I pay respects to General Ma.

296
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,148
What a coincidence.

297
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,649
I just came back to Ma Mansion to run affairs.

298
00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:03,409
You were saying that you met the Young Feudal Mistress.

299
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,469
Has she returned to Kuizhou?

300
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:09,949
General Ma, I'd like to have a word with you.

301
00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,669
General Ma, I saw Young Mistress walking together

302
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,089
with a scary man.

303
00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,069
I'm worried that she might be in danger.

304
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,769
The scary man you speak of most probably is her future husband,

305
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,069
Prince of Bo.

306
00:16:33,249 --> 00:16:35,949
Hong'er recognized the man.

307
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,248
The day when Feudal Lord Ma and his family were murdered,

308
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,509
he was staying at the restaurant.

309
00:16:40,509 --> 00:16:42,549
He had a murderous look

310
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:46,449
and was accompanied by three people in black.

311
00:16:46,489 --> 00:16:48,608
Perhaps they were his subordinates.

312
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,090
They looked extremely suspicious.

313
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,470
If he really was Prince of Bo,

314
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,128
when he came to Kuizhou, why didn't he stay in the Feudal Lord's Mansion,

315
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:03,130
but paid a high price to reserve my restaurant instead?

316
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,130
After the sky went dark that day,

317
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,749
all of them disappeared.

318
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,550
The next day, the murder had happened in Ma Mansion!

319
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,920
I suspect that these people have something

320
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,130
to do with the massacre case!

321
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:27,129
Are you sure Hong'er clearly saw

322
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,209
that he was the scary man who reserved the restaurant?

323
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,229
While Hong'er was playing with the man,

324
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:40,990
she accidentally saw his face under the cloak.

325
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,509
It should be him.

326
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,870
Could she have been mistaken?

327
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,310
Prince of Bo was making a tour in disguise.

328
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,009
He didn't want to be recognized and so he wore a cloak.

329
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,629
This is nothing to be surprised at.

330
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:01,420
General Ma, anyway,

331
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,740
I've a really bad feeling right now.

332
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:14,090
General Ma, you might want to catch up with Young Feudal Mistress to see if she...

333
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,849
That move would be too reckless.

334
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:20,709
If Hong'er was mistaken, treating the subordinates of Prince of Bo

335
00:18:20,709 --> 00:18:24,749
as some unworthy fellows would be a great disrespect!

336
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:30,929
Mr. Fang, how about this?

337
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,329
I'll find a painter to make a portrait of Prince of Bo

338
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,169
so as to clear up your doubt.

339
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,029
Is that okay?

340
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:40,730
Thank you, General Ma.

341
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:43,448
Tomorrow, I'll bring the portrait to the restaurant for you.

342
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,529
We can take the opportunity to get together, too.

343
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:51,989
Don't you worry. The man beside Young Mistress is certainly Prince of Bo.

344
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,448
I know you meant well.

345
00:18:54,449 --> 00:18:57,830
No matter what, I should be thanking you.

346
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,530
Thank you, General Ma.

347
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,009
I'll take my leave now.

348
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,510
Farewell.

349
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,829
Third Prince, His Majesty told me that he felt gloomy and went for a walk.

350
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:22,030
He didn't say when he'll be coming back.

351
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:26,170
Third Prince, please come again tomorrow morning.

352
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,049
I'll stay here and wait for Emperor Father to return.

353
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:31,248
You're dismissed.

354
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:33,550
Yes, Third Prince.

355
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,589
How dare you show your face here?

356
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,630
Are you not afraid that I'll behead you out of rage?

357
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:18,889
Prince of Bo, all these years, I treated you like my own son.

358
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,328
Have I ever wronged you?

359
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,249
But in the end,

360
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:27,149
you repaid me by deceiving me.

361
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,268
- I—
- Let me ask you this.

362
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:33,510
What is the past relationship between you and Ma Zhaixing?

363
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,850
Zhaixing and I have known each other since young.

364
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,729
The murder case of Commandant Xiahou caused a misunderstanding between us for many years.

365
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,369
When we met again,

366
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,210
I saw her as a total stranger.

367
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,370
I never reconsidered our past relationship nor do I have a soft spot for her.

368
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,129
Until not long ago,

369
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,608
she was punished to kneel in the Ancestral Temple.

370
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:01,729
Only then did I discover that she was forced to do so at that time.

371
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:05,369
The old injury in her leg was caused by me.

372
00:21:06,089 --> 00:21:08,009
I owe her.

373
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,070
I admit,

374
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,950
the reason I went to prison for her and treated her well

375
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:18,270
is not only for the sake of your order to placate the Ma Army,

376
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,110
but also because I love Zhaixing.

377
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,670
You finally admit that you have personal reasons for getting close to Ma Zhaixing.

378
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,829
My good son,

379
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:33,070
you truly value affection and friendship!

380
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,910
Emperor Father!

381
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:41,810
I tried to resist and cut off my feelings for her.

382
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,890
But she has found so many ways to show her affection for me

383
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,230
that I was unable to ignore them.

384
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,049
That's why I defied your order and admitted that I was Wolf Boy.

385
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,770
I can't see clearly now.

386
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,590
I was wrong.

387
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,910
One day, if I ask you to kill Ma Zhaixing,

388
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,249
what will you do then?

389
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:23,890
In that case, I've no choice but to follow the order.

390
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,770
Get up!

391
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,670
It seems like Chu Kui has finally let his guard down.

392
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:37,889
Get up.

393
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,970
Do you want to disobey me again?

394
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:49,368
All right.

395
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,950
Get up now. Get up.

396
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,109
Don't worry.

397
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:01,910
So long as Ma Zhaixing and the Ma Family Army

398
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,128
remain faithful to me forever,

399
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,470
I won't put you in a difficult position.

400
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,569
I'm the only one to blame.

401
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,430
I've granted you this marriage

402
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:16,869
and made you move from being unwilling to being trapped in love.

403
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:19,969
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

404
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,669
Prince of Bo,

405
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,690
perhaps I will have to make things difficult for you again.

406
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,350
Present it to him.

407
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,449
An informant I planted on Ma Fengcheng

408
00:23:46,449 --> 00:23:49,910
has sent me a secret letter.

409
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,689
The father and daughter from the restaurant in Kuizhou must be killed.

410
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:01,189
Night Fiends gave themselves away in the restaurant.

411
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:04,968
The owner noticed that they were the people who stayed in the restaurant

412
00:24:04,969 --> 00:24:07,710
the day the whole family was killed.

413
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:15,030
Ma Fengcheng didn't get suspicious, but you cannot leave any evidence

414
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,489
on the part of the owner.

415
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,269
It's my fault.

416
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:22,049
This matter touches upon the truth behind Ma Ying's death.

417
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,930
You must deal with it yourself so that I can be at ease.

418
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:30,970
A little owner can totally ignite a firestorm.

419
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:35,550
You mustn't let the family see Ma Fengcheng again.

420
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:39,449
This is the most reliable way.

421
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:41,449
I'll do as instructed.

422
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:50,848
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

423
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:54,328
Third Prince accepted the mission without any hesitation.

424
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,769
Even though he has feelings for Ma Zhaixing,

425
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,910
it didn't affect his loyalty to you.

426
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,890
What is wrong?

427
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,089
Your Highness, do you still suspect Third Prince?

428
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:15,910
I can't be certain anymore.

429
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:19,609
In this world, aside from me,

430
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:24,509
there's one other person who knows Prince of Bo very well.

431
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,609
It's time to let this person out.

432
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:34,929
At present, this person is the only one who can help me confirm

433
00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,290
if Prince of Bo is still loyal to me.

434
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,649
No! I can't wait anymore!

435
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,449
I've to go to the palace!

436
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:47,969
Young Feudal Mistress, I'm afraid it's improper!

437
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,629
Young Feudal Mistress, Prince of Bo has returned!

438
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:23,290
I've worried you.

439
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,650
Did the Emperor get mad? Did he punish you?

440
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,530
It's just that...

441
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:35,349
What? Tell me quickly.

442
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,569
It's just that His Majesty has assigned all the heavy court affairs

443
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:41,050
to me so that I can redeem myself.

444
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:45,530
His Majesty is a reasonable man.

445
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,910
You mustn't disappoint him.

446
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,368
Had you known earlier that it would go so smoothly,

447
00:26:50,369 --> 00:26:53,128
you should've stayed longer at Kuizhou.

448
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:55,328
Perhaps you'd get to try Kuizhou's top chef,

449
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,049
Mr. Fang's signature dishes.

450
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:00,289
My favorite dish is the braised fish.

451
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,208
I'm a little hungry now.

452
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:05,789
Okay. Next time when we go to Kuizhou, we'll bring you along

453
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:07,208
to meet Mr. Fang and Hong'er.

454
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,829
Great! Can I eat ten fish?

455
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:11,410
Of course! Just eat whatever you want!

456
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,290
Thank you, Young Mistress!

457
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:18,249
Zhaixing, you must be tired after the journey.

458
00:27:18,249 --> 00:27:20,089
Go get some rest.

459
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,670
Your Highness, you should go to bed early, too.

460
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:27,409
- Ma Jing.
- I'm here!

461
00:27:28,849 --> 00:27:31,028
- Escort your Young Mistress to her room.
- Yes.

462
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:33,368
We'll go back and rest now.

463
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:36,389
Let's go. His Highness is exhausted.

464
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:41,368
Young Mistress, it's been a while since I saw Mr. Fang.

465
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:43,328
Hong'er must have grown a lot taller by now.

466
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,868
Indeed. At Kuizhou...

467
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,650
Did His Majesty put Master in a difficult position again?

468
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,970
No.

469
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,209
He just found out my past relationship with Princess Consort.

470
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,208
However, His Majesty has made an order for His Highness to go to Kuizhou

471
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:15,170
and kill Mr. Fang from the restaurant and his daughter

472
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:17,649
so that the matter can remain concealed.

473
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,750
The father and daughter from the restaurant?

474
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:24,350
Are they Mr. Fang and Hong'er whom Young Feudal Mistress was talking about?

475
00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:27,889
It's the restaurant that we reserved when we

476
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,010
took action behind Master's back.

477
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,049
May I be bold to ask this?

478
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,728
The targets of this assassination are Young Mistress's old acquaintances

479
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:37,448
who have met you several times.

480
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,430
Are you really going to kill them?

481
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,950
Perhaps...

482
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,570
Perhaps we can find a way to eliminate his suspicion.

483
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:48,368
Master, you need not take up the matter yourself.

484
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:50,629
The three of us will handle it.

485
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,910
Failure at this task won't be tolerated.

486
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:00,950
Yes, Master.

487
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:04,849
Go to Kuizhou early tomorrow morning.

488
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,049
Hai Die, stay here so that Zhaixing won't get suspicious.

489
00:29:08,129 --> 00:29:09,729
Yes.

490
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:14,009
Yao Ji, we haven't met for five years.

491
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:26,790
I, Yao Ji, pay respects to Your Majesty.

492
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,169
Get up.

493
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:32,029
Thanks, Your Majesty.

494
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,089
Your Majesty, you've come to visit me personally.

495
00:30:36,089 --> 00:30:41,349
May I know if you want to offer me a chance to redeem myself?

496
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,069
Did I hear it wrong?

497
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:50,451
Are you admitting that you indeed made a mistake five years ago?

498
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,930
Five years ago, Prince of Bo and I were competing to be the head of Night Fiends.

499
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,050
I refused to accept defeat

500
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,510
and so I attempted to kill him,

501
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,229
but Your Majesty saw through my plan.

502
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:02,848
I only have myself to blame.

503
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:06,410
It serves me right to end up in jail.

504
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,609
Yao Ji, as you've expected,

505
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,249
I'm going to release you.

506
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:18,510
Thank you, Your Majesty.

507
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:26,210
I suspect Prince of Bo has changed.

[Bo Royal Manor]

509
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,449
The top priority is to find a way to satisfy both sides.

510
00:32:21,209 --> 00:32:22,809
Come out.

511
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,590
Why have you come here?

512
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,390
Mo Xiao told me

513
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,728
that you'll leave the city in the morning to deal with court affairs.

514
00:32:57,729 --> 00:33:00,189
I wanted to serve you breakfast,

515
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:02,849
but you were wiping your sword.

516
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:09,710
Just now, you looked so scary.

517
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,410
Have a seat.

518
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,330
Did I scare you?

519
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,509
Actually, it wasn't my first time seeing your murderous look.

520
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:40,330
Back when you murdered Young Feudal Lord of Tongzhou,

521
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:42,510
you had the exact expression, too.

522
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,189
He attacked you, so he should be killed.

523
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,989
You wiped your sword so early in the morning.

524
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:58,889
Does the mission assigned by His Majesty involve

525
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,409
someone dying?

526
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,289
Your sword will only take away the lives

527
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:16,089
of atrocious criminals, right?

528
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:20,430
I'll only point my sword

529
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,090
at those who might harm people's lives.

530
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,130
Swords don't have eyes.

531
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,249
But if you're the one holding the sword,

532
00:34:33,249 --> 00:34:36,610
you can choose whether or not to kill.

533
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,370
I believe Your Highness will never kill innocent people,

534
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,449
just like Wolf Boy used to be.

535
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,629
Even though Commandant Xiahou took away Little Wolf,

536
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:49,408
your human nature overcame your animal spirit.

537
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,169
You didn't kill him,

538
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,749
but instead you let him go. Didn't you?

539
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,689
I'm no longer Wolf Boy.

540
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:01,990
When I returned to the court,

541
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,350
I was not Wolf Boy, but Prince of Bo.

542
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:10,889
The task assigned to me by His Majesty is confidential in nature.

543
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:13,969
You wouldn't understand and shouldn't understand.

544
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,670
It's getting late,

545
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:21,570
I'll depart now.

546
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,549
You always stop when the bell rings.

547
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:41,810
This proves that you're Wolf Boy.

548
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:45,310
You're now Prince of Bo,

549
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:50,130
but you'll always be the kind Wolf Boy from Langshou Mountain.

550
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:52,829
Have a safe trip.

551
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:54,649
I'll wait for you to return.

552
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,529
Back then, I adopted you and Prince of Bo.

553
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,769
I trained both of you to become Night Fiends.

554
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:37,529
Prince of Bo used to be unsociable and eccentric.

555
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,489
He never talked.

556
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:43,889
It was you who made him speak his first word.

557
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,630
Eat.

558
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,750
If we fight for every meal,

559
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,530
sooner or later we'll all die!

560
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:31,030
Come! Go on!

561
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,249
It's not worthy to die.

562
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:47,869
Both of us were put to the test by Your Majesty.

563
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:50,050
If I were to die during training,

564
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:53,129
he wouldn't be able to pass the test alone.

565
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,649
You two are similar and strong. I don't want to lose any of you.

566
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,710
Based on my understanding of Prince of Bo,

567
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:06,430
I don't believe a woman can make him lose himself.

568
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:22,770
Young Feudal Mistress, is it because this morning, Prince of Bo said that he was no longer Wolf Boy,

569
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,670
so you want to plant these usnea?

570
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,728
Usnea is the memory I share with Wolf Boy.

571
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:31,689
I hope when these plants have grown,

572
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:35,610
it'll become a new memory I share with Prince of Bo.

573
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:40,869
But you clearly like Wolf Boy more than Prince of Bo.

574
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,190
What are you talking about?

575
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,449
Aren't they the same person?

576
00:38:47,449 --> 00:38:51,448
That being so, why can't you accept the fact that Prince of Bo

577
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:53,888
is no longer the Wolf Boy he used to be?

578
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:56,329
Besides, Prince of Bo doesn't like plants.

579
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,729
Perhaps he doesn't even like usnea now.

580
00:39:02,689 --> 00:39:06,509
Do I really like Wolf Boy more?

581
00:39:07,649 --> 00:39:09,249
Young Feudal Mistress!

582
00:39:17,729 --> 00:39:23,090
Young Feudal Mistress, His Majesty has summoned you to enter the palace.

583
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,010
His Majesty has summoned me?

584
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:26,610
Eunuch, do you know what the matter is?

585
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,470
I have no idea.

586
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,089
Eunuch, let's go then.

587
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,968
Young Mistress, His Majesty has made a special order

588
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:37,408
that you are to enter the palace alone.

589
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:38,889
Why?

590
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:43,409
Yes. Why can't I go along with the Young Feudal Mistress, Eunuch?

591
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,090
I have no idea.

592
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,950
Eunuch, can you make an exception for us?

593
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:53,689
Are you suggesting that I should disobey the decree?

594
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,409
His Majesty must have a reason for doing so.

595
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:01,809
Ma Jing, take good care of these usnea herbs.

596
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,609
I'll be back soon.

597
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,769
Okay.

598
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,810
Let's go, Young Mistress.

599
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,290
Hai Die, do you think His Majesty has invited Young Mistress to the palace

600
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,649
to serve her delicious food?

601
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,050
Come. Help me plant the usnea herbs.

602
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:42,010
Back then, I thought Prince of Bo was all alone.

603
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:43,688
That's why I made him stay in the palace

604
00:40:43,689 --> 00:40:46,269
after he recovered from his injuries.

605
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,629
We hit it off well

606
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:51,370
and so I adopted him as my son.

607
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,210
I didn't expect it to cause a misunderstanding

608
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,070
and let you two be separated for so many years.

609
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:01,349
It was my fault.

610
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,969
If it wasn't because of you, Wolf Boy would've died long ago.

611
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:11,910
I'm glad you don't blame me.

612
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:16,330
I know Prince of Bo has been feeling guilty

613
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:19,530
for your leg injury.

614
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,770
If you want to go to the battlefield and avenge your father in the future,

615
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,208
you must cure your leg injury.

616
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:31,109
Hence, I've found you the best physician.

617
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:36,149
She promised me that she'll definitely cure your leg injury.

618
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:41,149
But the imperial physician and many other physicians said

619
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:44,969
that the old injury in my legs can't be cured.

620
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:49,050
That's because they're not skilled enough.

621
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:54,370
The physician is inside the room.

622
00:41:55,169 --> 00:41:58,829
This physician has a great medical skill,

623
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:01,610
but she's rather odd.

624
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:04,928
You need to cooperate with her and listen to her words

625
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,648
in order for your injury to heal.

626
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,910
Let me make it up to you.

627
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,689
I, Zhaixing, will do as you wish.

628
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,360
Go inside.

629
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:20,329
Yes, Your Majesty.
