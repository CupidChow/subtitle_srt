[Episode 12]
I thought you were just childishly willful

21
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:37,309
and I tolerated your temper.

22
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:41,489
But now you burned the agreement.

23
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:45,190
Your outrageous action will be reported to His Majesty.

24
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,710
We'll have the king give us an explanation.

25
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,929
You!

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,730
Murderer!

27
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:00,128
Bing’er is not guilty.

28
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,470
I didn't execute her.

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,809
Stop lying to me!

30
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:10,810

it's the Double Seventh Festival.

45
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:19,110
I am sorry, Xing'er.

46
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,589
The fault lies with me.

47
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:24,830
I should have seen through Chu Kui's plan earlier.

48
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,350
Please let me protect you.

49
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,890
I will atone for the sins of the Night Fiends.

50
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,210
Halt!

51
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:37,930
State your business. Get off the horse.

52
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,388
Get out of my way! The princess is leaving!

53
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:41,688
In the middle of the night?

54
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,328
Do you have the command flag?

55
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,488
Command flag?

56
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:45,888
Who is this brat?

57
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:48,249
Get lost if you don't have the command flag!

58
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,930
You want the command flag?

59
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,689
Fine, see for yourself.

60
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,990
You really have it?

61
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,070
Don't you dare fool me.

62
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,849
Do you like this command flag?

63
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,289
Seize her!

64
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:09,510
Leave!

65
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,669
Make haste! Let's go home!

66
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,570
There's an ambush! Protect the princess!

67
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:52,790
Who's there? Stand aside!

68
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:55,070
My lady, please come with us.

69
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,770
Insolence!

70
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,549
Capture that girl!

71
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:33,289
It seems like the Central Plains have no decent men other than

72
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,009
that blinded Prince of Bo!

73
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,649
All the men here are thieves!

74
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,990
You get the job done, you get paid.

75
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,109
The rest of it, I leave it to you.

76
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,510
Bing'er, let's go.

77
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,510
Do not let her get away!

78
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,310
My leg hurts.

79
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:38,529
A bunch of worthless fools.

[Bo Royal Manor]

81
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,188
Third Brother, bad news.

82
00:07:39,188 --> 00:07:41,808
Princess Bao Na was furious last night. She charged through the gate

83
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,470
and hurt our guards.

84
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,528
I thought she was celebrating the Double Seventh Festival with you.

85
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:47,889
Why were she and her guards leaving the city?

86
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:50,449
Master, it was my mistake.

87
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:52,968
After Her Highness had the argument with you and insisted to return to the imperial residence,

88
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,609
she wouldn't allow me to follow her.

89
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,648
I never thought she would leave without telling us.

90
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,208
I shall accept my punishment.

91
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,849
Which direction was she headed?

92
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,088
To the east of the city.

93
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:04,290
Third Brother, whatever the case is, she is the king's beloved daughter.

94
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,029
We cannot let her be harmed.

95
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,230
She was rude, but we must show our good faith.

96
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,209
My men are now searching for her,

97
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:13,609
but she only listens to you.

98
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,469
Third Brother, go find her.

99
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:19,049
Hai Die stays here.

100
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:33,969
Commandery Princess.

101
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,328
Second Brother,

102
00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:41,510
you said Princess Bao Na has left the city in a fit of pique.

103
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,429
I thought she was celebrating the Qixi Festival with the Prince of Bo.

104
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,809
Hai Die, do you know what happened that night?

105
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:52,109
Your Highness, Commandery Princess,

106
00:08:52,109 --> 00:08:54,369
Prince of Bo confronted Princess Bao Na because of

107
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,968
how Your Highness got injured.

108
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,190
The princess burned the agreement and left angrily.

109
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,250
When she left, she even wounded some guards.

110
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,569
I sense the scent of blood.

111
00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:19,349
Stay cautious.

112
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,930
Our master is always so amazing.

113
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,869
He always catches the scent

114
00:09:24,869 --> 00:09:27,190
miles before we get any tracks.

115
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,989
But why is there a scent of blood where the princess was?

116
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,709
Master,

117
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,109
these are all the princess' guards and servants.

118
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,070
But where is the princess?

119
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,590
Her guards were skilled in martial arts.

120
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:40,250
But these two were killed in a single strike.

121
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,050
It's apparent the killer

122
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,250
was no normal bandit.

123
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,350
It must have been an elite warrior.

124
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,550
Master, do you think the princess...

125
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,430
This matter is much more complicated.

126
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,290
They all served the princess.

127
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,429
How did this happen?

128
00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:22,749
Your Highness, I was told

129
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:27,810
last night you and Princess Bao Na had an argument.

130
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,289
You upset her and that was why she left the city at night,

131
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,229
which led to her being attacked on the road.

132
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,829
Prince of Bo,

133
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,969
if you hadn't placed the blame on her, she wouldn't have left!

134
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,630
She was living in your manor, yet now she is in trouble!

135
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,449
I don't care if you are a prince, you must answer for this!

136
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,909
Punishing me is not the most pressing matter.

137
00:11:54,909 --> 00:11:57,850
Our priority right now is to find the princess.

138
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:06,709
What now? You want a fight?

139
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,009
You were rude to Prince of Bo first.

140
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,190
Take another step and we won't show mercy.

141
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,530
Stand down!

142
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,569
Yes, Master.

143
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,869
Prince of Bo, if the princess is hurt in any way,

144
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:32,610
my king will send his army here.

145
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:38,630
Bodyguard Captain, please calm down.

146
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,190
We will definitely bring the princess back safely.

147
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,649
Third Prince, His Majesty asked

148
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:50,469
you and the Bodyguard Captain to meet him in the palace at once.

149
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:52,649
And the search for Princess Bao Na

150
00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:56,590
will be handled by me now.

151
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,990
Go!

152
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,149
So, the King of Qitan agreed to send us troops?

153
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,369
Yes.

154
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,349
Princess Bao Na requested for her father to give military aid multiple times.

155
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:29,209
She is confident with Prince of Bo's strategic wisdom.

156
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,769
That's why the king agreed to aid you.

157
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,568
The princess placed the agreement inside the case of a painting.

158
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,989
She was hoping the Prince of Bo would appreciate the good faith

159
00:13:38,989 --> 00:13:42,270
the moment he opened the gift and found the agreement.

160
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,549
But last night the Prince of Bo returned the agreement without even reading it once.

161
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,329
The princess felt humiliated.

162
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:52,549
That was why she burned the agreement and left the city.

163
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:54,449
Now she is nowhere to be found.

164
00:13:54,449 --> 00:13:57,968
If His Majesty finds out, not only will the agreement be voided,

165
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:01,050
the two nations will also become enemies.

166
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,730
Prince of Bo, I ordered you to take great care of her.

167
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,489
Yet you upset her and caused her to leave in the middle of the night.

168
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:09,009
You disobeyed my order!

169
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:13,128
Father, she is missing because of me.

170
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,830
I will take responsibility for any consequences.

171
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,030
I will bring the princess back safely.

172
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,369
You can stop acting now.

173
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:23,648
Your Majesty, we have no faith in Prince of Bo's word.

174
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,849
He upset the princess and that was a grave mistake.

175
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,390
Should he fail to bring her back,

176
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,129
he is likely to run away and be gone for good.

177
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,609
Your Majesty, Prince of Bo must be imprisoned and await his trial.

178
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,049
Our guards will keep watch.

179
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,130
We'll take no chances.

180
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:44,550
Father, the prime minister is

181
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,529
currently leading a search for the missing princess.

182
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:49,689
I believe they will return with good news soon enough.

183
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,009
I am willing to assist the prime minister.

184
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,050
Prince of Yun, heed my order.

185
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,129
You must bring the princess back.

186
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,989
Do not create more tension between the two nations.

187
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,710
Your wish is my command.

188
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,950
Prince of Bo, if we can't find the princess,

189
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,610
I will show you no mercy.

190
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:14,649
Treason and negligence

191
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,130
will be the charges for your death sentence.

192
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,490
I gladly accept the punishment.

193
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,009
Guards,

194
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:25,369
take the sinner, Prince of Bo, to jail.

195
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,970
Yes!

196
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:36,389
What? Prince of Bo has been imprisoned?

197
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,509
What?

198
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,930
It was His Majesty's order.

199
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,569
If the princess is lost for good,

200
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:48,209
Prince of Bo must atone with his life.

201
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:55,810
Commandery Princess, there is still hope.

202
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,330
Mo Xiao and I will send search parties up the mountains.

203
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,370
Please don't be worried.

204
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:05,770
Searching without leads is as good as futile.

205
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,969
Does Your Highness mean Prince of Bo's life is forfeit?

206
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:15,049
Right.

207
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,610
Husband and wife are one, but they will be apart in the face of danger.

208
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:21,270
Not to mention you two aren't officially married.

209
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,190
Hai Die, mind your manners!

210
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,689
I am telling the truth.

211
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,088
For whom do you think Prince of Bo offended the princess?

212
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:30,448
Why do you think he returned the gift?

213
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:31,929
Prince of Bo was just imprisoned,

214
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,170
but Her Highness was showing no concern and was eager to burn the bridge.

215
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,369
I simply feel sad for my master.

216
00:16:37,369 --> 00:16:41,630
Hai Die, what are you talking about?

217
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,569
Her Highness didn't chase the princess out.

218
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:48,309
Ever since she came here, Commandery Princess has suffered so much

219
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:50,369
and because of Prince of Bo she put up with everything.

220
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,070
She never complained. So why are you even complaining?

221
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,770
Ma Jing, enough!

222
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:04,489
Your Highness, this might sound offensive to you,

223
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:08,469
but if any harm comes to my master, you and your servants

224
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:10,209
will pay dearly for it.

225
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,929
Hai Die, enough.

226
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,749
Ma Jing, pack our belongings. We're leaving.

227
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:22,449
But, Your Highness, why?

228
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,650
The danger is upon her, she is running back to the frontier

229
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,630
for her family army's protection.

230
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,730
Go. I won't bother to see you out.

231
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,829
Don't bother!

232
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,409
Wait.

233
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,610
Your Highness, are we really leaving?

234
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,010
Yes. We need to go now.

235
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:45,069
I need to talk to His Majesty now and rescue Prince of Bo.

236
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,689
Your Highness.

237
00:17:46,689 --> 00:17:48,089
Hurry!

238
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,488
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

239
00:17:56,089 --> 00:18:00,129
Here is the good daughter of a feudal master,

240
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,349
and also Prince of Bo's good princess consort.

241
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,529
Ma Jing!

242
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,370
I'm coming!

243
00:18:16,969 --> 00:18:19,069
Prince of Bo is being cornered.

244
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:23,569
The whole court is using this chance to plot against him.

245
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,990
The only person who cares for him

246
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,980
and is able to persuade His Majesty

247
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,809
is none other than her.

248
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,169
Greetings, Your Majesty.

249
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,089
You are requesting to join the search for Princess Bao Na?

250
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:06,808
Please grant me the permission.

251
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:08,709
Princess Bao Na left in the middle of the night

252
00:19:08,709 --> 00:19:10,310
and now Prince of Bo is in prison.

253
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,670
I am responsible as well.

254
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,529
I hope to make amends.

255
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,049
I wish to save Princess Bao Na and also Prince of Bo.

256
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,150
As for the search for Princess Bao Na,

257
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,950
I have placed the Prince of Yun and the prime minister in charge.

258
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,609
However, you are intelligent.

259
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:35,890
Eight years ago you solved the case of Adjutant General Xiahou Yi.

260
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,929
To this day, I still have a deep impression of that.

261
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,928
We need all the help we can get.

262
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:44,169
I'll make an exception for you.

263
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:48,790
You shall have a hundred imperial guards to rescue Princess Bao Na.

264
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,870
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

265
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:53,550
Rise.

266
00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,210
If you manage to bring her back, you shall have my thanks.

267
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,209
I know the princess has been bothering Prince of Bo

268
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,510
and burned the agreement out of spite.

269
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,709
But now she is in danger.

270
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:13,770
So is You Zhen.

271
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:18,809
As you know, what I hate the most

272
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:20,770
is being used as a pawn.

273
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,709
But this time I was left with no choice.

274
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:28,089
If we can't save Princess Bao Na,

275
00:20:28,089 --> 00:20:33,069
I can only sacrifice Prince of Bo.

276
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:38,850
I won't let Your Majesty lose any one of your sons,

277
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,689
but I do have a request.

278
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:42,789
I hope to have Your Majesty's permission.

279
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:44,949
What is it?

280
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,710
I wish to enter the prison and visit Prince of Bo.

281
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,469
Prince of Bo was the first to arrive at the spot where Princess Bo Na was ambushed.

282
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:58,189
His Highness has been to the spot, and he must have found some traces.

283
00:20:58,189 --> 00:20:59,789
I need to inquire of him about it.

284
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:02,229
I need more clues.

285
00:21:02,229 --> 00:21:07,070
Even if I allow you to meet him,

286
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,109
I am afraid the Bodyguard Captain won't let you pass.

287
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:15,069
Your Majesty, the Bodyguard Captain may be holding a grudge and taking it personally.

288
00:21:15,069 --> 00:21:18,949
I have a way to persuade them to let me visit Prince of Bo.

289
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:25,430
Prince of Bo is an important prisoner.

290
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,209
No visitors allowed.

291
00:21:27,209 --> 00:21:28,849
Please leave, Commandery Princess Ma.

292
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:31,129
Do you know she is Prince of Bo's future wife?

293
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,889
How dare you stop her from visiting!

294
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,168
I'll be frank with you.

295
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,850
If Princess Bao Na is not found,

296
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,750
there might not even be a Prince of Bo in the future.

297
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,409
We are just as worried as you are.

298
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,150
We too wish for Her Highness to return safely.

299
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,249
What we must do now is not fight each other but work as one.

300
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,390
Anyone is capable of fancy words.

301
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,650
Commandery Princess, stop wasting your time.

302
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,890
Please go back.

303
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,790
In that case... I'll strike a deal with you, Bodyguard Captain.

304
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,609
If you allow me to visit Prince of Bo, before tomorrow afternoon,

305
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,529
Princess Bao Na will be returned.

306
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:09,689
If not, punish me however you wish.

307
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,069
What say you?

308
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:14,489
A life for a life.

309
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,849
This bargain is worth it.

310
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,469
If you insist... very well.

311
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,110
Dying together?

312
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,410
Is this what you wish?

313
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,790
I want to die by your side.

314
00:23:16,689 --> 00:23:18,770
But I want even more

315
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:22,410
to live with you.

316
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,730
Hai Die told me everything.

317
00:23:29,209 --> 00:23:31,990
You were worried about my injury.

318
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:37,510
That was why you confronted Bao Na and returned the gift.

319
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,550
After knowing all you've done for me,

320
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,550
how could I not do anything?

321
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,569
You misunderstood.

322
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,950
I blamed Bao Na for causing your injury,

323
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,229
but only because you are my princess consort.

324
00:23:53,229 --> 00:23:55,949
I did so to preserve the court's reputation.

325
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:05,969
Your Highness, what about the fragrance pouch?

326
00:24:06,969 --> 00:24:11,130
Was it also because I am your princess consort?

327
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,949
I requested His Majesty's permission.

328
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:19,069
Along with the imperial guards,

329
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:21,949
I shall join the search as well.

330
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:23,749
No.

331
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,670
I am imprisoned. I have no way to protect you.

332
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:29,869
Then let me protect you.

333
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,530
You've gone through

334
00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:46,009
the worst danger for me in the past, no?

335
00:24:46,689 --> 00:24:49,290
Before I was your consort,

336
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,169
you saved me from the hands of the Young Feudal Master of Tongzhou.

337
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,750
You were badly wounded because of me.

338
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,569
And because of my ailment,

339
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:03,088
you went against the royal order and defeated the guards

340
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,429
only to take me with you.

341
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:15,569
You even allowed me into your courtyard against regulations,

342
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,010
showing me kindness when I was all alone.

343
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:34,089
Now, you are in jail because of me.

344
00:25:36,089 --> 00:25:39,009
Even if you did everything

345
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:42,130
simply because I was betrothed to you,

346
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:45,590
then so be it.

347
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,540
♫ I have always been guarding♫

348
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,890
♫ Nothing has changed♫

349
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,029
There isn't any woman who has the qualities to be my wife

350
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:03,490
that can make me care so much for her.

351
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,490
It's only because you are Ma Zhaixing.

352
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,160
♫ Looking past the starry night ♫

353
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:16,330
♫ Your gaze was firm and warm ♫

354
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:20,470
♫ Like it was telling me ♫

355
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,610
♫ Wait for me; Falling down for you ♫

356
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,680
♫ Falling down; Igniting the fireworks of love ♫

357
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,129
This present for the Double Seventh Festival...

358
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,689
After we've rescued Princess Bao Na,

359
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,909
I want you to give it to me in person.

360
00:26:48,449 --> 00:26:51,610
Judging by your temper, once you've decided,

361
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,930
you're even more stubborn than Bao Na.

362
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:59,390
For your search, bring Wen Yan, Mo Xiao and Hai Die with you.

363
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,869
Be cautious.

364
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:05,750
Whoever captured her is a skilled warrior.

365
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:09,310
All of her guards were killed in one strike.

366
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,390
Stay cautious.

367
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:13,470
Thank you for reminding me.

368
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:17,089
I still need one more thing that you have.

369
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:19,610
I need it as my talisman.

370
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:22,750
I need your blood.

371
00:27:29,329 --> 00:27:31,009
Your Highness!

372
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,970
Your Highness!

373
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:36,730
Your Highness.

374
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,330
How did it go?

375
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:43,369
This is the princess's favorite Flower Moon Rouge you asked me to bring.

376
00:27:57,329 --> 00:28:00,809
As per your order, we have brought the warrior wolf from the Bo Army here.

377
00:28:03,689 --> 00:28:04,808
Commandery Princess, be careful.

378
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,989
The wolf may be tamed, but it only obeys Prince of Bo.

379
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:09,430
Only he can approach the wolf.

380
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,770
So it listens only to Prince of Bo?

381
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,669
To tame a beast like this,

382
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:16,830
you must be capable of defeating it.

383
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,850
That is the only way.

384
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:22,329
Go.

385
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:24,870
I'll be waiting for your good news.

386
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,289
We need to work together to save Princess Bao Na and Prince of Bo.

387
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:35,288
Bring us to the owner of this scent.

388
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,209
She is Princess Bao Na.

389
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,328
So this is why you needed the rouge.

390
00:28:40,329 --> 00:28:43,310
The scent is the same as what Princess Bao Na was wearing.

391
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,730
With its sense of smell, it can track her even in the wild.

392
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:54,309
Mo Xiao, open the cage.

393
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:55,709
Yes.

394
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,708
Brother Ji Chong, for you.

395
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,189
Brother Ji Chong.

396
00:29:07,189 --> 00:29:09,510
It was all thanks to your support

397
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,889
that we were able to successfully capture this girl.

398
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,450
Here. I'll toast to you.

399
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,410
How about this?

400
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:33,110
Three days from now, I'll get more rewards.

401
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,270
Consider it compensation for my work.

402
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,430
Brother Ji Chong is outspoken indeed.

403
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,730
No.

404
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,689
I was being honest.

405
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:00,869
Brother Ji Chong, is this bird of prey yours?

406
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:05,850
This is Zhuiri.

407
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,569
He is my brother.

408
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:12,370
He's like my third eye.

409
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,089
It helps me see everything within a hundred-mile radius.

410
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,869
What is going on now?

411
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,789
This means enemies are approaching.

412
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,610
Zhui Ri, perhaps you should leave first.

413
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:47,069
This is interesting...

414
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:51,189
The wolf's howl and its bloodlust.

415
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:55,790
This wolf seems to have come for revenge.

416
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,729
Your Highness, shaking that bell is not going to help.

417
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,288
This wolf is not the Wolf Boy we knew from before.

418
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:04,688
It won't come back after hearing the ringing.

419
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:08,770
I am ringing this bell because I want it to sense Prince of Bo's scent

420
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,650
and then come back.

421
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,568
But it's so far away.

422
00:31:12,569 --> 00:31:14,969
Can it even sense the smell?

423
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,490
Follow the wolf!

424
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,469
Come. Let's go.

425
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,489
Place the scorpions here. Take the hostage away.

426
00:31:42,489 --> 00:31:44,770
We'll find shelter elsewhere.

427
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:48,610
Whoever controls this wolf must be a skilled warrior.

428
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:51,830
Unless we get rid of it, there will be more trouble.

429
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,329
Go ahead without me.

430
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,010
What I expect the most is to fight someone with skills.

431
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,769
I am a person who hates being chased and hunted down.

432
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,208
Very well, we leave the enemies to you.

433
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:05,069
Don't worry.

434
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:07,730
I love surprising other people.

435
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,690
Let's go.

436
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:20,849
Over there.

437
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,189
Commandery Princess. Look! It's Princess Bao Na's horse!

438
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:34,488
You're right. It's her horse.

439
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:36,450
Princess?

440
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,310
What is going on now?

441
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,890
Bing'er, do you still remember me?

442
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,230
We are here to rescue your master.

443
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,049
You must be worried about her, too. Right?

444
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,950
So the person who controls the wolf is actually a woman.

445
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,849
What's wrong, Bing'er?

446
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:55,770
Your breathing is burning and quick.

447
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,230
Bing'er.

448
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,689
The horse has been poisoned.

449
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:08,929
There are no symptoms, but the poison has invaded its body.

450
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:13,249
Running over five miles will cause the poison to spread all over and kill it.

451
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:14,750
Who would do such a thing?

452
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,949
Who would poison the princess' steed?

453
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,009
Princess Bao Na loves her horse.

454
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,969
The horse stayed in the palace stable.

455
00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:23,929
Her palace was well guarded.

456
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:26,309
No normal person could go in there.

457
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:28,629
No normal person could go in there?

458
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,690
Unless...

459
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,850
Unless what?

460
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,889
Prince of Bo was right.

461
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,249
It wasn't a coincidence the princess went missing.

462
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,969
If the enemies only came up with the plan recently,

463
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:42,928
why would they kill only the guards and servants?

464
00:33:42,929 --> 00:33:45,990
They clearly knew her true identity.

465
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,890
Which means Princess Bao Na didn't go missing,

466
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,449
she was kidnapped.

467
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:52,030
Kidnapped?

468
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,770
Yes.

469
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,550
And this kidnapping would likely be a conspiracy.

470
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,448
If there is a traitor among us, the whole incident

471
00:34:01,449 --> 00:34:03,289
will make perfect sense.

472
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:06,928
The enemies knew the horse was fast, so they poisoned it.

473
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:10,010
Once the princess left Imperial City, they abducted her.

474
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,209
It seems like someone meticulously planned this.

475
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,690
So if there is a traitor, who could it be?

476
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:23,070
The horse was staying in the stable. Who has been its handler?

477
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:28,589
Also, who would know the princess's every move after she arrived?

478
00:34:28,589 --> 00:34:32,729
In that case... it's Second Prince's doing.

479
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:35,549
Who? Second Prince?

480
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:38,649
Our priority is to find the princess.

481
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,569
As for who the traitor is...

482
00:34:40,569 --> 00:34:43,288
Prince of Yun's Manor has many servants. Prince of Yun may not be involved personally.

483
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,969
It's too early for any conclusion.

484
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,970
After we save Prince of Bo, we'll come up with another plan.

485
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,528
It's almost nightfall.

486
00:34:50,529 --> 00:34:52,048
It's harder to find her after dark.

487
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,689
We must make haste and search.

488
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,909
See if we can find more tracks.

489
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,909
Yes, Your Highness.

490
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,450
I can't afford to let them spoil my business.

491
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:07,289
I need to save my big client, Prince of Yun.

492
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,949
But the truth of it is intriguing.

493
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,729
She can notice a movement behind her.

494
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:25,769
Who exactly is she?

495
00:35:48,009 --> 00:35:49,629
Is Your Highness hurt?

496
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:50,929
I am fine.

497
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,889
Watch out here.

498
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:54,889
This area is crawling with poisonous scorpions.

499
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:59,790
Seeing this beauty was in danger, I couldn't help but to be the hero.

500
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,810
Thank you for your help.

501
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,830
However... who are you?

502
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,729
Why are you here?

503
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,289
My name is Ji Chong.

504
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:09,930
I'm a bounty hunter who does the bidding of those who pay me.

505
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,169
I am also one of the people you're looking for.

506
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,669
A while back, a mysterious client from the capital offered a high price

507
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:24,030
to gather the most elite warriors around Imperial City.

508
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,450
He offered a deal for us to work together on a task.

509
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:30,529
The deal was to abduct a girl who left the city alone.

510
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:33,450
Hold on.

511
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,088
I had a fallout with those people.

512
00:36:35,089 --> 00:36:37,349
They are enemies now.

513
00:36:37,349 --> 00:36:40,109
When they brought her back,

514
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,889
I realized the girl was actually a lady from Qitan.

515
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,328
That goes against my code of conduct.

516
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,410
When I was about to quit,

517
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:54,970
those vagabonds, they turned against me and wanted me dead.

518
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,769
So how are you still alive?

519
00:36:57,589 --> 00:37:00,210
It's Heaven's will!

520
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,610
When we were about to fight, a fierce wolf came out of nowhere.

521
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,370
It was watching us closely.

522
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:09,809
The gang scattered in a hurry.

523
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:13,809
And during the confusion, I hid behind the tree to save my skin.

524
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,830
If I hadn't seen this lady

525
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,710
almost walking into the group of scorpions they placed here earlier,

526
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,729
I would have taken a nap and gone off the mountain alone.

527
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:36,030
Nowadays it's hard being a good guy.

528
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,450
Thank you for saving me.

529
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,828
I am Ma Zhaixing. We're from the Bo Royal Manor.

530
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,629
If you're telling the truth,

531
00:37:46,629 --> 00:37:50,288
would you be willing to atone for your crime by assisting us

532
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:52,210
in searching of the abducted girl?

533
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:56,049
If you pay me, I am willing to do anything.

534
00:37:56,049 --> 00:37:59,830
Those people are headed for Ling Yun Temple for shelter.

535
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,829
If you make haste and take a shortcut,

536
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:06,329
you might stand a chance to intercept them halfway.

537
00:38:07,009 --> 00:38:09,970
If you are telling the truth, that means you've saved us.

538
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,150
I will repay your kindness.

539
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,010
Let's go.

540
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,929
Thanks.

541

Head for Ling Yun Temple!

542
00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:30,929
Let me go!

543
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,128
- Shut it!
- Let me go!

544
00:38:32,128 --> 00:38:34,130
Make more noise or say another word,

545
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,808
and you can bid your tongue farewell!

546
00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:36,929
I'll make you eat it!

547
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,909
I mean it!

548
00:38:38,909 --> 00:38:41,148
Boss, don't waste your time.

549
00:38:41,148 --> 00:38:42,730
Ling Yun Temple is just up ahead.

550
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,648
With some drugs, we can put her to sleep. Right?

551
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,728
- Just walk.
- All right.

552
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,569
Princess, are you hurt?

553
00:39:34,329 --> 00:39:37,469
Princess, are you hurt?

554
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,089
What took you so long?

555
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:41,849
These bandits were all rude to me!

556
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:43,590
Don't let any one of them get away with this!

557
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,910
Okay.

558
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,789
Princess, we cannot stay here.

559
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:48,569
Let's return now.

560
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,289
I am not going!

561
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,048
I want you to arrest these bandits first!

562
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:54,070
I want them to suffer!

563
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,770
Have mercy, Princess!

564
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,529
Have mercy on us!

565
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,969
Princess... Princess!

566
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,470
Princess...

567
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:06,329
- You. Stand up.
- Princess.

568
00:40:06,329 --> 00:40:08,809
You were the one that hit me just now.

569

Have mercy on me! Have mercy on me!

570

Have mercy on me!

571
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:22,889
Princess!

572
00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:51,509
Nice shot. Right on the mark.

573
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:52,930
You bet.

574
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,350
But it's not on a par with your Commandery Princess's resolve to risk her life for the princess.

575
00:41:01,629 --> 00:41:03,830
Princess, are you hurt?

576
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:04,909
Are you all right?

577
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:06,669
What about you?

578
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:08,469
I am fine.

579
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:16,649
It's over now.

580
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,590
You're safe.

581
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:37,511
You get the merit for aiding us,

582
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:41,529
but your involvement in this abduction means you know what we don't.

583
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:43,569
We cannot let you leave.

584
00:41:46,049 --> 00:41:48,529
Press another blade on me

585
00:41:48,529 --> 00:41:49,929
and I might fall for you.

586
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,330
You...

587
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,129
Stop!

588

Commandery Princess.

589
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,049
He may be involved,

590
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:04,370
but if he hadn't given us leads, we wouldn't have succeeded so fast.

591
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:06,969
Speaking of which, his merits make up for his wrongdoings.

592
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:09,510
We shouldn't treat him like a criminal.

593
00:42:11,049 --> 00:42:15,710
As for what he knows, I believe he is willing to tell us all.

594
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,270
After all, that will be his leverage to absolve himself.

595
00:42:21,729 --> 00:42:23,650
As I said,

596
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:27,710
I have no idea who hired us.
