[The Wolf]

00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,749
[Episode 25]
You seem reluctant.

21
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,130
Are you thinking of Ma Zhaixing?

22
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,970
Are you from our Chu family?

23
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,870
Taking revenge for your brother is a matter of course.

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,470
Zhang Jin!

25
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:02,889
No matter when,

26
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,249
you must have this sword with you at all times.

27
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,330
I have a request.

28
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,710
Say it.

29
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,970
When I lead the troop to annihilate Ma Army and Ma Zhaixing,

30
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,590
I wish to tell them that they will be annihilated

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,490
because of their sin for not rescuing First Prince on the battlefield.

32
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,750
So that they can know the reason for their deaths.

33
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:01,730
You mean to let them rest in peace, right?

34
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:09,509
Don't disappoint me.

35
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,530
Xing'er, I have to force you to be strong

36
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,290
so you can protect the Ma Army.

37

[Bo Royal Manor]

38
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:41,490
Welcome back, Prince of Bo.

39
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,129
I have...

40
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:50,350
Are you still mad at me? Is it because I didn't discuss with you the matter

41
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,069
of asking permission from His Majesty to go to the frontline?

42
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:56,849
But that is my father's Ma Family Army.

43
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,169
I couldn't just ignore that.

44
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:02,849
Father has already given the order.

45
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,990
Whether I'm getting mad at you is unimportant.

46
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,650
No, that's very important.

47
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,289
I hope you can support me.

48
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,490
For this decision I made,

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,450
actually, that's just a lie to say that I'm not afraid.

50
00:04:20,249 --> 00:04:22,048
But when I think of you by my side,

51
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,868
I know no matter what happens or what obstacles I encounter, Wolf Boy can protect me as well.

52
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:27,530
I'm not afraid anymore.

53
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,248
You'll be at the frontier and I'll be in Imperial City.

54
00:04:30,248 --> 00:04:31,609
We'll be in different places.

55
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,390
How can I protect you?

56
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,449
Your Highness, please listen to me.

57
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,170
I don't want to listen.

58
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,270
Your Highness—

59
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,610
Wolf Boy! Stop!

60
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,890
I have apologized to you.

61
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,030
Why do you still have to leave?

62
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,729
I accept Commandery Princess's apology.

63
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,729
Can you stop talking to me in such a way?

64
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:16,909
I know you were unhappy when you were with His Majesty.

65
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:20,869
But I didn't expect that you would ignore me for that.

66
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:33,069
Wolf Boy, stop being mad at me. Okay?

67
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,669
On the morning of the day after tomorrow, I will depart to the frontline.

68
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:41,370
Let's not waste our time getting mad and quarreling, okay?

69
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,350
That's enough!

70
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,349
Since the day you came to Imperial City, I've never had a peaceful day.

71
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:06,530
Have you ever thought that we should never have known each other from the beginning?

72
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,008
You shouldn't have come to Langshou Mountain. You shouldn't have saved Wolf Boy.

73
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,289
That way, you wouldn't have injured your legs.

74
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:17,949
You wouldn't have to worry so much about staying in Imperial City.

75
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,170
You could have a husband that loves you,

76
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,829
an adorable son and daughter pair, and live a carefree life.

77
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,850
Even if I can choose again,

78
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,050
I'd still choose to have you.

79
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,990
I've been thinking that if Xiahou Yi hadn't died at that time,

80
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,229
what would have happened to you and me?

81
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,169
Or how great it would be if

82
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,610
I had jumped off the cliff back then and died.

83
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,950
Perhaps...

84
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,049
we are really like what Yao Ji said.

85
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,010
We're cursed by God.

86
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:46,969
Your words are too harsh and outrageous.

87
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:51,388
Since I have reunited with you, I've never thought of being apart from each other.

88
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,610
I've never regretted meeting with you.

89
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,770
Even if I can't walk properly,

90
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,928
even if I'd be trapped in Bo Royal Manor for my entire life, I'm never afraid. I'll never regret it.

91
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,709
But...

92
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:11,670
But how can you ignore me when you get mad?

93
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,488
You don't want me anymore.

94
00:08:13,489 --> 00:08:16,569
I will be alone. Where can I go?

95
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,249
What can I do?

96
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,630
How can you ignore me?

97
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,070
That's my fault.

98
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,189
Stop crying, okay?

99
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,930
Are you still angry at me?

100
00:08:54,749 --> 00:09:01,169
Please promise me not to say such irritating words anymore even if you are very angry.

101
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:08,549
Listen to me carefully.

102
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,349
You've never been to the battlefield.

103
00:09:12,349 --> 00:09:16,489
Only tomorrow is left to assist the Ma Family Army.

104
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:21,769
Let me teach you how to arrange the troops and make a contingency plan, okay?

105
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,730
All right. I will learn it properly.

106
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,748
Your Highness, will you arrive later with an army of supporting soldiers?

107
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,530
Yes, I will.

108
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:41,249
Ma Jing will be with you for this time.

109
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,590
It makes me less worried.

110
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,728
I saw Ma Jing was very anxious just now as she was worried about Brother Feng Cheng.

111
00:09:47,728 --> 00:09:51,109
I let her lead the troops and depart before me.

112
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:57,009
In that case, I will pick a few expert soldiers from the Bo troops to go with you.

113
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,690
Get some rest early, okay?

114
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,669
Let's start practicing tomorrow morning.

115
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:07,989
No worries. I won't be lazy.

116
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,249
I still have a few affairs to settle.

117
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,650
You go back first.

118
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,049
I'm not tired. Why do you always urge me to get some rest?

119
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,029
Fine. Carry on your things.

120
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:23,549
I will go prepare my wolf bow.

121
00:10:58,789 --> 00:11:02,329
The world is so huge.

122
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:06,948
Why can't it accommodate the two of us?

123
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,449
Just the two of us.

124
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,830
I've never thought the rebellious you would surrender yourself

125
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,149
just because you want to know the unrevealed truth of the Ma Manor case.

126
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:50,850
Tell me the reason.

127
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:56,009
Ma Ying's daughter, Ma Zhaixing, is my best friend.

128
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,209
If there's something suspicious, I'll definitely check it out.

129
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,350
Commandery Princess Ma and you are best friends?

130
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,031
Then, Jin will have ways to instigate a revolt in the Ma Family Army.

131
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:12,970
Ji Chong, you must save Ma Zhaixing immediately.

132
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,889
Why do you say so?

133
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,110
You will get to know the reason after reading this letter.

134
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,488
Initially, Jin indeed wanted to take the chance and roped in the enemy leaders,

135
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:38,109
including Ma Ying.

136
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,189
But Ma Ying replied to Jin saying that he would surrender and retire,

137
00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:47,709
and never interfere in any matters anymore.

138
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,509
So, we gave up to advise Ma Ying from surrendering.

139
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:58,770
So, Jin wasn't the one who annihilated Ma Ying's family.

140
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,868
Ma Ying had no military power at that time. Why should we incite him to surrender?

141
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:10,288
Why should we take the risk of provoking hostility from the Ma Family Army just to kill him?

142
00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:23,010
Back then, our spy fell into Chu Kui's hands and he obtained our Tiger Seal.

143
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,909
Chu Kui made use of this Tiger Seal to frame all the accusations on Jin.

144
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,888
If the murderer was Chu Kui, then the suspicious person

145
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:36,369
who was seen by Mr. Fang during the annihilation must be Prince of Bo.

146
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:39,729
That means Chu Kui was afraid of the truth being revealed by Ma Family Army

147
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,609
and suspected Prince of Bo of entering the city in secret.

148
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,870
And that's why he killed Mr. Fang cruelly.

149
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,648
Then, why didn't you tell the Ma Family Army about it immediately?

150
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:51,348
So you could incite them to surrender and in the meantime taking them to be used by Jin?

151
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,609
For some time now, I did send someone to advise him.

152
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,889
But once they heard we were from Jin,

153
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,250
the Ma Family Army would refuse to meet.

154
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,650
Moreover, this Tiger Seal was found there.

155
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,449
We couldn't argue about that.

156
00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,949
They've firmly believed that Jin is their greatest enemy.

157
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:19,049
Without any evidence, they wouldn't believe my words.

158
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,909
But it's different now as we have you.

159
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:31,489
Since you and Commandery Princess Ma are best friends,

160
00:14:31,489 --> 00:14:33,229
she will definitely believe you.

161
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:37,489
We might have the chance to incite the Ma Family Army to surrender if you attend to them for us.

162
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:40,909
Moreover, Commandery Princess Ma is in Chu Kui's hands now.

163
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,429
Do you know why?

164
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,689
She is a hostage.

165
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,349
You're right.

166
00:14:48,349 --> 00:14:53,089
That also means your lovely Commandery Princess Ma is suffering now.

167
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,169
You're the only one who can save her now.

168
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:57,929
You have to be fast,

169
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:02,229
in case the Ma Family Army's life falls into Chu Kui's hands.

170
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,590
Give me a most speedy horse.

171
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,370
[Bo Royal Manor]

172
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,648
You will depart tomorrow.

173
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,809
I can only teach you by now.

174
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,889
You must listen carefully.

175
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,250
Yes, Master.

176
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,231
This is the topography around Taibao Batallion.

177
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:29,070
This time, the most important task is to encourage the army.

178
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,130
If you are familiar with the tactics, the army will be more confident.

179
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,389
Then, victory is not far from you.

180
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,209
I understand now.

181
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,210
Taibao Batallion is here.

182
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:46,370
According to the topography stated here, tell me your thoughts.

183
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,008
Taibao Batallion is surrounded by mountains on three sides.

184
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:57,309
It's easy to defend, but hard to attack.

185
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:01,990
There's a wide flatland right at the front that could be an entry point.

186
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,088
But the Jin Army will definitely defend strictly there.

187
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,489
If I want to attack them at night,

188
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,950
I can besiege in the surrounding forest.

189
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,751
Perhaps, you're really a talent that was born to lead the troops.

190
00:16:24,329 --> 00:16:27,008
Of course! I inherited my father's gene.

191
00:16:27,008 --> 00:16:28,489
This time is to revenge for him.

192
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,689
I surely couldn't shame him.

193
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,009
But there will be miasma in the forest.

194
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:40,589
What should I do then?

195
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,590
Lure the enemy, turning the disadvantage into an advantage.

196
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,969
I understand now.

197
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,049
Our troops can avoid miasmic places and invade Jin.

198
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,150
Once they arrive, we can lure them to enter miasmic places.

199
00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:01,870
You're so wise!

200
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:08,810
But maybe your enemy is not Taibao Batallion.

201
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,570
There might be other troops that ambush there?

202
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,009
What if it were me?

203
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,809
Don't make a joke.

204
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:26,328
That's impossible.

205
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:27,869
Take it seriously.

206
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,690
Troop formation is never a joke.

207
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,088
I'm guiding you through the tactics to face the enemy.

208
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,489
So every session has its use.

209
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,910
If you don't learn it seriously, you can stop learning now.

210
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,870
There are uncertainties on the battlefield.

211
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,489
Any place could be in danger.

212
00:17:45,489 --> 00:17:48,069
Should you be panicked when you encounter a problem?

213
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:56,209
Since that's an assumption, I'd like to know the reason for you becoming my enemy.

214
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,490
The Ma Family Army has always been out of control.

215
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,270
It will be valueless after the battle.

216
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,308
His Majesty doesn't want to keep it anymore and orders me to besiege the troops

217
00:18:06,308 --> 00:18:09,890
and annihilate everyone, including you.

218
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,408
Why? You can't respond to it?

219
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,209
Waiting to die?

220
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,168
If that's the case, I must fight against the troops who besiege there.

221
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,650
But Wolf Boy won't do that to you.

222
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:43,870
Xing'er, you are not my opponent.

223
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,129
Once we battle, there will be heavy casualties that happen to the Ma Family Army and you.

224
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,928
If we meet each other on the battlefield,

225
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:55,249
I would rather negotiate with you in person, asking you to surrender.

226
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:05,289
If I really have to battle with Wolf Boy,

227
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:07,870
I'm willing to negotiate with you in person.

228
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,930
Then, I can kill you when you attend the negotiation by yourself.

229
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:24,330
When you are dead,

230
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,690
the Ma Family Army will have no leader and will definitely lose in the battle.

231
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,370
Ma Zhaixing,

232
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,669
you must always remember what I'm saying now.

233
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:45,189
Never believe your enemy on the battlefield.

234
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:50,330
If we become enemies, there will be no more Wolf Boy, but only Prince of Bo.

235
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,850
Keep in mind that when two teams fight on the battlefield, either of them will die.

236
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,028
You must be crafty enough, knowing how to lure the enemy,

237
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:02,470
and kill the enemy at once by focusing on his weaknesses.

238
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,229
Do you understand now?

239
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,310
I understand now.

240
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,969
I will learn it slowly.

241
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,510
You have no time to learn it slowly.

242
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,090
But Your Highness is not the enemy that I will encounter very soon.

243
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,769
It's unnecessary to learn crafty tactics as of now.

244
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,829
You have to learn them now.

245
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,869
I know you are worried if I'll be lenient.

246
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:44,030
That's why you guided me through the tactics of arranging the troops.

247
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:47,830
Stop worrying about me, okay?

248
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:52,209
Come here.

249
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,830
This is the gold scale armor.

250
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,169
I prepared this especially for you.

251
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,530
This armor is light, but it's very tough.

252
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,249
It can protect you from attacks.

253
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,590
If the situation is unfavorable, it can protect your life.

254
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:31,950
You give me the tips and prepare this for me.

255
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,029
It seems you are really worried so much about me.

256
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,930
I've one more thing to remind you.

257
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:42,109
What is it?

258
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:44,389
Stay alive.

259
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,470
Stay alive.

260
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,710
No matter how bad the situation becomes,

261
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,730
no matter what the condition is,

262
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,909
no matter how tough to fight with the enemy,

263
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,510
you must stay alive.

264
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:17,769
Staying alive is the only way to defeat your ultimate enemy.

265
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,390
I promise you.

266
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,489
Try on the armor.

267
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:43,609
Can you set a banquet for me tonight?

268
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,189
Give me enough confidence to win in the battle.

269
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,369
Ma Jing, why are you here?

270
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,289
My brother is sick. I'm on my way to visit him at Ma Battalion.

271
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,010
Where are you going?

272
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,249
I am headed to Bo Royal Manor to find Zhaixing.

273
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,068
Commandery Princess will depart from the capital and meet with me tomorrow morning.

274
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,329
If you go now, I think you can't meet with her.

275
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:42,849
- Zhaixing will come?
- Yes.

276
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,568
Ma Jing, I'll follow you to the Ma Family Army Battalion.

277
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:50,009
I've something important to inform the army general.

278
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,408
You don't even know my brother. Why do you want to see him?

279
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:57,270
The real murderer who killed General Ma Ying was not Jin but Yang.

280
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,809
What?

281
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:30,449
Hai Die, thank you for helping me this time.

282
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:39,530
I never thought that Commandery Princess had such a deep affection for the master.

283
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:46,970
What I do for him is never enough compared with what he has done for me.

284
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:01,370
Dad, I have a good husband as you always hoped for.

285
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,690
Make use of this bow well.

286
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,530
I'm too selfish.

287
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,429
Let me be your Wolf Boy for the last time.

288
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:57,269
Master, it's the time to let Commandery Princess in.

289
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:00,240
I can't avoid it when it comes.

290
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:02,729
Let her in.

291
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,150
Hai Die, you can bring the Commandery Princess in now.

292
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,270
Why are all of you silent?

293
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:53,669
Your Highness, do you think that I'm shameless?

294
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:05,230
I'm afraid that you are married to the wrong person.

295
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,530
After tomorrow, we'll be leaving each other for a long time.

296
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,749
When we get married is unknown.

297
00:28:15,749 --> 00:28:22,209
But I wanted to let you see me wearing the wedding dress.

298
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:28,589
I wanted to let you know that we, as a couple, can overcome all obstacles.

299
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:33,149
Congratulations, Master and Commandery Princess.

300
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:37,509
Hai Die wishes you love for a century.

301
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,770
Thank you for the auspicious words, Hai Die.

302
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,930
Hai Die,

303
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,710
let's not disturb their sweet moment.

304
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,929
Let's head back.

305
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,680
Hold on.

306
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:31,808
Today is just a rehearsal for our wedding.

307
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:34,490
We shouldn't skip the steps.

308
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,689
I will listen to you for tonight.

309
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,530
Good!

310
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,189
Firstly, bow to the sky and the earth.

311
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,949
Okay.

312
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:53,449
Come here.

313
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,169
Okay.

314
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:03,330
Thank God for letting us meet and love each other.

315
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,130
Did you bow?

316
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,830
Yes, I did.

317
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,870
Secondly, bow to our parents. We skip this part first.

318
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,660
Lastly,

319
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,750
bow to each other.

320
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,409
We skip this first, okay?

321
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:44,849
Why?

322
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,569
We're not a couple if we don't bow to each other.

323
00:30:50,689 --> 00:30:52,669
Wait until the day

324
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:58,870
when we both get married,

325
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,409
then we do the couple bow.

326
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,030
I want to leave the best for the day.

327
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,710
Okay?

328
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,730
That's a good reason.

329
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:19,830
Then, the groom can take away the wedding fan now.

330
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:52,109
You are so beautiful!

331
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,370
How lucky of you to have such a beautiful bride!

332
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,008
The food is ready. Let's go over there.

333
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,809
Double Seventh sweets!

334
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:24,329
Your Highness has prepared the sweets.

335
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,430
Did you make it by yourself?

336
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,289
Of course!

337
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:41,370
Today, Your Highness has guided me in planning the tactics strictly

338
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,250
and set up the banquet that I requested for me.

339
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:49,350
I thought Your Highness was not reluctant to leave me.

340
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,849
It seems that I've misunderstood you.

341
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,409
I always don't know how to express myself well.

342
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,389
I'm reluctant, but I have to bear with it.

343
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,169
Even if you don't say that,

344
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,229
Zhaixing will still understand your intention.

345
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,069
Why do I have just a little?

346
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:38,849
You have such a low alcohol tolerance.

347
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,010
I've seen you after you get drunk.

348
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,450
Once the Ma Family Army defeats the Taibao Batallion,

349
00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:19,700
the first thing I want to do is to get marri–

♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

351

356

♫ I waste away aimlessly and without anyone urging me ♫

357

♫ A homeless drifter's delusional wish

360
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,420
♫ Letting me find the way in the endless darkness ♫

It's late now.

368
00:35:28,649 --> 00:35:30,870
I'll send you back to rest.

Hubby, can we stay here a little longer?

373

Okay.

374
00:35:56,409 --> 00:35:58,160
I'll listen to you.

Brother, are you all right?

379
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:30,389
Are you all right?

380
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,290
You mean, those who annihilated the Ma family

381
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:46,549
was Chu Kui?

382
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:51,730
I don't know you, and you've no evidence.

383
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:54,149
Why should I believe you?

384
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,090
You're talking nonsense here.

385
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:03,629
Tell! Where do you get the news from?

386
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,730
The Crown Prince of Jin. Prince of Wei, Li Juqi.

387
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,130
I was once

388
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,688
a general of Jin.

389
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:18,949
How bold you are to come here to interfere with us!

390
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:22,209
Do you know that the Ma Family Army and Jin are irreconcilable?

391
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,469
It's normal for you not to believe me

392
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:27,290
since I'm a person from Jin.

393
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:32,830
But why would I take the risk to come here if not for Zhaixing?

394
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,290
Brother Ye Han, put down the knife!

395
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,110
Brother, he treats Commandery Princess really well.

396
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:44,408
He's a friend, not a foe. He has no bad intentions.

397
00:37:45,689 --> 00:37:50,670
Ye Han, put down the knife!

398
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:03,110
This is a clapper stone from a bronze bell given by Commandery Princess to me

399
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,169
as a memento before we parted.

400
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:10,229
The bronze bell is something her mother left for her.

401
00:38:10,229 --> 00:38:12,309
She really values it.

402
00:38:12,309 --> 00:38:15,910
We treat each other sincerely.

403
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:21,170
I've no reason to risk my life for spreading a rumor and bringing harm to her Ma Family Army.

404
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:29,290
General Ma, is the evidence you mentioned just now a Tiger Seal of Jin?

405
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,050
The twelve Tiger Seals of Jin were made from peculiar rocks.

406
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:49,810
The seal is very unique.

407
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:55,590
I've already confirmed it is a real one.

408
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,570
Undeniable. This is a real one.

409
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,149
But do you know what happened

410
00:39:02,149 --> 00:39:05,688
to General Shen who kept this seal?

411
00:39:05,689 --> 00:39:08,470
Of course, I know that.

412
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,410
He was killed a year ago.

413
00:39:14,029 --> 00:39:18,570
From that, we can know that this seal was from General Shen.

414
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,109
But it has been used by Prince of Bo to frame the crime.

415
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,970
You speak without showing evidence.

416
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,990
How can you prove that this seal was kept by General Shen?

417
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:43,128
This is a word of "Shen" which was engraved secretly in the seal.

418
00:39:43,128 --> 00:39:44,560
Prince of Bo doesn't know this.

419
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,350
Let me ask you. How can General Shen, who was killed a year ago, confront Ma Manor?

420
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:57,370
If this seal was really used by Prince of Bo to frame the crime on the Jin Army,

421
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:02,410
then the truth of why Ma family was killed has been revealed now.

422
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,590
I've found a corpse.

423
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,609
He was the manager of Wan An Restaurant in Kuizhou.

424
00:40:14,209 --> 00:40:16,429
He was poisoned by an unknown poison.

425
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,390
That's very suspicious.

426
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,708
I've checked it out that Prince of Bo had already entered the city secretly the day the Ma family was killed.

427
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:26,490
This action is out of the ordinary for him.

428
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,930
He must have been there earlier to plan ahead and attack at night.

429
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,249
Mr. Fang...

430
00:40:35,129 --> 00:40:39,990
suspected that Prince of Bo

431
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,970
was the scary man who stayed in his restaurant.

432
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:51,810
I brought a picture of Prince of Bo on the second day

433
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,309
and met with Mr. Fang.

434
00:40:54,309 --> 00:40:57,330
There was a fake fire on that day.

435
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,950
But what had actually happened was a murder.

436
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,949
I missed the golden time to catch the real murderer.

437
00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:23,930
That means Prince of Bo was finding a chance to save Commandery Princess,

438
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:29,109
in order to console and

439
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:32,649
suppress the Ma Family Army. Am I right?

440
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:36,190
Prince of Bo's affection for the Commandery Princess is fake as well.

441
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,450
What a shameless Chu Kui!

442
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,009
General! Please give the order to save the Commandery Princess now.

443
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,689
You can't do that.

444
00:41:43,689 --> 00:41:45,609
I hope you can stay calm.

445
00:41:45,609 --> 00:41:48,430
Zhaixing will meet with us by tomorrow.

446
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,368
Ma Jing and I will go and make sure she arrives safely.

447
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:54,490
We will see how to deal with it later.

448
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:07,609
Ma Jing, I know you're worried about Zhaixing being devastated.

449
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:12,420
But Zhaixing has to know the truth.
