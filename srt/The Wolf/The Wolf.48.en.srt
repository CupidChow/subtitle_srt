00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,790
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:19,050
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,190
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,400
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,920
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,150
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,910
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:33,800
[Episode 48]

21
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,759
The quality of our soldiers is getting worse.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,839
He managed to get enlisted with that body?

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,039
Shorty, I heard you've been taking good care of the war horses. Keep it up!

24
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,199
Yes!

25
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:56,259
Where is Prince of Chuan's clothes? Prince of Chuan has arrived at the drill ground!

26
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,939
Deliver these two items of clothing to him.

27
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:00,319
Let me do it!

28
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,760
Don't you have to feed the horses?

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,701
I'll pass by there!

30
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,260
There is such a big hole, but he's still wearing it?

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,520
He's really a frugal person.

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,930
But this new one and this old one,

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,859
why are their sizes so different?

34
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,219
It's way too small.

35
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:25,540
Could he be losing weight?

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,639
It seems that he's still brokenhearted.

37
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,299
Are you slacking off?

38
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,700
I'm going to feed the horses now!

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,239
I'll go feed the horses now.

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,140
Surprise! Are you happy?

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
Yelu Bao Na?

42
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,640
I was wondering why there is a person sneaking around.

43
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,279
So it's you.

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,939
Why are you clothed like this?

45
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:07,879
Why did you sneak into the military camp?

46
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,440
I was worried you'd give up on life after losing Sister Zhaixing.

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,579
Plus the incoming war would affect your mood.

48
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:17,279
That's why I came to find you.

49
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:19,679
But I was afraid you'd be busy with training and combat,

50
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:21,599
and have no time to see me.

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,119
So I decided to sneak into the camp.

52
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,319
I-I don't mean to bother you!

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,980
I just want to stay by your side, and see if you're doing well.

54
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm doing very well.

55
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,200
You don't need to worry.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,839
Nonsense!

57
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,659
You've lost two inches off your waist!

58
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,519
It must be because of Sister Zhaixing that your mood is affected,

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,999
and you're not eating well.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,719
I asked the soldier in the kitchen.

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,220
He said your appetite has decreased, right?

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,880
Who's the one that's not eating well?

63
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,199
Eat.

64
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,459
You've lost weight. You should eat.

65
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,159
Cut the nonsense.

66
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,100
You need to have three bites first, and I'll then have a bite.

67
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:50,579
Do you think this is your home?

68
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,340
Fine.

69
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,279
I've never met someone who's better at bargaining than me.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,879
This. This. This.

71
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,098
You need to eat them all. Don't leave any food on your plate.

72
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:05,918
I'll only eat if you do so. This is my order.

73
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,659
Ma Zhaixing.

74
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,359
I order you to finish all the food.

75
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:15,470
Don't leave any on your plate.

76
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,680
Don't say no.

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,260
If not, I won't teach you archery.

78
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,320
What are you smiling about?

79
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,679
Nothing.

80
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:32,880
So meeting someone similar to me

81
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
carries a kind of sense of helpless retribution.

82
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,599
In short, you no longer need to do these things to me.

83
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:44,959
This is a war preparatory military camp.

84
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,379
- To have a delicate girl like you mingling with others here, that's outrageous.
- I...

85
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,000
If you get hurt, how can I explain it to the king?

86
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,179
Look at yourself.

87
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:04,459
You look worn out.

88
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,540
And your hands are wounded—

89
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,400
You're worried about me?

90
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,480
I'm warning you.

91
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,320
All this time while I've been away from home,

92
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,759
I haven't had a bath for so long.

93
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:25,040
My whole body smells bad.

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,479
I've never marched and trained every day, too,

95
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,839
nor walked such a long distance.

96
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,179
And I need to feed so many warhorses and wash so many clothes.

97
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:37,540
There are now calluses on my limbs.

98
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,079
And I need to sleep outside the tent and endure such cold weather.

99
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,879
I even need to worry about the appearance of beasts.

100
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,239
My life is hard enough.

101
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,899
But you're not comforting me,

102
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,979
but criticizing me.

103
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,779
Princess, I'm really touched by all these things you did for me.

104
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,680
Really?

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,759
Yes.

106
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,640
But you really need not torture yourself for me anymore.

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,700
I've put the Ma Zhaixing incident in the past.

108
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,740
And I'm doing well now.

109
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,740
Eat first.

110
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,040
After the meal, I'll get someone to send you home.

111
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm not leaving!

112
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,119
Unless you regain the lost two inches.

113
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:27,559
I'll never give up on what I want to do.

114
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,679
Eat first, okay?

115
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,720
I'll eat if you do so.

116
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,200
Dig in.

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Eat.

118
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:05,138
Don't you think it's ridiculous? So exaggerated?

119
00:08:05,138 --> 00:08:09,519
She is a princess but she sneaked into the military camp

120
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:12,279
and she even checked the sizes of my clothes!

121
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,839
Tell me! Isn't she crazy?

122
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,319
How can I let a reckless person like her take care of my warhorses?

123
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,519
She might ruin my plan.

124
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:31,518
So I'd gotten someone to send a letter to Bao Na's brother,

125
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,679
asking him to send someone to fetch her away.

126
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,100
You were once a horse expert,

127
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,480
but you didn't even notice this.

128
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,180
New kind of hay?

129
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,380
The weather has been quite wet lately.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,440
Bao Na changed the hay

131
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,639
to prevent the warhorses from getting sick.

132
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
That's very keen of her.

133
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,240
She's indeed from a tribe that knows horses.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,799
Moreover, this new hay is far away from the stable.

135
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,699
And she's such a delicate girl.

136
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,100
She must have suffered a lot.

137
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,300
Bao Na isn't being reckless and capricious.

138
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,520
She's just doing her job as a soldier.

139
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,520
You have misunderstood her good intentions.

140
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,200
But she's so slow at moving the hay.

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,639
If my warhorses starve, who will take responsibility for it?

142
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,479
I'll get someone to check on them at once.

143
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,459
Just now...

144
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,520
Ji Chong told us about what happened between him and Bao Na.

145
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,500
I think if they can really be together,

146
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,300
it would be full of laughter for sure.

147
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:04,979
I didn't cherish it before.

148
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,540
But now I've learned that

149
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,939
these everyday moments are the priceless ones.

150
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,080
I'm willing...

151
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,280
to do anything

152
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,740
just to watch you live well,

153
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,679
like what I'm doing.

154
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,140
Yao Ji?

155
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,320
You're injured.

156
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,500
Chu Yougui wanted to kill me.

157
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,720
But I wouldn't let him have it that easily.

158
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,660
Stay put or you'll lose more blood.

159
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,000
I'll tend the wound.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,919
You'll go fetch some water and ask Ma Jing to get some herbs.

161
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,880
Let me take off your clothes and tend the wound.

162
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,080
My wound is all right.

163
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,839
He's the Night Fiends leader.

164
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,739
But he didn't even notice that I was outside the door.

165
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,659
Perhaps he lost vitality long ago.

166
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,959
With his condition, there's no way he can save people.

167
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:03,000
Yao Ji, the world is big.

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,459
Isn't there any other way to save him?

169
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,020
No.

170
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,919
Then, do we still have the medicine

171
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:16,440
that Chu Kui forced Wolf Boy to eat?

172
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,140
I don't have it.

173
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:22,599
But there's a type of medicine recorded in the ancient book of the Grand Diviner Palace.

174
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:26,599
It temporarily strengthens one's body and makes him more agile.

175
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,540
But it'll deteriorate the body.

176
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,079
Royal Father, why did you suddenly summon us?

177
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,320
Is there an emergency military situation?
[Jin's Military Camp, Luozhou]

178
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,220
Repeat what you just said.

179
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,439
Yes.

180
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,598
Chu Yougui spared my life because he wanted me to send word

181
00:12:55,599 --> 00:12:59,239
and hand this item to Prince of Bo.

182
00:12:59,239 --> 00:13:01,839
Chu Yougui carved this persimmon himself.

183
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,939
He said the persimmon represents the brotherhood among you four brothers,

184
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:07,520
and it's Prince of Bo's favorite.

185
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,718
What Chu Yougui meant is that he expects Prince of Bo

186
00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:13,199
to go to Suyang alone for peace talks and troop withdrawal.

187
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,300
There will never be bloodshed among you brothers again.

188
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:32,279
He knows that within the Jin Army, you and Prince of Xun have the closest bond.

189
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,519
Even if it's a Hongmen Feast (trap), you'll surely put yourself at risk and attend it.

190
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:36,919
Oh, right.

191
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,840
He also said that if Prince of Bo doesn't go there in five days,

192
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,139
he can't guarantee Prince of Xun's safety.

193
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,640
If he dares lay his hands on Youzhen,

194
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,239
I'll immediately sneak into Suyang

195
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,259
and take his life!

196
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,200
King of Jin, I have a request.

197
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,100
In order to prevent someone from acting recklessly

198
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,800
and ruining the grand plan, please

199
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,380
take this person down!

200
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,279
Why do you always not care about your safety?

201
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,660
Publicly, Chu Yougui will definitely set a trap

202
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,339
and wait for you to save your brother.

203
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,880
If you die, it'll be a huge blow to our army's morale.

204
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,719
If you were as good as you were,

205
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:42,479
there might be a small chance.

206
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,579
But now,

207
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,180
even wood chips can hurt you.

208
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:06,860
- Privately...
- Privately, your life is in danger,

209
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,359
but you insist on acting brave to save your brother hastily.

210
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,860
Have you ever considered her feelings?

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
King of Jin, for the sake of our troops,

212
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,060
please put the general in jail.

213
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,919
Before he recovers, we can't let him act recklessly.

214
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,699
Guards.

215
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:40,180
General, I'm sorry about this.

216
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,419
- Take him away.
- General, please.

217
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,500
He'll understand your good intentions.

218
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,679
Prince of Chuan, it's time to eat.

219
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:15,379
Put it there.

220
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,318
Quickly eat it while it's still warm. Don't starve yourself.

221
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,000
You may leave.

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,840
Yes.

223
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,420
Prince of Chuan, it's time to eat!

224
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,059
Prince of Chuan, the food is getting cold!

225
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,579
Prince of Chuan, it's...

226
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,419
Yelu Bao Na?

227
00:16:57,359 --> 00:16:59,238
Are you not supposed to be in the palace?

228
00:16:59,239 --> 00:17:01,660
Why did you sneak out again?

229
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,180
You're not eating well!

230
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,660
That's how you lost the two inches!

231
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,299
Didn't I say that I don't want to see you?

232
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,639
Can't you see it?

233
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,339
I'm not interested in accepting your kindness!

234
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,179
The enemy troops are now in Suyang.

235
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:18,920
The great war is coming.

236
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:23,439
Do you know how worried Prince of Bo is about Chu Youzhen's safety?

237
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,200
Do you know that Zhaixing risked taking medicine

238
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,299
to help Prince of Bo save people?

239
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,559
Do you know that Chu Youzhen will probably be killed

240
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,720
by Chu Yougui at any moment?

241
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:38,100
You are a princess.

242
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,760
You're usually allowed to do as you please.

243
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,760
But if something happens to you,

244
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:46,559
your brother will unhesitatingly form an alliance with Chu Yougui,

245
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,559
and there will be countless casualties.

246
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,480
It will all be because of you.

247
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,519
- Have you ever thought about that?
- I...

248
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,399
I haven't.

249
00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:57,580
Of course you haven't!

250
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,760
Because you are someone who acts just with oneself in mind,

251
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,438
forcing others to accept your kindness

252
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:05,419
and never cares for others' lives!

253
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,479
I just want to quietly stay by your side to take care of you.

254
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,619
I don't know what I've done wrong.

255
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,119
I don't need your care!

256
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,100
In fact, when I see you,

257
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,159
I see trouble.

258
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:23,999
I think you're just a burden.

259
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,339
You're simply a troublemaker!

260
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,699
Leave now.

261
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,060
I don't want to see you here again.

262
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,399
Young Marshal, you've never been this harsh.

263
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,739
You must know that the princess meant well.

264
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,150
And you said those hurtful things

265
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,310
because you're worried about her safety here.

266
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:07,219
So you are forcing her to leave.

267
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,439
Help me take good care of her,

268
00:20:10,439 --> 00:20:13,620
until someone is here to take her back to the palace safely.

269
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,920
Yes.

270
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,579
Why are they howling so sadly?

271
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,118
There's no movement in the enemy troop yet?

272
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,339
No movement yet.

273
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,540
Okay.

274
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,139
Since Prince of Bo isn't showing up,

275
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,660
I'll give him some pressure then.

276
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:25,580
Chu Youzhen was whipped so badly atop the castle wall.

277
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,318
Should we let Prince of Bo know about it?

278
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:28,800
Of course not.

279
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,699
Prince of Bo's life is in danger.

280
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,800
If he finds out about Chu Youzhen's plight,

281
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,780
even if he has only his last breath left, he'll crawl to Suyang to save him.

282
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,719
This must be Chu Yougui's trick.

283
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,639
Having seen no movement in our troops,

284
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,599
he wanted to force Prince of Bo to show up.

285
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:48,559
And it's more than that.

286
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,960
It seems that we've underestimated him.

287
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,180
At this moment, we can only fight to the death.

288
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,279
Spread my military decree.

289
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,799
Our entire army will ambush Suyang tomorrow night!

290
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,400
Wait!

291
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
Greetings, Princess.

292
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,800
You've found the antidote to save Prince of Bo?

293
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,000
You're indeed of royal blood.

294
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,800
As long as Prince of Bo is back safe,

295
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I don't care about how many enemy troops there will be coming.

296
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Marquis, you're right.

297
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,600
General's recovery will surely boost our troops' morale.

298
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,800
By then, our troops will turn the tables

299
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,200
in the battle of saving Chu Youzhen.

300
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,600
Zhaixing, can Prince of Bo truly recover?

301
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,800
If I weren't sure,

302
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,500
would I stand here in front of you all?

303
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,000
After the general recovers,

304
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,600
we'll then talk about attacking Suyang.

305
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
King of Jin.

306
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,600
If God willing, we manage

307
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,000
to break through Suyang,

308
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,600
I have a wish.

309
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,700
May you grant it.

310
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Princess, please say it.

311
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,600
If the plan is a success,

312
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
by then,

313
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,200
whether I'm alive or not,

314
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,600
please ensure that the people will have a peaceful and happy life.

315
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,300
Spare them from the suffering of changing dynasties and wars.

316
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,600
That's the plan, to begin with.

317
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,300
Moreover, once the world goes back to normal,

318
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,000
I need you to lead us all to return to the former dynasty's glory.

319
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,200
There's no need to talk about the former dynasty.

320
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,500
What the people want is the future.

321
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,900
King of Jin,

322
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,500
I entrust you with the great responsibility

323
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,700
of taking good care of the people.

324
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Our top priority now is to save the general.

325
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm taking off first.

326
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Something seems off with Zhaixing.

327
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,500
Why did she say such a thing?

328
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,400
Juyao, you're overthinking.

329
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,600
Princess will surely fight alongside us until the end.

330
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,000
Also, we will definitely ensure her safety.

331
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,500
Right?

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,900
We should be the ones to risk life and limb.

333
00:24:56,719 --> 00:24:58,799
Young Marshal, are you really going to

334
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,200
sneak into Suyang and save him alone?

335
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Although Prince of Bo has been saved by Zhaixing

336
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,800
and he's recovering, he can't go there by himself.

337
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,200
Youzhen is in grave danger.

338
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,200
We can delay no more.

339
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
But you going alone—

340
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
I've found a secret tunnel.

341
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,400
It's a dry well to Suyang

342
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,200
and it fits only one person.

343
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't want to tell others

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,400
because I'm afraid they'll stop me.

345
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,300
Especially Prince of Bo, he'll stop me for sure.

346
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,500
So you must keep my secret.

347
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,600
Don't let anyone find out, understand?

348
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Hey, why that sad face?

349
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Don't you have faith in my skills?

350
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,200
Come back safely as soon as possible.

351
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,400
- Young Marshal—
- Got it.

352
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,500
If there's nothing else,

353
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,800
you should leave first.

354
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,400
I need to pack for it.

355
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
Yes.

356
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Qitan amber?

357
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,500
Yelu Bao Na?

358
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,300
You're awake.

359
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,300
How do you feel?

360
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Did I hurt you?

361
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,800
I'm all right.

362
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,600
You just had the medicine and your body is weak,

363
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,400
you should take more rest.

364
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,900
Thanks.

365
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,100
Yao Ji, thank you.

366
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,500
It's not something to be happy about.

367
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,400
Because there's black blood in you.

368
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,400
It means the drug has taken effect.

369
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,400
Say it.

370
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,700
How many days left do I have?

371
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,600
Your body isn't as strong as Prince of Bo's.

372
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,400
I reckon it's only a few days.

373
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
Zhaixing,

374
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,000
I've never given up on Prince of Bo.

375
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,400
And I won't give up on you, either.

376
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,100
But I really don't know how to make you and—

377
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,200
I'm fulfilling the wish of my loved one,

378
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,200
and I don't regret it.

379
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,800
Yao Ji, do me a favor.

380
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,300
Don't tell Prince of Bo.

381
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,400
These are my last days.

382
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,600
And I want to spend it well together with Prince of Bo.

383
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll leave no regrets.

384
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,600
Then,

385
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I can focus on saving Youzhen,

386
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,400
to fulfill his wish.

387
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Shoot!

388
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,800
The enemy army is no match for me.

389
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
It's hard to defend against all sizes of arrows.

390
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,500
I prepared the secret tunnel.

391
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,000
But I never thought the useless Prince of Bo

392
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,300
wouldn't dare to come here himself.

393
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,600
Find me his body!

394
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,100
Yes!

395
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,500
General, Young Feudal Mistress wants to see you.

396
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,400
Young Mistress, he's here.

397
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,700
Unlock the shackles and you may leave.

398
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,000
I have something to talk to him about.

399
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,500
Yes, Young Mistress.

400
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,400
Do you blame me?

401
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Why would I?

402
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,600
I know you mean well.

403
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,000
What happened?

404
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
Why did you ask me to come here?

405
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,000
And you're even wearing a wedding dress.

406
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Yao Ji has found the antidote.

407
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,000
Today will be your rebirth day.

408
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,900
What antidote?

409
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,400
Yao Ji said many things, but I didn't understand.

410
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
You should ask her next time.

411
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,400
Yao Ji has spent years looking for the antidote.

412
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,800
Why did she find it once you went there?

413
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,400
It went too smoothly.

414
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,600
I feel there's something wrong with you now.

415
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,000
What really happened?

416
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,200
I'm a girl wearing a wedding dress

417
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
who has prepared this wedding ceremony.

418
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,800
And I was waiting for my loved one to come here.

419
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
It's abnormal enough.

420
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,800
I feel so embarrassed that I want to hide in a hole.

421
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,800
And you insist that something's off with me?

422
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,400
It's your rebirth day and I want to marry you so badly.

423
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
That's what's wrong with it.

424
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,400
Something's off with me.

425
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,300
I'm too happy.

426
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,300
I never thought that

427
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,000
we'd love each other and grow old together.

428
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,300
I really want

429
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,600
to spend the rest of my life with you like this.

430
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,800
Once I take the antidote,

431
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,800
I'll head to Suyang and save Fourth Brother first.

432
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,300
And when I'm back,

433
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,100
I'll give you a real grand wedding.

434
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,400
I'll then take you back to Langshou Mountain

435
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,000
and we'll live a life of our own.

436
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,900
And fulfill those wishes of ours.

437
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,300
What do you think?

438
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
Why are you crying?

439
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,600
I really...

440
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,500
want to go back to Langshou Mountain with you.

441
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,000
And we will never be apart again.

442
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,400
Silly Xing'er.

443
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
We will never be apart again.

444
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
We won't.

445
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,600
Since you want to marry me,

446
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:00,300
let's kowtow to Heaven and Earth.

447
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Thank you for agreeing to be my wife.

448
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm no longer alone.

449
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,200
From then on, I'll protect you forever.

450
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
We'll never be apart.

451
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,100
I promise you.

452
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
We'll never be apart.

453
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:18,800
♫ Even I am basked under the scorching sun, love remains ♫

454
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,700
♫ I’ve no tears left so I cannot be your oasis ♫

455
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,600
♫ Hiding behind you, living forever in a universe you can't see ♫

456
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:35,100
♫ Hiding behind you, living forever in a universe you can't see ♫

457
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
♫ It won't hurt, it can't hurt, I will be the toughest rock ♫

458
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,800
♫ Can't dream, won't dream, I was born with no flesh and blood ♫

459
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:59,600
♫ Not gentle, cannot be sad, you don’t need to understand ♫

460
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,600
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later,
I will be waiting here ♫

461
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:09,300
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later,
I will be waiting here ♫

462
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Do you think putting on

463
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,400
this rouge will be good on our wedding day?

464
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm fine with anything as long as it's you.

465
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:49,400
♫ I’ve no tears left so I cannot be your oasis ♫

466
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,800
♫ Hiding behind you, living forever in a universe you can't see ♫

467
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,680
♫ It won't hurt, it can't hurt, I will be the toughest rock ♫

468
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:12,400
♫ Can't dream, won't dream, I was born with no flesh and blood ♫

469
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:20,300
♫ Not gentle, cannot be sad, you don’t need to understand ♫

470
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,100
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later... ♫

471
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,200
In this life,

472
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,500
to be able to receive your love,

473
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,600
I'm already contented.

474
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,400
If there's a next life,

475
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,700
then in the next life,

476
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,100
you need to keep enjoying watching the butterflies.

477
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,400
I believe as long as we keep enjoying watching butterflies,

478
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,000
we will surely recognize each other in the next life.

479
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,800
Xing'er, you...

480
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,500
In order to fulfill your wish,

481
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,300
I've put some tranquilizer in the rouge container.

482
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,500
When you wake up,

483
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,700
your fourth brother will be back.

484
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,900
That's great, Wolf Boy.

485
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,600
Even if there's only half a year,

486
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,300

[Flowing Backward 倒流 by Jolin Tsai 蔡依林]

488
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,000
♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

489
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,900
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

490
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:33,000
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

491
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,200
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

492
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:45,600
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

493
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,600
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

494
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:59,800
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

495
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,600
♫ Forever being together ♫

496
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,200
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

497
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,200
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

498
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,360
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

499
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,500
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

500
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,800
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

501
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,800
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

502
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,000
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

503
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,000
♫ Forever being together ♫
