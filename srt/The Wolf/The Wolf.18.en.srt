[The Wolf]

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,800
[Episode 18]
Sir, over here. Try it out.

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,300
Your Highness, there's no need—

21
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,800
It's just a shot.

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,800
I'll just see how hard it is.

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,500
Right on the mark!

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,400
Nice!

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
So you like the jade butterfly?

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,700
You should have said so.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,800
I didn't—

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,400
Right on the mark again!

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,790
Great job!

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,200
Boss!

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,900
Do you have two jade butterfly ready?

32
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,200
Come on!

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,600
Just my luck.

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,800
Who are these people anyway?

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,000
Gentlemen, congratulations.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Congratulations.

37
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,100
However, this is merely the first challenge.

38
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,600
It's just to warm you up.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,200
The prize is not the jade butterfly, it's a jade ring.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,600
A jade ring.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Boss!

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,300
This is clearly a scam!

43
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,900
You promised them the prize would be a jade butterfly!

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,000
Am I right?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,100
That's right!

46
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,800
Just go.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,700
You don't know anything.

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,800
Boss, your contraption is too easy to beat.

49
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Hang a few more hoops on it.

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
If I miss,

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,200
I don't get any of your prizes.

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,900
You...You are the one who said it.

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,000
Just pick up the pace.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,200
I am waiting to get the jade butterfly.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Sure!

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
However, if I hit the mark this time,

57
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,000
I am truly getting a jade butterfly. Right?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,300
Yes, certainly! Certainly!

59
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,800
Not just a jade butterfly,

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,900
even if Zhaixing wants the stars up in the night sky,

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,300
I will get it for her.

62
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,000
A young hero, indeed.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's an incredible marksman.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
More hoops going on.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,600
That's a lot!

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
Can he handle it?

67
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,400
Hold on.

68
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
He is making it impossible.

69
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
This is too difficult for anyone.

70
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,500
Look! He hit it again!

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,000
Remarkable skill!

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,100
- Impressive!
- Great shot!

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,000
Look! He hit it, too!

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,200
Incredible!

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
What now?

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,600
They both hit the marks.

77
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,400
Great skill!

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,500
Gentlemen, I am running a small business here.

79
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,100
I only have one jade butterfly.

80
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,500
Well...

81
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,200
This is the most valuable prize I have.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,800
But both of you beat the challenge. I...

83
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Boss!

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,600
I want you to put on as many hoops as you have.

85
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,000
If I miss, you get all your money back, plus interest.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
As for your prized jade butterfly,

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
let's not make it hard for the boss.

88
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,000
Better skill wins the prize.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,200
How does that sound?

90
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Sure. All right.

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,600
All right.

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Get all the hoops we have.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,700
He can't hit it.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,500
The more, the better.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,000
There is no way he can hit it.

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
Gentlemen, let's begin.

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Boss, you are scamming them.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
- There is no way you can hit the mark.
- That's right! Right!

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is impossible to hit!

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,900
Lose some hoops!

101
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,200
No way this can be done!

102
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,400
No way!

103
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,600
I thank you for rooting for me!

104
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
You are all good people.

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,000
If I hit the mark, the jade butterfly goes to this beauty.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,800
And the money will get you some drinks!

107
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Great!

108
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
An honorable young man!

109
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Thank you, Sir!

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,000
Lady, pick him!

111
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,400
He can surely hit it!

112
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,200
Right! He can do it!

113
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,100
You have our support!

114
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,800
Boss, this time, can I use my sword?

115
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
If it goes through all the hoops and hits the mark,

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,300
I win.

117
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
As long as you hit the mark, do as you wish.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,200
- All right, you gave me your word.
- Yes.

119
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,000
This is impossible.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,300
Look at him.

121
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,800
He can't get it.

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,900
First time for everything.

123
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
The world never ceases to surprise.

124
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
He is using a sword?

125
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,800
What kind of archery is this?

126
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,200
- I've never seen this before.
- You're right.

127
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Can he do it?

128
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Great shot!

129
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,700
Incredible!

130
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,600
Nice!

131
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,300
Great skill!

132
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Nice!

133
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
This is unbelievable!

134
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Man in black outfit, your turn!

135
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,800
Take your shot! Shoot!

136
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,800
Draw your sword!

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,700
Come on!

138
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Surrendering already?

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,400
What are you waiting for?

140
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,100
Show us what you got!

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He wouldn't even draw his sword.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,800
Maybe this one-of-a-kind jade butterfly goes to me.

143
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,900
Give it a try!

144
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,400
Hurry up! Hurry!

145
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,000
There! Hand it over!

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,800
Give it to him!

147
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Great!

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,700
- Zhaixing.
- Sir, let's get some drinks!

149
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
You promised us!

150
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's drink heartily.

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
Fine!

152
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,300
Hey!

153
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,800
Put me down!

154
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
What are you doing?

155
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,800
- Zhaixing!
- Put me down!

156
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Zhaixing!

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
Put me down! What are you doing?

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,300
All right. We'll drink later.

159
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,800
What are you doing?

160
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,500
Put me down!

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,000
Stop now!

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,700
Did you hear me?

163
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,000
Put me down!

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,600
Hey!

165
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,200
Prince of Bo, are you out of your mind?

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, I am out of my mind!

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,400
I told you earlier that I have questions for you,

168
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,900
but we're on the street.

169
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,600
Too many ears are listening.

170
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,500
How could I ask?

171
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,800
So in this world,

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
what you have in mind to tell me

173
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,900
is what's most important.

174
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Fine.

175
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,600
I understand it now.

176
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,400
But I wonder what the mighty Prince of Bo

177
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,000
wishes to know from me?

178
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,600
I want to know if your health has improved.

179
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you take your medication on time?

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Furthermore, why are you still coughing?

181
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,500
Are those worth your time and effort to find out?

182
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,800
I want to know!

183
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,100
If Your Highness wishes to know, feel free

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,900
to find out from Wen Yan.

185
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,200
I am not a skilled healer.

186
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
I don't want you to be misinformed.

187
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm frail. Cold weather will take a toll on me.

188
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,800
I don't want you to be annoyed by my condition.

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
I shall take my leave now.

190
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,600
Give it back!

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,500
Give it back!

192
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,600
Your Highness, what about this fragrance pouch you placed in my hand?

193
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Was it also because I was your consort?

194
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,100
Not every woman has the quality to be my wife

195
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,700
and make me care about her so much.

196
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,100
You're the only exception, Ma Zhaixing.

197
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Give it back!

198
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,000
It seems like you are still attached to it.

199
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,300
My fancy words for you

200
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
should now...

201
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,500
You...

202
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Why must you be this cruel?

203
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I have stopped provoking you, but why must you destroy the past, too?

204
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,500
If you regret showing me kindness,

205
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,200
why did you insist to see me today?

206
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,600
Why bother asking me about my health?

207
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,349
Before he is done using the Ma Army for his own ambition,

208
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,950
he must care for you.

209
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,889
He must put on an act.

210
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,951
Otherwise, he would be disappointing to his emperor father.

211
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:20,630
He is Prince of Bo.

212
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,090
It's his duty as a good son

213
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:26,810
of the Chu family to fool the daughter of the Ma family into his own hand.

214
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,748
Ji Chong...

215
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:32,510
What you said is enough to warrant a death sentence.

216
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,988
I am not scared of you.

217
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:35,689
I've beaten you before.

218
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:40,049
Ji Chong, my wound is hurting again.

219
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:41,850
We should go now.

220
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,810
Thank you.

221
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,069
Don't mention it.

222
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,449
I know. You feared he would direct his anger towards me so you asked to leave.

223
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,689
But I also knew you would come with me

224
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,089
because any further argument with him

225
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,090
would make him hurt me even more.

226
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,949
Candied hawthorns!

227
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:21,589
Have a look around!

228
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,149
Candied hawthorns!

229
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,150
With those sweet words,

230
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,668
I'll get you candied hawthorns as your reward.

231
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:27,809
Have a look around!

232
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:29,410
Wait here.

233
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,970
Candied hawthorns!

234
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,780

no one else can see the wind.

260
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,569

Feudal Young Mistress Ma!

You are still recovering!

268
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,428
Why are you in such a hurry?

269
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:01,050
You'd better walk your talk.

270
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,490
Do not simply show your kindness

271
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,650
because of your sympathy only to abandon it later on.

272
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,290
This is why he misunderstood.

273
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:14,410
And...

274
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:20,349
I will search for a great doctor among the commoners.

275
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,250
The world is vast, someone must know a way to treat your leg.

276
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,529
But my leg injury wasn't your fault.

277
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,590
Why do you care so much for me?

278
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:37,769
That day, did he do it because of guilt?

279
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,300
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

280
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:52,630
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

281
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,820
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

282
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,860
♫ You know who I am ♫

283
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,170
You came all the way here from the city.

284
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,869
But what is this place?

285
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:13,809
Ji Chong, you're a powerful warrior.

286
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:15,849
You have amazing reflexes.

287
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,890
Tell me.

288
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,670
If you were to jump from this height,

289
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,370
would you be safe and sound?

290
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,089
This cliff is far from the ground.

291
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:33,650
If I were to jump off this cliff,

292
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,610
there is only one outcome.

293
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,809
What is it?

294
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,429
To jump off this cliff

295
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,309
and manage to survive the fall, no human is capable of that.

296
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:50,170
Either it is a wolf, or...

297
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,910
a man with wolf's instincts and reflexes.

298
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,089
That's it then.

299
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:08,129
Why hadn't I thought of this?

300
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,309
No normal human was capable of that.

301
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,910
Xing'er, what is it?

302
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,931
You've been acting out of sorts all day, but why?

303
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:48,109
At this moment,

304
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:51,109
I have only but one doubt.

305
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,490
Ji Chong,

306
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,940
would a young boy

307
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,370
who was willing to risk his life to save his friend

308
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,010
grow up to become a man

309
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,850
who abandons his loved one?

310
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:19,750
Would he give up on them just to save his own skin?

311
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:26,250
A man's personality will never change.

312
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,070
If he was born a warm-blooded and high-spirited young man,

313
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:32,409
he can wish to have a normal life.

314
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:34,989
But when the time comes for him to act,

315
00:19:34,989 --> 00:19:37,969
he will still be full of spirit.

316
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,369
He will never give up on his loved ones and not save them

317
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:44,870
just to save his own skin.

318
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,809
Ji Chong, thank you.

319
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,890
Thank you so much.

320
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:04,129
Don't mention it.

321
00:20:04,129 --> 00:20:08,590
However, I don't understand why...

322
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,330
Wolf Boy,

323
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,409
you must have your predicament,

324
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,669
but please wait a little longer for me.

325
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:33,550
Ji Chong, it's too late to return to the capital for today.

326
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:38,390
Tomorrow morning, arrange a meeting with Fourth Prince for me.

327
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,630
Certainly.

328
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:05,608
Sister Zhaixing, why did you suddenly come here to admire my eldest brother's painting?

329
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,990
Right. How is the preparation for the prayer ceremony of my brother?

330
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,170
If things go well,

331
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,609
today is the day we learn the truth.

332
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:23,169
- The truth?
- You two, what's going on there?

333
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,188
It seems like you had a good night's sleep.

334
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,070
You rested well.

335
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,730
Not at all.

336
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:43,010
After you left, I stayed up the whole night.

337
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,890
I came to a realization.

338
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,990
[Xun Royal Manor]

339
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,469
Master.

340
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,310
How is the situation?

341
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,749
Major Yang was careless.

342
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,709
Ji Chong overwhelmed him with his great skills.

343
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,229
The mansion is now surrounded by our soldiers.

344
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,229
But Fourth Prince is still his hostage.

345
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,649
Ji Chong threatened us that only you alone can enter the mansion for negotiations.

346
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:19,309
Fine, understood.

347
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,929
Your Highness Prince of Bo.

348
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,088
His Majesty is hunting in the suburban area.

349
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,409
He is rushing back here.

350
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,548
His Majesty sent a messenger pigeon

351
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:30,308
that you must take care of this situation

352
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,790
and rescue Fourth Prince.

353
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:35,749
This cup of wine was granted by His Majesty.

354
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,830
Consider yourself graced with his presence.

355
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,769
Prince of Bo is here.

356
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:54,709
What are you waiting for?

357
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,589
Come in quickly.

358
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,190
Close the door.

359
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,069
Let my brother go,

360
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,809
then I shall spare your life.

361
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:30,950
If I were to decide my fate,

362
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,389
of course, I would want to live.

363
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,689
Isn't that how we discussed it?

364
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:37,770
Right? Fourth Prince?

365
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,130
However...

366
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,628
Curse you scoundrel! You killed my cousin!

367
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:48,188
You won't get away with this! I'll chop you into a million pieces!

368
00:23:48,188 --> 00:23:49,729
Silence!

369
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,450
Your brother is a man who hates evil doers.

370
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,289
He is unyielding.

371
00:23:57,289 --> 00:23:59,970
And I know of His Majesty's nature.

372
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,170
Now that I have his son as hostage,

373
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:06,030
unless he kills me, his anger will never be eased.

374
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:11,129
Besides, do you really think I stayed because there was no way for me

375
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:13,730
to get out of this mansion?

376
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,589
Listen closely.

377
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:20,188
I stayed here on purpose.

378
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:23,410
I was waiting for your arrival

379
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:25,850
so we could make a deal.

380
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,749
I told you to close the door because I want you to inhale

381
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:35,169
more of my handy little trick that is Corydalis herb.

382
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,090
Now, check your zhongfu acupuncture point.

383
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,189
You must be feeling very weak.

384
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,809
I am sorry you didn't notice.

385
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,569
That herb was hard to come by.

386
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,709
It's odorless and colorless,

387
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:59,149
but its effect is intense.

388
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:02,630
In less than an hour,

389
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,850
all three of us will die in this building.

390
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,830
However, I do have two antidote pills with me.

391
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,189
Be patient.

392
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:29,448
Prince of Bo, I'll give you a chance to live.

393
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,910
Since Fourth Prince refused to show me mercy,

394
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:38,889
he... must die.

395
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:47,950
If you give me your word that you will get me out of here safely,

396
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,890
then the antidote will be yours.

397
00:25:54,669 --> 00:26:00,250
You must be feeling even weaker and frail.

398
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,209
That's the poison showing its effect.

399
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:11,728
- Third Brother.
- Look at yourself.

400
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,129
What are you waiting for?

401
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,709
Didn't you give up on First Prince as well?

402
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:21,589
Think about it.

403
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,150
Leave your brother to die and you get to live.

404
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,249
This is worth it.

405
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:31,370
Not to mention this man here has always hated you.

406
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:35,130
He never thought of you as his brother.

407
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,050
You're right.

408
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:39,209
It all makes sense.

409
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:50,209
There is only one pill left.

410
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:54,089
It will take at least five days to make another.

411
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:59,010
One of you will still die in here.

412
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:04,569
I just want my brother to live.

413
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:07,770
Aren't you afraid of dying?

414
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,030
Fourth Little Brother, before I pass on, I will take this man's life.

415
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,730
Brother!

416
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:24,230
Chu Youzhen, how do I even continue this fight?

417
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,890
Emperor Father?

418
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,690
Ma Zhaixing?

419
00:27:44,189 --> 00:27:47,569
Prince of Bo, I apologize if I offended you.

420
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:50,370
I was merely carrying out my order.

421
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,370
You...

422
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,189
You set me up.

423
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,910
It wasn't of evil intentions.

424
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:04,530
I merely wanted to let our father emperor witness

425
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:09,450
how you chose to give up on saving my eldest brother.

426
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,188
We made it seem as realistic as possible.

427
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:17,029
Even the poison effect was caused by the drug in Zhang Jin's wine.

428
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,350
I wanted you to believe that you were poisoned by Corydalis herb.

429
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:25,230
But I never thought that when my life was at stake,

430
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,788
Brother, you were willing to sacrifice your life for mine

431
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:32,230
in order to save me.

432
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,309
Brother, I am sorry.

433
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,160
Zhaixing, judging by the planning,

434
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,360
this must have been your doing.

435
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:48,648
Yes.

436
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:51,969
I hope that Your Majesty wasn't offended by my recklessness.

437
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,089
You were indeed very reckless.

438
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:59,949
What if Prince of Bo here had chosen not to save Youzhen?

439
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:03,350
He would have no way to salvage the situation.

440
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,729
That wouldn't happen.

441
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,369
I was certain enough Prince of Bo would choose to save his brother.

442
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:14,589
Which means... Sister Zhaixing, you knew my brother would save me?

443
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:20,950
Zhaixing, I am curious.

444
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,430
How were you so certain about this outcome?

445
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,310
First of all, yesterday in the marketplace,

446
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:29,590
Prince of Bo didn't draw his sword to use it as an arrow.

447
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,609
Prince of Bo is a man who doesn't easily admit defeat.

448
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:37,509
He must cherish his Fang Sword a lot and he didn't want it to be damaged.

449
00:29:51,109 --> 00:29:54,370
Secondly, when Prince of Bo stayed at the Ministry of War,

450
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:58,590
he brought nothing except his Fang Sword.

451
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,690
My Fang Sword.

452
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,550
When Fourth Prince returned to the capital,

453
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,630
he had been searching for the First Prince's Dragon Tongue Sword.

454
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,410
I took another look at the painting of First Prince and found out that

455
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:18,128
the hilt of Prince of Bo's Fang Sword is the same

456
00:30:18,129 --> 00:30:20,489
as the Dragon Tongue Sword's hilt.

457
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,970
I made a guess.

458
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,440
Perhaps Lord Bo reforged the Fang Sword

459
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,480
using the parts of two broken swords.

460
00:30:41,489 --> 00:30:44,389
One of them was his Fang Sword.

461
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:49,029
As for the hilt, it came from First Prince's sword.

462
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,489
The dragon's head on the hilt can prove it all.

463
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,290
This is indeed the hilt of the Dragon Tongue Sword.

464
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,769
I held this as a child.

465
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:08,789
Third Brother, was this from Eldest Brother's sword?

466
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:21,209
Had Prince of Bo really given up on saving his eldest brother

467
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:23,250
and felt guilty over it,

468
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,189
he wouldn't have reforged the sword.

469
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:29,170
He wouldn't really cherish the sword.

470
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:33,570
Zhaixing, I am curious.

471
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,250
Did you make your bet all because of this sword?

472
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:41,150
Indeed.

473
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,670
Your Majesty,

474
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:47,050
does Your Majesty remember when Prince of Bo risked his life to charge into the royal mansion to save me?

475
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,149
That was enough to show

476
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,050
that he is not a heartless person.

477
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:07,910
I once had a close friend.

478
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:13,970
Back then, he chose to save the weak

479
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:19,150
and risked his life to the perils in order to save them,

480
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,750
just like the current Prince of Bo.

481
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,289
And then...

482
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:39,770
this close friend of mine was wronged for a crime he never committed.

483
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:45,880
But when we met again, he refused to make an explanation.

484
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,620
Perhaps there is another story behind...

485
00:32:55,299 --> 00:33:00,460
the battle involving Prince of Bo and the First Prince.

486
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:04,939
So Prince of Bo didn't save my eldest brother

487
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:08,060
because there was another reason behind it?

488
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:11,240
Father Emperor!

489
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,800
My son.

490
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:20,100
I promised your eldest brother and Prince of Bo

491
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,419
to keep it a secret from you.

492
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,338
Father Emperor!

493
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:26,739
Forget it.

494
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,658
Youzhen now has doubts.

495
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:33,600
This secret won't stay hidden much longer.

496
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,219
Perhaps it's time to tell him the truth.

497
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,599
During the Battle of Binzhou,

498
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:48,359
your eldest brother achieved great victory,

499
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:51,680
but his lieutenant betrayed him

500
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,818
which led him into a perilous situation.

501
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:57,239
After the lieutenant's betrayal, it was an uphill battle for us.

502
00:33:57,239 --> 00:33:59,040
Under the circumstances,

503
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,659
one of us must make the sacrifice to stall the pursuit.

504
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,260
Otherwise, the whole army will be wiped out.

505
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,720
I earnestly ask Eldest Brother to give me the mission to delay our enemies.

506
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,418
I have received an urgent report from our emperor father.

507
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:18,480
Fourth Brother has left the city on his own to extract us.

508
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,999
Based on his pace,

509
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:25,698
he will certainly run into the other enemy troops trying to launch a pincer attack on us.

510
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:27,418
He doesn't know we've been betrayed.

511
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:30,300
If he runs into them, he is doomed.

512
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,418
Brother, I'll stall the enemies.

513
00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:34,279
You must save our brother.

514
00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:36,279
Judging by the troops we have,

515
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:38,239
that is our only option.

516
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,219
The Sage-Bind Bridge up ahead is the choke point to stall the enemies.

517
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:47,120
Once the bridge is destroyed, not even a deity can pass.

518
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,720
I understand.

519
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:52,340
Even if it costs me my life, I will destroy that bridge.

520
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,559
This is the Dragon Tongue Sword.

521
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:58,120
I know you like it a lot.

522
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,880
Today, I hand it to you.

523
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,720
From now on, slay our enemy with this sword.

524
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,020
Take it as we're fighting as one.

525
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,059
Brother,

526
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,020
I will borrow your sword for now then.

527
00:35:20,699 --> 00:35:24,020
As soon as we lose the pursuit, I'll return it.

528
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:28,759
As I said, keep this sword.

529
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,521
Use it to protect those you wish to protect.

530
00:35:32,379 --> 00:35:34,079
As you wish.

531
00:35:55,459 --> 00:35:57,059
Hurry! They are right after us!

532
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,259
We need to fall back!

533
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,859
Pick up the pace!

534
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:02,959
Brother! Come over here!

535
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:13,259
Brother!

536
00:36:17,899 --> 00:36:19,618
I should be the one to stop them!

537
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,880
I've been keeping a secret from you!

538
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,779
My lieutenant betrayed me and he poisoned me!

539
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,979
I'll die soon!

540
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,938
We'll fight them together!

541
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:29,259
We'll get the antidote!

542
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,779
Who will save Fourth Brother then?

543
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,440
If you turn back for the antidote to save me but put him in danger,

544
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,378
or if you sacrifice yourself, I would rather die from this poisoning!

545
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:42,959
Brother, leave now before they get to Youzhen!

546
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,999
Brother!

547
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:47,780
- Generals! Heed my order!
- Brother!

548
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,640
- Bring Prince of Bo to safety at all cost!
- Third Highness!

549
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,101
Go!

550
00:36:51,101 --> 00:36:53,799
Brother!

551
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:01,200
Quickly go!

552
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,259
Brother!

553
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,540
Let go of me!

554
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,719
- Brother!
- Your Highness!

555
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,340
Brother!

556
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,099
Brother!

557
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,459
So, Prince of Bo didn't abandon my brother back then.

558
00:37:55,459 --> 00:37:58,599
But because I ran to the frontline without permission,

559
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,120
he was worried I would be slain by the enemies

560
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,599
so he remained there

561
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:07,079
and sent Prince of Bo to rescue me.

562
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,780
He missed the chance to find the antidote because of me!

563
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,059
That's why he died, isn't it?

564
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:23,300
Your brother carried out his duty as a son with honor.

565
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,079
He was a great brother.

566
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,420
Emperor Father,

567
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:33,400
he is dead because of me.

568
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,459
I was the cause of it, wasn't I?

569
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,299
Youzhen...

570
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,178
Brother!

571
00:38:47,179 --> 00:38:49,499
Your Majesty, I'm to be blamed for this.

572
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,580
I shall go after him right away.

573
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,519
It should be me.

574
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:59,979
It pains me to see him suffer so greatly.

575
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:05,379
This is why I chose to keep the truth from him.

576
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:18,660
[Here lies Chu Youyu, the late Prince of Bin]

577
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,080
Brother, it was my fault.

578
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,699
I didn't know you gave up on the antidote

579
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,359
in order to save me.

580
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:31,699
For so many years, I've wronged Third Brother.

581
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:33,960
I saw him as a coward.

582
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,400
It was actually he who saved me,

583
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,039
yet I kept accusing him of not saving you.

584
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:47,599
Our brother gave his Dragon Tongue Sword to me

585
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,999
for he wanted me to protect those I wish to protect.

586
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,319
This set of armor has gone through countless bloodshed and battles.

587
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,779
He wanted you to have this.

588
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:06,039
As he said, once you were older,

589
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:08,319
you would understand his effort.

590
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,240
Brother, don't worry.

591
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,759
I am no longer a child.

592
00:40:46,759 --> 00:40:50,820
I will do my best to protect everything you have passed down to me.

593
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,499
I won't disappoint either you or Third Brother.

594
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:59,700
Now that you understand what he did,

595
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,659
perhaps his sacrifice wasn't in vain.

596
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,219
All this time it was your idea to keep the truth from me?

597
00:41:10,219 --> 00:41:12,279
Or was it our father's order?

598
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:14,178
You cherish your bonds with others.

599
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,060
Had you known the truth,

600
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,540
you would have blamed yourself.

601
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,220
So you would rather be wronged as a cold-hearted abandoned,

602
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,680
than tell me the truth?

603
00:41:28,899 --> 00:41:32,519
Third Brother, this is my fault.

604
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,619
Ever since I was a kid,

605
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:37,279
I've never truly tried to understand you.

606
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:41,920
Yet of all the people only Sister Zhaixing knows it all.

607
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,240
She knows you better than anyone.

608
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,540
Before I came here today, she told me you would come here to seek me.

609
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,939
So she asked me to give you this letter.
