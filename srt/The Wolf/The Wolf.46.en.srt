[The Wolf]

19
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:34,932
[Episode 46]
Our marriage has become nothing but a cage for you.

20
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:39,204
In this world, I am the person who wanted most for you to live a free life

21
00:01:39,204 --> 00:01:42,032
and not be a caged bird.

22
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,192
But in the end,

23
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:51,071
I'm also the one who made you live within lies and agony.

24
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:55,452
Now,

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,460
I'm going to open the cage and set you free.

26
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,331
No,

27
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,591
you didn't trap me.

28
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:20,151
You've always been the one who is most protective of me.

29
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:27,592
For all my life, I'll stay by your side and protect you,

30
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:30,251
but only as a friend.

31
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,312
However, you know very well

32
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:38,070
that Prince of Bo has always lived in the deepest part of your heart.

33
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:40,772
You mean the same for him.

34
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:50,231
You two share a kind of understanding that I can't interfere with.

35
00:02:51,952 --> 00:02:55,052
You'll risk your life to protect each other at a critical moment.

36
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,051
I've seen these things with my own eyes.

37
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:03,492
He is the one who will bring you happiness.

00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,212
I'll divorce you and explain it to the world.

00:03:45,531 --> 00:03:47,592
But right now,

48
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:50,112
I'm still your husband

49
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:52,472
and I want you to promise me one thing.

50
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,392
What is that?

51
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:59,451
Stay with Prince of Bo while he's recovering.

52
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:02,991
Be with him in his most difficult time.

53
00:04:54,152 --> 00:05:00,772
I've heard that when someone passes away, he can still hear

54
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:02,932
everything you say to him

55
00:05:04,531 --> 00:05:06,972
within 24 hours after his death.

56
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,592
Can you stay with me like this

57
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:13,291
and let me talk to Wen Yan?

58
00:05:20,472 --> 00:05:24,672
Wen Yan, while I was staying at Bo Manor,

59
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:28,031
you took care of me in every possible way, just like the others.

60
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,932
And all of you...

61
00:05:34,352 --> 00:05:36,991
have always taken care of Prince of Bo.

62
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:42,171
Your master doesn't talk much.

63
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,492
Even if he has suffered grievances,

64
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:47,052
he'll only keep it to himself.

65
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,291
But I want you to know

66
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,652
that he really appreciates

67
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:05,492
a brother like you in his life.

68
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:13,472
Prince of Bo had been brought up by a wolf pack

69
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:18,492
and so he doesn't really understand human feelings.

70
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,072
So much so that

71
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:29,472
he thinks humans are not trustworthy at all.

72
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,450
Get lost!

73
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:33,671
I'd wronged him,

74
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,492
but you've healed his heart

75
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,231
and made up for what I'd done to him.

76
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,532
After I broke his heart, you'd given him

77
00:06:57,671 --> 00:06:59,972
the most sincere

78
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,711
and longest friendship.

79
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:09,032
If it wasn't because of you,

80
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:15,351
he would've lived a lonelier life than before.

81
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:24,372
- Hurry and save Master!
- Save Master!

82
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:03,972
From now onward, Hai Die, Mo Xiao, and I

83
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,351
will take good care of

84
00:08:09,511 --> 00:08:12,092
Prince of Bo for you.

85
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:21,752
Thank you.

86
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:34,812
With regard to what Your Highness was saying just now,

87
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:41,231
that you'll take care of me for Wen Yan,

88
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:45,311
I appreciate it

89
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:55,452
but don't do anything extra.

90
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,512
I don't want any misunderstanding.

91
00:09:05,572 --> 00:09:07,971
There won't be any misunderstanding

92
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:12,632
because soon I'll no longer be the princess consort of Prince of Chuan.

93
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:16,851
I meant every word

94
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,012
I said to Wen Yan.

95
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:24,052
When I knew about everything you did at Boxiang

96
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:27,411
and that you intended to repay me with your life,

97
00:09:28,271 --> 00:09:32,491
I decided not to push you away anymore.

98
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:39,372
You've actually repented long ago and changed,

99
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,411
but you kept it from me.

100
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:48,951
Ji Chong told me the truth about everything.

101
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:54,352
I'd misunderstood you for so long.

102
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:58,211
Thank you for everything you did for me.

103
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,111
I hurt you first.

104
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:03,851
You'd paid back everything at Boxiang

105
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:09,612
when I stabbed your chest with an arrow.

106
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:16,752
You tried so hard to make amends and repay me.

107
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:22,411
This alone...

108
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,892
makes me forgive you for everything.

109
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:43,032
Life is short and unpredictable.

110
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:48,812
We never know who will leave us in the next moment.

111
00:10:48,812 --> 00:10:51,292
I think...

112
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:56,352
perhaps we should cherish every moment that we have.

113
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,991
I don't want to lose anyone important in my life again.

114
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:57,250
♫ I have always been guarding here ♫

115
00:11:57,252 --> 00:12:01,712
Your Highness, if you would like to talk more with Wen Yan,

116
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,712
I'll leave you to it.

117
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:07,111
Prince of Bo.

118
00:12:09,052 --> 00:12:10,932
It's getting late.

119
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:13,332
You should go back and get some rest.

120
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,070
♫ Your gaze was firm and warm ♫

121
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,350
♫ Like it was telling me ♫

122
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,470
♫ (Wait for me) Falling down for you ♫

123
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,460
♫ (Falling down) Igniting the fireworks of love ♫

124
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,671
After letting her go,

125
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:56,252
he must be dying inside.

126
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,451
What are you looking at?

127
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:12,452
Little girl, stop asking questions.

128
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:14,891
You just went through a breakup

129
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:17,210
and yet you're already browsing through the Qitan Beauty Album?

130
00:13:17,211 --> 00:13:19,812
Why? Is it forbidden?

131
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:23,112
It's creased up.

132
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:25,212
This is my out-of-print collection.

133
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,011
The painting style is so good.

134
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,891
Don't try to act tough.

135
00:13:30,992 --> 00:13:32,712
Stop bugging me!

136
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,812
Fine.

137
00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:41,592
A beauty must be accompanied by a good wine.

138
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:47,232
I've brought our best wine for you.

139
00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:51,272
Now you're talking.

140
00:13:55,731 --> 00:13:57,511
I'll help myself then.

141
00:14:10,052 --> 00:14:14,352
To be honest, you must feel really terrible now, right?

142
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,191
Tell me.

143
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:27,472
Why did you decide to tell the truth?

144
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:42,271
Because Prince of Bo and Zhaixing are the same kind of person.

145
00:14:42,271 --> 00:14:44,152
The same kind of person?

146
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:50,552
Prince of Bo chose to hide the truth for the sake of Zhaixing,

147
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:55,832
while Zhaixing chose to constrain herself for the sake of me.

148
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,472
But they were not happy.

149
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:03,771
As I fulfilled their wishes,

150
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,032
I felt unhappy, too.

151
00:15:07,692 --> 00:15:10,411
The root of the problem was

152
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,191
that both of them were restrained by the shackles of destiny.

153
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,671
They couldn't get close to each other.

154
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:19,871
It would bring so much pain for the three of us.

155
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:25,831
Hence, I decided to break their shackles.

156
00:15:27,611 --> 00:15:30,171
Although Zhaixing can't let it go yet,

157
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,851
the least I could do was to

158
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,272
tell her the truth and set her free.

159
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:42,500
At least she would no longer be the caged bird

160
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,790
that was confined by hatred.

161
00:15:47,971 --> 00:15:50,551
Do you not feel pain in your heart?

162
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,472
I do.

163
00:15:56,531 --> 00:15:59,171
But I'll let it go after a while.

164
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:03,971
There are many things in life

165
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:07,472
that are more important than

166
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:09,672
the romance of love affairs.

167
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:17,672
Prince of Bo has done all the acts.

168
00:16:17,672 --> 00:16:20,171
He even took on the character of a tragic hero.

169
00:16:20,171 --> 00:16:22,271
This time, nobody would be

170
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,912
cooler than me when I decided to let go, right?

171
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:36,352
You're the coolest man I've ever seen.

172
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:53,792
As I tighten my grip, I only have Ma Zhaixing in my hand.

173
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,971
But if I release my hold,

174
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:03,991
I'll have a sea of stars (beauties).

175
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,731
My sea of stars.

176
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:20,191
Stop looking at other women!

177
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:23,011
- Bao Na!
- You...

178
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:24,611
Give me back my sea of beauties!

179
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,691
- This is a limited edition!
- No!

180
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:30,091
- Give it back to me.

181
00:18:10,612 --> 00:18:12,212
Black blood?

182
00:18:13,052 --> 00:18:15,472
When did this happen?

183
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:17,912
How long were you going to keep it from me?

184
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,890
We both know that

185
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,851
I'm eaten up by disease and there's no cure for me.

186
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,832
Why are you so surprised?

187
00:18:25,832 --> 00:18:27,320
Did you come to see me

188
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,052
because something had happened to Fourth Brother recently?

189
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:33,772
You're still thinking about others now.

190
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:37,772
As expected, when you see black blood,

191
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:41,472
it means your days are numbered.

192
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,732
How long has this been going on?

193
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:51,031
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to

194
00:18:51,031 --> 00:18:54,212
sustain myself for a few more days and capture Chu Yougui.

195
00:18:54,891 --> 00:18:57,092
But now that you're here,

196
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:00,512
I guess there won't be any problem.

197
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:06,192
You insist on taking down Chu Yougui.

198
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:07,852
This is equivalent to...

199
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:13,212
This is equivalent to asking me to kill you myself!

200
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:20,692
We share the same fate.

201
00:19:21,732 --> 00:19:23,912
I know how you feel.

202
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,071
You know nothing at all.

203
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:30,212
You know nothing at all!

204
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:37,831
Yao Ji, please fulfill my final wish.

205
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:40,631
Let me live until five days later to capture Chu Yougui.

206
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:44,371
After Fourth Brother successfully takes the throne and reconciles with Jin,

207
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:48,431
it'll put an end to Chu Kui's tyranny and bring peace to the world.

208
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,632
Does your childhood sweetheart

209
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:57,651
know that your days are numbered?

210
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:00,271
I won't let her know.

211
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,712
After I catch Chu Yougui, I'll disappear from the world.

212
00:20:27,052 --> 00:20:29,391
This is the medicine you want.

213
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:32,671
It can relieve your pain.

214
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:36,872
I'll give it to you if you can walk over here.

215
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:44,631
One.

216
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:48,532
Two.

217
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,332
Three.

218
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,652
This time,

219
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:08,752
I can no longer grant you your wish.

220
00:21:10,371 --> 00:21:12,191
I really cannot.

221
00:21:49,651 --> 00:21:54,991
Are you here because you're worried about his health?

222
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:58,612
Do you know that five days later,

223
00:21:58,612 --> 00:22:01,311
Prince of Bo will sneak into the capital

224
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:03,311
to take down Chu Yougui?

225
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:12,111
It seems like you have no idea at all.

226
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:16,972
So it's even more impossible for you to know that

227
00:22:16,972 --> 00:22:20,270
after Prince of Bo takes down Chu Yougui,

228
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,490
he plans to disappear from this world

229
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:25,452
and end his life alone.

230
00:22:27,572 --> 00:22:32,992
Is it because his body has gotten weaker and weaker?

231
00:22:32,992 --> 00:22:34,792
That's why he...

232
00:22:41,932 --> 00:22:43,892
You're not so dumb after all.

233
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:47,092
You also noticed the changes

234
00:22:48,332 --> 00:22:50,592
and browsed through medical books.

235
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,251
But Prince of Bo...

236
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,872
He didn't want you to know the truth.

237
00:23:02,491 --> 00:23:05,212
How's his body condition?

238
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:07,351
Please tell me.

239
00:23:16,411 --> 00:23:18,952
I share the same fate with Prince of Bo.

240
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:24,711
I'll grant him everything he wants with no regrets.

241
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:31,750
But even if Prince of Bo hates me,

242
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,971
I want to tell you the truth.

243
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:41,252
This is all your fault!

244
00:23:52,052 --> 00:23:58,032
Listen! If you didn't turn his hopes to dust back then,

245
00:23:58,032 --> 00:24:01,630
he wouldn't have fallen off the cliff. Nor would he

246
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,332
be forced to take Chu Kui's medicine

247
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:06,791
and be eaten up by disease.

248
00:24:07,812 --> 00:24:11,531
In the Longevity Forest, he helped you block Chu Yougui's arrow.

249
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:14,352
There's no cure for him now.

250
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,391
It's because of you.

251
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:19,352
It's all because of you!

252
00:24:23,411 --> 00:24:29,491
Now, Prince of Bo only has half a year left to live.

253
00:24:37,692 --> 00:24:39,392
Great.

254
00:24:40,651 --> 00:24:43,671
It seems like you still have feelings for him.

255
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:47,391
If he still refuses to treat his illness properly,

256
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:50,191
I'm afraid he won't even make it past half a year.

257
00:24:51,212 --> 00:24:53,632
However, I want him to

258
00:24:56,891 --> 00:25:02,072
live carefreely and happily throughout this period.

259
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,592
And you...

260
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:13,192
are the only one in the world who can make him happy.

261
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:16,931
Yao Ji,

262
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:21,532
your feelings for Prince of Bo...

263
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,651
This dagger...

264
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:40,332
is the only thing Prince of Bo ever gave me.

265
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:45,551
But after the War of Boxiang,

266
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:47,472
I had to destroy it

267
00:25:49,612 --> 00:25:52,191
in order to save his life.

268
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:58,371
This is the closest

269
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:03,171
and the furthest distance between us.

270
00:26:05,972 --> 00:26:08,572
Although we share the same fate,

271
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:13,071
we don't share the same feelings.

272
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:25,191
You're each other's soulmates.

273
00:26:28,411 --> 00:26:31,631
I, Yao Ji, have never begged anyone in my life.

274
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,732
But, Ma Zhaixing, I'm begging you.

275
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:39,971
I'm begging you to take good care of

276
00:26:40,852 --> 00:26:44,732
his wounded and wronged heart throughout

277
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:47,191
the time he has left.

278
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:50,251
Okay?

279
00:26:58,332 --> 00:27:00,992
I'm very jealous of you actually.

280
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,651
I'm jealous that all these years,

281
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:10,692
you were the first person he talked to

282
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:13,411
whenever he had something on his mind.

283
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:16,832
Thank you...

284
00:27:17,932 --> 00:27:21,752
for taking care of him without asking for anything.

285
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,752
Thank you.

286
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:32,911
But in the end, he's not my Prince of Bo.

287
00:27:35,411 --> 00:27:38,511
He's Wolf Boy who has been waiting for you all his life.

288
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:05,712
You pushed me away a few days ago.

289
00:28:07,011 --> 00:28:09,612
Is it because you knew

290
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:13,071
you couldn't promise me the future?

291
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:02,572
Xing'er really wants to know if Wolf Boy is willing to turn into a human

292
00:29:02,572 --> 00:29:05,351
and stay with Xing'er forever.

293
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,011
You're awake.

294
00:31:02,011 --> 00:31:05,052
Just a moment, we'll eat after I hang all the clothes.

295
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,011
Why are you here?

296
00:31:08,011 --> 00:31:09,911
Where are Liu'er and the others?

297
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:14,092
Ji Chong helped in relocating everyone else

298
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:16,352
to make room for us.

299
00:31:16,352 --> 00:31:18,632
You need to recuperate in peace.

300
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:23,592
I don't need you to take care of me.

301
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,392
Go home.

302
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,211
Not only your body,

303
00:31:32,211 --> 00:31:36,571
my heart needs to rest as well.

304
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:43,612
Do you know

305
00:31:45,932 --> 00:31:49,612
the life that I wanted

306
00:31:49,612 --> 00:31:52,132
more than anything else

307
00:31:52,132 --> 00:31:54,372
and yet I could never experience it is?

308
00:32:00,792 --> 00:32:05,651
It's to live a peaceful life with Wolf Boy.

309
00:32:06,812 --> 00:32:10,211
After washing the clothes, we'll hang the clothes to dry.

310
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:14,891
He's very strong and so he can wring out the clothes.

311
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:19,112
Then, I'll hang up the clothes one by one to prevent them from wrinkling.

312
00:32:26,852 --> 00:32:29,032
Later in the day,

313
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:31,891
we'll cook together.

314
00:32:31,891 --> 00:32:33,492
Then,

315
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:38,712
we'll sit here and have a meal together.

316
00:32:38,712 --> 00:32:41,611
The food looks simple but smells great.

317
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:46,551
I'll put his favorite meat bun among the dishes.

318
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:55,792
I've repeated the scene

319
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:58,452
over and over in my mind.

320
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:09,232
But what if Wolf Boy is gone?

321
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:27,832
If you're gone,

322
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:31,212
I still want to live like this.

323
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:38,891
While being alone, I'll make a space for your clothes

324
00:33:40,212 --> 00:33:44,231
and imagine that your clothes are still hanging there.

325
00:33:46,212 --> 00:33:47,952
At dinner time,

326
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,531
I'll lay the table for you

327

Nonsense.

337

Yao Ji told me everything.

338

That day, I saw you passing out because of the unbearable pain.

339
00:35:00,172 --> 00:35:02,832
You were unconscious for two days and nights.

340
00:35:05,412 --> 00:35:08,312
I was so scared and worried.

341

this is how our everyday life would be.

375

and prepare breakfast for you.

Nonsense.

378
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,752
I'll surely wake up earlier and leave the bed before you do.

379
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:31,132
You'll sleep till noon.

No.

382

I just don't want you to wake up so early.

383

But I think I should get up earlier than you.

387
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,992
I can watch your sleeping face

388

389
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:15,052
Especially when he smiles.

390
00:39:15,052 --> 00:39:18,871
Too bad he doesn't smile much.

391
00:39:20,451 --> 00:39:23,852
I like to smile. I smile all the time.

392
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:29,352
It's just that I only wanted to smile at you,

393
00:39:29,352 --> 00:39:32,892
but you weren't with me. That was why I stopped smiling.

394
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:41,312
It won't happen again.

395
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,731
After this, Xing'er will always stay with Wolf Boy.
