[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,670
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,750
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,980
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,130
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,440
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs)♫

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,860
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder)♫

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,080
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,710
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,130
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,370
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,270
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13

♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,850
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:12,050
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,790
[Episode 13]

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,439
About the things that he knows, I believe that he's willing to confess.

22
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,030
Because this is one of the requirements for him not to be convicted.

23
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:48,030
I've said it. I don't know who hired us.

24
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,510
But from three to five tomorrow afternoon, as promised,

25
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,650
he will be at the Mountain God Temple on the south slope to pick up the princess.

26
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,830
In other words, during that period of time,

27
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,596
whoever shows up at the Mountain God Temple will be the culprit.

28
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:07,889
Hai Die and Mo Xiao, deploy to the Mountain God Temple. Get ready to take him down.

29
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:09,530
Yes.

30
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,469
Let's go!

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,650
Thanks for your assistance.

32
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,990
Actually, I've been waiting for you to thank me.

33
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,530
I almost got impatient waiting for it.

34
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,329
You really speak bluntly.

35
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:35,830
If I were not,

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:42,550
I wouldn't shoot that arrow and you wouldn't be alive and standing here to talk to me, right?

37
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,289
That's true.

38
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,670
I can see that we're of the same kind.

39
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:56,687
We will fight with all our might and spare no effort.

40
00:02:58,894 --> 00:03:02,094
We've only known each other for a few hours.

41
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,970
How would you know?

42
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,089
Earlier, you risked your own life to protect the princess with your body.

43
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:13,229
People's virtue and appearance

44
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:17,211
are shown the most clearly before their death.

45
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:21,170
Actually, I don't want to die.

46
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,910
I've promised him to return safely.

47
00:03:28,435 --> 00:03:30,035
You don't want to die?

48
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:32,193
If it wasn't for me,

49
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:34,649
just now you would have been dead twice.

50
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,910
How do you plan to clear this debt?

51
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,000
[Owe]
Here. Sign this written pledge.

52
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,389
Looks like you've been wanting to earn a favor from me.

53
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,029
I won't do any losing bargain.

54
00:03:57,589 --> 00:03:59,508
But there's only the word "owe" here.

55
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,309
What do I owe you?

56
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:07,129
If it's a guy who owes me,

57
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,489
I will ask him to pay me with money.

58
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:11,909
If it's a girl,

59
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,750
she can give me whatever she likes.

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,009
You may repay me with whatever you like.

61
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,650
About the girls you've helped back then,

62
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:32,710
what did they pay you?

63
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,750
Some pleasure moments.

64
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,969
And...

65
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,249
something I can't tell.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,970
I'm leaving!

67
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,870
How can I find you to repay your favor?

68
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,890
I have the written pledge.

69
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:03,570
When I want to collect your debt, I will come to you.

70
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,810
What a weird person.

71
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,369
Feudal Young Mistress.

72
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,309
The princess is feeling better now.

73
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:22,136
We should send her back to the palace.

74
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,229
Depart, back to Imperial City.

75
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:26,790
Yes.

76
00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:34,610
Ma Zhaixing,

77
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,469
you covered my beautiful face and sent me back to the palace sneakily.

78
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:42,789
Are you pranking me?

79
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,749
Who said that she will obey and follow the one who saved her life?

80
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:50,509
Princess Bao Na, are you going back on your own words?

81
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,209
Young Feudal Mistress Zhaixing!

82
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:55,149
- Your Majesty.
- Please rise.

83
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:59,409
You didn't let me down.

84
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,290
Your Majesty, this is not solely to my credit.

85
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,709
It's due to the people in Bo Royal Mansion and the soldiers sent by Your Majesty.

86
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:13,190
Hence, I can successfully bring back Princess.

87
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:18,669
Princess, don't you have something to tell His Majesty?

88
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:25,209
Your Majesty, please forgive my immature acts.

89
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,290
I burned the agreement and left without telling anyone.

90
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,949
I've caused you to send out so many people.

91
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,349
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

92
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,850
Your reckless acts have indeed upset me

93
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,369
but I won't seek compensation from you.

94
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:47,850
If I'm looking for compensation, I'll look for your king.

95
00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:00,568
My father has promised to loan his soldiers. Don't worry, Your Majesty.

96
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:04,829
After I return, I will ask for my father's forgiveness.

97
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,290
Feudal Young Mistress Ma, I don't understand.

98
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,809
Since the princess has been saved,

99
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,749
why did you stop me from disclosing this?

100
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:20,168
Do you know that the prime minister and others are still searching for the princess?

101
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,969
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

102
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:27,170
As the culprit that kidnapped the princess is still unaware that we've rescued the princess;

103
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,879
hence, the culprit will most probably follow the original plan

104
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,799
and appear tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. at the Mountain God Temple.

105
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,979
The people of Bo Royal Mansion have set a trap there.

106
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:38,698
We will catch this culprit, for sure.

107
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,120
The culprit... is he...

108
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,440
a mole?

109
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,819
Very wise, Your Majesty.

110
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,400
That's why the princess had to enter the palace in disguise.

111
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,699
It's difficult to guard against an inside man.

112
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,900
If that is so, from tomorrow onward, Princess Bao Na shall remain in the palace.

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,300
You mustn't put yourself in danger.

114
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

115
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,100
Young Feudal Mistress,

116
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,298
for tomorrow's operation in catching the mole, I shall send a capable man to your aid.

117
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:21,220
Both of you must catch this mole for me.

118
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,019
Yes. Thank you, Your Majesty.

119
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,810
You may leave. You may leave with the princess.

120
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,009
Farewell, Your Majesty.

121
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:45,429
Ma Zhaxin, you'd better not act recklessly, crazily, or risk your safety again.

122
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,229
Tomorrow, you must return safely.

123
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:49,749
Do you understand? This is an order!

124
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,469
Also, I have something to tell you.

125
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,449
You must stay alive for me.

126
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,549
I understand.

127
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,090
By the way, Princess. There's one more thing that I need your favor for.

128
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,509
Go on.

129
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,888
I have a deal with your Bodyguard Captain.

130
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:15,928
If I still haven't found you by noon today, I will have to pay with my life.

131
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,109
That man is really a copycat.

132
00:09:18,109 --> 00:09:20,329
He's rude like me.

133
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:22,530
Leave this to me.

134
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,330
I'm leaving. I'm going to the prison to settle with the captain.

135
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,369
I'm here to save you.

136
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,289
The matter that Your Highness bribed us to kidnap the princess

137
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:20,429
is going to be found out soon.

138
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:24,750
If you don't believe me, you can kill me later.

139
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,350
Okay.

140
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,630
It's you.

141
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:36,069
How did you know that the culprit was me?

142
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,930
You poisoned the princess's horse and gave yourself away.

143
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,609
Now, Bo Royal Mansion is suspecting you.

144
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,550
And I knew your identity from them.

145
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:54,249
Then, where is Princess Bao Na now?

146
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:04,609
She was rescued by them.

147
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,749
What about your other accomplices?

148
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,690
To gain the trust of the people of Bo Royal Mansion,

149
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,830
we killed all of them.

150
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,350
I kind of helped you keep the secret.

151
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:27,869
I have zero interest in the grudges and conspiracies of the royals.

152
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,629
But at that time, your plan was failing.

153
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,669
The people of Bo Royal Mansion are starting to suspect your identity.

154
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:36,790
That princess is no longer important.

155
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,469
If I wasn't here to inform you,

156
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:46,169
you... would be in danger.

157
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:50,030
Then, why are you helping me?

158
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:56,649
Ten thousand taels of gold.

159
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,830
I'll teach you a way to get away from this and stay out of danger.

160
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,590
You can save your life and maintain your father's trust in you.

161
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,730
What is it?

162
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:14,069
When I was earning their trust,

163
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:18,190
I told their mastermind the culprit will appear at the Mountain God Temple on the south slope tomorrow.

164
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,170
In other words,

165
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,889
you just need to send a scapegoat there.

166
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,809
Yun Royal Mansion is in charge of the princess's temporary imperial palace and horses.

167
00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:32,088
Even if I have a scapegoat, first, the motive is unconvincing.

168
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:35,449
Second, I still can't get away from this.

169
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,750
But there's one man who suits perfectly.

170
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,550
It all depends if you are...

171
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,630
cruel enough.

172
00:12:49,093 --> 00:12:51,997
[Bo Royal Mansion]

173
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,029
Young Feudal Mistress, everyone is ready.

174
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,010
The horses are ready as well.

175
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,890
We can go to the Mountain God Temple to catch the culprit at any time.

176
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:08,869
Before departing, I have something to say.

177
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:12,150
What we're going to face is the mastermind.

178
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,768
It isn't someone easy.

179
00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:16,850
This trip is going to be dangerous.

180
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,710
But when I call to mind that you're here to help, I feel relieved.

181
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,850
I have faith that we can rescue Prince of Bo.

182
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,390
Princess, don't worry. I will always be by your side.

183
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,190
I won't leave you alone.

184
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,669
We are at your command, Young Feudal Mistress!

185
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,049
You all listen to the Young Feudal Mistress' words now.

186
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,849
Will you still follow my commands?

187
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,669
Your Highness?

188
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,449
We are at your command, Master.

189
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,270
Prepare your swords.

190
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,489
Get on the horses.

191
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,950
Follow me to catch the real culprit.

192
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,649
Yes! Understood!

193
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:57,950
Young Mistress.

194
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,730
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

195
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,368
Why are you pulling me? What are you doing here?

196
00:14:01,368 --> 00:14:04,568
- I'm looking at Young Mistress.
- What's there to look at?

197
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:15,969
Your Highness, won't your presence alarm the culprit?

198
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:19,689
Don't worry. I have a replacement in the prison.

199
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:37,529
Prince of Bo, I will reflect on my wrongdoings!

200
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,830
I finally have the chance

201
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:46,069
to gift this perfumed sachet to you in person.

202
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,750
This journey is full of ups and downs.

203
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,610
I will cherish this.

204
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,089
Later, during the arrest of the culprit,

205
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:14,549
you mustn't stay away from me.

206
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,549
I will stay close by your side to keep you safe.

207
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:25,009
But His Majesty said that he's sending you to help me catch the culprit.

208
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,449
Listen to me.

209
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,309
This is the sword that you often use.

210
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:52,130
Prince of Bo, please protect us well.

211
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,450
Wen Yan, do make a guess.

212
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,630
Who will be the culprit?

213
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,850
Since it's an inside man, then it should be someone that we know.

214
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,089
Wait here.

215
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:05,209
Those swordsmen should be arriving soon.

216
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,729
After we pick up Princess Bao Na, kill all the swordsmen!

217
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,150
Yes!

218
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:20,910
Prime Minister.

219
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:28,130
Looks like you are the culprit who kidnapped Princess Bao Na.

220
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:32,089
By the order of Prince of Bo, we were lying in ambush.

221
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:35,208
Prince of Bo and Feudal Young Mistress have been released from prison.

222
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:38,610
Right now, they're on their way here.

223
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:41,249
Prince of Bo is coming as well?

224
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,349
Prime Minister, you better surrender.

225
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:45,968
Don't waste your time.

226
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:48,109
Kill them all!

227
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,270
Your Majesty, Prince of Yun is asking to see you.

228
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,569
- Let him in.
- Yes.

229
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:11,489
Summoning Prince of Yun to enter the hall for an audience!

230
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,449
Aren't you in a rush to see me?

231
00:18:26,449 --> 00:18:29,689
Now that you're here, why aren't you speaking?

232
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:36,169
Emperor Father, I have found out who the culprit who kidnapped Princess Bao Na is.

233
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,850
Who is that?

234
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,450
It's...

235
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,010
my father-in-law.

236
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,750
It's the prime minister?

237
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,289
Yes.

238
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,328
To defeat Prince of Bo and make him fall into disgrace,

239
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,209
he took this unwise move.

240
00:18:52,209 --> 00:18:54,849
The prime minister hopes that with the disappearance of the princess,

241
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:57,469
you will severely punish Prince of Bo

242
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,750
and indirectly gain favor for me.

243
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,949
What an evil heart.

244
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:08,610
He made me imprison my own son.

245
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,109
Punish me with death, Your Majesty.

246
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,589
How did you know about this?

247
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,270
This morning, the prime minister came to me and told me everything.

248
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,328
He wants me to work with him on this plot. But how can I tolerate that?

249
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,269
Right now, the prime minister is meeting with the villains

250
00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:28,949
to bring the princess back to Prime Minister's mansion.

251
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:32,330
He was planning to let me bring the princess to you,

252
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,769
so that you'd acknowledge that it was me who had found the princess

253
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:38,369
and performed a deed of merit.

254
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:40,910
How dare you, Jing Xiang.

255
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,290
I've appointed you as Prime Minister

256
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,610
and became in-laws with you.

257
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,370
How dare you repay me with this!

258
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,989
Calm down, Father.

259
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,568
It's due to my foolishness.

260
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,349
I was deceived by sinister people!

261
00:19:57,349 --> 00:19:59,149
Please rise.

262
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,870
Rise.

263
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:12,328
For this matter, you pulled back before it was too late.

264
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:16,069
You didn't go along with Jing Xiang's evil deeds and betray the kingdom.

265
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:19,589
I'm relieved.

266
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:25,630
Now, Jing Xiang should be in Prince of Bo's hands.

267
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,169
Yesterday, Young Feudal Mistress Ma rescued Princess Bao Na and saw through their conspiracy.

268
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:36,668
Today, I've ordered Prince of Bo to make use of their plot to catch the mole.

269
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,570
Very wise, Emperor Father!

270
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:45,270
I'm just relieved that

271
00:20:46,249 --> 00:20:49,769
you did not collude with your father-in-law

272
00:20:49,769 --> 00:20:53,110
and betray me.

273
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,729
Or else, I wouldn't spare you any mercy.

274
00:20:57,729 --> 00:21:00,949
I'm absolutely loyal to you, Emperor Father!

275
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,110
After Prince of Bo arrests Jing Xiang,

276
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:11,570
I'll issue an imperial edict to sentence him to death.

277
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,689
This way, I can give the king

278
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:18,170
a reasonable explanation.

279
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:22,530
Thank you, Emperor Father, for not killing the whole family.

280
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,568
You may leave.

281
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,729
Yes, Emperor Father.

282
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,690
Your Highness!

283
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,069
- Madam, please go slowly.
- How do you take care of Madam?

284
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,429
How can you let her walk around freely? Chuchu.

285
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:58,129
I went to my father's mansion to talk with my mother.

286
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,448
Suddenly, a group of imperial guards came and arrested them.

287
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,650
What happened?

288
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,030
Please find a way to save them!

289
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,750
They also said that my father is currently waiting to be beheaded in the prison.

290
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:14,210
I... can't save him.

291
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,490
Your Highness, please, I beg you!

292
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,089
If you don't save him now, it'll be too late!

293
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:21,329
I would like to save him,

294
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:24,109
but this is a death sentence personally given by His Majesty!

295
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,290
Chuchu.

296
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,549
- Chuchu. Chuchu!
- Madam! Madam!

297
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:42,890
- Chuchu!
- Madam!

298
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,948
What are you still doing here? Hurry and call the physician over!

299
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,868
- Hurry up!
- Yes!

300
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,849
Chuchu...

301
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:51,109
Chuchu, wake up! Servants!

302
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,874
Somebody, help!

303
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:55,041
[Yun Royal Mansion]

304
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,550
When did you arrive?

305
00:23:12,229 --> 00:23:14,609
I'm here just in time.

306
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:19,310
I almost missed this loving scene of you and Princess Consort.

307
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,369
I've prepared the things that you asked for.

308
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,010
The rest, I'll arrange for my men to send over.

309
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,469
Prince of Yun is indeed generous.

310
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,110
This is considered as my little token of regard.

311
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,450
This is...

312
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,669
This is Breath Stopping Powder.

313
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,128
Mix it with wine and drink it.

314
00:23:45,128 --> 00:23:47,610
Your pulse will be gone for four hours,

315
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,269
as if you were poisoned.

316
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:52,870
Although you've found yourself a scapegoat,

317
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,609
everyone knows that you are very close with Prime Minister.

318
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,549
His Majesty will still be suspicious of you.

319
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:04,530
You need to pretend to take poison to prove your innocence with your life.

320
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,309
This is the best solution.

321
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,208
This bottle of medicine may even earn Princess Consort's heart back and forgive you.

322
00:24:15,209 --> 00:24:17,450
Who are you?

323
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:23,570
A person who wanders about, who loves money,

324
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,310
who loves women; a mere rake.

325
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:35,429
I bid you goodbye.

326
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,790
Yesterday, the imperial physician reported to me that due to Jing Xiang's betrayal,

327
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:17,889
Yougui is overwhelmed with guilt and took poison.

328
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,928
Is brother all right?

329
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:23,710
His pulse was gone for a while and he nearly stopped breathing.

330
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:27,590
After such frightening moments, he was saved.

331
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,988
At first, I was still suspecting that

332
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,550
he was in this together with Jing Xiang.

333
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:39,949
Now, it seems that I've misunderstood him.

334
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:44,670
That's it for now.

335
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,210
Prince of Bo,

336
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:54,070
I foolishly wronged you and put you into prison.

337
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,030
You won't blame me, right?

338
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,570
I hold no grudges at all.

339
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,850
Good.

340
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,209
I didn't expect that

341
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:08,509
Ma Zhaixing would perform such a deed of merit

342
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:11,289
and save you.

343
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:12,729
Yes.

344
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:15,588
Thanks to Ma Zhaixing, I managed to overcome this hurdle.

345
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:17,689
Apart from this,

346
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:23,070
after Princess Bao Na was saved, she sent a letter back home.

347
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,989
Their king already understands what happened.

348
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:31,288
He even agreed to allow

349
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:36,850
Youzhen, the Fourth Prince who has been held hostage for so many years, to return.

350
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,108
These are all to Young Feudal Mistress Ma's credit.

351
00:26:41,108 --> 00:26:44,709
I must thank her properly.

352
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,309
- Zhang Jin,
- Yes.

353
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:50,409
I want to gift Young Mistress Ma the best silk and satin.

354
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,070
Please arrange for that.

355
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

356
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:57,830
On behalf of Zhaixing, thank you, Emperor Father, for the gift.

357
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,909
For Princess Bao Na to be understanding this time,

358
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,329
I am surprised as well.

359
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,349
Emperor Father, where is Princess Bao Na at the moment?

360
00:27:08,349 --> 00:27:10,090
At the moment?

361
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:16,330
At the moment, Princess Bao Na should be at your Bo Royal Mansion

362
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:20,330
challenging Ma Zhaixing.

363
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,609
Greetings, Your Highness.

364
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:41,430
May I know why are you here and making this grand gesture?

365
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:44,270
Ma Zhaixing,

366
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,069
to repay your life-saving grace, I've decided to teach you archery.

367
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:53,808
For my archery skills, my King Father and my eleven brothers said that they are excellent.

368
00:27:53,808 --> 00:27:55,989
Look carefully.

369
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,509
What an amazing shot, Princess!

370
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:19,910
Clap your hands

371
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,530
for my amazing archery skills.

372
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,149
What's there to cheer about?

373
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,470
Your archery skills are worse than mine.

374
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:34,250
Since young, no matter what I do,

375
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,270
everyone compliments that I'm the best,

376
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,650
but that isn't the truth.

377
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:44,230
However, the people around me are bewitched.

378
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,890
They lie to coax me.

379
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,070
Your father and brothers are trying to protect you.

380
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,469
I know.

381
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,270
In this world,

382
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:06,110
there are only two people who dare to pop the false appearances and tell me the truth.

383
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:08,909
One of them is Prince of Bo.

384
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:14,248
Three years ago, unlike the others, he didn't want to compliment my archery skills,

385
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:17,509
making a deep blow to my pride.

386
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:22,069
Because of him, for the first time, I wanted to work hard,

387
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:25,889
just to gain approval from him.

388
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:30,789
Is this why you learned to speak Chinese and write Chinese characters this well?

389
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:35,869
The second person is you.

390
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:38,089
But how?

391
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:40,929
When you mistook silk for the Bridge of Magpies,

392
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,309
I foolishly acted along with you.

393
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,529
When I saw that Prince of Bo gifted you the perfumed sachet,

394
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,689
that was the first time I became afraid of losing to somebody.

395
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:00,129
So, I purposely tampered with it to frame you.

396
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,810
You're a member of the royalty.

397
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,768
You don't need to compete with anyone.

398
00:30:06,768 --> 00:30:12,250
Your royal father and brothers will bring all glory and put it in front of you.

399
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:16,749
Yes.

400
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,090
I miss home.

401
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:22,830
It isn't fun here.

402
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,770
I'm inferior to everyone here!

403
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:30,230
Ma Zhaixing,

404
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,850
if you dare to tell anyone about this, I will...

405
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,688
Is this how you treat someone who saved your life?

406
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:38,749
Never mind.

407
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:44,249
You can even put laxative into the tea of the person that you like.

408
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:52,950
Back then, I really wished that Brother Bo would stay by my side forever.

409
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,789
Ma Zhaixing, I've decided.

410
00:30:57,789 --> 00:30:59,929
You can have Brother Bo.

411
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,649
Since you're older than me,

412
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,828
you're not as beautiful as me,

413
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:07,849
and your body is not as perfect as mine, either.

414
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,089
I'm worried that after Brother Bo cancels your marriage engagement,

415
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:13,670
you will spend the rest of your life alone.

416
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:17,630
Then, thank you for that.

417
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:21,749
Your Highness, the carriage is waiting outside the mansion.

418
00:31:21,749 --> 00:31:23,889
We're ready to depart.

419
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:26,089
Thank you, Princess, for being magnanimous.

420
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,090
For supporting peace between both kingdoms.

421
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,409
Princess, I wish you a safe journey.

422
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:34,568
Brother Bo, if you come to your senses one day

423
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:37,469
and realize that Zhaixing is not as good as me,

424
00:31:37,469 --> 00:31:40,769
you're welcome to join my clan and be my husband!

425
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:45,949
Zhaixing, if you get divorced by Brother Bo one day,

426
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:48,350
I will rush back to comfort you

427
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:52,570
and also celebrate Brother Bo being single again.

428
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,330
Well, you'll have to wait for a long time then.

429
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:03,589
I'm leaving!

430
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:56,130
We've finally sent Princess Bao Na back safely.

431
00:32:57,989 --> 00:33:01,489
It seems like you like the bow and arrows that I gifted you very much.

432
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:03,510
You bring them with you everywhere.

433
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,670
I really like these bow and arrows that

434
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,850
you gifted me.

435
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,589
Let me have a look to see if the bowstring is loose.

436
00:33:21,829 --> 00:33:24,490
When Princess Bao Na was around,

437
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,369
you did a good job.

438
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,369
Whatever you want, feel free to ask for it.

439
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:35,549
The perfumed sachet and the bow and arrowa that you gifted to me are more than enough.

440
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,050
What I want is really simple.

441
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,170
I just want pure, sincere love.

442
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,170
No deceptions, no lies.

443
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,590
When I was in the palace just now,

444
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,909
His Majesty gifted you a tremendous gift as a reward.

445
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,949
There's good news as well.

446
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,850
The king has decided to overlook this matter.

447
00:34:06,229 --> 00:34:08,329
Really?

448
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:12,849
That's great! Since we managed to borrow soldiers, the day of conquering Jin is near!

449
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,770
How's my spirit?

450
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:47,909
Better than men.

451
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:51,910
King of Jin,

452
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:55,130
I'm the daughter of Ma Ying, Ma Zhaixing.

453
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,569
You used despicable tactics

454
00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:00,329
to assassinate my father and my whole family!

455
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:02,790
This is unforgivable and intolerable!

456
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,330
His Majesty is afraid that you still care about Kuizhou

457
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:08,689
so he kept it a secret from you and released a second order to us.

458
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:12,889
That was to kill Ma Ying and his family, and leave only Ma Zhaixing alive.

459
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,770
When we meet at war in the future,

460
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:21,510
I, Ma Zhaixing, will chop off your head to avenge my father!

461
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,210
It's my fault for being unaware of it and not managing to stop Emperor Father.

462
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,830
I can never forgive myself.

463
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,770
This is a gap that can't be crossed over between us.

464
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:34,569
Come out!

465
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:36,309
- Go.
- Go.

466
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,148
- Hurry up.
- I'm afraid.

467
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:48,409
- You should go instead.
- Stop dawdling.

468
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:53,988
Your Highness, it's my fault.

469
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:59,308
We just want to let you two celebrate Qixi Festival again.

470
00:35:59,308 --> 00:36:02,650
If you want to punish, punish me alone.

471
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,529
Calm down, Master.

472
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:12,129
Your Highness, for the sake of the well-meant qiaoguo (a pastry made during the Qixi Festival) that they've brought,

473
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:14,209
please don't let down their good intentions.

474
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,668
Today, let's celebrate this festival among the two of us again.

475
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,369
Qixi Festival is over.

476
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:21,169
We can't turn back time.

477
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,989
As long as I'm with you, I don't mind any formalities,

478
00:36:24,989 --> 00:36:27,570
even if it's a pretended act.

479
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,690
Pretend?

480
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:34,789
If it can be pretended, I hope that I can pretend that the mistakes

481
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:37,490
I have done had never happened.

482
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:43,610
Your Highness, aren't you being a little greedy?

483
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:47,950
I just want to celebrate the Qixi Festival with you.

484
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,610
What about you?

485
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,970
Me, too.

486
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,849
Very much.

487
00:36:59,669 --> 00:37:03,708
Among these qiaoguo, only one has a red string inside.

488
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:08,310
So, the two of you must choose carefully.

489
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,129
You only have one chance.

490
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,049
If we pick the right one,

491
00:37:21,049 --> 00:37:24,749
will we be inseparable forever?

492
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,870
You may choose it.

493
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,869
There's a red string!

494
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:11,130
I knew that Young Feudal Mistress and Your Highness were destined to be a couple.

495
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,710
Hai Die.

496
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:21,449
Next up, you need to tie the other end of the red string around Young Mistress's little finger.

497
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:26,690
Then, tie the other end around His Highness's little finger.

498
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,449
In this way, both of you will live a long and happy life together

499
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,270
and stay inseparable forever.

500
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,689
Hurry up. Release the fireflies.

501
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,289
Isn't it beautiful?

502
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:44,950
There are a lot of fireflies.

503
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,949
It's beautiful.

504
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,349
Young Mistress is right.

505
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,969
I'm being selfish.

506
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,730
A white lie

507
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,370
and self-deception, they're totally different.

508
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,929
What did you say just now? I couldn't hear you clearly.

509
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:39,410
I must've been too clumsy that I broke the string accidentally.

510
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:44,290
Your Highness, this is just a myth.

511
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,310
I hope that you won't feel upset.

512
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,270
Never mind. I'm okay.

513
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:55,010
Enjoy. I have other things to attend to.

514
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:03,429
Why did it break?

515
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,809
Wolf Boy!

516
00:40:27,089 --> 00:40:31,289
Be honest, are you keeping something from me?

517
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,970
Zhaixing,

518
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,870
the culprit who killed your father is Chu Kui.

519
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:05,349
Are you having a fever?

520
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:07,850
Why are you talking nonsense?

521
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:10,589
My father is doing fine.

522
00:41:10,589 --> 00:41:14,290
Yesterday, didn't you go to have a meal with him?

523
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,450
My father even agreed that we can get married.

524
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,270
How could something happen to him?

525
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,448
Wolf Boy, are you awake?

526
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,590
Stop evading the subject.

527
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:56,289
Zhaixin, is Xiahou Yi dead?

528
00:41:56,289 --> 00:41:58,549
He's in Imperial City, living just fine.

529
00:41:58,549 --> 00:42:00,550
Don't curse him.

530
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:09,889
- So those eight years were just a nightmare...
- What nightmare?

531
00:42:09,889 --> 00:42:11,989
What are you talking about?

532
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,070
Nothing.
