00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,710
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,810
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,030
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
 (I tell myself to keep pushing on)

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,190
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,280
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
 (Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,920
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry) ♫

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,090
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,550
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11

♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,910
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:12,110
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,259
[Episode 24]

21
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,959
You're awake.

22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,080
It's really you.

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,379
I'm fine.

24
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:02,859
Don't be afraid.

25
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,700
It's my fault that

26
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,540
you fell into Yao Ji's wicked plot.

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
Who saved you?

28
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,819
It was His Majesty.

29
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,639
His Majesty now knows that it was all Yao Ji's plot.

30
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,280
Hence, His Majesty didn't blame me and set me free.

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,220
Did you say that His Majesty had found that it was Yao Ji's plot?

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,739
His Majesty thought that there was something fishy about this;

33
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:40,058
hence, he sent his men to investigate in secret.

34
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,298
He found that the person behind all this was Yao Ji.

35
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,679
She's the one behind this.

36
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:49,839
Father sent his men to investigate in secret?

37
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,539
Also, after His Majesty learned that you were injured,

38
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,699
His Majesty was so worried.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,560
Father knows about this, really?

40
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,159
Your Highness.

41
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,999
Xing'er.

42
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,739
I'm starving.

43
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,080
Okay. What do you want to eat?

44
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,340
I'll make it for you right now.

45
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,939
Go.

46
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,539
Meat bun.

47
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,420
Sure.

48
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:43,399
When I was unconscious, what happened?

49
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,440
Master, this could be resolved

50
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,700
because of Wen Yan's effort.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,759
He took all the blame.

52
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,718
Wen Yan? Time to have your medicine.

53
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,840
After Master wakes up,

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,799
remember to make another dose of medicine

55
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,900
for him to drink.

56
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,160
Greetings, Master.

57
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,759
I can't bow.

58
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,339
Please forgive me.

59
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:55,000
Without my order,

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,180
who allowed you to act without permission?

61
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,420
You're being recalcitrant!

62
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,859
I know that I'm wrong.

63
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:06,359
Please punish me.

64
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,559
Master, Wen Yan's meridians are broken.

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:14,680
If you want to punish him, I'm willing to bear it for him.

66
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,939
Master, if one of the Night Fiends disobeys, everyone should be punished.

67
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:24,239
I'm willing to take the punishment for Wen Yan, too.

68
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:31,759
The first one who should be punished is me.

69
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,739
I have involved you in this.

70
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,859
Please accept my apology.

71
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:40,940
Master!

72
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,479
- Master!
- Master!

73
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,360
Wen Yan, you sacrificed yourself for me.

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,820
I'll repay you for sure.

75
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,519
Master...

76
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,059
Mo Xiao...

77
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:04,560
He said that for Master,

78
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,180
he's willing to go against everyone, including His Majesty.

79
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:13,740
So am I.

80
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,300
Master, actually, after you fell in love with Young Feudal Mistress,

81
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,579
you've become more relaxed and you smile more often.

82
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,419
All of us like

83
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,180
the master who will do silly things for Young Mistress.

84
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,760
We will all die eventually.

85
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:39,660
If our deaths are worthy,

86
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,680
I have no regrets.

87
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,939
Master, I'm not a good talker like them,

88
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,580
but our beliefs are the same.

89
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:59,339
We just hope that you and Young Mistress can be safe.

90
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:08,440
I promise you.

91
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,858
From now on, I won't put you into a situation where you'll be defamed.

92
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:14,620
You are not allowed to sacrifice yourself for me, either.

93
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:21,679
All of us mustn't forget about this.

94
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,580
Yes, Master.

95
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,839
Mo Xiao, find the best physician to treat Wen Yan.

96
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:37,198
Announce that Wen Yan is on leave and has gone back to his province.

97
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:41,399
Wen Yan, stay in Bo Royal Mansion until you recover.

98
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,419
I will cure you.

99
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,279
Even if your meridians are broken...

100
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,120
as long as you follow me to train and practice martial arts consistently,

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,940
although your martial arts will be affected,

102
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,941
not long after this, you will surely be able to move freely.

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,360
Thank you, Master.

104
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,760
After what happened,

105
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,460
I totally realize that I can't protect Zhaixing by myself.

106
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,200
Even I...

107
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,220
might hurt her.

108
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,740
I always thought that

109
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,680
as long as she doesn't know the truth behind the Ma Manor massacre,

110
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,219
as long as the Ma Army is here,

111
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:52,540
she will be protected and live safely.

112
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,899
Although this crisis has passed,

113
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,600
it's hard to say when Emperor Father will want to kill Zhaixing again.

114
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,839
You're right, Master.

115
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,579
Besides, the Ma Army is going to attack Taibao Camp soon.

116
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:11,339
This battle is dangerous.

117
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,839
If their military is weakened, their value will reduce.

118
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,300
Young Feudal Mistress's importance in His Majesty's heart may wane.

119
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,976
I've received a secret report.

120
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:35,359
It's reported that the Ma Army is currently suffering from the aftereffects of miasma.

121
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,079
They are deep into Chu Kui's plot.

122
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:42,620
The Ma Army and Ma Ying are all righteous warriors.

123
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,079
Should we take justice as our responsibility on behalf of Heaven?

124
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:51,959
Well... What do you mean, Royal Father?

125
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,408
[Li Juqi, heir apparent of the king of Jin]
 Find him.

126
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,619
Ally with him in saving Ma Zhaixing and the Ma Army.

127
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:05,040
Protect the offspring of the loyal people.

128
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:21,880
Master.

129
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,279
You're quite early.

130
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,560
You have something in you.

131
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,698
I have some connections with the new warden of the prison.

132
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,539
Money makes the mare go.
(T/N: Idiom - money can make the most reluctant do anything)

133
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:38,878
Hence, he purposely arranged for me to deliver meals to this dungeon from now on.

134
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,180
Master,

135
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,800
it was Wen Yan who took the blame and ruined you.

136
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,059
Calm down, Master.

137
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,059
I can help you with my disguise skill and bring you out.

138
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:00,300
After that, you will be able to kill those hateful men in person.

139
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,940
I won't escape from prison.

140
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,180
I didn't for the last five years and I won't do it now, either.

141
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,020
Why?

142
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,999
Although His Majesty is only imprisoning you here,

143
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:17,520
but one day, he might behead you.

144
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,979
I'm not leaving.

145
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:28,660
If you insist on not leaving, I will obey your order.

146
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,499
I heard that the cure for the poison had been passed to His Majesty.

147
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:36,060
Never mind.

148
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,319
Also, keep an eye on Ma Zhaixing and Prince of Bo.

149
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,779
If there's anything, report to me immediately.

150
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,159
Yes, Master.

151
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,380
You may leave.

152
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:57,419
Is there anything else?

153
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,900
One more thing. I don't understand.

154
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,939
Why didn't you tell His Majesty that

155
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:05,419
it was Prince of Bo who spared Hong'er and her father?

156
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:11,799
This way, you wouldn't be imprisoned in this dark dungeon.

157
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:14,679
Wen Yan had predicted this step.

158
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:18,660
His Majesty knew as well that I would blame it on Prince of Bo.

159
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,379
If I said that, would His Majesty believe me?

160
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:26,760
If he didn't, I would also be charged with falsely accusing a prince.

161
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,810
Other than that, are you protecting Prince of Bo?

162
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,959
The things that you've done, now that I think about them,

163
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:47,200
every event, every step, they were all to keep Prince of Bo by your side.

164
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,679
Deep down, you're actually...

165
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,260
Shut up!

166
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:57,100
Why would I keep someone who wanted to kill me by my side?

167
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:00,259
I just think that...

168
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:03,979
defeating the current Prince of Bo would be too boring.

169
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:09,060
Master, what are you expecting then?

170
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:14,460
One day, when he becomes the Prince of Bo that I want,

171
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,319
only then will he have the right to be my opponent.

172
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:22,539
Will there be such a day?

173
00:13:23,599 --> 00:13:25,199
Yes.

174
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,599
There will be.

175
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,040
Have a seat.

176
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,478
Hai Die. Mo Xiao. Please sit, too.

177
00:13:56,699 --> 00:13:57,979
Have a seat.

178
00:13:57,979 --> 00:13:59,680
Thank you, Young Feudal Mistress.

179
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,900
Where is Wen Yan?

180
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,120
Where did he go?

181
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,440
Where's Wen Yan?

182
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,259
Someone in his family got sick.

183
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,319
He asked to be on leave and went back home.

184
00:14:19,499 --> 00:14:22,119
Why didn't he say goodbye?

185
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,059
It's getting dark outside.

186
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,419
Can't he leave tomorrow?

187
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,038
It's safer to leave during the day.

188
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:30,039
Ma Jing!

189
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:32,960
When your family member gets sick,

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,310
you will understand his restlessness.

191
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:39,000
Why did you curse me?

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,839
I'm just giving an example. No offense.

193
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,020
Just an example.

194
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,400
Ma Jing, I'll hit him for you.

195
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,579
Hai Die, why did you side with her?

196
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:50,020
She's an outsider.

197
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,038
Ma Jing isn't an outsider.

198
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:53,779
That's right! I'm Hai Die's good friend!

199
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:56,178
Listen! Good men don't mess with ladies.

200
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:57,918
Don't make me hit you.

201
00:14:57,918 --> 00:15:00,539
Or else, you'll suffer.

202
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,519
Watch out!

203
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,019
Ma Jing, listen. You can't hit me.

204
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,519
- You don't need to do that. You have short arms and legs. Don't you know?
- Hai Die, quickly help me!

205
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,939
- Coming!
- Sit down. Don't come near me!

206
00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:11,579
- Hit him!
- Stop!

207
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,739
How great it is to laugh and play like that!

208
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:19,440
As if we're living without any worries.

209
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,120
Do you know since when I realized that

210
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,100
being carefree could only last for a while,

211
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,019
not for life?

212
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,219
Since when?

213
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,180
Since I drove Wolf Boy away,

214
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,320
I have never been the carefree Ma Zhaixing anymore.

215
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,890
I will let you have a carefree day today.

216
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,999
Don't think about other things.

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,139
Don't bother with the rest and don't worry, too.

218
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,779
I'll accompany you to do anything you want. Just the two of us.

219
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,040
Really?

220
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,919
A little more to the front.

221
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,659
A little more to the right.

222
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:17,640
A little more to the right.

223
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,778
I... Your left side.

224
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,060
My right side.

225
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,540
A little more to the right.

226
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,739
Behind you!

227
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:30,499
A little more to the front.

228
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,239
This isn't carefree at all.

229
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:38,780
This is absolutely foolish.

230
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,340
We need to be foolish to be carefree.

231
00:16:43,619 --> 00:16:45,219
Your turn.

232
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,399
Sure.

233
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,460
Tie it up for me.

234
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,120
Done?

235
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,800
Done.

236
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,800
Which side? Right side.

237
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,919
Right side.

238
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,720
- No. Left.
- Left?

239
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,999
Left. Again.

240
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,180
- Behind you.
- Behind me?

241
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,039
Right.

242
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,040
- Here.
- Where is it?

243
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,579
In front of you.

244
00:17:57,979 --> 00:18:00,119
This isn't carefree at all.

245
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,699
You're taking advantage of me.

246
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:06,360
My carefree is about doing things as I wish.

247
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,798
I don't want to play this anymore. Let's play another game.

248
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,179
This isn't carefree at all.

249
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,480
As long as I'm with you,

250
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,398
just like this, even if we're not talking,

251
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:32,979
just sitting against each other's back, to me, it's a type of being carefree.

252
00:18:36,259 --> 00:18:39,100
Just like when we used to be.

253
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,080
Back then, I wasn't a good talker.

254
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,750
It was you who always did the talking and I listened to you.

255
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,739
When you were tired, you would lean on me and sleep.

256
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,200
That's right. I always recall the carefree days when we were young.

257
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:02,819
After I kept thinking about it, I would feel

258
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:08,359
that our meeting was the best gift from God.

259
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,959
How could it be a curse?

260
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:15,019
Why did you mention that all of a sudden?

261
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:17,720
I met Yao Ji in prison.

262
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,040
She said that you and I were cursed.

263
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,920
We can never be together.

264
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,020
What else did she say?

265
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:34,860
She also said that the real you is not what I can endure.

266
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:43,700
After the Slaughter Banquet, I did once have such a thought.

267
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,319
But I was wrong.

268
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,240
The Wolf Boy back then could change for Xing'er.

269
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,840
Prince of Bo now is the same as well.

270
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:58,219
Even if we're cursed, the two of us will definitely be together.

271
00:19:58,219 --> 00:20:02,578
No one can tear us apart. Do you agree, Wolf Boy?

272
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Wolf Boy?

273
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,779
Wolf Boy?

274
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,640
What did you say?

275
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,700
Did you just doze off?

276
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,599
Sleep then. You can lean against my back.

277
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,519
Hurry up! Send the ones who were poisoned by miasma here!

278
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,919
- Hurry, I need more men to carry the bodies!
- I'm here!

279
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,420
There's another one. Lend me a hand and call the army physician over!

280
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,179
Doctor, we're going to attack the Taibao Camp.

281
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:06,999
I'll ask you only one question.

282
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,858
General Ma and the soldiers went into the woods to scan the terrain.

283
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,119
Why did they end up like this?

284
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,179
General Ma and the soldiers were poisoned by miasma.

285
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,580
Poisoned by miasma?

286
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,138
It is due to the heat, moisture, and the dead air of miasma.

287
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:26,119
They realized it too late.

288
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,098
Forgive me for being honest.

289
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,378
The poison has gone deep into his internal organs.

290
00:21:30,378 --> 00:21:33,299
Treatment will only delay his death for a while.

291
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,019
General.

292
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,920
Have a seat.

293
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,379
Ye Han, come over here.

294
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,680
I have something to tell you.

295
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:20,539
I've been fighting wars for my entire life.

296
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,079
I have put life and death aside long ago.

297
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,259
My only regret is...

298
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:34,579
that I couldn't avenge General Ma's death.

299
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,400
We're going to attack Taibao Camp soon.

300
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,359
What a near miss.

301
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,000
General.

302
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,760
Ye Han, tell me.

303
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,480
If I hand over Ma Army to you,

304
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,859
what will be your first step?

305
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,740
I don't want you to hand over Ma Army to me!

306
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,570
We still need you to lead us

307
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,390
to avenge for General Ma Ying and support Young Feudal Mistress Ma!

308
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,059
Shut up!

309
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:28,060
Can I trust you and hand you the Ma Army?

310
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:38,379
Jin's prince has led troops to the Taibao Camp.

311
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:42,920
This undeniably has boosted the Jin Army's morale.

312
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,360
Tell me! What the most important thing is now?

313
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,579
I must immediately send a man to inform His Majesty

314
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:54,700
about the epidemic situation and ask for back up.

315
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,861
The surprise attack on Taibao Camp should not be delayed anymore!

316
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,180
Great.

317
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,900
Well done.

318
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,059
I'm relieved now.

319
00:24:09,499 --> 00:24:11,299
Go.

320
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,879
Report this to His Majesty.

321
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:17,279
Don't let the Ma Army get completely annihilated here.

322
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,920
Take care, General.

323
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,120
[Jin Army's Taibao Camp]

324
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:53,020
Your Highness, in another ten kilometers, we'll arrive at Taibao Camp.

325
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:57,579
Also, it is reported that there's a trace of Ji Chong around this area.

326
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,119
I knew it.

327
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:09,378
The main army will halt its movement. Take me there.

328
00:25:09,378 --> 00:25:10,839
Yes, Your Highness.

329
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,119
Here, have some tea.

330
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:30,579
Bro, have a seat.

331
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:33,600
Let me ask you something.

332
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,520
Sorry.

333
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:38,479
Please, go on.

334
00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:43,480
From what I've heard, Wan An Restaurant's Mr. Fang of Kuizhou

335
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,820
is your close friend, right?

336
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,259
Why did you ask?

337
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,699
I'm an official from the court. I'm here to investigate a murder case.

338
00:25:59,099 --> 00:25:59,959
Okay.

339
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:02,060
I'll answer all your questions.

340
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,118
Old Fang and I grew up together here.

341
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:08,419
But a good person doesn't live long.

342
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:12,339
If you need any help from me, I'll help you for sure.

343
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:15,979
Have you ever heard him offending anyone?

344
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,060
That's impossible.

345
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,999
Old Fang is kind to people.

346
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,880
He wouldn't even offend a fly.

347
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:28,100
Then, on the day of the murder,

348
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,299
was there anything strange about him?

349
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,458
That day, he came here to buy a packet of tea.

350
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:40,639
He said that he was going to meet General Ma Fengcheng that night.

351
00:26:40,639 --> 00:26:42,080
Ma Fengcheng?

352
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,719
Yes. Besides, he seemed troubled.

353
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:48,899
He said that during the night of the murder of the feudal lord's family,

354
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,339
a terrifying man came to his place.

355
00:26:52,339 --> 00:26:56,599
He looked exactly like the man

356
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:58,799
who was with Young Feudal Mistress when she was in Kuizhou.

357
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:05,480
But General Ma said that the one beside Young Mistress was her husband, Prince of Bo.

358
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,759
He couldn't be the man who checked into his place.

359
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:11,020
That makes sense.

360
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,620
If he was Prince of Bo,

361
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,360
why would he enter the city in secret and stay in his establishment?

362
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,000
What happened then?

363
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,779
General Ma decided to show him Prince of Bo's portrait

364
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:25,838
to confirm whether Prince of Bo

365
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,139
was the terrifying man who came to Kuizhou.

366
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:31,760
So, he asked to meet him in order to clear Mr. Fang's doubts.

367
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,900
But before they met, Old Fang died.

368
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,780
Old Fang must have mistaken it.

369
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,240
I think...

370
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,459
the one who stayed in his restaurant was probably an assassin.

371
00:27:52,459 --> 00:27:54,240
Assassin?

372
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,419
Previously, those mysterious men came fiercely

373
00:27:58,419 --> 00:28:00,300
and rented the whole restaurant.

374
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:03,979
The night after that, all of them disappeared.

375
00:28:03,979 --> 00:28:07,518
On that night, Feudal Lord Ma and his whole family were murdered.

376
00:28:07,518 --> 00:28:10,858
This is definitely not a coincidence.

377
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:14,378
Well, aren't they suspicious?

378
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:18,759
They must be Jin's assassins who killed Feudal Lord Ma and his whole family.

379
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,899
Hence, Mr. Fang probably died

380
00:28:22,899 --> 00:28:26,858
because he saw the assassins.

381
00:28:26,858 --> 00:28:30,759
Hence, the killers wanted to kill him to get rid of a witness.

382
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,359
Your guess is probably right.

383
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,539
But the weird thing is Mr. Fang thought that the assassin

384
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,259
looked exactly like the man beside Young Feudal Mistress,

385
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,559
Prince of Bo.

386
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,680
Young Marshal.

387
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,858
Since you pretended to be a soldier of Qitan and attempted to assassinate Prince of Bo,

388
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:14,540
we haven't met each other for long.

389
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,358
I received your secret message.

390
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:18,100
I dare not neglect your orders.

391
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,979
Why are you looking for me?

392
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,839
I've asked you to investigate

393
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:29,420
the culprit of Ma Ying's death.

394
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,819
I've also asked you to investigate if the Jin Army

395
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:34,218
have sent any assassins lately to sneak into Kuizhou

396
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:35,738
and kill a restaurant owner.

397
00:29:35,738 --> 00:29:39,240
If you're asking about the Jin Army, you should have asked me instead!

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,718
I'm sorry, Young Marshal.

399
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,399
Jin can't afford to lose you.

400
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,379
For Jin, I had to expose your whereabouts.

401
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,299
You're Jin's heir prince.

402
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,319
We haven't met for a long while.

403
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,980
I've forgotten how to bow. I'm sorry.

404
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,559
You're a general of Jin who got millions of soldiers killed.

405
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,038
Do you think that it's enough to make up for your mistake

406
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,119
by working your whole life to support their families?

407
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,999
There's another story behind Ma Ying's death.

408
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,760
The culprit isn't from the Jin Army.

409
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,920
What did you say?

410
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,320
If you want to know more, follow me back to Taibao Camp.

411
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,258
What? My brother was poisoned by miasma?

412
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:32,240
What happened?

413
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,358
This is the latest news that His Majesty has gotten.

414
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:36,679
His Majesty has ordered for Young Feudal Mistress and Master to enter the Imperial Palace at once

415
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,100
to discuss the military situation of the Ma Army.

416
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,138
Ma Jing, don't worry for now.

417
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:46,159
I'll go to the Imperial Palace with Lord Bo first and ask about the situation.

418
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,218
Maybe it isn't as bad as you think.

419
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,279
Young Mistress, please return as soon as possible.

420
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:51,438
I'll wait for your news.

421
00:30:51,439 --> 00:30:53,359
Zhaixing, let's go.

422
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

423
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,699
You've heard about it, right?

424
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:28,659
About a hundred Ma Army soldiers were poisoned by miasma

425
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:31,939
and the poison has gotten deep into their internal organs.

426
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:34,699
The situation isn't looking good.

427
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:38,579
The morale of the Ma Army is greatly affected.

428
00:31:38,579 --> 00:31:41,160
Everyone is in a panic.

429
00:31:42,499 --> 00:31:47,559
I propose to send the royal physician over to treat them.

430
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:56,759
Before you entered, I'd ordered it.

431
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,459
Thank you, Your Majesty, on behalf of the Ma Army.

432
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:10,839
Young Feudal Mistress, the Ma Army had planned to attack the Taibao Camp for some time.

433
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,019
They know the place well and have set a strategy.

434
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,280
If we replace them on such short notice

435
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,720
and send another general, I'm afraid that we won't be prepared,

436
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,479
and don't stand a chance of winning.

437
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:31,059
But if we withdraw the troops,

438
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,939
we will lose this opportunity of a lifetime.

439
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:39,679
There won't be an opportunity like this in the future.

440
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,679
Probably considering the situation they are in,

441
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,059
the Ma Army didn't mention withdrawal but asked for reinforcements.

442
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:53,680
I'm willing to lead the reinforcements to the frontline.

443
00:33:05,199 --> 00:33:07,300
If you go,

444
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,739
who will be in charge of the military matters in court?

445
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,219
Don't forget you still need to lead the Bo troops

446
00:33:15,219 --> 00:33:19,199
to merge with the Qitan troops and be Ma Army's back up.

447
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,780
You can't lose your judgment because this is related to Young Feudal Mistress

448
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,780
and forget to consider the whole picture.

449
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,379
Your Majesty is right.

450
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:33,519
Prince of Bo should stay in the Imperial City to stabilize the morale of the troops

451
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,459
and protect His Majesty.

452
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:37,300
At the moment,

453
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:42,000
the most suitable person to lead the reinforcements is me.

454
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,718
Are you willing to bear such a big responsibility?

455
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:50,920
That is what I want.

456
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,639
You've never fought any wars before.

457
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,580
The battleground where intense fights take place

458
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,379
isn't something you can handle.

459
00:33:58,379 --> 00:34:01,279
Your Highness, the main purpose of me going this time

460
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,300
is to stand with the Ma Army and boost the troop's morale.

461
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,139
The attack on Taibao Camp is the first step of the whole surprise attack.

462
00:34:07,199 --> 00:34:09,239
It's not directly fighting against the enemy.

463
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,540
So, you don't need to worry.

464
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,760
You're too naive.

465
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,460
Young Feudal Mistress, based on your words,

466
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,599
I know that you've considered it thoroughly.

467
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:28,720
The daughter of Ma Ying is indeed as excellent as men.

468
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,459
I shall order right now to send you to the frontline

469
00:34:32,459 --> 00:34:36,719
to lead the Ma Army and boost the troop's morale.

470
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,119
I'll also order the Commander of the Jiaozhou Army

471
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:45,900
to lead twenty thousand soldiers to meet up with you and reinforce the Ma Army.

472
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,879
I will obey your command, Your Majesty.

473
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,440
Prince of Bo, about my imperial edict, do you have any objection?

474
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,100
His Majesty is asking you a question.

475
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,319
I... have no objection.

476
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:10,619
- Zhang Jin.
- I am here.

477
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,259
Escort Young Feudal Mistress back to their mansion.

478
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:17,140
I still have something to discuss with Prince of Bo.

479
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:19,459
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:28,040
Young Feudal Mistress, please follow me.

481
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:38,759
Come with me.

482
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:49,319
Do you still remember

483
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:52,580
how your brother taught you

484
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,419
to be a good general back then?

485
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:59,820
There is no need to keep the Ma Army anymore.

486
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,419
Although they have been poisoned by miasma and lost some soldiers,

487
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:15,000
as soon as Ma Zhaixing gets there,

488
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,219
their morale will be lifted.

489
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:21,699
They will still be able to give the Jin Army at Taibao Camp a big blow.

490
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,880
In that way, my purpose is achieved.

491
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,720
But for the Ma Army, no matter if they win or lose, you will lead an army

492
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,359
to set a trap against them afterward

493
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,820
and wipe them out.

494
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,940
Then,

495
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,040
what about Zhaixing?

496
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,820
Kill her as well.

497
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,179
If you think that you can't do this in person,

498
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,318
you can order your men to do it.

499
00:37:06,319 --> 00:37:10,699
I know this is cruel.

500
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:13,119
Since that day

501
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,020
when you confessed to me about your feelings toward her and your past,

502
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,179
I know that

503
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:28,419
one day, you'd have to face this.

504
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:31,559
But what can I give to you?

505
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:34,199
At least you had her

506
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:37,758
for these past days. Am I right?

507
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:40,780
Father Emperor, we can wipe out the Ma Army,

508
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,780
but Ma Zhaixing is just a weak woman.

509
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,720
Father, I beg you, please spare her life.

510
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:53,579
Spare Ma Zhaixing's life?

511
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:59,019
Back then, did anyone spare your brother's life?

512
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,739
I don't understand what you're talking about.

513
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,179
Do you still remember?

514
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,319
When your brother died,

515
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:17,660
despite your injuries,

516
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,659
in this hall, you knelt for him for three days and three nights.

517
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:25,758
It was me who dragged you away.

518
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,439
Do you still remember?

519
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:29,860
I do.

520
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:37,679
Then do you remember what you promised me?

521
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,200
An eye for an eye.

522
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,319
The ones who should pay with their lives, other than that traitor general,

523
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,419
are Ma Ying together with the Ma Army.

524
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,499
What do Ma Ying and the Ma Army have to do with Brother's death?

525
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:26,758
Back then, Youyu anticipated that it would be a tough war.

526
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:28,979
He sent people to inform me.

527
00:39:28,979 --> 00:39:31,359
I issued an imperial edict

528
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,839
and ordered the only one troop

529
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,820
which could make it on time, the Ma Army, to back him up.

530
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:41,640
My military order had been issued for days,

531
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,140
but Ma Ying didn't reply.

532
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:50,980
Back then, he clearly told me that
[Ma Ying]

533
00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:55,540
a general at the battlefield may refuse the king's orders.

534
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,720
The truth is...

535
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:04,860
he was just trying to protect his troops and sacrifice my son,

536
00:40:05,939 --> 00:40:08,079
your brother.

537
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,739
I can't help but

538
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,820
choose to endure this and let it pass.

539
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,720
But from that day onward, I realized that

540
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,739
Ma Ying and the Ma Army have to be wiped out.

541
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:39,799
Besides, they're not worthy to be trusted.

542
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:48,780
For a battle fated to lose, sacrificing them is the only choice.

543
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,540
Why didn't you mention this to me?

544
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:58,860
Because I know you.

545
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,860
You were close with your eldest brother.

546
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:05,879
I was afraid that you would act impulsively.

547
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:10,420
Besides, the country was unstable back then.

548
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,879
I had to rely on the Ma Army's power.

549
00:41:14,879 --> 00:41:16,820
After that, I ordered

550
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:23,739
the Night Fiends to kill Ma Ying because of the loss of my son.

551
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,020
Back then, your brother sacrificed his life to save you

552
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:32,570
because he believed that you'd repay him.

553
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,939
I believe you will avenge the death of your brother

554
00:41:39,939 --> 00:41:45,640
and not help the Ma family by saving Ma Zhaixing. Am I right?

555
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,460
Prince of Bo, you seem reluctant.

556
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,699
Are you still thinking about Ma Zhaixing?

557
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,340
Are you one of the Chu family?

558
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:17,340
To avenge your brother's death is what you should do.

559
