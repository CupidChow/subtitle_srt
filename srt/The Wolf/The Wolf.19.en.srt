Ma Zhaixing!

23
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,880
I knew it.

24
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,359
As long as I have the bronze bell,

25
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,220
you can always find me.

26
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,400
Will you accompany me

27
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,199
while I buy some candied hawthorns?

28
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,199
I have no idea what you're saying.

29
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,260
Come with me.

30
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,320
Are you...

31
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
still holding a grudge

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,059
because I called you a monster back then?

33
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,339
That I said you would hurt me?

34
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,600
Those words hurt you too deeply.

35
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,800
Is that why you refuse to tell me who you are?

36
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,799
Commandery Princess,

37
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,370
yet again you've mistaken me for someone else.

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,780
♫ Hiding behind you, living forever in a universe you can't see ♫

♫ It won't hurt, it can't hurt, I will be the toughest rock ♫

40
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,559
You're right.

41
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:05,320
That night...

42
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,100
when you called out my name at the courtyard,

43
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,519
I mistook you for someone again.

44
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,459
At that moment,

45
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:21,159
I should have recognized that you are him.

46
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,980
How could I not recognize you?

47
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,839
How could I?

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,980
You knew it well enough.

49
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,420
That night,

50
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,719
I couldn't bear to see you suffer the pain of a one-sided love.

51
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,660
That was why I allowed you

52
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,039
to mistake me for another man

53
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,819
and called you Xing'er.

54
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Listen.

55
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:56,079
The way you said that name

56
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,119
was just like him.

57
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,759
It was so much like him.

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,319
But there is something that shares a stronger resemblance.

59
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,370
Of all the people in this world,

60
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,500
only you, Wolf Boy,

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,959
can read and see the wind.

62
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:23,359
So when I saw you at the market that day,

63
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,539
you were standing there waiting for the fragrance pouch

64
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,220
to be dropped by the wind.

65
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,959
And of all the people,

66
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,660
only Wolf Boy

67
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,219
can save me in time.

68
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,619
That is an ability

69
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,120
only a man raised by wolves can possess.

70
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,320

Wolf Boy, you're finally back!

74
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:44,998
I am Prince of Bo, Third Prince. You may address me as Prince of Bo.

75
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:49,720
I once had a friend who looked very much like Prince of Bo.

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,439
He bears a scar on his shoulder.

77
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,100
I have no scar on me.

78
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,139
Even though you're ugly, you're ugly just like him.

79
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:05,900
I am not the Wolf Boy you can betray and hurt as you wish!

What if I wasn't?

111

I believed you were him

That day you risked your life to put your faith in me,

119
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,619
yet I didn't make it in time.

120
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,440
Which led you to fall off the cliff and not knowing if you were dead or alive,

121
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,819
I had thought

122
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,000
you were no longer of this world.

123
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,900
But as it turned out, you survived.

124
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,479
You became Prince of Bo.

125
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,680
You were right next to me all this time.

126
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,300
Why didn't you reunite with me?

127
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,360
Do you hate me for lying to you?

128
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:32,719
I can't reunite with you.

129
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,619
His Majesty saved my life.

130
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:52,159
He wanted me to forget my past.

131
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,319
My identity as Wolf Boy will be shunned by others.

132
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,179
He ordered me not to mention it to anyone,

133
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:02,959
but you saw right through it.

134
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,080
I threatened you with my life and forced you to confess your identity.

135
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,000
Now I know you are Wolf Boy.

136
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,459
If His Majesty wishes to punish me, I'll gladly accept it.

137
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,779
His Majesty wanted it kept a secret to preserve my reputation.

138
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:32,140
Not to mention you and I are engaged.

139
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,259
If I plea to His Majesty, perhaps he would forgive you.

140
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,700
Other than His Majesty's order, I was also worried

141
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,880
if you found out I was the terrifying Prince of Bo

142
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,520
and not your beloved Wolf Boy,

143
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,219
you would be disappointed.

144
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,359
Prince of Bo can never be Wolf Boy.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,540
Rather than letting you be disappointed in Wolf Boy,

146
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,059
I might as well become the Prince of Bo you hate.

147
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,980
So this is your way to protect me?

148
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,999
Just as that day, I would rather suffer your resentment

149
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,560
than to let you stay on Langshou Mountain.

150
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,360
Why?

151
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,060
Why were we both so foolish?

152
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,280
Our way to protect each other

153
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,139
made us suffer the greatest sorrow.

154
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,619
I am headed for Prince of Xun's manor.

155
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,519
I'll explain to Fourth brother about your note.

156
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't want him to be worried.

157
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,620
After years of separation, we have too much catching up to do.

158
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,680
You have my word.

159
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,060
Once I am back, we'll never be separated again.

160
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,799
You forgot to return something.

161
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,240
The fragrance pouch.

162
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,500
Go on.

163
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,339
I'll keep an eye on you.

164
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,279
Ma Zhaixing,

165
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,599
it's time you paid your debt.

166
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,360
[Bo Royal Manor]

167
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:52,940
This is where we first met.

168
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,100
Why do you need me here to clear my debt?

169
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,559
I need a place where Prince of Bo isn't around.

170
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,899
Prince of Bo is Wolf Boy.

171
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:12,459
Wolf Boy is Prince of Bo. Am I right?

172
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:21,319
The conversation you had with Prince of Bo just now,

173
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,179
and how you forced him into admitting it by jumping off the cliff,

174
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:25,819
I saw everything.

175
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:32,779
You brought me there yesterday. I knew something was off.

176
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,899
Furthermore, based on what you told me and what you pulled off at Prince of Xun's mansion,

177
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,919
I knew I should follow you.

178
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,819
To my surprise, I got the chance to witness your touching reunion with Prince of Bo.

179
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
Ma Zhaixing,

180
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:56,364
I am tired of helping you.

181
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,120
I kidnapped Chu Youzhen for you,

182
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,380
and what did I get in the end?

183
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,120
Prince of Bo is just as loyal to you as Wolf Boy.

184
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,680
Wait.

185
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,319
Wolf Boy and Prince of Bo turned out to be the same man.

186
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,620
How did you even fall in love with him twice?

187
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,320
You wouldn't even give me a chance to try my luck.

188
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,620
Ji Chong, you were willing to help, and for that,

189
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,940
I shall forever remain grateful.

190
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,019
I've told you before.

191
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,840
When you feel sadness and pain, I'll be there to catch you.

192
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,360
I won't let you fall deeper into sorrow.

193
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,020
I thought I could be that man for you.

194
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:56,300
I am sorry.

195
00:17:01,359 --> 00:17:05,180
Losing to Prince of Bo is unacceptable for me.

196
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,100
But losing to Wolf Boy, I'll gladly accept it.

197
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,859
He was raised by wolves.

198
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,220
He became one with the wild.

199
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,319
He jumped off the cliff to save you.

200
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,560
Wherever you are, as long as he hears the bell ring,

201
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,540
he can always find you.

202
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,819
I can do...

203
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,759
none of these.

204
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,020
Even though I treated you well,

205
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,879
I have a handsome face,

206
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,880
and am full of charisma,

207
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,259
I still ended up in Prince of Xun's manor

208
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:59,160
working as a guard only to protect you.

209
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,959
Yet Prince of Bo turned out to be Wolf Boy.

210
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,280
Fate has left me with no chance!

211
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:13,839
Ji Chong,

212
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,000
don't be like this okay?

213
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:24,300
You are a precious friend of mine.

214
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,919
Friend?

215
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,960
I have more than enough friends in my life.

216
00:18:34,719 --> 00:18:36,319
I stayed...

217
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:38,839
all because of you.

218
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,780
And since I can't have your love,

219
00:18:44,139 --> 00:18:47,879
I don't see any more reason to stay in this place.

220
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:50,819
Where will you go?

221
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,700
A place without Wolf Boy and Ma Zhaixing.

222
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:03,719
I'll continue to be a wandering maverick living a life of freedom.

223
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,560
Don't think that giving me that look

224
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,600
will clear you of your debts to me.

225
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,440
Every job in the world has its rules.

226
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,319
Not asking for payment brings bad luck.

227
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,060
You owe me three things.

228
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,680
First of all, give me something to remember you by.

229
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,879
How about that? It's Wolf Boy's token for you.

230
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:39,660
I want that.

231
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,620
Actually, my late mother left this to me.

232
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,720
But since you asked...

233
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,459
Here.

234
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,060
I never planned to get this bell from you.

235
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,019
All I want is one of the clapper stones.

236
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,700
What is the second thing?

237
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,300
The second thing is...

238
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:32,859
to come with me as I deal with someone I dislike.

239
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,939
"Come to Langshou Mountain if you wish to see Xing'er."

240
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:40,999
Prince of Bo is too anxious.

241
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,999
He rushed off to Langshou Mountain as soon as he got Ji Chong's letter.

242
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:46,679
He didn't have to go there.

243
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,759
Ji Chong would never hurt Commandery Princess Ma.

244
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,519
Ji Chong is provoking Prince of Bo on purpose.

245
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,220
So he came here and took Her Highness.

246
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,900
But I am surprised.

247
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,839
My master was actually her beloved Wolf Boy.

248
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:13,060
Should His Majesty find out, I wonder what punishment will be given to Prince of Bo?

249
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,279
Where is my brother going in such a hurry?

250
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,460
My father wants to see us now.

251
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,099
Where exactly did my brother go?

252
00:21:24,099 --> 00:21:25,920
Say something.

253
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:29,360
Is he in trouble?

254
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,920
Tell me! I'll take full responsibility.

255
00:22:25,479 --> 00:22:27,019
It's you!

256
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,139
It's an honor to meet you, Prince of Bo.

257
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:40,740
No.

258
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,279
I should address you as Wolf Boy.

259
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,299
That sounds very disrespectful.

260
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,959
I got it.

261
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:53,939
Perhaps I should call you Prince Wolf.

262
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:55,740
Do you like it?

263
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,680
It's an honor to meet you, Prince Wolf.

264
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,960
You two are conspiring!

265
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,060
He forced me.

266
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,720
Ji Chong, what is the third thing you want from me?

267
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,700
Release him once you get it.

268
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,260
Zhaixing,

269
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,180
he is the mighty Prince of Bo.

270
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,499
My little trick isn't enough to kill him.

271
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:24,979
Besides, do you care so much for him?

272
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:27,979
Fine.

273
00:23:27,979 --> 00:23:30,979
The third thing I want is...

274
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:35,739
Let go of her!

275
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,060
You scoundrel!

276
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,360
You're no better than me.

277
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,739
You have been fine over the years,

278
00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:53,160
but she suffered because you lied.

279
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,100
- You are no righteous man.
- Enough!

280
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
Stop fighting!

281
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,800
Both of you! Stop!

282
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:13,958
That hurts.

283
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:17,019
I think my wound is tearing.

284
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:22,060
Xing'er, where does it hurt?

285
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,899
Zhaixing, are you all right?

286
00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:26,838
She is my princess consort. Mind your own business!

287
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:30,680
Don't forget, she was shot because of me.

288
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:35,059
- Is your leg feeling better now?
- I can run like a tiger!

289
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,340
Fine!

290
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:38,059
Stop!

291
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,039
You two, stop fighting!

292
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:45,160
Don't you see how childish you are?

293
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,500
It's time for you to go.

294
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,959
See yourself out.

295
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,779
Ma Zhaixing,

296
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:02,179
thank you for the clapper stone.

297
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,559
You gave him the clapper stones?

298
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,900
Ma Zhaixing, don't you forget.

299
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,719
You still owe me.

300
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,219
I don't want you to be my friend.

301
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:20,519
I want to be your only creditor forever.

302
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,499
So long.

303
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,979
Come back here!

304
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:40,799
Seeing how he helped me before, just let him go.

305
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,838
He helped you?

306
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,819
So you gave him the stones?

307
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,319
Think about it.

308
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,320
Every time he helped me out was because you picked on me

309
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,760
and when I felt the most helpless.

310
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,740
It's my fault.

311
00:26:01,199 --> 00:26:02,799
To make it up to you,

312
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,839
I'll stay with you for the night on Langshou Mountain.

313
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,560
Then eat my punch.

314
00:26:10,219 --> 00:26:11,819
Close your eyes.

315
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:43,810
♫ Eternity may not be far away ♫

316
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,470
♫ Lingering on love for one more day ♫

317
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,550
♫ My heartbeat kept repeating that jump for joy
during our first meeting ♫

318
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:59,200
♫ Every time our gaze meets ♫

319
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,250
♫ A smile always stays by the side of my lips ♫

320
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:10,700
♫ Always kept thinking about it ♫

321
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,720
♫ No space to step back to ♫

322
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,410
♫ Already surrounded by love ♫

323
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:25,640
♫ One more gaze and let's see who will melt whom ♫

324
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:29,699
Did that cool your anger?

325
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,819
I never really blamed you,

326
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,600
Wolf Boy.

327
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:45,420
♫ Fleeing like a breath of vapor and we may end up at eternity ♫

328
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:55,160
♫ Maybe it is not far from lingering in love for one more day ♫

329
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,360
♫ Exchanging a look and static electricity starts
to fly into a graceful dance ♫

330
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,339
Zhuiri,

331
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,920
it's just you and me now.

332
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:13,990
♫ Overlapping similar circles within the shadow ♫

333
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,450
♫ Every time the face is completely red from blushing ♫

334
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,520
♫ No space to step back to ♫

335
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,130
♫ Already surrounded by love ♫

336
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,440
♫ One more gaze and let's see who will melt whom ♫

337
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:39,280
♫ One more hugging practice until perfection is achieved ♫

338
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,420
What's so interesting about the campfire?

339
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:44,460
I was watching you.

340
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,400
I want to see how life has been for you.

341
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,820
I went from Wolf Boy to Prince of Bo,

342
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,440
how could it not be good?

343
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,500
♫ Lingering on love for one more day ♫

344
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:11,419
Back then, a stare into Wolf Boy's eyes

345
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:14,439
and I could tell every emotion he was feeling.

346
00:29:14,439 --> 00:29:18,919
But now, I can't see anything from your eyes.

347
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:25,359
Was it the perilous imperial court that rendered you an emotionless person?

348
00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:28,479
You'll never have to guess

349
00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:34,599
whether I am Wolf Boy or Prince of Bo,

350
00:29:35,459 --> 00:29:37,860
as long as you're with me.

351
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,860
I am happy.

352
00:29:50,479 --> 00:29:52,760
After you fell off the cliff,

353
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,260
how did you go from Wolf Boy to becoming Prince of Bo?

354
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,800
How did the scar on your shoulder disappear?

355
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,640
After His Majesty saved my life,

356
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,920
he sent me who was like a monster at that time to the palace dungeon.

357
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,100
And in the dungeon,

358
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,799
there were plenty of oddities who researched on medicines and weapons.

359
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,280
They too were shunned by the world.

360
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,480
They were trained to serve His Majesty.

361
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,840
What did they use you for?

362
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:35,099
For marches and a weapon of war.

363
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,020
I've done unspeakable things.

364
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:45,319
After he assimilated oddities like us,

365
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,160
he sent us to the army.

366
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,940
But only I became a prince.

367
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,119
It's clear His Majesty values your qualities.

368
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,180
My father gave me another chance at life.

369
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,339
He healed me and educated me.

370
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:18,140
I was once told that to remove a scar

371
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,380
one must endure agonizing pain.

372
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,220
Did it hurt?

373
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,339
Nothing hurts more than losing you.

374
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:54,419
At first it was a little harsh.

375
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,640
But then I had a family.

376
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,560
After a few years,

377
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,900
I stopped thinking about Langshou Mountain.

378
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,998
For my duty as Prince of Bo,

379
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:14,519
I worked day and night to train myself and the troops.

380
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,619
I studied to acquire knowledge.

381
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:22,456
I couldn't bear to just watch as the people were suffering from the war.

382
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,880
As Prince of Bo, I must uphold justice.

383
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,119
It's my duty to give shelter to those who have lost their homes.

384
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,219
To beat swords into plowshares, I must do my best to help.

385
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,340
Whether you are Wolf Boy or Prince of Bo,

386
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,600
your good nature has never left you.

387
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,489
You are loyal,

388
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:47,540
just as you are to me.

389
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,420
And you're devoted to serving His Majesty.

390
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,259
So that's why for our engagement, even though you were discontent with me, you couldn't help but accept it.

391
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:06,240
And then you kept giving me the cold shoulder and being mean to me.

392
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:22,500
It's my fault.

393
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,040
I misunderstood you for many years.

394
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,339
I am glad you agreed with the engagement.

395
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:39,959
Otherwise, we would have missed each other in life again.

396
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,280
Why was I always the one to make you sad?

397
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,480
I witnessed you fall from the cliff.

398
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,619
I regret it very much.

399
00:33:58,339 --> 00:34:00,279
I had been thinking.

400
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:02,979
Had you not left the mountain with me,

401
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,460
none of these tragedies would have happened.

402
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,760
Perhaps I wouldn't have lost you.

403
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,940
Do you still remember that shadow play?

404
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:27,459
Every time Xing'er left Wolf Boy,

405
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,600
she would be worried

406
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,480
if the wolf would get hurt or fall ill.

407
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,139
Xing'er wanted to ask

408
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,420
if the Little Wolf wished to be human and be with her forever.

409
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,260
You still remember it?

410
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,920
Eight years ago,

411
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,159
the Little Wolf didn't answer.

412
00:35:07,959 --> 00:35:09,659
Eight years later,

413
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,980
the Little Wolf wants Xing'er to know

414
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:18,020
that he wishes to be with her till the end of time.

415
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,939
With one of the stones gone,

416
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:58,420
the sound has become deeper.

417
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,360
Let's return.

418
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,718
I'll order all of my troops to hunt that man down.

419
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,719
We'll retrieve the stone.

420
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,360
So this is how Wolf Boy reacts when he is jealous.

421
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,120
He does sound intimidating, like Prince of Bo.

422
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,678
Prince of Bo and Her Highness will be happy

423
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,059
to see this when they come back.

424
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,720
Wen Yan! Hai Die!

425
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,278
Bad news. His Majesty is here. He is at the entrance.

426
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,839
Where are Prince of Bo and Commandery Princess Ma?

427
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:27,479
Your Majesty, Lord Bo didn't leave us any message when he left.

428
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,359
What are these?

429
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,319
Your Majesty, these belonged to Her Highness.

430
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:48,198
She has always loved a shadow play about the story of a wolf.

431
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:50,119
I misplaced them there.

432
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,359
I was about to remove them. I hope Your Majesty understands.

433
00:37:55,719 --> 00:38:00,499
The shadow play was about a wolf?

434
00:38:00,499 --> 00:38:02,220
What was the title?

435
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,859
It's...

436
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:06,600
Wolf Boy and Xing'er.

437
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,279
Your Majesty, Wolf Boy is being wronged.

438
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:11,619
Wolf Boy is innocent.

439
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:14,439
The culprit is someone else.

440
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,059
Xing'er? Do you mean Ma Zhaixing?

441
00:38:22,439 --> 00:38:26,200
So she and Prince of Bo have known each other for years.

442
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,639
I see now why she would risk everything to prove Wolf Boy's innocence.

443
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,939
I always thought she did so for justice.

444
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:41,159
But these two have always been

445
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,239
keeping this secret from me in unison.

446
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,999
Your Majesty, don't misunderstand.

447
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,100
Prince of Bo never mentioned anything about his past.

448
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,278
Her Highness only found out today that Prince of Bo was the friend she's been searching for.

449
00:38:55,278 --> 00:38:57,279
She never meant to lie.

450
00:38:57,279 --> 00:39:00,260
I had always thought

451
00:39:01,479 --> 00:39:06,919
taking Prince of Bo in as my adopted son was perhaps the best decision in my entire life.

452
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:12,559
But I never thought that Zhaixing's past with Prince of Bo

453
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,700
would have been kept a secret from me.

454
00:39:19,879 --> 00:39:21,999
My son has grown up.

455
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,399
He must think he's capable.

456
00:39:24,399 --> 00:39:28,800
Just how many more secrets are you actually keeping from me?

457
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,640
Your Majesty, please don't get angry.

458
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,439
Zhang Jin, we're leaving.

459
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,919
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

460
00:40:05,399 --> 00:40:07,459
I couldn't tell His Majesty that the Prince of Bo was Wolf Boy

461
00:40:07,459 --> 00:40:09,880
because I knew he would be furious.

462
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,299
His Majesty is wise.

463
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:14,939
Of course, he would make the connection.

464
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:17,000
What do we do now?

465
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,238
His Majesty is furious.

466
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:22,140
Will Her Highness and Prince of Bo be punished?

467
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,100
We must inform our master in advance.

468
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,918
They need to be prepared before they return.

469
00:40:26,919 --> 00:40:30,099
I'll set out right away. I'll head for Kuizhou throughout the night.

470
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,260
Why didn't you sleep?

471
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,399
Was it because I was leaning on your arm

472
00:41:11,399 --> 00:41:13,819
so you couldn't fall asleep?

473
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,001
Ma Zhaixing,

474
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:20,489
you slept so soundly leaning on my arm.

475
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:23,560
Do you even care if I couldn't sleep?

476
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,840
Sorry.

477
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,139
Wolf Boy,

478
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:41,780
I have a sudden craving for candied hawthorns.

479
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,860
Let's leave the mountain.

480
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:48,399
What? You won't come with me?

481
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,460
Too many people in Kuizhou know us both.

482
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,419
It could cause a disturbance,

483
00:41:55,419 --> 00:41:58,000
not to mention unease for us.

484
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,959
You have a point.

485
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:05,918
I have an idea.

486
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:09,359
Just like when we were kids, we can hide ourselves under capes.

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,250
♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

490
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:35,450
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

491
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:45,030
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

492
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:50,510
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

493
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:57,880
♫ I so want to run to your embrace ♫

494
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,860
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

495
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:12,110
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

496
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,710
♫ Forever being together ♫

497
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,350
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

498
00:43:19,350 --> 00:43:26,480
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

499
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,680
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

500
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,740
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

501
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,960
♫ I so want to run to your embrace ♫

502
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,920
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

503
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:02,280
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

504
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,560
♫ Forever being together ♫
