[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,710
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,950
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,170
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,420
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs)♫

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,840
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder)♫

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,190
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,800
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,170
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,400
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,340
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,250
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,560
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,750
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,970
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,240
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,950
♫ You know who I am ♫

19
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,180
[The Wolf]

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,140
As long as we can save the Ma Family Army, then I am willing to try.

21
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,080
Since Commandery Princess Ma is willing to take the risk...

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,160
As a member of the Ma Family Army, I'm also willing.

23
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,720
I will accompany you to the end then.

24
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,770
Wen Yan, immediately give Commandery Princess

25
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,470
the herbal pill for suppressing her Soul Separation Syndrome. I'm in a hurry.

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,220
Mo Xiao, send a messenger pigeon to Hai Die.

27
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,600
We'll be in the capital by noonday. Tell her to have a horse ready at the bottom of the mountain.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,940
This is the small path you mentioned?

29
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,020
Unless someone has wolf-like skills, otherwise, how does one get down?

30
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,310
From the bottom of this cliff, it's a straight walk to the capital.

31
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,610
But... how do we get down?

32
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,700
I told you before, this road is risky.

33
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:48,310
Could it be you've climbed down from here before?

34
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,310
I haven't.

35
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,410
Then, Your Highness...

36
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,380
Why am I feeling so dizzy?

37
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,000
It could be the medicine that Wen Yan gave you for suppressing your soul from being detached.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
It's taking effect.

39
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,360
Why is it now?

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,570
Then, the Ma Family Army...

41
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,480
Your dizziness won't last long,

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,010
so don't worry. There are times when I'll still need you to be awake.

43
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,790
I didn't lie to you.

44
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,950
I've never climbed down from here before,

45
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:49,200
because no one can climb down this cliff.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,110
Today, with you as an extra, whether you will be safe or not

47
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,470
will only be determined by the heavens.

48
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,890
Master!

49
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,300
Go. Let's stop the rebellion.

50
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,150
The Prince of Bo has yet to appear and His Majesty is ignoring us.

51
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,040
Then you can't blame the Ma Family Army for not having any reservations.

52
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,480
It's noonday! Attack the capital!

53
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,890
[Ma]

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:35,170
Sacrifice our lives for the truth!

55
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,120
Your Highness, are we still not releasing any arrows

56
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,460
at this time?

57
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,930
Are you stupid? My father-in-law

58
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,220
is still in the Ma Army's hands.

59
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,020
If I order the arrows to be released, he will die.

60
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,840
It's Your Highness.

61
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,390
I overlooked that in my panic.

62
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,140
Archers, prepare!

63
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,060
Seek the truth!

64
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,680
Release the arrows!

65
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,040
- Everyone--
- Commandery Princess Ma is here!

66
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,760
It's the Commandery Princess! Commandery Princess!

67
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,670
- It's really the Commandery Princess!
- Commandery Princess! Commandery Princess!

68
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,370
Commandery Princess!

69
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,320
- Commandery Princess!
- Commandery Princess!

70
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,820
Brother Fengcheng. Ma Jing. Please stand up quickly.

71
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,620
- Commandery Princess!
- Commandery Princess, you're still alive!

72
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,040
The heavens are just. The heavens are just.

73
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,230
The Ma Family Army will follow the Commandery Princess until death.

74
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,740
Follow the Commandery Princess until death.

75
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:34,030
Follow the Commandery Princess until death!

76
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,770
Brother Fengcheng, it's all thanks to Wen Yan and His Highness, Prince of Bo.

77
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,720
They saved me in time.

78
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,700
General Ma, you are wholeheartedly loyal.

79
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,460
I should not have suspected His Majesty.

80
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,870
An investigation revealed that the actions on the night Commandery Princess Ma was injured were done by someone on the inside.

81
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,010
That traitor was the Young Master, Gu Qingping, from Tongzhou.

82
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,220
This is the evidence of him colluding with the enemy.

83
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,040
[Emperor of Jin: I have decided to pledge allegiance to the Kingdom of Kin...]

84
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:22,080
Commandery Princess, the Young Master of Tongzhou, did he really ally with Jin to conspire against us?

85
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,410
This tiger seal was found on the Young Master of Tongzhou.

86
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,880
The tiger seal of the Jin people.

87
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,220
It cannot be wrong.

88
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,630
He wanted to take me away with him, but I was saved by the Prince of Bo.

89
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:43,510
Furthermore, the assailants that entered the Ma Manor did, in fact, have the tiger seal in their hands.

90
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,280
I witnessed everything.

91
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,700
His Majesty is here!

92
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,690
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,640
Ma Fengcheng, you want nothing more than for me to swear a poison oath, right? (T/N: oath if broken curses the swearer)

94
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,610
I will take a blood oath right here that

95
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,280
I'm willing to vow to in front of everyone.

96
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,780
"If General Ma Ying's death

97
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,850
was heartless and an act devoid of justice done by me,

98
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,100
I will be condemned by the heavens, where even death is not a sufficient punishment!"

99
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,360
Your Majesty.

100
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,250
Zhang Jing.

101
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,490
I will now sign this blood oath!

102
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,940
[Signed Blood Oath sworn to by the Emperor of Yang that he had nothing to do with the death of General Ma.]

103
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,670
From this day forth, the Ma Family Army will be surrendered back to the Imperial Court!

104
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,630
We surrender to Your Majesty!

105
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,950
- We surrender to the Imperial Court! Surrendered to His Majesty!
- Surrendered to the Imperial Court! Surrendered to His Majesty!

106
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,200
Surrendered to the Imperial Court! Surrendered to His Majesty!

107
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,330
Surrendered to the Imperial Court! Surrendered to His Majesty!

108
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,400
Surrendered to the Imperial Court! Surrendered to His Majesty!

109
00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:00,370
Father, please wait patiently in heaven.

110
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,020
The Ma Family Army and I

111
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,640
will definitely avenge this blood feud on behalf of the whole Ma family.

112
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,510
Commandery Princess.

113
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,160
Enter.

114
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,690
- Greetings to the Commandery Princess!
- Greetings to the Commandery Princess!

115
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,800
- Commandery Princess!
- Commandery Princess! What is this for?

116
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,470
Kneeling like this is not enough to repay the debt of gratitude I owe all the soldiers who, for the sake of Father,

117
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,460
did not hesitate to lead troops into the capital and all who sacrificed their lives in this battle.

118
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,240
I, Zhaixing, thank you on behalf of my deceased father.

119
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,310
- Commandery Princess! Please don't!
- Commandery Princess!

120
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,710
Commandery Princess, if you don't get up

121
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:59,090
then I will also keep kneeling!

122
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,420
Hurry, hurry, hurry! Come!

123
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,250
Hurry up and get up.

124
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,310
Commandery Princess.

125
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:10,840
We're doing this of our own free will.

126
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,910
In the future, you don't have to thank us.

127
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,770
We're one family.

128
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,190
This cake is something I made myself!

129
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,920
Whenever I'm unhappy,

130
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,780
I will eat this and it will dissolve my worries!

131
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:32,190
Commandery Princess, give it a try!

132
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:34,020
Ma Jing!

133
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,320
Commandery Princess, you must find this laughable.

134
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,520
This younger sister of mine,

135
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,680
her martial arts skills are average,

136
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,600
but when it comes to eating, she's unbeatable!

137
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,370
- Brother!
- Eating wherever she goes.

138
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,750
Half of the army provisions for the Ma Family Army

139
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,550
were all eaten by her!

140
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,180
Brother, you!

141
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:01,870
Commandery Princess, don't worry. I'll take good care of you!

142
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm just grateful that you're safe.

143
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,120
Protecting everyone in the Ma Family Army,

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
that has always been my father's longstanding wish.

145
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,370
From now on, I will take on this responsibility.

146
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,220
Commandery Princess.

147
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,180
Now, the Ma Family Army and the Imperial Court already have suspicions of each other.

148
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,550
Although His Majesty said he was not going to pursue the matter,

149
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,600
the will of the emperor is unpredictable.

150
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,530
From now on, repairing the relationship between the Ma Family Army and the Imperial Court

151
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,180
must be the goal I work hard toward.

152
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,000
Commandery Princess, you're putting your all into the Ma Family Army,

153
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,230
can't you leave some for yourself?

154
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,530
This time, it was not easy for you to avoid getting murdered by the Emperor of Jin

155
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,430
and also the violent treachery of the Young Feudal Lord of Tongzhou.

156
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,130
Oh, right! You...

157
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,930
are you hurt anywhere?

158
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,820
I was able to survive the calamity this time all thanks to being rescued by the Prince of Bo multiple times.

159
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,660
That's how I was able to come back unharmed.

160
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,290
Speaking of which, the Prince of Bo is my savior.

161
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,450
Commandery Princess, listen to me! I've heard that

162
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,410
the Prince of Bo is surrounded by an evil aura!

163
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:21,640
He is a demon with a cold temperament!

164
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,750
So if you meet him in the future, you must keep your distance!

165
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,540
Remember that! All right?

166
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,720
While on the road, although the Prince of Bo didn't say any comforting words,

167
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
he forced me to face reality and helped me to solve all my problems.

168
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,250
Even when the Young Feudal Lord of Tongzhou was holding me hostage,

169
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,900
he got injured while protecting me.

170
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,980
Brother Fengcheng. Ma Qing! I just remembered something.

171
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,340
I'll step out for a moment!

172
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,900
Commandery Princess! Commandery Princess!

173
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,780
The wounds on your body weren't healed to begin with

174
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,690
and adding the haste of traveling, they have opened up again.

175
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,840
Master.

176
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,600
Master, I've ordered the servants to bring a basin of ice water.

177
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,050
Apply the ice onto your wound for at least one incense stick's time. (T/N: Around half an hour).

178
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,190
You must not go too fast.

179
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,480
I know it now.

180
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
You may go now. I can handle this myself.

181
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Commandery Princess Ma.

182
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,120
How did Your Highness know it was me?

183
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,740
I know the sound of your footsteps. What are you doing here?

184
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:19,880
I came here to check up on Your Highness's wound.

185
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,740
Just then I saw a servant carrying a basin of water, so...

186
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,230
This is not the first time that you've seen my bare skin.

187
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:33,490
Commandery Princess Ma, isn't it too late to be shy about it now?

188
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,270
Last time, I was too lost in my own thoughts

189
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,210
and forgot about the propriety between males and females. How is that comparable?

190
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,430
What about this time then? Can you leave?

191
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,030
You're injured. Let me take care of you!

192
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,320
No need.

193
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,270
You mustn't move around! Sit still!

194
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,220
Sit still!

195
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,410
These best-quality external wound medicines must be used along with an ice compress

196
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,870
in order to let the medicine have a greater effect.

197
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,250
Your Highness is already injured and it's hard to put on medicine.

198
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,780
Please don't reject my good intentions. Let me return the favor.

199
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,390
Has Your Highness

200
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,810
been through a lot of hurtful experiences?

201
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,990
Are you testing me again to see if I'm the person you knew?

202
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,430
I've already given up on the idea that you're Wolf Boy.

203
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,290
After all, there are a lot of lookalikes in this world.

204
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,820
I just think Your Highness has a high tolerance for pain.

205
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,250
These wounds must have opened up during the haste of travel,

206
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:51,750
but all the while you didn't utter a word of pain.

207
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,420
But... how can it not hurt?

208
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
When you get hurt often,

209
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,440
you get used to it.

210
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,340
If enduring pain can become something you get used to,

211
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,530
then you must have experienced a lot of unimaginable hardships

212
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,380
and sufferings.

213
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,490
May I ask Your Highness,

214
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,900
if you can teach me how to endure pain?

215
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:35,650
You've always been alone

216
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,760
and enduring things on your own.

217
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,500
During the Soul Separation Syndrome, you forced yourself to wake up.

218
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,710
For the sake of the Ma Family Army, you pulled yourself together.

219
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,180
You're already strong enough, why do you still need me to teach you?

220
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:01,460
Commandery Princess Ma, no matter the time or place,

221
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,930
you should never shed any tears.

222
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,130
Tonight, in the imperial garden, His Majesty

223
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,290
has invited his officials to a banquet.

224
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,130
That includes all of the generals in your Ma Family Army.

225
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,960
I thank you for the notice, Your Highness.

226
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,080
I understand. I will retreat now.

227
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,950
Your Highness.

228
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,870
Let's hope that from now on,

229
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:52,050
neither of us will need to endure pain again.

230
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,220
You really know how to act!

231
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
His Majesty has arrived.

232
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

233
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
The Auspicious Dragon Phoenix Goblet?

234
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,000
Could it be that His Majesty has something important to announce?

235
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,600
The last time he used this goblet

236
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,400
was the day I got married. Why was it brought out today?

237
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

238
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,100
All of you may be excused.

239
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,200
Many thanks, Your Majesty.

240
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,700
You may return to your seats.

241
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,800
Today's incident at the city gate,

242
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,600
no one is allowed to talk about it from now on.

243
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes, Your Majesty.

244
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Great! I like it very much!

245
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,200
Sit, sit, sit.

246
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,600
I toast Prime Minister!

247
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
The Ma Family Army have been disrespectful on multiple occasions.

248
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,100
Although His Majesty is kind and has granted us no punishment,

249
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,200
I'm willing to drink as a punishment.

250
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,700
I kindly ask Prime Minister to disregard our past misgivings!

251
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,200
Feudal Young Mistress has overstated!

252
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,600
I deeply respect General Ma's wholehearted loyalty!

253
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,800
As His Majesty said,

254
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,600
eliminate enmity with a smile, ending it here!

255
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,600
Zhaixing, looking at you sitting here with ease,

256
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,100
shouldn't you thank another person?

257
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,300
Yes, Your Majesty.

258
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
Prince of Bo.

259
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,000
There are no words that can express my gratitude. You saved my life.

260
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,200
The Ma Family Army and I owe you a favor.

261
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
We will repay it one day.

262
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,700
Cheers.

263
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
Yougui,

264
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,200
don't you think the Feudal Young Mistress and the Prince of Bo are a match?

265
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,600
I'll have her married to Prince of Bo and be my daughter-in-law.

266
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,000
How about it?

267
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,200
Father, I have the same feeling.

268
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,800
They are a perfect match.
(T/N: Idiom - Talented man and a beauty)

269
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,400
Also, Third Brother doesn't have a wife yet.

270
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,600
As a brother, I'm worried for him.

271
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,800
I don't know what Third Brother is thinking.

272
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,300
Third Brother.

273
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,800
The world is uncertain.

274
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,500
Since I'm always in the military, I never thought about getting married.

275
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,200
I'm afraid I'll neglect her.

276
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,300
Father, what Third Brother said, he went around and agreed.

277
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,800
Commandery Princess, don't mind. My son...

278
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,700
He is always...

279
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,000
burying his head in being busy with managing military affairs.

280
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,800
He is a bit unromantic.

281
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
I heard that when you were in Kuizhou City,

282
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,200
you were quite picky with all your marriage suitors.

283
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Are you going to dislike

284
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,800
my son, Prince of Bo, too?

285
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,900
Your Majesty, the Commandery Princess absolutely will not!

286
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,200
Sit down, I didn't ask you.

287
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,400
An imperial wedding;

288
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,000
the significance is beyond a romance between a man and a woman.

289
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,800
It is the uniting of a royal and his subject in matrimony.

290
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,000
Naturally, it will dispel Jin Kingdom's scheme to sow discord between us.

291
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,200
It will also better demonstrate my gracious favor towards you,

292
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,000
as well as the Ma Family Army's loyalty towards me.

293
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,700
Commandery Princess, what do you think?

294
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,400
Could it be that you

295
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,000
have something else in mind?

296
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,800
My son won't be a match for you?

297
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Please forgive me.

298
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,800
I don't have anyone in mind.

299
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,200
Then, why are you still wavering?

300
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,600
It is only because I have yet to take revenge against my family's enemy and our country's rival.

301
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Your Majesty, I'm willing to marry Prince of Bo.

302
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,190
I just ask Your Majesty

303
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,200
to permit us to hold the wedding after the two of us have obliterated the Jin Kingdom!

304
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,800
Good!

305
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
Then, the wedding

306
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,200
will commence after you complete your wish.

307
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,400
I will now betroth you to the Prince of Bo.

308
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,000
You and I are one family now.

309
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
From now on, move into the capital.

310
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,400
On behalf of Ma Ying,

311
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll take good care of you.

312
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,600
I thank you, Your Majesty.

313
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:01,000
Prince of Bo, are you going to come here and thank me with the Feudal Young Mistress?

314
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,600
♫ Without you and without me ♫

315
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,900
Thank you for granting our marriage, Your Majesty.

316
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,600
Yes! Today, I'm happy.

317
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
- Zhang Jing.
- Here.

318
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,000
The Dragon Phoenix Goblet! I bestow to the Prince of Bo and the future Princess Consort of Bo a goblet of wine!

319
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,000
♫ People who are in love ♫

321
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,800
♫ Yet have no way to stop and stay ♫

322
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,600
After drinking the wine,

323
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,400
you two will officially agree to get married.

324
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,200
♫ How painful is giving up ♫

325
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,800
♫ Blame me for falling in love with a wild beast
who has lost his way ♫

326
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,600
♫ Paying with my freedom ♫

327
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,800
♫ I stand at the intersection facing you ♫

328
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,000
♫ Personally burying this tenderness ♫

329
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,800
All right, all right. Rise.

330
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,000
Emperor Father has used this Auspicious Dragon Phoenix Goblet to bestow the wine.

331
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,200
It is clear he values this marriage quite considerably.

332
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
This joyous occasion has been a long-time coming for the imperial family.

333
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,000
Congratulations, Third Brother and Commandery Princess Ma.

334
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,100
Thank you for your auspicious words, Second Brother.

335
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,600
Go back and sit down.

336
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,600
Play joyful music!

337
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,400
I toast all of my officials!

338
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,200
We thank you, Your Majesty.

339
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,500
Come!

340
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
Fill up, fill up!

341
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,280
♫ Even if I hurt again and love again ♫

342
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,200
♫ Do not say again ♫

343
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,400
♫ Seeing you yet I cannot walk forward ♫

344
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,500
I will toast again to good things coming in pairs!

345
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,400
Come.

346
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,000
Please, Your Majesty.

347
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,910
Your Majesty,

348
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,100
I can't drink too much alcohol so I'll go back and rest.

349
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
Oh, all right.

350
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,800
Hurry and rest.

351
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,800
I'll take my leave.

352
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,900
Prince of Bo...

353
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,790
Wolf Boy,

354
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,200
this is my wedding liquor.

355
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,390
I'm sorry.

356
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,300
I can't wait for you anymore.

357
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,010
Today, I have been bestowed a marriage.

358
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,600
The two of us, in the end,

359
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,600
were destined to meet but not fated to be together.

360
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,100
It's you.

361
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,200
Father ordered me to take you back to the palace.

362
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,000
Please.

363
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,500
Let go!

364
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,100
Even if you're ugly,

365
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,800
you're ugly just like him.

366
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,600
Feudal Young Mistress, please conduct yourself.

367
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,500
It's time to go back.

368
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
Stop telling me what I should do!

369
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,400
Who I should marry!

370
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,600
I just want to see Wolf Boy right now.

371
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,600
You don't have Wolf Boy's scar and sincerity.

372
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,000
You and Wolf Boy have such different identities and status.

373
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,900
Who are you to look so much like him?

374
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
So what about Prince of Bo?

375
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,800
Feudal Young Mistress Ma,

376
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,500
the person you always mistake me for,

377
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,140
is he... very important to you?

378
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,300
If not important,

379
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,400
why leave a lantern riddle with "wolf" written on it?
(T/N: One type of Lantern Festival Riddle Game)

380
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,200
You're still thinking about him.

381
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,300
Actually,

382
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,200
you are Wolf Boy. Am I right?

383
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

384
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,400
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

385
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,600
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who
its afterglow will illuminate ♫

386
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,800
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

387
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,000
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense ♫

388
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,200
♫ But gentleness is always invincible ♫

389
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,000
♫ I am already used to viewing from high above
in the mountain alone ♫

390
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,800
Wolf Boy,

391
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,600
I truly,

392
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,600
truly from my heart, wanted to tell you this.

393
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,600
♫ I have yet to encounter any challenge that I find difficult ♫

394
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,300
♫ Even going against the tides, my vision is still steady,
manners is still fierce ♫

395
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,000
♫ I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling ♫

396
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,600
To me, your existence

397
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,600
is just a stumbling block.

398
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,000
I really wanted to kick you away.

399
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
Wolves and humans can never be together!

400
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,400
Don't you understand!

401
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,600
In other peoples' eyes, you're just a monster!

402
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,400
Get lost!

403
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Get lost!

404
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,400
Don't be stupid.

405
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,800
I‘m not the Wolf Boy that you can easily betray.

406
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,600
I don't care about what you say!

407
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
You just not worthy of me!

408
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Get lost!

409
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,600
♫ But gentleness is always invincible ♫

410
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,600
Feudal Young Mistress! Feudal Young Mistress!

411
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,800
Where are you, Feudal Young Mistress?

412
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,700
Feudal Young Mistr—

413
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,400
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white or grey ♫

414
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,100
Feudal Young Mistress!

415
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,900
Feudal Young Mistress!

416
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,900
Feudal Young Mistress! How come...

417
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,600
How come you fell into the water?

418
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Stand up quickly.

419
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,400
Are you all right?

420
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,800
Come.

421
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,000
Slowly.

422
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,600
Are you all right?

423
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,000
How did you fall into the water? What happened?

424
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,000
Wolf Boy.

425
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,600
This is the palace. How could there be a Wolf Boy?

426
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Just now, he...

427
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,400
really was here.

428
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,200
I chased him away.

429
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I chased him away.

430
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Wolf Boy.

431
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,200
Let's go back.

432
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,660
Wolf Boy...

433
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,500
you left.

434
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,980
It's good you left.

435
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,700
You left...

436
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,300
so that you cannot see Xing'er getting married.

437
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,400
You've suffered, Feudal Young Mistress.

438
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:19,330
Let's go back and rest.

439
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,200
It's all right, don't cry.

440
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,600
Wolf Boy will be happy for you. Let's go back and sleep.

441
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,400
Let's go home.

442
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,700
- Let's go.
- Wolf Boy.

443
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,000
Where is my and Second Highness's horse carriage?

444
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,800
Prime Minister, please ease your anger. I will go urge them immediately.

445
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,000
Lord Major, you are the biological cousin of the Fourth Prince

446
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,200
and the biological nephew of the late empress. Did you see the prime minister?

447
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,600
He didn't say anything when he left.

448
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
He...

449
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
[Major Yang Hou]
...is just relying on the fact that he is the father-in-law of the second prince.

450
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,000
But he is not aware that

451
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,600
that son-in-law of his is nothing but the offspring of a Bozhou military prostitute.

452
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,800
As for if he is actually of His Majesty's true dragon bloodline,
(T/N: Chinese emperors were said to be descendants of dragon gods)

453
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,300
I‘m still suspicious of it.

454
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,000
Prime Minister,

455
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
I didn't think that even though I came so late,

456
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,300
my horse carriage would already be here.

457
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
I can tell with one look that your horse

458
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,200
has an unbridled wildness.

459
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,300
It is quite normal then for it to go on a rampage.

460
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,400
It seems this person is like his horse, reckless yet with a mouth that cannot shut up.

461
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,000
Father-in-Law!

462
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,900
There's no need.

463
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Major Yang,

464
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
you always tease that my royal mother has a military prostitute background.

465
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,600
You may not be tired of saying it,

466
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,600
but I do not hear anything new.

467
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,400
All these years, you have been repeating it over and over again,

468
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
could it be you only have this one trick?

469
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,200
If you continue and don't think of how to improve on it,

470
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,400
even I will feel ashamed on your behalf.

471
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Second Prince has a virtuous character,

472
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,200
but I am afraid that Major is in the prime of his youth

473
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,000
and is as reckless as his horse.

474
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,800
There will be a day when both he and his horse will get thrown off their feet. (T/N: They will suffer a crushing defeat)

475
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,580
Prime Minister has overstated.

476
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,200
If you want to flip over a horse,

477
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
that will be hard.

478
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:32,400
This treasured horse comes from Qitan, it is one of the best warhorses!

479
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,600
It is not some crossbred horse

480
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,800
and is even less likely to be a wild horse from an unknown origin.

481
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,400
Its blood is pure,

482
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:44,400
just like the Fourth Prince, who will be returning from Qitan sooner or later.

483
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,200
He is the only biological son the empress had before she passed.

484
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
No one can compare.

485
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,200
You-- You mock Second Prince!

486
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,600
I, his subordinate,

487
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,800
will wholeheartedly await Fourth Prince's return.

488
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,300
I'll take my leave.

489
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,000
I won't send you off.

490
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,400
[Flowing Backward by Jolin Tsai 蔡依林]

491
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,800
♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

492
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:23,800
♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

493
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:33,600
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

494
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:39,200
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

495
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,400
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

496
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,400
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

497
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,600
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

498
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,200
♫ Forever being together ♫

499
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,800
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

500
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,000
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

501
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:22,200
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

502
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

503
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,600
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

504
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:43,600
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

505
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:50,800
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

506
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,200
♫ Forever being together ♫
