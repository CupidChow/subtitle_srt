00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,870
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,140
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,190
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,310
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,930
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,100
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,860
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,140
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,470
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,330
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

13
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,310
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,610
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,820
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,060
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,390

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:33,045
[Episode 35]

21
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,938
Imperial Father,

22
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:41,099
the princess will be here soon,

23
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,640
but there's no news of Juyao yet.

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,600
Announcing the arrival of the princess!

25
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,979
Begin the ceremony!

26
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,580
Wait!

27
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,619
I, Li Juyao, am a sinful soldier.

28
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,798
I went missing in action for seven years, an unpardonable crime indeed.

29
00:04:06,798 --> 00:04:10,020
I am here to ask for my due punishment!

30
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,420
What wrong have you done?

31
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,660
First, I spoke brashly and angered the general.

32
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,999
Second, I was uncontrollable and disobedient.

33
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:25,459
Third, I suspected the general; an unforgivable crime.

34
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,100
Fourth, I created dissent amongst the troops.

35
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,298
Fifth, I spread harmful rumors.

36
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:36,640
Your list of wrongdoings is inexhaustible indeed.

37
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,179
I feel embarrassed to face you now, My King.

38
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,940
But Taiyuan City is my home.

39
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,840
My family is here.

40
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:51,079
It has been seven years since I left.

41
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,479
I would really love to come back.

42
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,699
I beg you to take account of a son's

43
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,940
longing towards his father and lighten my punishment

44
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,840
so I may use the rest of my life to redeem myself.

45
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,039
Father, please forgive Juyao.

46
00:05:21,859 --> 00:05:24,538
Your Highness, please let the prince return.

47
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,719
Your Highness, please let the prince come back.

48
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,799
Redeem yourself?

49
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,219
You wish.

50
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,340
If you do not agree,

51
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,080
I shall kneel here forever.

52
00:05:48,859 --> 00:05:52,040
Today is the princess's coronation.

53
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,340
And you're going to kneel here forever?

54
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,300
How are you admitting to your mistakes?

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,400
You are threatening me!

56
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,579
I dare not.

57
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:09,059
I just want to ask for Imperial Father's forgiveness.

58
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,520
Get up.

59
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,719
You brat.

60
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,098
Thank you for your forgiveness, Imperial Father.

61
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,660
From now on,

62
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,659
I will listen to everything you say.

63
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,240
You will not see any trace of rebellion from me!

64
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:09,699
Congratulations to both of you for settling your differences.

65
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:13,340
This is a true blessing for the Kingdom of Jin.

66
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,780
The fact that I've reconciled with the king

67
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,739
and that the troops are united is all because of the princess.

68
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:35,879
The Kingdom of Jin shall win every war under the princess's leadership!

69
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:39,479
My sincerest greetings to the princess!

70
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,099
My sincerest greetings, Your Highness!

71
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,660
Your Highness, long live the princess!

72
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,219
Master,

73
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,179
today the king didn't gather the marquises in the hall.

74
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,400
Instead, he went to the Bo Army's training grounds.

75
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,998
His Majesty is trying to avoid the marquises' questions by using military training as an excuse.

76
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:15,138
Can Lord Bo awaken in time to save him?

77
00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:16,879
Lord Bo,

78
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,760
the king and ministers are all waiting for you.

79
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:24,980
Please wake up.

80
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:55,219
Your Majesty,

81
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,039
Marquis Han and Minister Cui request an audience.

82
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,439
Bring them in.

83
00:08:58,439 --> 00:08:59,999
Yes, Your Majesty.

84
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,319
Greetings, Your Majesty.

85
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,918
Please rise.

86
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

87
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:15,859
My dear officials.

88
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,680
Look at this.

89
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,660
What do you think of their training today?

90
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,939
At this rate, do you think we can invade Taiyuan?

91
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,120
Your Majesty,

92
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,039
these soldiers are the best fighters around.

93
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,040
Their capabilities are unparalleled.

94
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,299
Invading Taiyuan is not impossible,

95
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,360
but these brave soldiers all belong to the Bo Army.

96
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,819
I was thinking that if we were to unleash all their potential,

97
00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:55,059
why don't we get Lord Bo to demonstrate

98
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,580
and let us witness his majestic presence?

99
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,240
Marquis Han,

100
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,840
Lord Bo is still not here yet.

101
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,060
So the answer is obvious.

102
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,499
Looks like Lord Bo has indeed been killed by the Princess of Jin.

103
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:18,258
Now we should be sharing the king's burdens.

104
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:20,780
You have a point, Minister Cui.

105
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,260
Lord Bo is akin to the god of war.

106
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:30,620
However, since he cannot lead the troops to war now,

107
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,299
if our troops do wage war with Jin now,

108
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,719
I'm afraid the result would be...

109
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:39,519
Would be what?

110
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,938
I'd love to listen to your advice.

111
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:46,339
I have brought prisoners of war from Jin.

112
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:47,618
Men!

113
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,179
Bring the Jin prisoners of war here!

114
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:51,759
Halt!

115
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:08,679
Your Majesty, if we release these prisoners back to Jin,

116
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,800
I'm sure their king can feel our sincerity

117
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
and declare a truce with us.

118
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,140
I don't understand what you mean.

119
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,859
Minister Cui,

120
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:24,420
if we send these prisoners back,

121
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,219
what would the king of Jin feel about my intentions?

122
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:33,200
He would feel that we would like to peacefully divide the lands equally.

123
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,619
Minister Cui,

124
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,419
how dare you stir the military's resolve before the war?

125
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,299
- What punishment does that entail?
- Lord Bo!

126
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,960
To war!

127
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:49,880
To war!

128
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,078
- To war!
- To war!

129
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:17,818
Greetings, Your Majesty.

130
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,499
Rise.

131
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,420
Thank you, Imperial Father.

132
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,099
War is impending,

133
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:26,920
yet you talk about a truce.

134
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,670
Marquis Han,

135
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,498
you are a military leader, too.

136
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:34,258
What punishment befits someone who stirs our resolve?

137
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,139
The death penalty.

138
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,938
Marquis Han.

139
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:41,839
Yes, Your Highness.

140
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,760
If we were to send the prisoners back, we can.

141
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,859
But there is one condition.

142
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:51,980
They have to defeat Lord Bo.

143
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,359
Marquis Han, the king has spoken.

144
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:04,239
Release them now and arm them with weapons!

145
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,778
I have left home for many years. I have made you worry.

146
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:10,120
I shall drink three cups of wine as punishment.

147
00:13:17,499 --> 00:13:19,539
Juyao, you're intoxicating yourself.

148
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,020
Father won't hold on to past grudges.

149
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,539
Who said I won't?

150
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,139
He only came back because of the princess.

151
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,079
- Fa–
- She also made him understand me.

152
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,980
As his father, I am nothing to this brat compared to the princess.

153
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:46,738
But despite dedicating so much to her, this brat still hasn't won her heart yet.

154
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,578
You are absolutely right, Your Majesty.

155
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:52,299
I thought the young prince was a natural charmer,

156
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,099
taking after the king himself.

157
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,838
But it looks like he falls short behind the king when you were young.

158
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:04,699
This brat is much worse than I was.

159
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,039
Father, I'm just being gentle.

160
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:13,720
Besides, Zhaixing has no time for romance now.

161
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,058
I can't force her, can I?

162
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:19,020
And I thought you'd studied The Art of War.

163
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,779
Winning a lady's heart is the same as battling in a war.

164
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,859
You have to be swift, decisive, and precise.

165
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,178
Strike while she's unprepared, do what is unexpected.

166
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:30,260
It's an age-old adage.

167
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,959
Got it?

168
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:37,219
But, Imperial Father,

169
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,160
Zhaixing is still not ready to welcome a new relationship now.

170
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,199
I can't just strike while she's weak.

171
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,320
Excuses.

172
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,839
You're just scared of failing.

173
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,158
She may have rejected your feelings, but are you giving up like that?

174
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:55,938
No. I am confident.

175
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,320
I will love only Zhaixing in this life.

176
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,618
Since you are so confident, why do you fear being rejected?

177
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:06,220
It should motivate you instead.

178
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,020
Love and war are the same.

179
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,058
Juyao,

180
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,058
this is my first time seeing you so invested in a lad, too.

181
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,719
In fact, you don't look like the person I once knew.

182
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:20,979
You brat,

183
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,019
despite the odds, you brought the princess back to Taiyuan.

184
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,000
At first, even I had no high hopes for her.

185
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,258
But you believed in her.

186
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:31,960
In the end, she did live up to everyone's hopes

187
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,000
and made me see her strengths as a woman

188
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,780
and determination that supersedes that of men.

189
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:44,820
Ma Zhaixing is a legendary woman indeed.

190
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:49,520
Unfortunately, legendary women

191
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,619
are often cursed with ill fates and tragic experiences.

192
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,360
Even if I have to risk my life,

193
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,540
I will protect Zhaixing from any harm.

194
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,920
You should tell that to the princess, not us.

195
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:12,659
Imperial Father,

196
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:16,339
I'm worried that if Zhaixing and I do become an item,

197
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,380
malicious rumors might spread.

198
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:23,580
When did you become so fearful of everything?

199
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:26,280
If what you do is right and just,

200
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,159
why should you fear rumors?

201
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:32,539
Since your love is sincere, go ahead.

202
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,479
I support you,

203
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,659
but I have a condition.

204
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,699
You must succeed and not fail.

205
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,959
Father, here's to you!

206
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,160
Here.

207
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,618
You look like me the most when I was young.

208
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,639
I have high hopes for you.

209
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,940
The king has ordered Ji Chong to lead the Chuanlong Army again.

210
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,958
- Ye Han.
- Yes, Your Highness.

211
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:03,779
From today onward, the Ma Family Army will work under the Prince of Chuan.

212
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,819
It's an order.

213
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,600
Yes, Your Highness.

214
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:09,699
Young Feudal Mistress,

215
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,801
don't tell me your homecoming gift for Prince of Chuan is to let him lead the Ma Family Army?

216
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:19,019
Don't you think it's too unexciting?

217
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,640
What are you saying?

218
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:29,160
I guarantee that this gift is what Ji Chong needs.

219
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,020
Ever since we came to Jin, if he hadn't helped us,

220
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,560
I might not have survived till now.

221
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,339
That's why.

222
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:42,738
Young Feudal Mistress, the gift you're sending should be something he wants,

223
00:17:42,739 --> 00:17:45,600
not something he needs.

224
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,780
And what's that?

225
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,019
Your heart.

226
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,599
Your Highness, can't you see it?

227
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,039
The prince is downright in love with you.

228
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,138
Even Ye Han can see that.

229
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:00,639
Right?

230
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,280
You...

231
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:08,338
Your Highness, even a rough guy like me can see that.

232
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,339
You saw it, right?

233
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:14,900
By the way, Young Feudal Mistress,

234
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,259
doesn't the prince have a promissory note from you?

235
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:23,840
But Ji Chong doesn't want money.

236
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,259
And now, how can I give him any good memories?

237
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:31,359
How about this?

238
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,020
Prepare a blank promissory note for Ji Chong.

239
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,819
Let him choose what memory he wants, shall we?

240
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,980
Come on.

241
00:18:41,739 --> 00:18:43,339
Sit down.

242
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:46,858
Just prepare a blank promissory note and let him decide what he wants from you.

243
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:50,240
He can write it here, and you'll just need to sign.

244
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,319
Zhaixing!

245
00:19:04,339 --> 00:19:05,839
Coming.

246
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,679
General Li, come in.

247
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,459
Your Highness, the prince is here.

248
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:21,240
He's here.

249
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,380
Ji Chong.

250
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,959
Ma Jing. Strategist Ma.

251
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:40,319
I have something to tell the princess.

252
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:41,779
Please leave.

253
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,039
Yes, Your Highness.

254
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:48,239
- Let's go.
- Make it up to him.

255
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:58,819
Today is the day you reconciled with your father.

256
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,499
I thought you'd drink till daybreak.

257
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,540
Ji Chong.

258
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,100
Ji...

259
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,460
Ji–

260
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,120
I have something important to tell you.

261
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:44,659
I'll listen.

262
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:46,619
Please get off first.

263
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,959
- Get off!
- No!

264
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,420
I have let you off once.

265
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,619
But I just couldn't leave.

266
00:20:59,379 --> 00:21:02,239
When you knew Lord Bo was Wolf Boy,

267
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,580
I kept my distance away from you.

268
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,470
But who'd know...

269
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,030
that after all the twists and turns,

270
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,150
you still returned right back here to me.

271
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,190
♫ Not gentle, cannot be sad, you don’t need to understand ♫

272
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:28,080
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later,
I will be waiting here ♫

273
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,880
I'm sorry.

274
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:36,079
I don't want to hear you say sorry.

275
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,939
I want...

276
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,980
♫ Not gentle, cannot be sad, you don’t need to understand ♫

277
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,880
You!

278
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:57,950
♫ A hundred years later, a thousand years later ♫

279
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,440
Zhaixing...

280
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,320
Why am I in Zhaixing's chamber?

281
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:10,840
Promissory note - Creditor: Ji Chong, Debtor- Ma Zhaixing

282
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,498
Your Highness! Your Highness!

283
00:23:39,499 --> 00:23:41,020
Your Highness! Calm down, Your Highness!

284
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:43,339
- Ji Chong!
- Your Highness! Your Highness!

285
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,858
- Zhaixing!
- Calm down.

286
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:45,838
What are you doing?

287
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:47,160
Calm down!

288
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,398
Your Highness, calm down!

289
00:23:48,398 --> 00:23:49,819
Don't hurt yourself, Your Highness!

290
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,279
- Careful with the knife!
- What's this?

291
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,618
Don't hurt yourself.

292
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,738
The sight of him makes my blood boil.

293
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,920
I can't calm down!

294
00:23:57,739 --> 00:23:59,799
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Your Highness.

295
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,758
Even a dying prisoner deserves to know what he has done wrong.

296
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,599
I only slept on your bed.

297
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:06,599
Must I die because of that?

298
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,378
To think you're still coming up with nonsense.

299
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,659
The whole kingdom knows that you have been here the whole night.

300
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,299
Show some sincerity, will you?

301
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,118
- Show some sincerity!
- Let go of me!

302
00:24:17,118 --> 00:24:18,579
Your Highness, calm down!

303
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,039
- Zhaixing!
- Your Highness.

304
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:24,800
Prince, if you really love the princess, we will give you our blessings.

305
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,059
Congratulations.

306
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,659
Stop spouting nonsense!

307
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,720
No, we're not.

308
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:33,320
- Your Highness.
- Think back on what you'd done!

309
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,079
I want...

310
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:41,619
Stop!

311
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,479
I've remembered what happened last night.

312
00:24:49,379 --> 00:24:52,039
Since it was me who tarnished your reputation,

313
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,299
all the more you can't kill me.

314
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,420
Unless you want to erase all evidence of your debt by killing me so that you don't have to pay me back.

315
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:04,019
Your Highness.

316
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,119
Ma Zhaixing.

317
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,900
[On the day we defeat Yang, I, Ma Zhaixing will travel with you to the ends of the earth. Wherever you go, I follow.]

318
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,080
I've signed my name on the promissory note you prepared last night.

319
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,559
I want you to travel around

320
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,160
and explore the world with me.

321
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,840
If you regret your decision,

322
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,499
you can tear this now.

323
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,199
- Your Highness!
- Don't tear it!

324
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:41,779
You're a princess! You can't go back on your word!

325
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,480
Who says I'm tearing it?

326
00:25:56,739 --> 00:25:58,640
Ma Zhaixing,

327
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,359
have you thought it through?

328
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,759
Since you've promised me,

329
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,539
I will never let you go again.

330
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:10,819
I've never thought of breaking my promise to you.

331
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,559
She said yes, Strategist Ma!

332
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,439
She said yes!

333
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,560
She did!

334
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,200
Today is the day you reclaim the Chuanlong Army.

335
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,899
You will be meeting the king soon.

336
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,719
You should go back and prepare now.

337
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,080
Okay, as you wish.

338
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:34,980
Let's go!

339
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,859
She said yes!

340
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,580
Your Highness, you've really promised the prince, haven't you?

341
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,059
This is great!

342
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,618
I'm so happy now!

343
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:53,958
Your Highness, I think the prince is much better than that Bo–

344
00:26:57,739 --> 00:27:01,318
Boring, disloyal men...

345
00:27:01,318 --> 00:27:03,180
Right, Brother?

346
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,419
This is great!

347
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,220
Brother!

348
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,899
This is great, Brother!

349
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,439
The promise is true,

350
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:18,719
but we need to defeat Lord Bo first

351
00:27:18,719 --> 00:27:23,760
and win the war before I can realize it.

352
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,779
The king has ordered.

353
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:30,579
We will wage war against Jin soon.

354
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,899
Everyone must serve the kingdom now.

355
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:38,059
Any stored food in households will be confiscated for military use.

356
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,179
All adult men must serve in the army.

357
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,400
Transgressors will be prosecuted!

358
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:45,819
Let go of me!

359
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,659
Mother!

360
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,779
- Mother!
- Let go of my son!

361
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,620
I've won.

362
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:11,839
Fourth Brother,

363
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:19,960
I've brought your favorite persimmons.

364
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,100
Look, it's a persimmon.

365
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:44,099
When you were young, you often said,

366
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:49,619
persimmons (shi zi) sounded like four sons (si zi).

367
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
That's why persimmons

368
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,580
represent us four siblings.

369
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,940
In the past, when I set out for war with Big Brother,

370
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,880
you would tell Father that persimmons are round.

371
00:31:17,219 --> 00:31:19,159
And that's why we brothers

372
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:23,259
should stay together.

373
00:31:42,339 --> 00:31:44,039
Fourth Brother,

374
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:50,279
I'm so sorry.

375
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,039
I couldn't save Big Brother.

376
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,859
Now, I've caused you to sink into this state.

377
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,419
We will wage war against Jin tomorrow.

378
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,020
Don't worry.

379
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,800
I will end this

380
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:18,900
very soon to come back and keep you company.

381
00:32:20,499 --> 00:32:22,780
I won't leave you alone here.

382
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,600
Why are you standing here?

383
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,939
Why aren't you inside the chamber, caring for the prince?

384
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,298
Your Highness, Lord Bo is here to visit Fourth Prince.

385
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:05,580
We were told to leave.

386
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:11,900
Only Youzhen's illness can motivate Lord Bo to battle.

387
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:14,219
It's good that he's here.

388
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:15,699
Open the door.

389
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,419
Yes, Your Highness.

390
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
Greetings, Imperial Father.

391
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,700
Persimmons?

392
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,400
This was Youzhen's favorite food when he was a boy.

393
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,000
But ever since Youyu died in the war,

394
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
he never touched them again.

395
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,400
Now, out of my four sons,

396
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,800
only you have survived the treacherous attacks.

397
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,800
In the end, you're the only one left.

398
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,400
Don't worry, Imperial Father.

399
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Big Brother was a hero when he was alive

400
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
and a legend even now.

401
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,800
He will protect me from Heaven

402
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,800
so I can take my revenge until I die.

403
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
Lord Bo,

404
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,000
I can feel your blood thirst and fighting spirit now.

405
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Truly exceptional.

406
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,700
I also know

407
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,800
what you told Youzhen in this room just now.

408
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,600
Your bloodlust is different from that of the past.

409
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,000
You can't even conceal it.

410
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,800
It gave you away.

411
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,300
I also know that

412
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,600
you plan to risk everything,

413
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,800
including your life to avenge Youzhen.

414
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,900
Then,

415
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,600
take your burning spirit with you

416
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,200
and decimate both the Ma Family Army and the Jin Army.

417
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,400
Lord Bo, don't forget.

418
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,000
You still owe your eldest brother a life.

419
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,400
Now, Fourth Prince has turned into a vegetable for you.

420
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
Lord Bo,

421
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:58,800
only by winning this war and killing the princess of the previous dynasty can you answer to your brothers.

422
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
Yes, Father.

Youzhen.

425
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,200
Youzhen, it's your father.

426
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,800
I'm here with you.

427
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,000
Wake up.

428
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,200
Youzhen.

429

- Yao Ji.
- Yes, Your Highness.

430
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,100
Quick! Examine his pulse now!

431
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,700
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:45,300
Father, just now, when I was alone with him, I noticed his fingers moving slightly.

433
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,300
I think he's getting better.

434
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,600
His hands are moving?

435
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,800
Then, he will wake up very soon, right, Yao Ji?

436
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,400
Your Majesty,

437
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,400
the prince's pulse was restless just now, but it has calmed.

438
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,000
But judging from his reaction when he saw the persimmon,

439
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,800
I suggest that when you visit him in the future,

440
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,200
you can talk to him or show him some of his favorite things.

441
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,400
This may help him recover soon.

442
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:26,300
I will do exactly what you said.

443
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,400
Your Majesty, we have received an urgent report.

444
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,300
Speak.

445
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,000
The rebel, Wang Rong, has seized Boxiang City.

446
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,800
The fools have finally taken the bait.

447
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,600
It's time for me to wipe those beasts out now.

448
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,200
Let's go!

449
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,600
Wait for me.

450
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Let's go!

451
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,600
Even before Wang Rong seized Boxiang,

452
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,600
I have sent hundreds of elite soldiers to conceal themselves among the commoners.

453
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,500
When I invade later, once I sound the call,

454
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,300
these soldiers will respond and ruin the enemy's plan.

455
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:51,600
Since we will be aided from the inside, Boxiang City will soon become hell for the enemy.

456
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,000
You go ahead first with the primary army.

457
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,600
I will back you up personally and march towards Weizhou city together.

458

The seal, please.

459
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,700
Receive the seal.

460
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,400
Kill the enemy and win the war.

461
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,000
I will lead my soldiers to Boxiang City tomorrow morning.

I heard Ma Zhaixing and her company have reached Boxiang City to defend the city.

464
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,400
Her? The previous dynasty's princess?

465

When Lord Bo's troops conquer Boxiang City,

469
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,400
we will set off to Weizhou City and supervise.

470
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,200
You will focus on treating Youzhen.

[Boxiang City]

Our scouts have reported that Lord Bo has deployed his troops.

474
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:05,400
This is exactly what our king had expected.

475
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,600
My old dad has foreseen that judging from how crazy Chu Kui can be,

476
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:16,700
as long as we strike first and win a battle, we can enrage him into attacking us.

♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

492
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:04,200
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

493
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,200
♫ Forever being together ♫
