- Your Highness.
- Be careful.

Come out!

I have something to ask you.

36
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,300
Give me the blade.

37

Give me the blade!

- Give it to him.
- My Lord.

39

Fourth Prince is drunk.

40
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,200
He might be reckless.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,300
Be careful, Master.

42
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,800

you couldn't even love the woman you love the most.

kill yourself who is being deceived.

53

I can give you your freedom by doing that.

Here.

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,000
How much did Fourth Prince drink?

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
He even called Master's name directly.

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,700
I think he was so drunk that he lost his rationality.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,200
I think he spoke his true feelings after he got drunk.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,600
What Fourth Prince said just now was heartbreaking.

67
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,200
Did Master not evade him

68
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,600
because he actually wanted to be killed by Fourth Prince?

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,400
Master has already killed the Wolf Boy

70
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,600

Remove all the usnea herbs.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,800
I don't want any plants in the mansion.

75

Clean Ma Zhaixing's room.

76
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000

You will exhaust yourself without eating or drinking anything.

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,500
Ji Chong said he will teach me archery this morning.

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
Why isn't he here yet?

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
Maybe...

84
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Will you teach me archery now?

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,100
Are you ready?

86
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,000
Come in!

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,200
His Highness is calling us.

88
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,400
- His Highness is so handsome.
- I'm so nervous.

89
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
He's still so handsome.

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Aren't you teaching me archery?

91

They are...

You are ready but I'm not.

93
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,600
I have to eat.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,900
But I can't really make a decision.

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,600
Decide for me.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Don't reject me.

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Otherwise, I won't teach you archery.

98

100
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,600
Pick mine.

101
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,700
Mine is delicious.

102
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,800
It is very delicious.

103
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Pick mine.

104

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,000
May I ask?

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,700
What is the difference for all of you

107
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,300
if I choose one and not the other?

108

Don't tell me that all of you

109

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,700
Princess,

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,100
- how could you call His Highness as "that guy"?
- That's right.

112
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,500
His Highness is handsome and talented.

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,100
He is the cream of the crop in Jin.

114
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,600
I apologize for being rude.

115
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,400
His Highness is more handsome compared to seven years ago.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,200
His smile will charm everyone.

117

He's so handsome.

118
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,500
Crown Prince is handsome, too.

119
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,200
- Why don't you surround him instead?
- I'm sure you don't know this.

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,000
His Highness isn't arrogant and is approachable.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,600
Crown Prince is strict and doesn't smile.

122
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,300
He's very cool.

123
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,931
Princess, all of us envy you.

124
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,588
Look! His Highness is infatuated with you.

125
00:07:56,588 --> 00:08:00,900
That's right, Princess. You are taking it for granted.

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,400
- So handsome.
- Surprisingly,

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
this guy is also a superstar.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,100
Look!

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Do all of you want His Highness to eat the breakfast you made for him?

130
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,100
I've decided.

131
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,800
Which will you choose?

132
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,000
This. This. This.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
This, this, and this.

134
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,800
Everything from here.

135
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,900
All right.

136
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,700
Since you've made your choice, bring them over.

137

You're asking me to pick?

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,700
- Ma Zhaixing.
- I'll make you burst at the seams.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,700
I'm ordering you to finish everything.

140
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,400
No leftovers.

141
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,100
Otherwise, don't expect me to teach you archery.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,500
You... liar.

143

In this world,

144

only Prince Ji Chong can make Princess eat and drink.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,600
These are for His Highness.

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,200
You chose all of these on your own.

147
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
You have to finish them.

148
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,300
Hurry up. It's been so long since you had a proper meal.

149
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,500
That's too much.

150
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,600
She's so rude. She has no manners.

151
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,200
Slow down.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
Will you teach me archery once I'm done?

153
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,400
Finish it first.

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,900
Slow down. There's no rush.

155
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,400
Slow down. Look at you.

He's wiping her mouth.

157
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,300
How is that possible?

158
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Ma Zhaixing,

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
besides this,

160
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,500
I can still do more for you.

161
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,600
You can choose to live any life you want.

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,200
What do you have in mind?

163
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,600
I will give you three choices.

164
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,700
The first choice.

165
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,400
Keep leading the Ma Family Army and live your life opposing Lord Bo.

166
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,500
Second choice.

167
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Go on an adventure with me and enjoy yourself in the pugilistic world.

168
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
Third choice.

169
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,700
Marry me.

170
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,200
Rely on me.

171
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Leave revenge-taking to me.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
Let me protect you forever.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,300
You should know that in my current state,

174
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,700
I can only choose the first choice.

175
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,800
I've already guessed that.

176
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,300
I just want you to know that as a prince myself,

177
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,000
I can offer you so much more than Lord Bo.

178
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:56,300
That includes changing your life.

179
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,500
Zhaixing,

180
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,000
I will support you with all my heart in defeating Lord Bo.

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,900
But you have to promise me.

182
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Never let hatred change your original self.

183
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,000
Sometimes hating someone too much

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,600
will make you forget what you wanted initially.

185
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,500
Ji Chong, thank you.

186
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,500
Also, I don't want you to strain yourself.

187
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,200
I don't want you to torture yourself.

188
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,200
You have to eat, sleep, and rest on time.

189
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,600
I know you are doing this for my own good.

190
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,300
I promise.

191
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Are you done?

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,500
Let's go.

193
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
Where are we going?

194
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,800
Didn't you pick the first life?

195
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I will do my best to help you out.

196
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,100
I'm bringing you to someone who can contend against the King of Jin.

197
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,400
Let's go.

198
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
Remember to guard this place.

199
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't let outsiders come in again.

200
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,100
Yes.

201
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ji Chong, we are here...

202
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
Who lives inside?

203
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Pingyuan, Elder Princess of the previous era.

204
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I asked Ke Lang to investigate this for me.

205
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Besides her identity

206
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:55,800
and the fact that tomorrow is her birthday, I know nothing else.

207
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
The elder princess of the previous era is still alive?

208
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,600
Why didn't King of Jin announce it to the public and instead hid the truth?

209
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Also, how did Elder Princess survive Chu Kui's massacre?

210
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,400
We have to find a key person to answer all your questions

211
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,500
so we can stand on the same ground as the old man.

212
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,400
What a surprise.

213
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,000
The person who always passed by and didn't visit is here to see me.

214
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,800
Grand Supervisor.

215
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,600
- Ma Jing, close the door!
- Yes!

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,200
This is a trap!

217
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Help! Help!

218
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,000
Grand Supervisor.

219
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
What a strong girl.

220
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,700
I wonder why Your Highness and Princess asked me to come here?

221
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,200
Grand Supervisor, I'm sorry.

222
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,600
- I have a question.
- Princess Pingyuan at Tangxing Garden.

223
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,900
Tell me everything about her.

224
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:17,700
What is Your Highness talking about?

225
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,600
I don't get it.

226
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
See?

227
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Zhaixing, I knew it.

228
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,500
You won't get anything from him.

229
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,700
You should've listened to me.

230
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,500
We should rush Tangxing Garden and see what's going on.

231
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
No, that is too rude.

232
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,200
Why don't we go to the King of Jin directly?

233
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,700
I'm always rude to him anyway.

234
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,400
I don't mind being rude again.

235
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,900
Sure.

236
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I will accompany you to make a mess out of the King of Jin's palace.

237
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,200
- Let's go.
- Fine.

238
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,100
All right. I give up.

239
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,900
I give up. All right?

240
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,300
I will tell you everything.

241
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't cause any more trouble.

242
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,400
Grand Supervisor,

243
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,600
when I left Jin, I'd never heard of Princess Pingyuan before.

244
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Brat, you know nothing.

245
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,800
Princess Pingyuan

246
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,700
is the previous era's last surviving... royal princess.

247
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,200
A royalty?

248
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
Are you sure of her identity?

249
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,200
According to King of Jin's personality, I'm sure her identity is confirmed.

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,000
As the last surviving member of the previous era,

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,400
doesn't she want to appear in public and gather people?

252
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,000
Elder Princess lives a tough life.

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,200
Although she experienced the massacre and survived,

254
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,400
she gained a long scar that was left on her face.

255
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Elder Princess has high self-esteem.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,200
She doesn't want to face the public with her face.

257
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,900
That was why she asked King of Jin

258
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,400
to let her live the rest of her life

259
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,200
in a low profile.

260
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,600
Zhaixing, meet her with me.

261
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,000
Brat!

262
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,200
Elder Princess is respectable.

263
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Without the King of Jin's orders, no one can enter Tangxing Garden.

264
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,400
Don't cause any trouble.

265
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,700
All right. I understand.

266
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,600
I think both Princess Pingyuan and I suffered at the hands of Chu Kui.

267
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,900
We have the same fate.

268
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,600
I heard that tomorrow is Elder Princess's birthday.

269
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm sure you are busy.

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,400
I've taken too much of your time.

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,000
That is too much coming from you, Princess.

272
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,500
If there's nothing else, I'll be leaving now.

273
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,800
I have to prepare for Princess's birthday tomorrow.

274
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,100
Thanks for today, Grand Supervisor.

275
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,600
I didn't expect to get such important information.

276
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,800
Zhaixing,

277
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
we should get Princess Pingyuan to come to our side

278
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,400
and ask her to support you and the Ma Family Army.

279
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,400
With that, the old man will not be able to control you.

280
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
This won't work.

281
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,600
Didn't you hear what he just said?

282
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,000
No one can see Princess Pingyuan without the King of Jin's orders.

283
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's better for us to find another way.

284
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,400
Fourth Prince, please drink it.

285
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
This is a hangover cure.

286
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Why are you in my manor?

287
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
This is the Bo Royal Manor.

288
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,800
You were drunk yesterday.

289
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,200
You made a mess out of the Bo Royal Manor.

290
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,100
What did I do?

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,200
Your Highness...

292
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,000
tried to kill Lord Bo with a sword yesterday.

293
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,100
I tried to kill Third Brother?

294
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,000
Is he all right now?

295
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,000
He is so strong.

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,700
No one can hurt him.

297
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,000
Why am I worrying about nothing?

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,500
People like him deserve to die.

299
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,900
You were more honest when you were drunk.

300
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,700
It feels like you are lying now that you are sober.

301
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,000
What did I say?

302
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Stop making me guess.

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,400
The truth.

304
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,300
Did you forget about the truth you said?

305
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,310
[Prince Bin of the Yang, Chu Youyu's Tomb]

306
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,400
The grass on Big Brother's grave has grown again.

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,300
I finally understand why Big Brother

308
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:48,400
sacrificed his own life and chose to save you back then.

309
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,500
Even if you were misunderstood by me,

310
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,100
you still wouldn't tell me the truth.

311
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,300
Even if you lost the person you love the most,

312
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,300
you will still sacrifice yourself for me.

313
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,900
Third Brother, you're so foolish.

314
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,500
Big Brother has been gone for so long.

315
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,200
He left you alone here in the dark.

316
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,000
It must've been lonely, right?

317
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Wipe your tears.

318
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,500
Both Big Brother and I don't want to see your crying face.

319
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,300
Third Brother, I swear.

320
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,100
From now on,

321
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,000
I will not let you fight this battle alone.

322
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,200
I won't be as childish as I used to be.

323
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,000
I will take you as my example and listen to you.

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,200
I will never disobey you.

325
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400
If you don't believe me,

326
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,000
I'll ask Big Brother to be my witness.

327
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,620
[Prince Bin of the Yang, Chu Youyu's Tomb]

328
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,160
You have to promise me one thing.

329
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,980
Tell me.

330
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,879
Never get drunk and make a mess at the Bo Royal Manor

331
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,419
and call me by my name.

332
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,859
It's getting late. Let's go.

333
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,639
Wait. I came here because I have something important to tell Big Brother.

334
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:57,900
I hope Big Brother can bless Third Brother and Sis Zhaixing.

335
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,579
Although they are already on opposing sides,

336
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:04,540
I hope they never fight each other.

337
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:10,180
I don't want to see two people in love fighting with each other again.

338
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:16,660
You can't hide from what is supposed to happen.

339
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:21,399
What's coming will still come in the end.

340
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,939
[Tangxing Garden]

341
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,480
Feudal Young Mistress,

342
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,900
are you sure you want to do this?

343
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,619
Besides meeting Princess Pingyuan

344
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:01,619
and having her support me and the Ma Family Army, I have no other choice.

345
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,359
Didn't you oppose this method when Ji Chong suggested it?

346
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,299
I don't want to get him involved in this.

347
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,580
I've troubled him enough.

348
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,433
I don't want his father and son relationship with King of Jin to get worse.

349
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:19,118
All right. I'm going all out for you, Young Feudal Mistress.

350
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:40,300
I didn't expect Princess Pingyuan and my mother to have the same birthday.

351
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,779
Both of them like usnea herb as well.

352
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,959
Is she the one?

353
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,659
Ma Zhaixing is here to see Princess Pingyuan.

354
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,838
Who are you?

355
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,279
How dare you trespass the Tangxing Garden?

356
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,318
Someone!

357
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:46,019
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:56,019
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

359
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm here today to ask for a request.

360
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,080
I apologize for frightening Your Highness just now.

361
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,220
I hope you forgive me.

362
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,040
I've heard about Princess Ma from King of Jin.

363
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,058
Although I don't know what your request is,

364
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,179
I'm sure I can't help you.

365
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:16,239
Princess Ma, please return.

366
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,399
What I'm requesting for is what Your Highness

367
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:23,400
has always been hoping for every day.

368
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,938
A peaceful life for the people in our hometown.

369
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:27,578
King of Jin has his plans.

370
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:31,239
I advise you not to be anxious.

371
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,539
I can't endure it any longer.

372
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,338
Your Highness is bearing the grudge of the nation.

373
00:26:36,339 --> 00:26:38,700
Will you endure it again and again?

374
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,300
I'm a weak woman.

375
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,940
If it wasn't for King of Jin's protection,

376
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,599
I'm afraid I would've already been dead.

377
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,580
Taking revenge is sweet.

378
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,599
But if it is rushed,

379
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:57,098
you might die before you've taken your revenge.

380
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,419
But we can no longer delay it.

381
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:03,639
If we drag this out, Jin will lose its chance to initiate the attack.

382
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,040
That is why I am so anxious.

383
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,459
If Your Highness begs King of Jin

384
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:11,779
to deploy his army and attack Chu Kui, perhaps he might listen.

385
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,200
Chu Kui is the culprit who annihilated your family after all.

386
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:19,340
I don't understand anything about situations and timing.

387
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,680
I advise you to forget about this.

388
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:27,040
But I understand your pain of not being able to speak out

389
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,210
after all these years.

390
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,500
This pain can never be told to anyone

391
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,660
and can only be kept inside.

392
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,440
Living in silence during the day and struck by nightmares at night.

393
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,980
You'll experience more pain as time passes.

394
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:59,560
Bearing the huge burden of hatred alone

395
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,079
that will never be gone.

396
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,479
It is endless.

397
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,599
You were correct about my situation all these years indeed.

398
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,019
You are ambitious.

399
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:19,279
But from what I've heard, the Ma Family Army is a group full of elites

400
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,659
without a leader.

401
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,380
The discipline is weak.

402
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,720
It is not as strong as it used to be.

403
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,799
I hope Your Highness will come with me and see for yourself.

404
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,199
The usnea herb was my mother's favorite flower when she was alive.

405
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,839
It signifies the "queen."

406
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:04,039
Alike.

407
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,119
You look so alike.

408
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:09,380
Your Highness.

409
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,160
Your face looks like a friend of mine.

410
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,840
Was your mother from the Yang?

411
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,139
Of course.

412
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,079
My mother was poor.

413
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:23,119
She married my father as a concubine.

414
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,219
It's impossible that Your Highness knew my mother.

415
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:33,119
I'm not sure why but I feel familiar with you.

416
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:39,519
Maybe it's because both of us like the usnea herb.

417
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,760
So...

418
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,040
I will go with you.

419
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,479
Thank you, Your Highness.

420
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:49,399
The Ma Family Army will not disappoint you.

421
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:51,799
There is a path to go out in the back garden.

422
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:54,059
We don't have to alert the guards.

423
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,659
All right.

424
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,099
Here!

425

Pass. Over here!

426
00:30:00,819 --> 00:30:02,139
Here. Let's go.

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,140
Here. Hurry up!

428
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,000
- Hurry!
- Here!

429
00:30:07,459 --> 00:30:09,339
Pass!

430
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:11,858
- Look.
- Who are you passing to?

431
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:14,899
I hope we don't have to fight anymore.

432
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,859
Life like this is so good.

433
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,979
Exactly.

434
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,139
If we had a woman by our side, that would be perfect.

435
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,118
Yes. You are right.

436
00:30:23,118 --> 00:30:25,019
Pass it here.

437
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,199
This is what you wanted to show me?

438
00:30:30,099 --> 00:30:32,299
The Ma Family Army is really as King of Jin said.

439
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,400
Hurry up!

440
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,379
Princess is here!

441
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,139
Quiet! Stand in line!

442
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,139
Princess!

443
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,539
Princess. Madam. Ma Jing.

444
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:46,760
Princess, have you eaten?

445
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,780
What are you doing?

446
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,323
There is no discipline at all!

447
00:30:51,323 --> 00:30:54,400
Is this the Ma Family Army that terrifies everyone?

448
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,159
Princess, I can explain. This–

449
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,720
Ma Yehan,

450
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,640
I've seen everything.

451
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,560
There is no need to explain.

452
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,500
I'm ordering you to drill the army into shape immediately.

453
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,859
You will be punished by military law, otherwise.

454
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,800
Yes, Princess.

455
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:15,974
Fall in!

456
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,139
Your Highness.

457
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,539
I'm responsible for not guiding the troops.

458
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:26,420
That was embarrassing.

459
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,079
I'm sure there's a reason for this.

460
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,178
I hope Your Highness can give the Ma Family Army another chance

461
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,260
and not be disappointed.

462
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:39,475
Since you are so confident,

463
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:45,218
show me the Ma Family Army that you speak of which is feared around the world.

464
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,520
Thank you, Your Highness.

465
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,698
King of Jin!

466
00:31:57,699 --> 00:31:59,019
Crown Prince...

467
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,458
Something... Something happened to Princess.

468
00:32:02,459 --> 00:32:03,779
What happened?

469
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:04,821
Tell him.

470
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:07,979
King of Jin, Her Highness was taken by Princess Ma.

471
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,380
She even tied me up.

472
00:32:11,939 --> 00:32:13,899
That's unacceptable!

473
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:17,359
Ju Qi, come with me.

474
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:18,860
This...

475
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,239
Stay focused!

476
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,299
Straighten your waist! Train harder!

477
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,298
Princess, our brothers were just poisoned.

478
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:39,058
They are recovering.

479
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,540
Weren't you worrying about their health yesterday?

480
00:32:45,199 --> 00:32:52,019
Father said building an army's discipline will take many years.

481
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,540
But destroying it only takes a moment.

482
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,620
The Ma Family Army's morale is low now and there's no sense of unity.

483
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:04,359
If we don't train right now, when will we recover morale?

484
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,980
Do you want King of Jin to chase us away from Taiyuan City?

485
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,260
Ma Family Army!

486
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,840
If anyone defies my orders,

487
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,880
they will be punished by military law!

488
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
Yes!

489
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,460
Focus!

490
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,139
Stand straight!

491
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,160
Didn't you eat?

492
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:42,959
Brothers! Endure it!

493
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,298
Listen to Princess.

494
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,239
Endure!

495
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,279
Get up!

496
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,600
Get up!

Get up! Keep training!

498
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,019
Can't you understand me?

499
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,500
Keep going!

500
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,279
Soldiers!

501
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:17,519
Stop!

502
00:34:23,899 --> 00:34:29,039
You met Her Highness without my orders and brought her out.

503
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,699
What were your intentions?

504
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,240
Greetings, King of Jin.

505
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,940
Please calm down.

506
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,540
I brought Her Highness to take a look at the Ma Family Army that's serving her.

507
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,740
I had no intention of offending you.

508
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:48,380
Ma Zhaixing, are you sure?

509
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,979
Or are you holding a grudge against Father for not deploying his troops?

510
00:34:51,979 --> 00:34:53,520
King of Jin,

511
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,980
your argument with her was caused by me.

512
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:59,580
I promised to come out with her.

513
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,859
I hope you don't blame Princess Ma.

514
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,759
I'm just worried about Your Highness's safety.

515
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:11,699
I will forget what Princess Ma has done.

516
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:18,218
Ju Qi, send Her Highness back to the Tangxing Garden to rest.

517
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,980
Her Highness, please.

518
00:35:24,139 --> 00:35:26,400
Farewell, Your Highness.

519
00:35:38,379 --> 00:35:42,499
An army's commander can decide the result of a battle with careful planning.

520
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,139
Being calm is the key.

521
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:50,100
You were blinded by hatred.

522
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,780
You are not suitable to command the Ma Family Army.

523
00:35:55,139 --> 00:35:56,698
Forgive me for being frank.

524
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:59,178
For the past few days, you wouldn't see me

525
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,920
and discuss the war with me.

526
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,739
I had no choice and my hands were tied.

527
00:36:05,739 --> 00:36:10,040
That was why I defied your orders and met Her Highness on my own.

528
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,421
Once the Ma Family Army finishes training,

529
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,240
I will apologize to you in person.

530
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:20,639
- Ma Jing, send King of Jin off.
- Yes.

531
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,100
How dare you?

532
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,820
Are you chasing me away?

533
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,259
Soldiers of the Ma Family Army!

534
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:34,879
Keep training!

535
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:36,860
The Ma Family Army Seal is here.

536
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,680
Stop training!

537
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:45,980
Why do you have the Ma Family Army Seal?

538
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,039
What are your intentions?

539
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,940
Did you lie to me to take away the Ma Family Army 's command?

540
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,799
Princess!

541
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,299
You've misunderstood Prince.

542
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,178
I gave him the seal.

543
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,858
You handed the seal to an outsider.

544
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:03,020
- Are you staging a rebellion?
- I...

545

Someone!

546
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,140
Take Ma Yehan away and punish him according to martial law!

547

Can't you understand my orders?

00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:19,300

Why did you throw Princess into the water?

00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:24,379
- Princess.
- Nobody move!

- Princess.
- Ji Chong, that's too much!

571
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,738
Ma Zhaixing, take a look at yourself!

572
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:42,479
Your heart is only filled with hatred toward Lord Bo.

573
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:45,099
You can't separate your allies from your enemies.

574
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,659
Are you still the Ma Zhaixing that I know?

575
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:50,240
General Ma gave me the seal

576
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,569
because he was prepared to sacrifice himself on the night before the hostage exchange!

577
00:38:54,569 --> 00:38:56,648
He was afraid that he would die when rescuing you.

578
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:58,791
That was why he asked me to protect you.

579
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:01,709
He wanted me to hand your father's seal to you.

580
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:05,729
After rescuing you, General Lee wanted to return the seal to me.

581
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,088
But I thought it was better for him to return it to you.

582
00:39:09,089 --> 00:39:12,209
That's because he contributed the most in that operation.

583
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,690
The brothers trust him as well.

584
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:26,010
Why didn't you return it to me?

585
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,669
Because you are always thinking about getting revenge.

586
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:32,709
I'm afraid seeing your father's seal will only increase your hatred.

587
00:39:32,709 --> 00:39:37,071
I wanted to wait for a few days and return to you when you've calmed down.

588
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:40,929
Also, Princess, our brothers were having fun

589
00:39:40,929 --> 00:39:42,869
because those were wine and dishes sent by Crown Prince.

590

I dare not reject.

591

I thought they worked hard for the past two days

592
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:50,259
and decided to give them a rest.

593
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,540
It was my fault that you misunderstood.

594
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:01,960
The fault is not yours.

595

I let the Ma Family Army down.

598
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:16,189
Zhaixing,

599
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:18,029
when you hate someone too much,

600
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,869
you forget what's most important to you.

601
00:40:20,869 --> 00:40:24,150
You were too busy hating Lord Bo and tortured your body.

602
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:26,689
You didn't even trust the people around you.

603
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:30,450
Ask yourself. Was it worth it?

604
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,289
I'm sorry.

I was arrogant and full of myself.

607
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:55,549
I even doubted the Ma Family Army who is loyal to me.

608
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:57,709
King of Jin was right.

609
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:00,970
I'm not suitable to command the Ma Family Army.

610
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:13,829
The Ma Zhaixing in my heart is extremely smart and is also wise and benevolent.

She also has the courage that doesn't lose to men.

If you are not blinded by hatred and face it calmly,
