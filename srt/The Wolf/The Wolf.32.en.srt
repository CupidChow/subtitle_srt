[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,669
[Episode 32] 
You're in Qitan.

21
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:35,848
Do you plan to take her life here?

22
00:01:35,848 --> 00:01:40,448
King of Jin chose this timing to announce the existence of Princess Pingyuan

23
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:43,129
because he wants her to stop living in hiding.

24
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:46,469
I am helping her overcome her fear.

25
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:49,389
You shouldn't be concerned.

26
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:51,810
I think King of Jin miscalculated.

27
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,070
Princess Pingyuan is no longer young,

28
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,590
and she seems frail.

29
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,389
Are you sure she can rally the people to her cause?

30
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,750
She might as well just keep hiding and live an ignoble existence.

31
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:10,370
Zhaixing, take the princess and leave.

32
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:14,089
Prince of Bo.

33
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,110
Princess, fear not.

34
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,030
I merely have a piece of advice for you.

35
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:26,090
Do you see the old drum at the corner?

36
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:31,309
Look at it clearly.

37
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:34,330
Do not make yourself a pawn.

38
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,190
Once King of Jin has conquered the world,

39
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,749
your fate will be just like that drum,

40
00:02:42,749 --> 00:02:47,429
abandoned in the corner and left to die.

41
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,669
King of Jin is a man of honor.

42
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:57,849
My fate will surely not be the same as that drum.

43
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:00,788
Prince of Bo, you should stop wasting your time.

44
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,869
Young Feudal Mistress Ma and Prince of Jin, let's leave.

45
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,349
Yes.

46
00:03:19,309 --> 00:03:21,029
Third Brother, how can you find it funny?

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,189
I am terribly distressed!

48
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,720
We're initially in a sure-win situation,

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,080
but suddenly this Princess Pingyuan came out of nowhere.

50
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,989
This Princess Pingyuan is an imposter.

51
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,409
How did it go?

52
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,910
Did Princess Pingyuan's arrival stir up some trouble for Prince of Bo?

53
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,089
Everything is as King of Jin expected.

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,889
The King of Qitan never forgot her kindness to him.

55
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:48,068
His harsh attitude toward us

56
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,769
has changed.

57
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,849
This is great.

58
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,929
Do you see the old drum at the corner?

59
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,829
Do not make yourself a pawn.

60
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,350
Your fate will be just like that drum,

61
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,890
abandoned in the corner and left to die.

62
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:15,170
King of Jin is a man of honor.

63
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,189
My fate will surely not be the same as that drum.

64
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,148
Ji Chong, what are you doing?

65
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:25,388
She is an imposter.

66
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,189
She is not the real Princess Pingyuan.

67
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,549
That old fool tricked us all!

68
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:35,489
General Li, now is not the time to joke about this!

69
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,650
How do you know?

70
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,830
Our plan was supposed to be flawless.

71
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,649
So you knew she was a fake?

72
00:04:45,649 --> 00:04:48,030
You were working with the old man?

73
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:52,749
Ma Zhaixing, you're toying with unspeakable danger.

74
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,330
This was the only chance to thwart them from borrowing soldiers.

75
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,389
I must take a leap of faith even if it costs me my life.

76
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,770
Prince of Bo has noticed that she is an imposter.

77
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,469
He knows.

78
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,989
How can he know?

79
00:05:04,989 --> 00:05:08,750
Do you know why he mentioned the drum at the corner?

80
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:13,530
The drum in the king's tent is no ordinary drum.

81
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,948
It was given to the leader of Qitan by the past ruler of the previous dynasty.

82
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,469
It's a symbol of the Qitan King's power.

83
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,289
It's an heirloom.

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,990
A princess from that said dynasty

85
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,889
failed to recognize the drum from her own nation,

86
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,990
and she even acted like it meant nothing.

87
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:39,069
The princess lived deep in the palace and she doesn't know politics.

88
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,230
It's normal for her to not recognize the drum.

89
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,209
You can use that as an excuse.

90
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:47,849
But as the king knows, Princess Pingyuan knows much about Qitan.

91
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:51,250
How could she not know this important detail?

92
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,909
Even if Prince of Bo doesn't expose her now,

93
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:59,990
he must be suspecting Pingyuan's identity.

94
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,610
The military aid is at stake.

95
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,449
Prince of Bo won't give up until he finds the evidence.

96
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,749
Third Brother, that was impressive!

97
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,548
You used an old drum to bait that fake princess.

98
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:21,469
Zhaixing and Ji Chong didn't even notice anything.

99
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:24,148
But there's something I don't quite understand.

100
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:28,189
Third Brother, when did you realize the princess was an imposter?

101
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,449
Intuition.

102
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:32,588
That's why I must test her.

103
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:34,310
That's very observant.

104
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,889
She is a princess from the past dynasty, so how could she not remember the drum from her own dynasty?

105
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,148
It's true Qitan has diplomatic relations with the previous dynasty.

106
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:47,629
But past Qitan kings have been displeased with the oppressive relationship.

107
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:49,829
That's why they chose to side with us.

108
00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:54,969
If Pingyuan uses the drum and her past with Qitan to incite sentimentality,

109
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:57,389
King of Qitan might change his mind.

110
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,949
But how can we convince the king she is an imposter with a drum?

111
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,750
We can't.

112
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,469
It's merely the first step to prove my suspicion.

113
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,290
We need firm evidence.

114
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,129
There is no firm evidence.

115
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,989
Only the king has ever seen the real princess.

116
00:07:12,989 --> 00:07:16,370
Everyone else who did is probably dead by now.

117
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,130
There is.

118
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,209
Chu Zhen, the painter.

119
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:26,849
Back then my father didn't slaughter all of the servants of the past dynasty.

120
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:30,230
Some of those not involved in the imperial court were spared

121
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,148
to continue their service in the palace.

122
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,708
Chu Zhen was one of them.

123
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:36,769
Now that you have said it,

124
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,050
I do have some memory of that.

125
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,108
When I was young there was indeed an old painter in the palace.

126
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:47,109
But that painter left years ago.

127
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:50,929
Do you actually know where he is right now?

128
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:54,029
He is in Shenzhou.

129
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,209
Father has sent men to keep watch on him.

130
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,588
Master, Shenzhou is one of the cities nearest to Qitan.

131
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:03,750
Even with a fast horse it will take one day for the trip.

132
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,308
Bring him here.

133
00:08:05,309 --> 00:08:07,570
Make it back before the coronation ceremony.

134
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,669
Remember, keep a low profile.

135
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,970
Do not let Ma Zhaixing and her men spot you.

136
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,930
Yes, consider it done.

137
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,928
Third Brother, are you planning to expose that fake princess during the ceremony tomorrow?

138
00:08:20,928 --> 00:08:22,550
Yes.

139
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,548
But Young Feudal Mistress Ma might be held accountable.

140
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,029
Hai Die, don't be silly.

141
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,669
Remember, Ma Zhaixing has Bao Na to back her up.

142
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,249
With that crazy Bao Na around, the king would probably only lecture her.

143
00:08:32,249 --> 00:08:35,570
In the worst case, they would only be banished.

144
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:37,989
Fourth Prince is right.

145
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,990
I was being silly.

146
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:46,649
I thought that the old man had changed

147
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,950
and allowed you to make up for your mistake.

148
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,489
But it was the other way around.

149
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:56,130
That's why no officers from Jin came with us.

150
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,268
That old man had this planned all along!

151
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:02,948
If our plan was exposed, he could absolve himself of any responsibility.

152
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:05,230
He could make you the scapegoat.

153
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:09,829
Ma Zhaixing, that old man set you up!

154
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:10,989
No.

155
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,030
King of Jin had told me the risk of this plan.

156
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,310
I made the decision myself.

157
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,350
I will order Liu Xin to impersonate Princess Pingyuan and go with you.

158
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,170
I understand.

159
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,889
I appreciate the honesty.

160
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:33,230
But I have decided to follow your plan and travel with Liu Xin.

161
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,130
I will never forgive myself if Chu Kui succeeds.

162
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:40,110
This mission is full of perils.

163
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,030
If Princess Pingyuan's identity is exposed,

164
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,628
you will be the only one held accountable.

165
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:48,391
You must not put diplomatic relations at risk.

166
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:52,049
Are you certain about your decision?

167
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:54,829
I've made up my mind.

168
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:58,610
I only hope that you will treat the Ma Army well.

169
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,509
Certainly, I will.

170
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,508
Desperate measures need perfect timing.

171
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:09,030
If we miss the timing, nothing will work.

172
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,989
I know the risk,

173
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:13,030
but I must take the chance.

174
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,650
You sound just like that old man.

175
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,629
Who is this girl here?

176
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,390
She is Liu Xin.

177
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,270
She was Princess Pingyuan's personal servant.

178
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,950
So she knows about the princess's past with the king.

179
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,369
Years ago, King of Jin found out who she was.

180
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,050
So he had her impersonate Princess Pingyuan.

181
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:41,189
He thought that one day this disguise might be useful.

182
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,589
The old man always plans ahead.

183
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:45,490
The life of others means nothing to him.

184
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:48,370
This really looks like his doing.

185
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,508
General. Young Mistress.

186
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,649
As the general expected, Mo Xiao has left in secrecy.

187
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:58,588
I was planning to follow him, but that would alert him.

188
00:10:58,589 --> 00:10:59,889
So I returned.

189
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,210
So Prince of Bo has made his move.

190
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,830
He must have someone spying on us.

191
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,710
Even if we escape now, it will be too late.

192
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,850
But we can't just wait and do nothing.

193
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,429
Young Mistress, maybe we could ask Princess Bao Na for help.

194
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:14,610
No!

195
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,948
We've troubled her too many times.

196
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,071
We must not let her know this plan.

197
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:20,410
Zhaixing is right.

198
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,950
For now, we must pretend nothing has happened.

199
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,130
We cannot let Prince of Bo see any flaw.

200
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,570
After nightfall,

201
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:31,410
I will intercept the evidence Mo Xiao brings back.

202
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,150
But, General, we have no idea what their plan is.

203
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,769
How do we stop it?

204
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,650
They will pass Wu Town to reach Qitan.

205
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,610
Wu Town is a small town.

206
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,070
After nightfall,

207
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,350
I'll wait for him there.

208
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,068
It doesn't matter what evidence Prince of Bo has to expose us,

209
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:50,890
I must sabotage it.

210
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,070
Without evidence,

211
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,610
it's only Prince of Bo's word against ours.

212
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,188
Ji Chong, Liu Xin's safety is in your hands.

213
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,209
If I fail to stop him,

214
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,889
remember, you must deny ever being involved.

215
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:11,388
What about Liu Xin?

216
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:13,830
The King of Qitan will never spare her!

217
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:17,289
From the day she agreed to become King of Jin's pawn,

218
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,649
she should have been ready for this.

219
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,329
This day will come sooner or later.

220
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,270
I...

221
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,150
Liu Xin,

222
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,828
Ji Chong has never failed.

223
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,930
He will stop their plan.

224
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:38,749
Ji Chong, I will distract Prince of Bo

225
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:40,430
so you can leave unnoticed.

226
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,108
- Brother Ye Han.
- Yes.

227
00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:43,849
Take care of Liu Xin.

228
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:45,029
Yes.

229
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,370
Stay cautious.

230
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,089
Don't worry.

231
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,409
This time, I won't be bested by him again.

232
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,908
Third Brother, come. Try this local wine.

233
00:13:07,908 --> 00:13:10,470
Take this as an early celebration.

234
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,208
I'll pass. I need to stay alert tonight.

235
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,549
Third Brother, you're being paranoid.

236
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,629
There is no way Ji Chong would know you sent Mo Xiao to find the painter Chu Zhen.

237
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:25,109
Not to mention you have Hai Die watching them.

238
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,669
Nothing can go wrong.

239
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:30,689
Ma Zhaixing is no match for your wits.

240
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,628
Do you really have so much faith in me?

241
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:36,828
Of course!

242
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,588
Ma Zhaixing admires you.

243
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,470
She couldn't even bear to kill your warrior wolf.

244
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,670
From what I see, she will forever be bested by you.

245
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:55,110
Master, Ma Zhaixing has just left her tent.

246
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:57,289
She went into the Qitan king's tent secretly.

247
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,708
We'll use that drum tomorrow to expose Ma Zhaixing,

248
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,388
but she entered the king's tent?

249
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,970
Did she notice anything?

250
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,410
Zhaixing, kindness is your greatest weakness.

251
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,870
I must hone you to make you strong.

252
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:13,349
General.

253
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:17,188
Well?

254
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,989
When Princess Ma entered the king's tent, Prince of Bo rushed toward there,

255
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,590
but his men are still watching us.

256
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,649
Now is our chance. You must set out to intercept Mo Xiao.

257
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:28,029
Very well.

258
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,630
Our plan has been jeopardized

259
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,249
because I fell for Prince of Bo's trick.

260
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:39,229
Prince.

261
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,630
Prince, I want to live!

262
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:46,430
Zhaixing and I will do our best to keep you safe.

263
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,530
Next, we must count on Zhaixing to stall Prince of Bo.

264
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:31,350
Why are you here?

265
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,429
Why are you wiping the old drum for no reason?

266
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,250
Are you doing this out of guilt,

267
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,489
or is this to salvage your plan?

268
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,170
Answer me!

269
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,849
Would you still believe anything I say?

270
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:52,710
I can judge for myself.

271
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,089
The princess ordered me to confirm if this drum was a present from the past dynasty.

272
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:02,588
Because it was covered in dust, not to mention your threats,

273
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:05,089
Her Highness couldn't recognize it.

274
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,270
Stop making excuses.

275
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,949
Do you think cleaning the drum

276
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,070
will keep the king from finding out the princess is an imposter?

277
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,069
It's futile.

278
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:33,189
I knew you wouldn't believe me even if I told you the truth.

279
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,209
But you would believe what your eyes see, right?

280
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,889
Between killing and mercy,

281
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,510
I chose mercy for your wolf,

282
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,970
but do you know why I spared it?

283
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,609
No one asked for your mercy.

284
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,589
Your soft heart will only make you fail beyond any hope.

285
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:00,690
That's why we are different.

286
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,289
It is also what differentiates Jin and Yang.

287
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,450
I learned to show mercy from Ji Chong and the King of Jin.

288
00:17:09,149 --> 00:17:11,129
Even if I hold a grudge against you,

289
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:16,070
I mustn't hurt people or myself out of recklessness.

290
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:29,090
I believe righteousness will always prevail.

291
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:37,730
Jin's fate is like that of the past dynasty.

292
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,549
In the end,

293
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:42,910
Yang will destroy it!

294
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,510
How dare you!

295
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,410
What are you doing?

296
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,610
Let go of me!

297
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,988
Let go!

298
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,228
You sneaked into the king's tent. This is an action of a thief.

299
00:18:10,229 --> 00:18:12,988
I will bring you to them myself!

300
00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:16,089
Stay away from me! Stay away from me!

301
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,669
Prince of Bo and Young Feudal Mistress Ma.

302
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,589
Why are you here?

303
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,930
Well...

304
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,029
Young Mistress and Prince of Bo, don't you know the belts you're holding

305
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,429
are meant for the Festival of Fire Dance tomorrow?

306
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,949
The king will wear the belts for all the lovers in this world.

307
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:08,309
Granny, I didn't mean disrespect.

308
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,949
I hope you understand.

309
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:11,549
This must be destiny's arrangement.

310
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,250
Impossible!

311
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:19,750
But... why were you two holding the belt at the same time?

312
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,149
Prince of Bo, may I ask?

313
00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:25,670
Did you tie the belt to Young Mistress Ma's hand?

314
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,590
Prince of Bo, please follow our tradition

315
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,330
and tie the belt for her so as to complete the ceremony.

316
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,610
Otherwise, the king will be upset when he finds out.

317
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:53,468
Are you really going to do as she said?

318
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,748
Just get this over with.

319
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:58,210
I don't want her to keep nagging at me.

320
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,620
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

321
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,770
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

322
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:20,820
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who
its afterglow will illuminate ♫

323
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,040
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

324
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,210
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense ♫

325
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:32,530
♫ But gentleness is always invincible  ♫

326
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,270
♫ I am already used to viewing from high above
in the mountain alone ♫

327
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,590
♫ Don't need any vast fame and power ♫

328
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,780
♫ During the day, sunlight lights up the road I walk on,
at night, my vision illuminates it ♫

329
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,750
♫ Except for the numbing solitary that
makes me lose miserably ♫

330
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,960
♫ I have yet to encounter any challenge that I find difficult ♫

331
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,560
♫ Even going against the tides, my vision is still steady,
manners is still fierce ♫

332
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,170
♫ I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling,
it’s history in the making ♫

333
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,980
♫ Climbing mountains and cliffs ♫

334
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,400
♫ I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry,
just so I can push on harder ♫

335
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,500
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

336
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,350
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

337
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,400
♫ Without you, it does not matter who I am ♫

338
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,990
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

339
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,930
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

340
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:23,220
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who
its afterglow will illuminate ♫

341
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,430
♫ The banished, waiting for someone the same ♫

342
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,570
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense ♫

343
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:35,560
♫ But gentleness is always invincible  ♫

344
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,230
♫ I waste away aimlessly and without anyone urging me ♫

345
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,120
♫ A homeless drifter's delusional wish
of finding a place of belonging ♫

346
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,010
♫ Have long since lost the destination,
like a lone goose flying in circles ♫

347
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,980
♫ Just before I was about to give up ♫

348
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,280
♫ You suddenly appeared, bringing me light ♫

349
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,350
♫ Letting me find the way in the endless darkness ♫

350
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,750
♫ No more hesitation, no more looking all around ♫

351
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,510
♫ You took away what I care about and all my attention ♫

352
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:00,720
♫ But let me know who I am and give me a destination ♫

353
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,910
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

354
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,429
Stay calm, Ma Zhaixing.

355
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,650
We're only one step away.

356
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,110
I must stall Prince of Bo so Ji Chong can get away safely.

357
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,070
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey ♫

358
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,290
♫ Indifference is the suppressed sorrow
for the person inside the armor ♫

359
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:38,560
♫ A drop of tear could destroy it
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

360
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:44,720
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

361
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,370
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

362
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,750
♫ But let me know who I am and give me a destination ♫

363
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,790
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string ♫

364
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,030
♫ has experienced warmth ♫

♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey ♫

366
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,710
Congratulations, Young Mistress and Your Highness.

367
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,069
You've exchanged your token of love. Now, your love

368
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,129
will forever be blessed.

369
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:19,129
Granny, I'm not feeling very well. May I leave now?

370
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:24,010
Just now I think I might have contracted some very nasty filth.

371
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,310
Thank you for helping.

372
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,269
Thank you for playing along with my plan to stall Prince of Bo.

373
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:48,468
Before I had mistaken you for a servant and I felt so sorry for it.

374
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:53,730
That is why I didn't ask and played along to stall Prince of Bo.

375
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,108
However, not all of it was fake.

376
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,230
The green and white belts

377
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,529
are indeed meant to bless all the lovers in the world.

378
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:17,029
But Prince of Bo and I are never going to be blessed.

379
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:26,810
Master, we got the target.

380
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,310
Let's go.

381
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:33,009
Brother Ye Han, did Ji Chong get away?

382
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:37,828
- Brother Ye Han?
- Young Feudal Mistress!

383
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:39,530
Bad news.

384
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,349
Where is Liu Xin?

385
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,748
She told me she was retrieving an important belonging from the tent.

386
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,930
She never came back so I went after her, but she was long gone.

387
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,229
Young Mistress, did she escape fearing our plan might be exposed?

388
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:53,589
Let's not draw any conclusion.

389
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,509
Let's split up.

390
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,149
Why are you here?

391
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:04,269
The person you want is with me.

392
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:05,969
Bring her in.

393
00:25:08,229 --> 00:25:09,829
Let go of me.

394
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,829
Young Mistress!

395
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,830
Ma Zhaixing, you put up a good play in the king's tent.

396
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:19,389
You managed to distract me.

397
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:24,670
But sadly, your girl here made an error.

398
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,670
She jeopardized your plan.

399
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,190
It seems like Ji Chong has left this place for nothing.

400
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,169
What do you want in exchange?

401
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:40,810
It wasn't easy catching this imposter.

402
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,950
Of course, I must present her to the king.

403
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,090
The alliance is at stake.

404
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,710
If you were me, would you let her go?

405
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,449
Move!

406
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:01,290
Stay still!

407
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,790
Stay still!

408
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,468
Stay still!

409
00:26:05,469 --> 00:26:08,690
- Young Mistress.
- Liu Xin.

410
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,949
Liu Xin!

411
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,790
Stay still!

412
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,589
I thought you would let her go.

413
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:16,050
I told you I would accept your punishment!

414
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:18,610
I never said anything about releasing her.

415
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:23,030
For old time's sake, I'll give you a chance to live.

416
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,930
Bring the bow here.

417
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,988
Stay still!

418
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:35,789
Ma Zhaixing,

419
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,889
your subordinate betrayed you.

420
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:42,389
I'll give you a chance to execute her.

421
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,628
I'll then plea to the king

422
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:46,829
and tell him you were tricked by the King of Jin,

423
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,869
that you knew nothing.

424
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:55,590
No.

425
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,910
Even if I spare her life today,

426
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,529
being an imposter is enough to warrant execution by the king.

427
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,229
Please, let her go.

428
00:27:07,229 --> 00:27:08,549
She is innocent.

429
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,849
I won't run away.

430
00:27:09,849 --> 00:27:11,989
I'll surrender myself to the king.

431
00:27:11,989 --> 00:27:14,589
Please, spare her life.

432
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,448
- Ma Zhaixing.
- Please.

433
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:20,229
Your soft heart won't give you the strength to kill me!

434
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,628
Don't you want to avenge your family?

435
00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:24,749
Pick up the bow now!

436
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,628
This is my doing.

437
00:27:34,629 --> 00:27:37,070
I won't let her pay for my mistake.

438
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:42,189
How honorable of you.

439
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,990
Your honor is to die in another's stead.

440
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,929
- Hai Die.
- Yes.

441
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,509
Watch them closely.

442
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,109
Bring them with us.

443
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,049
Master, should we apprehend Ji Chong?

444
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,609
Don't bother.

445
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:01,509
Mo Xiao can deal with him.

446
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,109
Take them away.

447
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,370
The king will deal with them tomorrow.

448
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:14,389
Young Mistress!

449
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:15,508
- Young Mistress!
- Liu Xin!

450
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:17,848
- Save me!
- Liu Xin!

451
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:19,569
- Save me! I don't want to die!
- Liu Xin!

452
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,509
Move! Stay still!

453
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:24,869
Young Mistress! Save me!

454
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,989
You talk about getting revenge.

455
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:34,689
What did you do? What can you achieve?

456
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:36,969
You had your chances to take my life.

457
00:28:36,969 --> 00:28:39,429
You could have killed me while disguised as a servant.

458
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,269
Bao Na had me trapped, but you didn't shoot me.

459
00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:47,010
You missed your chance and allowed me to retaliate.

460
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,170
Because I'm not like you!

461
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,930
I am not a scoundrel.

462
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,130
I won't take advantage of your weakness.

463
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,420
You conspired with the King of Jin

464
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,810
and used an imposter to trick us.

465
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:08,670
Ma Zhaixing, you failed so terribly because of your own doing!

466
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:15,710
This is all your fault.

467
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:18,789
You killed my family,

468
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,910
but you saved me!

469
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,090
It was you who made me so miserable!

470
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,630
It was you who made revenge my sole purpose

471
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,629
and made me live this miserable life!

472
00:29:30,629 --> 00:29:33,949
This wasn't who I was!

473
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,448
You turned me into this monster. It was you!

474
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:41,150
You are still not strong enough.

475
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,970
You are not the person I'm waiting to seek vengeance on me.

476
00:29:49,869 --> 00:29:51,670
I hate you.

477
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:56,390
I hate you!

478
00:29:57,749 --> 00:30:00,600
I hate you!

479
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,210
♫ Love remains ♫

480
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,180
♫ I cannot make your heart move ♫

481
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,830
♫ so I can only pretend to be moved by my own persistence ♫

482
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,190

is it Princess Pingyuan?

539

Someone took the princess' painting!

540
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,250
Just as Lord Bo expected.

541
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,730
They really have a guilty conscience.

542
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,740
However, he can take the painting with him.

543
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,669
After all, you have a skill that no one else possesses.

544
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:18,849
You can draw the same painting on-site again as long as it was your own work.

Right? Painter?

546
00:37:20,569 --> 00:37:22,490
I can do that.

547
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,849
Why does Princess Pingyuan look like this?

548
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:04,609
Sister Zhaixing! Sister Zhaixing!

549

What happened? Who tied you here?

551

I shot Chu Youzhen by accident.

00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,870
How did that happen?

553
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,310
Sister Zhaixing, don't worry.

554
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,349

569
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:26,869

My King, the plan was my idea.

Ma Zhaixing,

576
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,790
your life is in Prince of Bo's hand.

I don't care how he deals with you.

578

But this other sinner will not be forgiven!

579
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,330
Take her down!

580
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:11,949
Prince of Bo, you wouldn't bear to kill Ma Zhaixing. Right?

581
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:16,030
She had the bow in her hands last time, but she didn't take the shot.

582
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,350
Had she killed me sooner,

583
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:21,949
the circumstances would have been different today.

584
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:26,590
Mercy for the enemy is cruelty for one's self.

585
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,390
Ma Zhaixin, have you learned your lesson?

586

Youzhen has a kind heart.

587
