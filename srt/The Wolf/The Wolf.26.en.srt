00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,740
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,840
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,120
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,220
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,500
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,890
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,080
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,780
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,480
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,250
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,270
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:05,850
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

[The Wolf]

21
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,010
[Episode 26]

22
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,879
Ma Jing, I know you're worried that

23
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,640
Zhaixing might be sad,

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
but she needs to know the truth.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,360
Feudal Lord, sorry for my incompetency!

26
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,300
General!

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,980
Brother!

28
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,760
Wolf Boy,

29
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,079
I hope every couple in the world

30
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,560
ends up like us.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,920
I hope they can be honest with each other

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,699
and have their happily ever after.

33
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,680
Xing'er,

34
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,520
time to sleep.

35
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:56,660
Carry me back then.

36
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:02,940
Okay, I'll carry you back.

37
00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:00,680
Ma Zhaixing, see you on the battlefield.

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,500
It's time for me to pay with my life.

39
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,540
Ma Family Army, listen up!

40
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,480
General Ma Fengcheng has passed away!

41
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:09,480
Stop!

42
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,200
Why are you sneaking around?

43
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,519
He must be Chu Kui's spy!

44
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,879
He's trying to report General Ma's passing to them.

45
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,419
Get down!

46
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,379
You!

47
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,400
What else did you tell them?

48
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,899
You guys will never win against His Majesty!

49
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,099
Tell us! Did you tell them that

50
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,959
the Ma Army already knew the truth about the murder of the Ma family?

51
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,840
This...

52
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,479
What should we do?

53
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,579
Maybe he has told them about General Ma's attempt to rebel.

54
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,419
If Chu Kui knows about this,

55
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:52,700
he will stop Zhaixing from coming.

56
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,179
But it will take at least one day

57
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:56,260
before they receive the pigeon's letter.

58
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,439
I think Zhaixing still has time to leave.

59
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,500
It's just that we must be quick.

60
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,760
We need to meet her before anyone else.

61
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,639
[Bo Royal Manor]

62
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,839
Young Feudal Mistress, time to depart.

63
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:27,039
Strange. Why isn't His Highness sending me off?

64
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:48,079
Young Mistress, Lord Bo was summoned by His Majesty this morning.

65
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:50,339
That's why he couldn't send you off.

66
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,039
Tell Prince of Bo to be at ease and wait for my victorious return.

67
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,500
Young Mistress, have a safe trip.

68
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,859
Please take care of yourself.

69
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,579
You guys take care as well.

70
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:11,959
I'll leave now.

71
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,579
Young Mistress.

72
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,960
Master, Young Mistress has departed.

73
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,079
From this moment onward,

74
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:44,319
Ma Zhaixing and I will go on our separate ways.

75
00:08:44,319 --> 00:08:46,299
Our ties are severed.

76
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,639
If we meet on the battlefield,

77
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:52,280
let's see if Ma Zhaixing

78
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,119
will be blessed by the heavens.

79
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
Yes, Prince of Bo.

80
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,659
Enter the palace.

81
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,099
Ma Jing, are you okay?

82
00:09:24,099 --> 00:09:25,740
I'm fine.

83
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,579
If I can't confirm Young Feudal Mistress's safety personally,

84
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,539
I won't be able to face my dead brother.

85
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,940
Fine.

86
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,779
The Imperial Army can reach

87
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:39,879
the Ma Army camp in many ways.

88
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,000
We'll split up into three groups.

89
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:45,779
You two, follow Ma Jing

90
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,779
and search in the east!

91
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:50,779
The other two should take the mountain path.

92
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:52,700
I'll take the main path.

93
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,260
Send us a smoke signal if you find anything!

94
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,839
- Yes!
- Yes!

95
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,360
Master, what's wrong?

96
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,679
How's the progress?

97
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:28,340
Ma Zhaixing is on her way now.

98
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,140
I've investigated the path she's using.

99
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,859
My men are following her as well.

100
00:10:31,859 --> 00:10:34,539
We'll poison her when we have the chance.

101
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,340
- You mustn't fail.
- Yes, Master.

102
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,419
It's you?

103
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,959
The antidote!

104
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,320
You're trying to poison Zhaixing behind His Majesty's back.

105
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,879
Do you think His Majesty will release you?

106
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll tell His Majesty about your misdeed right away.

107
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,460
Damn it!

108
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,439
Your Majesty.

109
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,279
Father Emperor.

110
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,820
Prince of Bo, you...

111
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,879
you came at the right time!

112
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,919
The spy I planted in Ma Army sent us news.

113
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,400
He said the Ma Army has found new evidence

114
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,840
and they know that I was the one who ordered the assassination of Ma Ying!

115
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
They intend to stage a revolt.

116
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,739
But...

117
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,859
But this is strange.

118
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,580
Why aren't they moving

119
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,900
when they're trying to stage a revolt?

120
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,399
I'm sure they're waiting for Ma Zhaixing to arrive before they act.

121
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,160
Capture Ma Zhaixing immediately!

122
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:59,580
Father Emperor, I just came back from Yao Ji's cell.

123
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,600
Yao Ji ordered her men to poison Ma Zhaixing on her way there.

124
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,820
Ma Zhaixing must be safe!

125
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,679
She's my hostage now! I need her to stay alive!

126
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:11,319
Bring the Night Fiends and stop Ma Zhaixing immediately!

127
00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:14,240
Bring her back!

128
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,120
Yes, Father Emperor.

129
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,770
Let's take a break. We'll go to Taibao Camp later.

130
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,439
Sir, what would you like?

131
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,020
Give me the best tea. And some snacks.

132
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,960
Sure, please have a seat. Please have a seat.

133
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,140
- Sit down.
- Yes, Young Feudal Mistress.

134
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,879
Is there no one willing to sit with me?

135
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,719
Young Mistress, we're low-rank troops.

136
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,979
It's unsuitable for us to sit together.

137
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,199
Fine. I won't force it since you

138
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,219
are so disciplined.

139
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:20,279
Sir,

140
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,419
your snacks. And your tea.

141
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:32,559
Thank you.

142
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,340
Please enjoy.

143
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,559
The carriage is ready. Prepare to depart!

144
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:06,700
- Let's take a look inside.
- Yes.

145
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,940
Let's depart!

146
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Miss Ma Jing, there's no one inside.

147
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,280
Get on the horse!

148
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,020
Ma Jing!

149
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:49,299
Young Feudal Mistress?

150
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,979
Ma Jing!

151
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,960
Young Mistress!

152
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,340
Young Mistress! I've finally found you!

153
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,820
Is it really you?

154
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,099
Were you alone?

155
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,839
Prince of Bo sent his men to escort me.

156
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,079
Just now, I wanted them to stop.

157
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,639
I wanted to see if it was you.

158
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:17,060
I didn't expect them to tell me to move along and not waste any time.

159
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,659
Do you know what? I then lied to them.

160
00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:23,140
I told them I had a stomachache and I asked them to wait for me up ahead.

161
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,399
We shouldn't stay here! Let's leave!

162
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,100
Hurry! Hurry! Get on my horse!

163
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,360
- Wait!
- Hurry! Follow me!

164
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,779
Ma Jing, what's going on?

165
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,380
I'll tell you everything when we're safe.

166
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,020
Ma Jing, what exactly is going on?

167
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,199
Young Mistress, you must be prepared for the news

168
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,120
that I'm going to tell you right now.

169
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,659
Ma Jing, why are you wearing this attire?

170
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,840
Don't tell me...

171
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,859
My brother... passed away.

172
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:07,319
Ma Jing, let's return to the Ma Army camp.

173
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,480
I want to send Brother Fengcheng off.

174
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,340
Stop!

175
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,960
Surround them!

176
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,040
Young Feudal Mistress Ma, you're not allowed to leave.

177
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,439
You guys misunderstood us!

178
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:22,439
Ma Jing is my family!

179
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:27,079
Young Mistress, I'm sure Prince of Bo sent them to kill us.

180
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,500
What are you saying?

181
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,000
Why is Prince of Bo trying to kill us?

182
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,900
Kill Ma Zhaixing!

183
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:44,260
Stop!

184
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,940
Leave Ma Zhaixing alive.

185
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,360
His Majesty has an order.

186
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,200
Bring her back to Imperial City.

187
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,460
Who are you?

188
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,759
Arrest her!

189
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,079
Who are you?

190
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,740
Why is the Bo Army following your orders?

191
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,620
No.

192
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,039
They aren't Prince of Bo's men at all.

193
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,160
They're just impersonating them!

194
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:15,500
Prince of Bo did send them here!

195
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:19,079
Because the King of Jin...

196
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:21,400
isn't the one who wiped out your family!

197
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,740
It's Chu Kui and Prince of Bo!

198
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,740
Impossible.

199
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,360
Impossible.

200
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm sure Prince of Bo isn't the culprit.

201
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,259
Who exactly are you?

202
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,319
Not every woman can make me care for them.

203
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:40,039
Even if they're my consorts.

204
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:43,680
It's all because you're Ma Zhaixing.

205
00:19:47,879 --> 00:19:51,140
Are you still Wolf Boy?

206
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,519
I will always be Wolf Boy in front of you.

207
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,099
Heavens, thank you for bringing us together and making us love each other.

208
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,079
Why?

209
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,519
Why?

210
00:20:24,459 --> 00:20:26,179
Under His Majesty's order,

211
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,179
I'm here to arrest the criminal, Ma Zhaixing.

212
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,419
Take her away!

213
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,039
Hold it right there!

214
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,179
Young Feudal Mistress!

215
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,259
- Stop! Stop!
- Young Mistress!

216
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,159
Hold it right there!

217
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,060
Ma Zhaixing,

218
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,179
I will tell you everything that you want to know.

219
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,899
But do you have the courage to bear the truth?

220
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,900
Why did you kill my entire family?

221
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,279
What did my father do wrong?

222
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:33,060
He protected the borders and fought for the empire all his entire life.

223
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

224
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:41,559
I'm sure you weren't the one who wiped out my family.

225
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,600
I'm sure it's the King of Jin, am I right?

226
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,380
The truth is Ma Ying's merits were too great for his own good.

227
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,039
The truth is I sent you to the battlefield

228
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,179
because His Majesty wanted to kill you and the entire Ma Army.

229
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,360
The truth is the man you love

230
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
is a tool of your father's killer!

231
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,340
As long as I can be with you,

232
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,460
I don't care about anything else.

233
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,340
Even if your love is fake.

234
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,019
If I could pretend, I hope that

235
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,520
the misdeeds that I've committed haven't happened at all.

236
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,779
But when you say that you want a pure relationship

237
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,099
without any lies,

238
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:30,420
I realized that I can't do it.

239
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,580
What did he use you for?

240
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,559
A weapon for war.

241
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:39,380
Young Feudal Mistress, you may know Wolf Boy well,

242
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,799
but you don't know Prince of Bo at all.

243
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,739
When I return to the court, I'm not Wolf Boy anymore.

244
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:49,059
I'm Prince of Bo.

245
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:52,739
She said we were cursed by the heavens,

246
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,679
and that we will never be together.

247
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,960
I often will think that

248
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:03,240
it might have been better if my life ended when I fell off the cliff.

249
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,419
Don't tell me there's an ambush?

250
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,319
What if I were the ambush?

251
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,459
If you and I fight, it means that Wolf Boy is dead.

252
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,659
Only Prince of Bo is left.

253
00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:31,839
The truth is...

254
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:36,219
Wolf Boy and Xing'er will never be together!

255
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:43,380
The truth is you and I were cursed by the heavens!

256
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,680
The truth is...

257
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,639
I still hope that you're lying to me even at this very moment!

258
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,220
Arrest Ma Zhaixing and Ma Jing.

259
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,779
Bring them back to the capital.

260
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:25,340
- Yes, Your Highness.
-Yes, Your Highness.

261
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,439
How dare you try to poison His Majesty's hostage?

262
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,959
Stay put with your master.

263
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:27,360
His Majesty has no time for you two now.

264
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,140
You two should reflect on your actions

265
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,800
and wait for His Majesty's punishment.

266
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,060
Master.

267
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,579
How's the situation? Do you have any news?

268
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:44,239
After the Ma Army knew the truth about the murder of the Ma family, they tried to stage a revolt.

269
00:25:44,239 --> 00:25:45,720
Ma Zhaixing was captured by Prince of Bo.

270
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,199
Now, she's the hostage of His Majesty.

271
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,519
Prince of Bo didn't let her go?

272
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,940
No. He treats her like a criminal.

273
00:25:58,499 --> 00:26:01,699
Now they're enemies.

274
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:04,000
This is their cursed fate from the start.

275
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,160
The true Prince of Bo will surely awaken.

276
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,940
Soon.

277
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,740
The true Prince of Bo will return soon.

278
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,120
He will require my assistance.

279
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,659
Seems like we'll be out soon.

280
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,080
It's our brothers from the Ma Army!

281
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,140
Search the front!

282
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

283
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,780
What happened?

284
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,779
Young Feudal Mistress...

285
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,219
Prince of Bo took Young Mistress away!

286
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,800
We were too late.

287
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,279
What are we waiting for?

288
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,059
Attack the capital and save Young Feudal Mistress!

289
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,120
No!

290
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,979
Now, our forces are weak. We're no match for Prince of Bo.

291
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:04,100
And we can't save Zhaixing and Ma Jing without a plan.

292
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,259
What should we do if Chu Kui kills Young Mistress?

293
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Although they've exposed our plan,

294
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
Zhaixing is still of use to Chu Kui.

295
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,800
As long as Chu Kui has Ma Zhaixing in his hand,

296
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,499
the Ma Army will behave themselves.

297
00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:27,119
Chu Kui will certainly suppress us with every chance he gets.

298
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,760
Let's return to our camp and form a plan.

299
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,780
Return to the camp!

300
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,079
- Young Feudal Mistress!
- Don't touch me.

301
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,620
Let go of me!

302
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,400
Let go of me!

303
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,700
I can walk by myself!

304
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,459
Let me out!

305
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:38,260
You liar! Let me out!

306
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,840
Young Mistress!

307
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,419
Young Mistress treated you all so well.

308
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:55,000
How can you be so cruel and unscrupulous?

309
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,699
All of you are worse than dogs!

310
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:59,459
You're right.

311
00:29:00,019 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm speechless.

312
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,860
Hai Die!

313
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:09,560
I treated you as my best friend, you know?

314
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,379
You and Prince of Bo,

315
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:17,500
how could you two be the ones behind Feudal Lord's death?

316
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,619
How could you bear to do such a cruel thing?

317
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,359
Just treat it as if you knew the wrong person.

318
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:29,619
Come back!

319
00:29:29,619 --> 00:29:32,200
Come back!

320
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
Keep watch over them.

321
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,100
I'll report to Master.

322
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,840
Mo Xiao,

323
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,539
I have questions for you.

324
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:57,120
Young Feudal Mistress.

325
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,439
Is Prince of Bo really the one

326
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:11,639
who wiped out my family?

327
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:24,259
That damned Ma Family Army!

328
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,059
One step is all I need for me to succeed!

329
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,940
But... But everything went wrong in the last step!

330
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,039
They even joined the Jin Army?

331
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,880
This is great!

332
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,520
Jin got our Ma Army without any effort!

333
00:30:42,019 --> 00:30:45,920
But you were able to sever your romantic ties with Ma Zhaixing

334
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,820
and bring her back to me immediately.

335
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,639
Prince of Bo, I will compensate you well in the future.

336
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:55,939
The Ma Family Army has joined Jin.

337
00:30:55,939 --> 00:31:00,760
The most important thing now is to use Ma Zhaixing to control the Ma Army

338
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,860
so that Jin doesn't dare to act recklessly.

339
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,799
Ma Army is a huge boost to the strength

340
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,520
of the Jin Army.

341
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,479
That King of Jin,

342
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:13,500
he'll try everything to save

343
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,499
Ma Zhaixing in order to gain the favor of the Ma Army.

344
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,199
Prince of Bo, ask your guards to guard over her.

345
00:31:20,199 --> 00:31:21,860
No mistakes are allowed!

346
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

347
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,640
Ma Zhaixing is still poisoned.

348
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,319
At this very moment, she's the most important hostage we have.

349
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,259
She must stay safe.

350
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,680
You're right. Zhang Jin!

351
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:44,399
Before I put Yao Ji in jail,

352
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,600
I forced her to give me the antidote.

353
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,560
I knew this would happen.

354
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,800
Here. Go and neutralize the poison in her body.

355
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,580
Yes, Father Emperor.

356
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,860
Master, Ma Jing and Young Feudal Mistress are now in prison.

357
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,059
This is the antidote.

358
00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:24,000
Put an adequate amount in her food or water.

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,839
And let Ma Zhaixing consume them.

360
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:29,819
Remember, you must keep the poison a secret from her.

361
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,679
According to her personality, she won't follow your instructions.

362
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,720
Yes, Your Highness.

363
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,480
Master, aren't you going to visit her?

364
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,240
She's a hostage and a criminal.

365
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,360
There's no need for me to visit her.

366
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,399
Have some food.

367
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,500
So nice?

368
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,399
Did you poison the food?

369
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:28,959
I wouldn't commit such an atrocious act.

370
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:38,399
Right.

371
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,260
You're only good at slaughtering people in the dark.

372
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,279
Get out!

373
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,319
I don't want to see you!

374
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:53,320
Eat while it's hot.

375
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,819
Scram!

376
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,660
Close the door.

377
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,299
If you dare hurt Young Mistress,

378
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:05,319
I won't let you off even if I become a ghost!

379
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,960
Young Feudal Mistress, time to eat.

380
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,380
I want to see Prince of Bo.

381
00:34:33,259 --> 00:34:37,300
Young Mistress, drink it while it's hot.

382
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:41,599
Young MIstress!

383
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,519
- I want to see Prince of Bo!
- Did they bully you?

384
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:46,559
I will prepare a new one for you.

385
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:56,019
Young Feudal Mistress!

386
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:59,259
I'll say this again.

387
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,960
Bring me to Prince of Bo!

388
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,219
Young Mistress, calm down.

389
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,699
Young Mistress, put down the shard first.

390
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll bring you to Master.

391
00:35:12,499 --> 00:35:15,259
Here, give me the shard.

392
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:18,859
I promise I'll bring you to Master.

393
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:22,679
I promise.

394
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:28,580
Young Mistress, you're no match for us.

395
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,259
Why are you doing this?

396
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:31,879
I told you I want to see Prince of Bo!

397
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,739
Don't you understand me?

398
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,199
I understand.

399
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:39,299
I'll report to Master immediately.

400
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,899
She insists on seeing you.

401
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:57,240
She even tried to hurt herself.

402
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,959
She was injured by accident when I tried to snatch away the shard from her.

403
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,760
Is it serious?

404
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,180
Just some minor cuts. Nothing serious.

405
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:18,320
This is the remaining antidote. I'll return it to you.

406
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,560
The problem is Young Feudal Mistress didn't consume the food with the antidote.

407
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,860
The poison is still in her body.

408
00:36:24,779 --> 00:36:29,799
Master, shouldn't you visit her?

409
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,180
Under what identity?

410
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,739
As Wolf Boy?

411
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:39,240
Or as Prince of Bo who broke her heart?

412
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,180
But...

413
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,080
I will earnestly beg Father Emperor to let Ma Zhaixing go.

414
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,919
And I will trade one life for another.

415
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,099
Master, how are you going to do that?

416
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:01,060
I'll let Zhaixing kill me personally

417
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,520
in order to avenge her family.

418
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,820
This is the best way for me to atone for my sins,

419
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,920
and it's the best ending for both of us.

420
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,620
Master!

421
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,199
Hai Die.

422
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:29,580
Master, aren't you going to visit Young Feudal Mistress tomorrow?

423
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,839
Let me think about it.

424
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:47,219
I still have some antidote left.

425
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:55,490
Xing'er, I could only neutralize your poison by bringing you back.

426

I will make sure you're safe.

428
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,600
His Majesty directly ordered us to assassinate them!

429
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,019
But why must all the blame be directed to Master!

430
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:13,939
Why is he doing this?

431
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,140
But isn't it the same if we do the dirty deeds for Master?

432
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,660
I dare to say this.

433
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,559
I'm sure Master has always been thinking about this.

434
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,160
Maybe he has been thinking about using his life to atone for his sins

435
00:38:34,699 --> 00:38:40,760
ever since he gave Young Feudal Mistress the wolf bow.

436
00:38:49,499 --> 00:38:53,119
Young Feudal Mistress!

437
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:56,919
Why do you look so pale?

438
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,320
Are you hurt?

439
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,040
I'm fine.

440
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,060
Ma Jing, dress her wound.

441
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,660
This...

442
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,239
How did you get such a big cut on your hand?

443
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,300
Does it hurt?

444
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,299
It doesn't.

445
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,420
Just tell me if you're in pain!

446
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,099
Please don't keep it to yourself!

447
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,639
Silly girl, why are you crying?

448
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:55,480
My hand doesn't hurt at all.

449
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:58,980
You're lying!

450
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,020
You're a human!

451
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,900
I'm sure it hurts!

452
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,520
I'm in pain when I look at it!

453
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,820
Young Mistress!

454
00:40:16,919 --> 00:40:18,980
Ma Jing, don't cry.

455
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:22,119
Don't cry.

456
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,999
Don't cry.

457
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,120
According to reports,

458
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,879
Chu Kui built many underground cells that are unknown to people.

459
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:44,520
It's hard for us to identify the exact cell that Young Feudal Mistress is in.

460
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,019
And now, I'm sure Chu Kui has entrusted the defense of the whole palace to Prince of Bo.

461
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:54,180
So, the current Yang Palace is impenetrable.

462
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,180
We can't even enter the palace.

463
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,879
How could we save Young Mistress?

464
00:41:07,939 --> 00:41:10,040
Since we can't enter the palace,

465
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:15,160
we'll force them to hand her over then.

466
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,299
Fourth Prince, according to our current speed,

467
00:41:24,299 --> 00:41:27,659
we can reach the capital within half a day.

468
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:32,420
Fourth Prince?

469
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,120
What did you say?

470
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,310
Fourth Prince, if you're tired, we should take a break at the stop in front of us.

471
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:39,080
We can continue tomorrow.

472
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,299
I'm not tired.

473
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:45,540
I was just wondering why Father Emperor didn't let us stay and attack the Taibao Camp.

474
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,039
Instead, he wants us to quickly return to the palace.

475
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,219
I don't know what His Majesty is planning as well.

476
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:53,840
But I'm sure His Majesty has his own concerns.

477
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,559
Do you think Father Emperor is doing this

478
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,839
because he thinks that I will spoil his plan?

479
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:00,979
If that's the case,

480
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:04,779
why would His Majesty ask you to do a reconnaissance of the Taibao Camp in the first place?

481
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:07,139
Your Highness, you're overthinking things.

482
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:09,220
Cousin, you're right.

483
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,680
But this time, I've helped Father Emperor to complete a mission.

484
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,120
Say, do you think Third Brother will see me in a different light?

00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:04,960
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

492
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,250
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

493
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,880
♫ Forever being together ♫

494
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:19,440
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

495
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,610
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

496
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:33,790
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

497
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:40,850
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

498
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:47,940
♫ I so want to run to your embrace ♫

499
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:55,030
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

500
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:02,430
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

501
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:08,700
♫ Forever being together ♫

502
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,960
