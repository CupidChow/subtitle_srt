♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:32,838
[Episode 34]
It's not a solution to hand over your military power.

21
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:33,898
That's being at your wit's end now!

22
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:36,559
Your Highness! Your Highness!

23
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,059
Princess!

24
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,280
The Ma Army, His Highness, and also Adjutant General Zhou,

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,438
they are fighting now.

26
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,800
This is bad!

27
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,959
She has already handed over the military seal to the King of Jin!

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,618
Stop talking nonsense in front of me!

29
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:52,538
Listen!

30
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,699
The Ma Army doesn't accept the division of the troops.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,618
Yes!

32
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,518
We'll only follow the Adjutant Ma to death!

33
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:59,359
Are you defying the order?

34
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,978
Let the King of Jin lead the Ma Army!

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,838
- No way!
- Adjutant Ma.

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,490
[Command Token]

37
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,019
Young Feudal Mistress Ma has already handed over the military seal.

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,020
From now on, the Ma Army has to obey my order.

39
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,920
Can't you recognize this military seal?

40
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:28,780
If Crown Prince insists on dividing the troops,

41
00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:33,279
then I'll leave the Ma Army!

42
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:46,339
We'll only follow Adjutant Ma to death!

43
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,839
- Adjutant Ma!
- We'll only follow Adjutant Ma to death!

44
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,220
Young Feudal Mistress.

45
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,230
Adjutant Ma, I've already decided

46
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,380
to hand over the military power to the King of Jin.

47
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,139
I hope Adjutant Ma will not make things hard for me.

48
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:01,480
I don't mean to put Young Mistress in trouble.

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,099
It's just that all of us in the Ma Army made a vow with our lives

50
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:10,180
to forever serve Great General Ma and you.

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,619
If we violate it, we will die badly.

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:24,618
Always serve Great General and Young Mistress!

53
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,839
- Always serve Great General and Young Mistress!
- Don't just stand there watching.

54
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,740
Do you have any good idea?

55
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:32,959
You really don't want to help me out?

56
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:37,800
I did have an idea.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,140
If the Ma Army really have to obey the order to join the Jin Troop,

58
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,278
why don't you find a general from Jin that can convince the Ma Army to lead them?

59
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:48,379
Where could you find such a person?

60
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,680
Yes.

61
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:53,059
Who suits that position?

62
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,580
Me!

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,340
How is it?

64
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,299
I'm not qualified for it?

65
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:07,859
No one can be more suitable than you to lead the Ma Army.

66
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,960
What do you think, Crown Prince?

67
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,739
First and foremost, Ji Chong knows the rules of Jin well.

68
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,779
Secondly, he's deeply trusted by the Jin Troop and the Ma Army.

69
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,978
I believe this would help much in avoiding conflicts in the future.

70
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,219
This is not a trivial matter.

71
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,659
I will have to ask Royal Father about it.

72
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,820
Sure. Without further ado, I will go with you.

73
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,300
Yes, you may.

74
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,539
How is my acting?

75
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,559
There's no problem for Young Mistress now.

76
00:04:56,559 --> 00:05:01,840
What I'm worried about is the decision of the King of Jin.

77
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,000
The old man must agree with it.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,019
This is the only way now.

79
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,800
Moreover, this is just a temporary countermeasure for him.

80
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,559
Once the Ma Army becomes weaker, he will kick me off at anytime

81
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,600
without any loss caused to him.

82
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,440
All right.

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,899
Let him manage the joint troop matter.

84
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,199
Hand over the marshal seal to him.

85
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,578
Juyao is indeed the best person for this condition.

86
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,080
But don't you worry that he's playing tricks on us?

87
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm exactly waiting for him to reveal his tricks.

88
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:49,019
Didn't you notice his attitude while welcoming me today?

89
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,759
He will surely be the greatest obstacle in our plan of making Ma Zhaixing hold a powerless position.

90
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,779
So we have to wait until he reveals himself.

91
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,539
And I will then have enough reason to take him down.

92
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,580
I understand now.

93
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,119
Royal Father, you're actually setting a trap to catch him by being lenient to him now.

94
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:09,219
The princess of the past dynasty has appeared.

95
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,640
It's impossible for Chu Kui to not do anything.

96
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,858
We must eliminate all the internal obstacles as soon as possible,

97
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:20,698
making Jin's power great and respectable,

98
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,520
and get ready to meet the Bo Army on the battlefield at any time.

99
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,538
Zi Shen, get me some water.

100
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:31,939
Yes.

101
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,219
Master, the water is here.

102
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,980
Zi Shen, don't come near!

103
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,099
Zi Shen, run!

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,220
Close the door!

105
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,239
Major Yang.

106
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:12,538
Yes, I'm here.

107
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,139
How long before the troops from every prefecture

108
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:17,659
arrive here in the palace?

109
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,939
Your Majesty, the troops from every prefecture are on their way now.

110
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,178
Wang Rong and Han Qing will reach the capital to meet Your Majesty in three to five days.

111
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,860
But...

112
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,598
Don't hesitate. Just tell me!

113
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,219
There are rumors spreading in the prefectures at the same time

114
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,578
saying that the appearance of the princess of the previous dynasty

115
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,258
caused the Third Prince's plan to borrow the troops to fail

116
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,720
and Fourth Prince's life to be at risk.

117
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:49,139
You mean the next one who will suffer is me?

118
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,298
I dare not.

119
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,899
I've already been checking the source of the rumor and

120
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,200
will punish him quickly to warn the others.

121
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,560
Report!

122
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,199
Report to Your Majesty.

123
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,679
- The Military Marquis Wang Rong of Zhenzhou has revolted.
- Revolted?

124
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:04,459
Wang Rong set out not really to come here,

125
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,059
but has led his troops to submit to Jin.

126
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,559
This...

127
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,178
Isn't his mother here in the capital as a hostage?

128
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,459
She already died of illness last month.

129
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,818
The servants were ordered by Wang Rong to hide the truth.

130
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,639
All of them have already committed suicide today.

131
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,378
Your Majesty, with the princess' appearance,

132
00:08:23,379 --> 00:08:25,098
Wang Rong revolted and joined Jin.

133
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,659
This will cause our troops to lose morale.

134
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,520
Preposterous!

135
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,240
As long as Prince of Bo is here, who within my Three Armies would dare to waver?

136
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Who dares?

137
00:08:40,499 --> 00:08:42,178
You're right, Your Majesty.

138
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,938
Once the troops arrive at the capital

139
00:08:43,939 --> 00:08:46,219
and sees that the commander-in-chief is the valiant Prince of Bo,

140
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,980
the troop's morale will surely be in awe.

141
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:10,380
What happened, Yao Ji?

142
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,660
Your Majesty.

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,199
Why hasn't Prince of Bo recovered his sanity?

144
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:19,498
Didn't you feed him with drugs that could heal him?

145
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:21,099
I did feed him with that.

146
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:24,058
I don't know why Prince of Bo still can't control himself

147
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:26,499
when he woke up.

148
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:29,799
Follow me.

149
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,059
- Wen Yan.
- Yes.

150
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,498
- Mo Xiao.
- Yes.

151
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:33,659
Keep an eye on Prince of Bo.

152
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,900
This matter must be kept a secret.

153
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,739
Yes, Your Majesty.

154
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:43,680
Master!

155
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,900
Did you try your best to treat him or not?

156
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,700
If you dare to fool me,

157
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,240
I will kill you!

158
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,039
I dare not trick you.

159
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,938
I think you know well the reason why I didn't kill you

160
00:10:00,939 --> 00:10:05,219
even if you'd made great mistakes in the past.

161
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,820
I know.

162
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,121
Your Majesty, please allow me to go out of the palace.

163
00:10:10,121 --> 00:10:12,119
I'll meet with my foster father.

164
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:16,539
Maybe he would know why the drug has become ineffective.

165
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,140
- Zhang Jin.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

166
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,378
Relay my order.

167
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:23,019
Restore Yao Ji to the Grand Diviner immediately

168
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,258
and let her manage the Grand Diviner Palace.

169
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:26,340
Yes, Your Majesty.

170
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,060
Thank for your grace, Your Majesty.

171
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,360
Yao Ji, Wang Rong has revolted and sided with Jin.

172
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,378
There should be no more mishaps with the gathering of the military marquises and their troops.

173
00:10:36,378 --> 00:10:40,899
You must heal Prince of Bo before Han Qing leads the different military marquises

174
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,219
into the capital.

175
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,010
Otherwise, my Three Army's morale will greatly waver

176
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:50,250
without the God of War Prince of Bo.

177
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,340
I understand. I will settle this right now.

178
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,099
You led your troops here to my state which is an act of abandoning darkness and choosing the light.

179
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:57,738
We are like tigers with wings now.

180
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,719
Let me pay my respect to you.

181
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
Damn him.

182
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,179
I've disliked that Chu for a long time.

183
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:16,058
Without my mother as a hostage,

184
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,659
plus the fact that King of Jin has the princess of the past dynasty with you calling out to the world,

185
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:23,579
like the saying goes... What is that again?

186
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,019
- Whoever understands the situation is an outstanding man.
- You're right. I mean that.

187
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,779
I've been involved in battles all the time.

188
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,380
I don't know much about words.

189
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,980
Please don't mind me speaking directly.

190
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,520
Are you sincerely treating the princess as your mistress (master)

191
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,400
or planning to abandon her right after using her?

192
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,080
If the latter is your intention,

193
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,320
then your act of gathering everyone for justice

194
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,080
is just a fake one.

195
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,660
That's nothing different from Chu Kui.

196
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,499
Military Marquis, you don't need to worry about that.

197
00:12:02,499 --> 00:12:05,138
I've always despised Chu Kui.

198
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,979
I've always encouraged loyalty.

199
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,799
I won't do the same thing.

200
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:13,519
That's great!

201
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:16,650
I...

202
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,079
Then, I'm willing to join you

203
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:22,900
in conquering the enemy state.

204
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,138
Come on!

205
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,139
Let me pay my respect to you first.

206
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:34,680
Come.

207
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,480
Welcome, Guest. I'll serve you tea right away.

208
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,080
- Young Marshal.
- How did that thing go?

209
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,440
All done. I've contacted the former subordinates of the Chuanlong troops.

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,698
I used your marshal seal and forged a military order

211
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,760
to relocate everyone from the fortification team.

212
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,058
That's great!

213
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:56,660
After a few days, thousand of our brothers from the Chuanlong troops

214
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
will gather here.

215
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:02,839
I took charge of the joint troops and held the marshal seal

216
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,640
just because of this matter.

217
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,099
But have you confirmed if everyone is willing to support me toppling the King of Jin?

218
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:13,259
I've already passed your words to them.

219
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,400
Let's discuss the time to take action.

220
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:21,719
It's not easy to deal with the old man.

221
00:13:21,719 --> 00:13:23,300
In order to fight against the King of Jin,

222
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,639
we have to keep secret bribing and gathering men.

223
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:31,420
But we have to gain popular support as the next step.

224
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,519
Gain popular support?

225
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,339
Ke Lang, I've already spread the news that the princess of the past dynasty has appeared.

226
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,859
Both of you keep watching the situation.

227
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,499
Young Marshal, will the princess agree to this matter?

228
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:47,839
I will let her know how merciless the King of Jin is.

229
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,938
Master, aren't you going to meet your foster father?

230
00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:29,259
I remember he's living in the outskirts of the imperial city.

231
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:31,259
You're right.

232
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,818
But he has returned to the origin of the tribe a year ago

233
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:37,719
just to pick a local unique herb.

234
00:14:50,619 --> 00:14:53,900
If not for curing Prince of Bo,

235
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,139
I wouldn't come back again

236
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,259
to this place that makes me sad.

237
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:06,879
Master, I heard

238
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,780
that your tribe was once very strong.

239
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,359
Why are there only you and your foster father left now?

240
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,880
Where are the others?

241
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,079
They passed away.

242
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,378
[Bo Royal Mansion]

243
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:50,938
Military Marquis Han, you traveled all the way to the capital.

244
00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:52,419
Yet you didn't have an audience with the emperor first

245
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,178
and came here instead.

246
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,539
Unfortunately, His Majesty gave an order

247
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,540
of not allowing anyone to meet Prince of Bo while he's under house arrest.

248
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,100
I heard that the princess of the previous dynasty had shot Fourth Prince

249
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,320
and poisoned Prince of Bo,

250
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,379
causing his life to be at risk now.

251
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,980
Whether he is still alive will affect the stability of our troops.

252
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,599
I must enter now

253
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,359
to personally confirm whether Prince of Bo is still alive. Move aside.

254
00:16:23,359 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm sorry to say this.

255
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,539
I can understand your anxiety, but we have to obey the imperial order.

256
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:30,460
Why not have an audience with the emperor first?

257
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,460
If His Majesty allows you to enter, we won't hinder you to do so.

258
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,060
How dare you!

259
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:38,760
You dare command me?!

260
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,599
Marquis, look.

261
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:49,780
It's inappropriate to slap a woman.

262
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,660
Can you please stop making it difficult for low-level subordinates like us.

263
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,539
Once the punishment period ends,

264
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,719
he'll definitely have an audience with His Majesty.

265
00:16:56,719 --> 00:16:58,839
Please wait for a few days more.

266
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:01,960
I can only wait for one more day.

267
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,479
If I can't meet Prince of Bo after one day,

268
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:08,520
- that means he has become a useless person as the rumors are saying.
- Okay.

269
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,740
By that time, no one can save you.

270
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:14,798
- All of you wait here.
- Yes, Marquis!

271
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:17,539
It seems that you really care about His Highness.

272
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,359
Take care, Marquis.

273
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,900
Open the prison door.

274
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:35,138
What happened to you, Your Honor?

275
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:38,619
You look very pale.

276
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,180
Do you not want to save Prince of Bo or you don't know how precious time is?

277
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,340
Open the prison door quickly!

278
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,339
When you were away, he had been groggy

279
00:17:48,339 --> 00:17:50,239
and in intense pain.

280
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:21,199
Royal Father, regarding the matter of Juyao handling the joint troops,

281
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:22,579
it was indeed as you expected.

282
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,059
He's playing tricks on us.

283
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,098
He forged a military order by using the marshal seal

284
00:18:26,099 --> 00:18:28,640
and relocated the old subordinates of the Chuanlong troops from the fortification team,

285
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,390
trying to expand his power.

286
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,138
He also has been spreading news of the past dynasty's princess's appearance

287
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:35,459
in order to gain popular support.

288
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,659
It's time.

289
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,199
I've been waiting for this moment.

290
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:44,780
You lead the troops and take him down now.

291
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,600
I will obey your order.

292
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:56,879
This place is...

293
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:01,858
You want to know why I hate the old man

294
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,959
since seven years ago, don't you?

295
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,699
This place looks desolated.

296
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,259
It seems to be a place without supervision.

297
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:15,820
If they are attacked by robbers or bandits

298
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,839
when the men are not at home,

299
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,399
how could all these old and weak women and kids save themselves?

300
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,539
All the men in this village were killed by that old man.

301
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,900
All the men in this village were once my brothers

302
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,559
going through thick and thin with me on the battlefield.

303
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,839
Seven years ago, I received the news saying my mother

304
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:49,379
was seriously ill while on the battlefield.

305
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,540
Although I was worried so much for her,

306
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,339
I still had to battle at the frontline.

307
00:19:55,339 --> 00:19:57,880
Because I was not only a son to my mother,

308
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,059
I was also a young marshal of the battalion.

309
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:01,439
I couldn't leave my obligation.

310
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:03,560
But the sadness of missing my mother...

311
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,658
- Young Marshal!
- ...was noticed by my deputy generals.

312
00:20:05,658 --> 00:20:06,899
We know you're in a bad mood.

313
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,659
So we're here to accompany you to drink.

314
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,458
Yes.

315
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,819
- Come on. Let's drink.
- Come, this is your bowl.

316
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,481
- Come on!
- Let's toast.

317
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,059
- Pour the wine.
- Come on, let's toast.

318
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,779
Let's toast.

319
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:20,458
Let's pay respect to Young Marshal.

320
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:22,079
Salute, Young Marshal.

321
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,739
Why is there no more wine?

322
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,600
We have it here.

323
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,019
Here you go. We have a lot.

324
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,938
- Give him a full bowl.
- Come on! Let's drink.

325
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,138
Drink!

326
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:32,440
Let's toast!

327
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,959
- Great wine!
- Great wine! Give me full bowl.

328
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,780
Full bowl! Full bowl!

329
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,199
Come on!

330
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,759
- Come on! Let's drink!
- Let's drink!

331
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,719
- More, please!
- Don't just look!

332
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:47,479
Let's drink and enjoy.

333
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,739
Great wine! Full bowl, please.

334
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,859
Let's continue.

335
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,618
He's drunk. Young Marshal!

336
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,580
Young Marshal.

337
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,500
No problem. We will win for you in this battle.

338
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,299
Yes!

339
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,139
Don't worry much and head back to visit your mother

340
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:05,378
and wait for our return with victory at Taiyuan.

341
00:21:05,379 --> 00:21:06,660
Yes, victory!

342
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,440
Wait for our victory!

343
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,739
When I woke up,

344
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,239
I was already at Taiyuan.

345
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:16,899
I hadn't met my mother for the last time yet

346
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:21,000
when I received the news that my troop

347
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,320
was ambushed with thousands of casualties.

348
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,199
I could imagine how mad that old man was,

349
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:32,000
executing all the brothers that went through thick and thin with me.

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,978
Royal Father, it was all my fault!

351
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,978
Royal Father, please let them go!

352
00:21:35,979 --> 00:21:38,179
Their crime is not serious enough to be sentenced to death!

353
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,280
Royal Father, it was all my fault.

354
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,940
Royal Father, please let go of them.

355
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,858
Royal Father!

356
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:47,219
They were the assistant generals.

357
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,319
They violated the military order, causing us to be defeated.

358
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,458
- I'm willing to do anything!
- You say, they shouldn't be sentenced to death?

359
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:58,138
Then, what about the others who were sacrificed in battle?

360
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:00,180
What crime did they have?

361
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,338
Royal Father...

362
00:22:01,339 --> 00:22:02,939
Come!

363
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,720
Execute the punishment!

364
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,859
No!

365
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,619
No!

366
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,339
All of them had their families

367
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,979
but they were dead because of me.

368
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:25,840
A dozen lives were then laid in between me and my father.

369
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:31,160
Whenever I think of my dead comrades,

370
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,979
I can never forgive him.

371
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:40,700
What I can do now

372
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,000
is help take care of the families of my dead brothers.

373
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,779
Brother Ji Chong, you are here!

374
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,279
- Brother Ji Chong!
- Hi.

375
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,078
- Brother Ji Chong!
- Xiaoyu, did you miss me?

376
00:22:55,099 --> 00:22:56,699
How obedient you are!

377
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,900
Zhaixing, look at this kid.

378
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,940
He's the son of my deputy general who was with me the longest.

379
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,059
But since the day he was born, he has never seen his dad.

380
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:10,780
But he is very similar to his dad.

381
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,820
He's also very optimistic.

382
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,380
Xiaoyu!

383
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,539
Xiaoyu.

384
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,780
Let's go.

385
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,360
Look at that. It's been seven years already.

386
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,000
They still can't forgive me.

387
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,019
They don't even want to speak a word with me.

388
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,219
They aren't willing to step into Taiyuan also.

389
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:03,319
The King of Jin killed your comrades without further consideration,

390
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:07,000
causing many families to be broken.

391
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,020
So, that's the reason

392
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,139
you left your home

393
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:17,359
and became a bounty hunter to earn money for many years.

394
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,900
Get away!

395
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,280
Surround him!

396
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:33,240
What are you doing?

397
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,740
Prince, we're sorry for offending you.

398
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,399
We're here with the order from the King of Jin to arrest you.

399
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:44,700
Is it because I asked the people

400
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,359
to believe in the princess?

401
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,800
The princess's appearance is the truth.

402
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,219
If you don't want them to believe in that,

403
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:55,119
that means you are guilty of something.

404
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:59,300
You forged the military order and relocated your old subordinates.

405
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,659
That can be considered as a crime, right?

406
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:04,480
Take him down!

407
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,579
Even though Prince of Bo has taken the drugs, he is still unconscious.

408
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,019
His Majesty thinks that even if the Prince of Bo can awaken,

409
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,338
he couldn't recover to his best state.

410
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,218
Therefore, he decided to take out the Red Cloud Sword.

411
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:24,020
Prince of Bo has not awakened.

412
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,338
To stabilize the overall situation and placate the troop's morale,

413
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:29,580
His Majesty needs a powerful sword in his hands

414
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,780
so that General Han and the others can remember his frightful power

415
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,439
and not bear any other intentions like Wang Rong who revolted.

416
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:50,110
[Ancestral Temple]

417
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:55,299
All ancestors of the Chu family,

418
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,059
I'm the ruling emperor now.

419
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,439
I can only kneel down to Heaven and Earth.

420
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:05,959
Therefore, Fourth Prince Youzhen, is here

421
00:26:05,959 --> 00:26:09,119
to kowtow to all our ancestors.

422
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,760
Prince of Bo originally could have conquered the world for me.

423
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,259
Too bad, he is not that blessed with good fortune.

424
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:25,580
Thus, I'm here tonight to take the Red Cloud Sword by myself.

425
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:37,020
Youyu!

426
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,339
It's been many years already!

427
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,379
It seems that you still can't forgive me, am I right?

428
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,100
Youyu!

429
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,098
The Chu family's empire has already come to an emergency state.

430
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:40,280
You still want to create a mess and take my life?

431
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,860
If the Chu family's empire is gone,

432
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,059
your beloved Fourth Prince will have to be sacrificed, too.

433
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:50,800
Come! Come!

434
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:54,498
Your Majesty, you're right.

435
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,319
Since you've brought Fourth Prince here,

436
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,699
First Prince dares not to go against you.

437
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,519
Congratulation to Your Majesty for taking back the Red Cloud Sword safely.

438
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:05,180
Even if Prince of Bo can't recover,

439
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,040
Your Majesty can stun the Three Armies.

440
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,480
Imperial Father.

441
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:20,799
Unfilial son!

442
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:34,039
Your Majesty, look at the stars in the sky!

443
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:39,138
Yao Ji, what celestial phenomenon is this?

444
00:28:39,139 --> 00:28:40,939
Explain to me now!

445
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,559
Your Majesty, it's a strange phenomenon.

446
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,620
These five stars reunite only once in 500 years.

447
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:51,800
Your Majesty is the luckiest person!

448
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,880
You surely can defeat the Jin Army and personally kill Ma Zhaixing!

449
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,138
Your Majesty, Military Marquis Han caused a ruckus at the Bo Royal Mansion earlier.

450
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:05,719
After he failed to meet Prince of Bo,

451
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,299
he went to see Minister Cui and the other ministers

452
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,899
who are in favor of peaceful negotiations tonight. They are now meeting behind closed doors.

453
00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:14,739
I'm worried that they are conspiring.

454
00:29:14,739 --> 00:29:16,498
If they still fail to meet Prince of Bo tomorrow,

455
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:21,000
they will dissuade Your Majesty to postpone the army dispatch.

456
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,239
Spread my order.

457
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:25,339
I'm going to inspect the Bo Army at the drill ground.

458
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,979
Whether Prince of Bo will awaken or not,

459
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,740
I would like to meet those generals and ministers personally.

460
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,618
Yes, Your Majesty.

461
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:36,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

462

[Memorial Tablet of Yang's Prince of Bin, Chu Youyu]

463
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,819
Your Highness, what should we do next?

464
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,660
We can't just watch Ji Zhong, Ke Lang,

465
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,939
and Ye Han to be punished. Right?

466
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,619
Forging the military order is a felony!

467
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:03,220
Don't panic. Let me think about it.

468
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,599
Your Highness, General Wang is here.

469
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:23,580
Greetings to Princess.

470
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,599
Please rise, General. I can't afford this.

471
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:32,839
In the past, Ma Ying and I were once officers in the royal court.

472
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:37,199
But now, everything has changed.

473
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:41,639
Did you especially come because you got an idea on how to save Ji Chong?

474
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:44,618
Yes, I do.

475
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:49,020
Forcing the King of Jin to hold the canonization ceremony

476
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,800
and show his loyalty to Your Highness.

477
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:58,258
I've suspected that the King of Jin wasn't sincerely reviving the former dynasty.

478
00:30:58,258 --> 00:31:01,599
And now, I've proven my thoughts.

479
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,160
Please be rest assured, Your Highness.

480
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,019
I've led my army here to seek refuge under Your Highness.

481
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,259
Together with the Ma Army and Prince's Chuanlong's troops,

482
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:14,978
if we manage to lure the King of Jin to face us alone,

483
00:31:14,979 --> 00:31:20,379
we can surely force him to submit and return the imperial power to you.

484
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,379
Your Highness, please stop hesitating.

485
00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,160
It's urgent.

486
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,599
The sin committed by the prince and the others is a felony.

487
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:41,699
You know the King of Jin well. He is cruel.

488
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,920
Besides, he will grasp any chance

489
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,899
to remove those who are loyal to you.

490
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,940
If you keep hesitating,

491
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,840
only death will await them.

492
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:56,200
I really appreciate your kind intention.

493
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:02,200
Your solution might be feasible.

494
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,079
Great, I'll go and prepare now.

495
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,920
But please allow me to reject it!

496
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,499
In front of a greater enemy, Jin must be united.

497
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:20,559
Also, Ji Chong and the others indeed have forged the military order and violated the law.

498
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,659
If one fails to obey the law strictly,

499
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,619
how would they win in future battles?

500
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:30,580
If they aren't punished, how will the Jin people value Jin's law?

501
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,179
Your Highness, are you not worried that with your identity and power,

502
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,099
the King of Jin will mistreat you and manipulate you like a puppet?

503
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:44,699
Chu Kui only cares for status and power, instead of the people.

504
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,920
So what if I don't have status and power?

505
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,338
Besides, it's true that under the King of Jin's governance,

506
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,000
Jin has become a very disciplined state.

507
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,680
Although his governance is strict, there's no tyranny.

508
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,239
This is the prime wish of the people.

509
00:32:58,239 --> 00:32:59,978
It doesn't matter who is the ruler.

510
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,920
Are you really not going to save Ji Chong and the others?

511
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:09,580
I'm sad and worried for them.

512
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,039
But this is my personal affair.

513
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:15,339
Sometimes, under such a situation,

514
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:18,119
it's crucial to keep my emotions under control.

515
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:22,019
If you don't have a perfect solution for it,

516
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,499
I'll meet with the King of Jin again.

517
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,659
After all, it started all because of my negligence.

518
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,859
I shouldn't escape from my responsibility.

519
00:33:30,859 --> 00:33:32,820
Well said.

520
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,858
Under such a situation, it's crucial to control one's emotions.

521
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:39,019
I really respect your remarks, Princess.

522
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,738
Sorry for offending, Your Highness.

523
00:33:40,739 --> 00:33:42,820
King of Jin.

524
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,880
I tell you what...

525
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,939
I mean, I've told you that Princess is a kind lady.

526
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,459
You may rest assured.

527
00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:51,959
Are you satisfied now?

528
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:59,780
General and Your Majesty, you have colluded?

529
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,200
In the past few days, if I've offended Your Highness,

530
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,940
please forgive me.

531
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,580
I was also told about the truth just a moment ago.

532
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:12,440
From the time when Your Highness returned,

533
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,999
everything was a test designed by me.

534
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:19,180
It is for the sake of this moment.

535
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,059
So, everything I've experienced is to test me

536
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,779
whether my emotions will run over logic

537
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,859
and affect the renaissance of the previous dynasty?

538
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,720
In this troubled era,

539
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,779
the ruler should look at the big picture.

540
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,559
I have no other choice. Your Highness, please forgive me for what I've done.

541
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,599
I'll hold the canonization ceremony for Your Highness as soon as possible.

542
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:43,458
What about Ji Chong and the others?

543
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,680
Did they learn of the truth?

544
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,099
They escaped on the way back here.

545
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,079
I've sent my guards to arrest them.

546
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,440
Please enter, Your Highness.

547
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,299
Feel free to tell, Your Highness.

548
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,859
Afterward, what are you planning to do with Ji Chong and the others?

549
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,559
I purposely let him run away.

550
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:40,019
Once he escapes, he will definitely meet up with the old members of the Chuanlong troops and

551
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,000
come back to attack us.

552
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,258
However, those old members have already received my order

553
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:46,720
to pretend to consent with him.

554
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,698
In the end, no one will support him,

555
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:52,380
and he will leave in anguish and shame.

556
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,440
But if he doesn't leave and come back alone,

557
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,559
I'll imprison him forever.

558
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,599
Why do you do this?

559
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,779
If he knows that you're dedicated to protecting me

560
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,819
without any evil intentions, that all was just a test,

561
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,680
he would put away his resistance.

562
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,720
I hope he misunderstands me forever.

563
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,179
I hope Your Highness will help me in that, too.

564
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,680
I won't agree to you.

565
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,359
Is Your Highness aware of the reason for testing you?

566
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,920
It's because I'm worried that Your Highness

567
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,720
is not suitable to stay in this troubled era just like that brat.

568
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:42,599
When he was born, he was very tiny.

569
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:45,300
Not much bigger than my palm.

570
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,419
I was worried that he would not last long.

571
00:36:48,419 --> 00:36:50,839
I never expected that he would grow up well,

572
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,499
and become bolder than anyone else.

573
00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:58,860
In Jin, everyone is afraid of me, especially the children.

574
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,480
But he was the only child who dared to hug my leg and refuse to let go.

575
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:10,580
Does Your Highness know what this brave child has feared

576
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,480
since he was young?

577
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:19,280
He is afraid that people around him would suffer because of him.

578
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,819
When he was a little boy, he was lazy in practicing martial arts

579
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,099
as well as in studying.

580
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,739
He was not afraid of any punishment.

581
00:37:26,739 --> 00:37:29,419
But if his servant was punished,

582
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,720
he would beg for mercy.

583
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:37,240
This kid may seem arrogant and naughty.

584
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:42,660
Instead, he is soft-hearted.

585
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,180
Indeed, he is.

586
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,440
Only parents know their children well.

587
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,299
After he grew up, he surprised me very much.

588
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,698
At the age of sixteen, he led the troops for the first time.

589
00:38:03,699 --> 00:38:07,120
In that year, he won plenty of battles.

590
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,819
Since then, he strived to improve his combat strength

591
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,339
and study military strategies every night.

592
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:15,179
I was very pleased that

593
00:38:15,179 --> 00:38:18,540
this brat learned to be humble

594
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,580
aside from enjoying the vanity.

595
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:25,619
But later I found out that it wasn't the case.

596
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:29,039
The reason why he desperately wanted to win in every battle

597
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,020
was because he was afraid that the men he brought out with him would fail to return.

598
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,320
Seven years ago, you punished Ji Chong's adjutant general.

599
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,979
I reckon that your intention was to intimidate him

600
00:38:41,979 --> 00:38:44,340
and teach him a lesson.

601
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:48,999
As a chief marshal of the Jin troops, I hoped that he could learn

602
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:50,799
to be just and stern.

603
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,970
However, as a father,

604
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:57,660
I really appreciate his kindness and righteousness.

605
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,899
But this is not a good thing on the battlefield.

606
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:05,279
Seven years ago, he chose to leave.

607
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:07,820
I was really confused at that time.

608
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,339
I was mad that he chose to escape from reality.

609
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,419
At the same time, I didn't want him to stay and become apathetic.

610
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,920
However, Your Highness, you're different from him.

611
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,599
He can choose to live in his own way.

612
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,820
But Your Highness can't do that.

613
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:35,698
You bear the hatred of a country and your family,

614
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:38,540
and you can't escape from that.

615
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:43,259
That's why I had to test Your Highness

616
00:39:43,259 --> 00:39:45,300
on whether Your Highness will be emotional

617
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,259
and disregard the overall situation.

618
00:39:51,499 --> 00:39:56,380
What if I didn't pass the test?

619
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,500
Well... This means that Your Highness is not suitable for this troubled era

620
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,120
and are not eligible to lead the army.

621
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,680
I can only risk wronging the citizens of this world and sit on the throne

622
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,379
until the world is pacified.

623
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,060
And I'll return the power by then.

624
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:17,379
With your loyal conduct,

625
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,540
I reckon that you didn't really want to make use of me, to sacrifice and

626
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,799
abandon me during our Qitan trip. Am I right?

627
00:40:25,179 --> 00:40:26,779
You're right.

628
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:31,440
If something bad happens, I already have a backup plan.

629
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,218
Besides, I've secretly informed Liu Xin to seek help from others

630
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:38,359
if anything happens.

631
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,259
So that day, she didn't run away,

632
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:48,920
but went to seek help from you instead.

633
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,779
I've cleared your confusion.

634
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,799
Could Your Highness promise me

635
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:58,939
not to tell this to Juyao and let him continue to hate me?

636
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:06,660
This is my way to protect him as his father.

637
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,399
I hope that he can stay away from this chaotic world for he isn't suitable for it.

643
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:10,980
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

644
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:17,970
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

645
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:25,150
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

646
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,860
♫ Forever being together ♫

647
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,390
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

648
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:39,560
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

649
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:46,830
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

650
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:53,790
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

651
00:43:53,790 --> 00:44:01,090
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

652
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:08,060
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

653
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:15,370
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

654
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:21,000
♫ Forever being together ♫

655
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,770
