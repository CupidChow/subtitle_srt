00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,690
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,740
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,120
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,410
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs)♫

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,830
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder)♫

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,060
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,780
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,150
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,420
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,230
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,040
{Episode 11]

21
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,659
I didn't ask you to eat them!

22
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,920
I'm leaving!

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,600
Don't run! Your leg isn't healed yet! Where are you going?

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,440
I have something to give you!

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,819
You've been staring at this malt candy the whole afternoon.

26
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:11,619
Ma Jing,

27
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:16,680
this malt candy is sweet, right?

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,999
Why does it taste sour?

29
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,520
Tell me honestly.

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,339
This afternoon, when you went to buy malt candy,

31
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:28,519
it was not by accident that you met Prince of Bo. Right?

32
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,180
Were you worried about Princess Bao Na

33
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,660
and Prince of Bo...

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,299
I'm worried that His Highness will be impatient towards Princess Bao Na and give himself away.

35
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,699
That's why I went to check on him.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,400
Is that so?

37
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:47,839
I didn't expect him to understand what it means to cherish a girl.

38
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:55,378
Why aren't you preparing dinner?

39
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,239
I thought you weren't hungry.

40
00:02:57,239 --> 00:02:59,458
But Princess Bao Na and His Highness need to eat, right?

41
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,460
They ate outside.

42
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,140
- What?
- What's with that reaction?

43
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,620
That's good to hear.

44
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,419
When did they return?

45
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,400
While you were looking at that malt candy.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,419
- Where are they?
- In Prince of Bo's courtyard.

47
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,179
They are practicing calligraphy together!

48
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,020
Your Highness, please stop!

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,259
I heard that Prince of Bo is teaching you calligraphy.

50
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,638
Why don't you practice in the main hall? I'll prepare the tools.

51
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,960
Don't trouble yourself.

52
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,659
It's not troublesome at all. Why would it be troublesome?

53
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,999
You will have more space in the main hall.

54
00:03:47,999 --> 00:03:51,299
It can make you feel relaxed. It's a suitable place for practicing calligraphy.

55
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,839
The study room is quiet.

56
00:03:52,839 --> 00:03:54,960
It can calm one's heart more easily.

57
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,300
But you'll feel sleepy as well.

58
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,380
Her Highness will practice diligently.

59
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,018
Your Highness, you'll be in the study room with Princess Bao Na, just the two of you.

60
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,040
Aren't you afraid that Her Highness's reputation will be affected?

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
I don't mind!

62
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:19,479
Your Highness, let's practice in the main hall since Young Feudal Mistress thinks it's unsuitable.

63
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:21,260
No way!

64
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,713
Ma Zhaixing, are you trying to create trouble?

65
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,399
Let me tell you a secret.

66
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,900
Prince of Bo bought a perfumed sachet.

67
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,540
He wants to give it to me.

68
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,940
But it's embarrassing for him to give it to me in public.

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,859
That's why I came up with an excuse to practice calligraphy,

70
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:44,520
so that he can spend time with me alone.

71
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,559
Sister Zhaixing, please help me out. Okay?

72
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:52,179
Please don't interrupt us, okay?

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,839
The main hall has people moving around. It's unsuitable for calligraphy, indeed.

74
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,018
You guys should go to the study room, so that you wouldn't be bothered.

75
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:11,279
Do you really mean that?

76
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,380
Let's go.

77
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,538
Just thinking that I'm going to spend time alone with you, my heart is beating like crazy.

78
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,379
I'm afraid my hands will shake later.

79
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,499
But I won't mind it if you hold my hand later!

80
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:59,859
Brother Bo, you're standing so far away. How can I practice like this?

81
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:04,300
Aren't you supposed to hold my hand and help me out?

82
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,099
You don't need anyone to assist you in practicing calligraphy.

83
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,300
You can do it as long as you're calm.

84
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,280
Your Highness, return to your seat.

85
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
No!

86
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,800
I won't return to my seat if you don't accompany me.

87
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:19,079
That's great.

88
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:22,458
You should rest earlier. I've still got things to do.

89
00:06:23,499 --> 00:06:25,359
I'll practice!

90
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,400
I'll practice then.

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,139
I'll practice on my own.

92
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,740
I'll practice on my own then.

93
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,240
This is strange.

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,000
When is Brother Bo going to give me the perfumed sachet?

95
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Don't tell me he's going to surprise me by giving it to me while I'm asleep?

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm so tired.

97
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,760
Zhaixing.

98
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:56,579
Where's Brother Bo?

99
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,919
This is strange.

100
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:06,071
Where is he?

101
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:12,819
How did I fall asleep?

102
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:15,059
Brother Bo!

103
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,698
Feudal Young Mistress, ever since you knew that His Highness had gone out with Princess Bao Na,

104
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,280
the two even practiced calligraphy together earlier,

105
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,919
you became anxious and your temperament changed.

106
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,060
According to my past experience,

107
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,519
it seems that you're jealous!

108
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,640
What's the use of knowing that fact?

109
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,680
I was the one who pushed His Highness towards the princess.

110
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
Give it to me!

111
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,279
It's been a long time since you were this sad.

112
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:12,159
You were sad last time because of Wolf Boy.

113
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,299
But this time, you're sad because of His Highness.

114
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:17,559
Don't put them into the same category!

115
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,720
Wolf Boy would never treat me like that!

116
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,179
Why are you angry?

117
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,599
You caused this present situation, didn't you?

118
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,318
I don't want to listen! I don't want to listen to this!

119
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:30,138
Don't listen then. That's fine.

120
00:10:30,138 --> 00:10:33,059
Come, vent your anger with the straw puppet.

121
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,839
Aim for the head and shoot through its eyes! What do you think?

122
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,380
Fine!

123
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,240
I'll shoot its left arm first.

124
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,459
Because he bought a perfumed sachet for the princess with that hand!

125
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,020
Great shot!

126
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,639
Next!

127
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,459
Do you want to shoot its right arm?

128
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,240
I'll shoot its right arm!

129
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,259
He taught Princess Bao Na calligraphy with that right hand!

130
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:12,020
Yeah!

131
00:11:15,819 --> 00:11:17,119
Again!

132
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:19,559
Give it to me!

133
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:21,999
Hurry!

134
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,240
Where should I aim next?

135
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,959
How about the heart?

136
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,299
Yes! The heart!

137
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,940
You...

138
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,040
Steady yourself.

139
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,980
You can't pierce my heart when you're in this state.

140
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,680
Show me the spirit you had earlier.

141
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:12,659
Tell me.

142
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:15,180
Why are you aiming for my heart?

143
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,880
This is an order.

144
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,400
You...

145
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,980
Are you sure?

146
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,580
I won't eat my words.

147
00:12:48,599 --> 00:12:50,299
Because...

148
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,860
Because you only cared about Princess Bao Na!

149
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,239
Young Feudal Mistress, isn't that what you wished for?

150
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,899
I... I was...

151
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,398
I just wanted you to put on an act!

152
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,839
I didn't want you to do it for real!

153
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:15,134
I don't understand at all.

154
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,020
Can you explain it to me?

155
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:28,819
Just now, I heard

156
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:31,520
you say that I was different from Wolf Boy.

157
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,359
How are we different?

158
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:41,200
I'm doing this for the sake of our future.

159
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,780
We should understand each other and grow together.

160
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,539
That can minimize misunderstandings.

161
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,619
Isn't that better?

162
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:53,259
You...

163
00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,259
You mean it, right?

164
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:56,518
You're so annoying.

165
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,460
Stop repeating that.

166
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,340
This is an order.

167
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:04,319
Wolf Boy only treats me well.

168
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:06,260
And he does it whole-heartedly.

169
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,659
I'm the only one in his heart!

170
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:10,719
There's no one else!

171
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,219
Wolf Boy is sincere towards you, indeed.

172
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,279
Of course!

173
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,800
And whenever I'm unhappy,

174
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,939
he'll use sweet words to coax me and make me happy.

175
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,280
For example, now, I'm very unhappy!

176
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,779
Right.

177
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,119
So, he's a sweet talker?

178
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,099
Correct!

179
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,379
He's the sweetest talker!

180
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,819
But only when I'm around!

181
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,340
Your Highness, what are you laughing at?

182
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:55,900
I'm happy for you.

183
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,280
Because I'm not good at sweet-talking.

184
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,580
That's why I'm envious that you have a friend like that.

185
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,579
Why are you envious? Why are you happy?

186
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:09,219
Didn't you say you want us to grow together?

187
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:11,640
You should learn this then!

188
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,280
Fine.

189
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,200
Your Highness, are you laughing at me?

190
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,519
Before I promise you,

191
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:25,019
you need to answer my question.

192
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,599
Are you being jealous?

193
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,000
And were you trying to make me jealous as well?

194
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,940
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

195
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,930
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

196
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:55,140
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who
its afterglow will illuminate ♫

197
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,330
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

198
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,480
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense  ♫

199
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,510
♫ But gentleness is always invincible ♫

200
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,599
Aim for my heart.

201
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,100
Pierce it.

202
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,159
Maybe Bao Na isn't inside at all.

203
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,210
♫ I have yet to encounter any challenge that I find difficult ♫

204
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,800
♫ Even going against the tides, my vision is still steady,
manners is still fierce ♫

205
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,340
♫ I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling,
it’s history in the making ♫

206
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,530
♫ Climbing mountains and cliffs, I’m earth-shatteringly alone ♫

207
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,690
♫ With no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder ♫

208
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,990
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

209
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,830
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

210
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,720
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

211
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,140

215
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,880
Your Highness!

216
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,999
I'm a bit tired now.

217
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,200
I'll return to my room.

218
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,559
Young Feudal Mistress!

219
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,060
Quiet!

220
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,339
How I wish I could dig a hole and hide in it!

221
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,580
I'll only say one thing.

222
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,079
Tell me.

223
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:42,660
You just confessed to him earlier.

224
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,960
I know!

225
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,740
Go to sleep!

226
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,479
Where's Brother Bo?

227
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,619
I can't find him anywhere.

228
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,240
Your Highness, maybe His Highness has returned to his courtyard.

229
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,219
Whose room is this?

230
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:07,820
Your Highness, this is Miss Zhaixing's room.

231
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,459
Sister Zhaixing?

232
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:37,419
You mustn't do this!

233
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,180
Your Highness, please calm down!

234
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,918
I'm not being impulsive.

235
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:42,758
It is you who are too cunning!

236
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,440
You guys tried to use me as your pawn!

237
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,880
Your Highness, what do you mean by that?

238
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,199
Why did he give Ma Zhaixing the perfumed sachet?

239
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,638
That perfumed sachet was mine!

240
00:18:52,638 --> 00:18:55,239
It's mine!

241
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:59,778
Your Highness, I can't understand what you're talking about when you speak like that.

242
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:02,220
Brother Bo bought a perfumed sachet.

243
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,739
I thought he bought it for me.

244
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:09,059
But in the end... In the end, he gave it to Ma Zhaixing!

245
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:12,740
Tell me! Are they having an affair?

246
00:19:16,999 --> 00:19:18,858
Your Highness, you're overthinking.

247
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:20,498
That's just your assumption.

248
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:23,439
Unless Third Brother acknowledges that he has feelings for Ma Zhaixing,

249
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:25,859
I won't believe it.

250
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,559
But, as a princess, it isn't suitable for you

251
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
to ask him this question personally, am I right?

252
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,779
Of course.

253
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:42,039
So, this is a difficult situation.

254
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,380
Especially with a quiet person like my third brother.

255
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,979
It's harder for us to get an answer from him.

256
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:55,980
Since verbal statements are no guarantee,

257
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,640
how about...

258
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,620
How about we find out the truth by witnessing it ourselves?

259
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,400
Your Highness, you're right.

260
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,978
If something urgent happens, that is like putting Your Highness

261
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,618
and Ma Zhaixing on the same scale.

262
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,738
And Third Brother's heart will be that scale.

263
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:18,200
Who has more weight? We just have to observe Third Brother's reaction after that.

264
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,199
Your Highness, you mustn't be afraid.

265
00:20:22,199 --> 00:20:26,040
I believe that Third Brother won't let you down.

266
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,519
Who are you?

267
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,300
You're now our precious guest.

268
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
All right.

269
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,179
Ma Zhaixing is nothing.

270
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,679
I'm more important than her.

271
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,820
Of course, you're more important than her.

272
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,618
I'll be leaving then.

273
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:45,160
Just treat it as if this didn't happen today.

274
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,139
Everything you saw was a hoax!

275
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:49,998
Yes. A hoax.

276
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,580
Farewell, Your Highness.

277
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,220
I feel a bit guilty manipulating the innocence of young girl.

278
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:06,999
That Princess Bao Na is crazy.

279
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,159
She actually used a dagger to threaten us!

280
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,679
I was really worried just now.

281
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,620
I'd be more worried if she wasn't crazy.

282
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,880
The crazier she is, the better it is for me.

283
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,559
I wasn't sure of Ma Zhaixing's position within Prince of Bo's heart until tonight.

284
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,680
After Bao Na came to us,

285
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:41,579
I'm more confident that Ma Zhaixing is Prince of Bo's weakness.

286
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:45,059
Witnessing the truth for ourselves.

287
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,860
That's a great idea!

288
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,978
We'll let Princess Bao Na dig her own grave.

289
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:51,398
Let her find out the fact that Prince of Bo is hiding his engagement.

290
00:21:51,398 --> 00:21:54,900
Let the paper be unable to cover the fire.

291
00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:00,178
As for what should be done next, Father-in-Law, have you planned it out?

292
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:04,359
Just like what you wish, everything will go according to plan.

293
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,459
Good!

294
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:08,140
Bring me to the person you have found.

295
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,580
Yes.

296
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,379
There's no need for you to run.

297
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,280
Zhuiri (Chasing the Sun), you must greatly admire a graceful expert like your master. Right?

298
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:24,919
We have more money now.

How dare you! This is the Constabulary!

Outsiders are to leave!

304
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:59,540
Brother, calm down.

305
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,179
Let's make a deal.

306
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,059
This... The Great Thief, Chen Kui?

307
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,879
Quickly call for our leader!

308
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,600
Leader! Leader!

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
Leader!

310
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,920
Leader!

311
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,620
Is he really Chen Kui, the top criminal?

312
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:28,180
Excuse me, but how did you capture him?

313
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,539
I found him on the road.

314
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,819
You found him?

315
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:35,760
I'm supposed to meet the ladies in Hundred Flowers Brothel.

316
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,460
Pay me now.

317
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,999
Very good. Just the right amount.

318
00:24:46,999 --> 00:24:48,639
Not too much, not too little.

319
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:51,099
I'll leave now. Don't need to send me off.

Ji Chong.

322
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,460
Don't tell me he's...

323
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,159
Yes. It's him.

324
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,159
Including this, he has captured

325
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,360
four of the most wanted criminals in the capital within ten days.

326
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,339
And he leaves without a trail.

327
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,259
He's something.

328
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,820
Who are you?

329
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,299
Why are you making this so creepy?

330
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,879
My young master...

331
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,339
wants to make a deal with you.

332
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,039
But you're not sincere at all.

333
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,480
You don't need so many people to make a deal.

334
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,420
You're something, indeed.

335
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,779
Seems like it's not a coincidence that

336
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,258
you could capture four of the most wanted criminals all by yourself.

337
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,740
You're capable indeed.

338
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,619
I'll be as capable as the amount of money you give me.

339
00:26:07,619 --> 00:26:09,439
You're frank.

340
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,679
Someone...

341
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:23,320
These bounty hunters are just like you.

342
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,460
They hunt for money.

343
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,720
If you're willing, they will tell you what to do.

344
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,780
You'll be rewarded handsomely after you finish the tasks.

345
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,660
But we have a rule.

346
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,819
Never ask about our identity and our goal.

347
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:42,878
I won't. I won't ask anything.

348
00:26:42,878 --> 00:26:45,400
Finish the task according to our instructions then.

349
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,819
You're talented.

350
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:51,300
Seems like there's a great chance that we will collaborate again in the future.

351
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,680
As long as you have the money,

352
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,659
my talent will belong to you.

353
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,899
I'll leave now.

354
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:08,280
The top girl of Hundred Flowers Brothel refuses customers if you don't arrive on time.

355
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:12,619
Your Highness, although bounty hunters are capable,

356
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:14,659
their backgrounds are unknown.

357
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,338
A mixture of good and evil.

358
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:18,480
Can we believe in them?

359
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,720
The sea holds thousands of rivers in order to achieve its vastness.

360
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,419
As long as we focus on their strength,

361
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:26,560
even criminals and scoundrels will be useful to us.

362
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,119
What I want from them is the ability to do tasks without asking anything.

363
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,299
By doing so, even if they fail,

364
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:39,020
nobody will find out about our involvement.

[Orphan and Widow Village, border of Jin Kingdom]

Slow down!

367
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,390
- Give it to me!
- Slowly!

368

Ji Chong is here!

Good boy. Come!

- Ji Chong!
- Come! Good boy!

Good boy. You guys can go and play.

376
00:28:19,878 --> 00:28:21,859
- Let me talk to your mother. Okay?
- Okay.

377
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:23,019
Finish it quickly.

378
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,259
Okay. Good boy.

379
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,500
How are you lately?

380
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,760
Are the children doing well? Do you have enough money?

381
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,978
I want the pinwheel!

382
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,138
I want this!

383
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,079
Give it to me!

384
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,879
Soon I will be rich!

00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:44,020
By then, you guys won't need to worry about money!

Not just you guys,

387
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:49,239
even the people in the neighboring village will have money as well!

388
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,659
You can all raise your children without worries!

389
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,660
Sir, don't take it to heart.

390
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,380
They will appreciate your efforts one day.

391

Where's Young Feudal Mistress?

396
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,499
She and the princess went out early this morning.

397
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,258
For what?

398
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,779
According to my knowledge, Princess Bao Na invited Young Feudal Mistress

399
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,779
to buy things together for the Qixi Festival celebration tonight.

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,059
Qixi Festival's celebration?

402
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,520
What can we buy in this wilderness?

403
00:29:55,639 --> 00:30:00,300
Ordinary people cannot understand the thoughts of a princess.

404
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,280
We're here. We're here.

405
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,399
Sister Zhaixing, you may come down!

00:30:31,219 --> 00:30:33,439
- Your Highness.
- Greetings, Your Highness.

407
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,999
Your Highness, why are we here?

408
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,858
In war, we should take down the leader of the opposition faction first.

409
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:44,618
But in love, we should tackle the stomach of our loved one first.

Brother Bo loves meat.

411

and prepare a feast of meat for the Qixi celebration tonight.

413

As long as Brother Bo enjoys the feast,

414
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:01,279
I'm sure he'll show me his passionate side tonight!

416
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,000
Sister, are you unwilling to do so?

417
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,720
The road was bumpy.

My leg feels uncomfortable.

- If we need to ride horses—
- Sister, I understand.

420
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:16,700
You can ride my horse, Bing'er.

421
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,119
It will be like just sitting on a chair. Very stable.

422
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,539
You just need to chat with me while we ride horses.

423
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,159
Look at Bing'er's headwear. Isn't it beautiful?

424
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:32,738
Your Highness, riding a horse is my favorite sport.

Why don't you let me accompany you?

426
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,819
I've compromised with Sister many times.

427
00:31:36,819 --> 00:31:39,300
But why doesn't she appreciate my effort?

428
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:42,299
No one dares to reject me in my family.

429

But why is it different now that I'm out...

430
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,019
Fine.

00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,279
Your Highness, I'll join you for the hunt.

Princess, your leg hasn't healed yet. You mustn't ride horses.

434
00:31:59,239 --> 00:32:01,600
I will be careful. Don't worry.

435
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,539
I'll protect you then.

436
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:11,539
Princess, be careful!

437
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,460
Sister Zhaxing, keep up!

438
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,978
Your Highness, please slow down!

439
00:32:21,979 --> 00:32:24,399
I can't catch up!

440
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,539
Your Highness!

Bing'er!

442
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,659
What's wrong?

443
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:13,018
Bing'er, good girl.

444
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:15,759
I'll reward you when we return.

445
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:20,099
As for Ma Zhaixing...

446
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:22,740
Although she's pitiful,

447
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,119
she's a worthy sacrifice for me to witness Prince of Bo's love.

448
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:28,660
Thank you for sacrificing yourself.

449
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,620

Someone!

00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,700
Are you sure of what you heard?

453
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,899
Are you sure it was the emperor's imperial physician who took care of Ma Zhaixing?

454
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,019
I'm sure.

455
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,919
How was she able to call for the imperial physician?

456
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,259
Maybe the imperial physician was meant for you, Your Highness.

457
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,521
Maybe Ma Zhaixing took advantage because you didn't need his service.

458
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,820
So... Go and take a look!

459
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,118
- See if Prince of Bo is back!
- Yes.

460
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,999
Wen Yan, how's Zhaixing?

461
00:34:25,999 --> 00:34:27,319
Did she hurt her leg again?

462
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:30,899
My Lord, the imperial physician said that her leg injury is not to be worried about.

463
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,880
It's just that she received some shock.

464
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,759
It hurts!

465
00:34:38,059 --> 00:34:42,179
As for Princess Bao Na, she only wanted the physician from Qitan to treat her injury.

466
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,999
So, I don't know much about her situation.

467
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,040
Why does it hurt so much?

468
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:53,640
Brother Bo!

469
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,138
My Lord, please don't worry.

470
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,880
Young Feudal Mistress drank her medicine.

471
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,339
She'll be able to rest well for the next few hours.

472
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,259
Find out the reason behind her fall.

473
00:35:04,259 --> 00:35:08,939
My Lord, it seems that something is abnormal about this.

474
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,719
Brother Bo!

475
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,800
Is my leg broken?

476
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,640
It hurts!

477
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:23,059
First, the people of Qitan are the best at horse riding.

478
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:27,759
And Princess Bao Na's horse is the best horse among all horses.

479
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,639
Moreover, Young Mistress is the daughter of Ma Ying, the daughter of a general.

480
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:35,379
I'm sure her riding skills are great.

481
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,739
This is strange. Why is there no reaction?

482
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,320
Is it because I wasn't loud enough?

483
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,660
Why isn't anyone coming?

484
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,858
Your Highness, you need to drink the medicine while it's hot.

485
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,740
Are you dumb? I'm not...

486
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,980
I'm in pain!

487
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,759
Brother Bo! Hurry!

488
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:06,678
Give me the medicine!

489
00:36:06,678 --> 00:36:08,179
Hurry!

490
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,040
It hurts!

491
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,619
Brother Bo, I'm in pain.

492
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,360
I can't even move.

493
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,958
Please forgive me.

494
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:32,400
Why don't you come and check on me?

495
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,540
Since that's the case, you should rest.

496
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,920
Your Highness, please take care.

497
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,999
Brother Bo!

498
00:36:39,999 --> 00:36:41,778
I'm in pain!

499
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:44,260
Brother Bo!

500
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,320
They fell off their horses at the same time?

501
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,740
Yes.

502
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,679
And Princess Bao Na emphasized that

503
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,919
both she and Young Mistress suffered the same injury.

504
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:58,500
She repeated that many times.

505
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,060
And the medicine that she's drinking...

506
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:03,459
What?

507
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:06,099
It doesn't suit her condition.

508
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,980
Don't tell me that

509
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:12,660
Brother Bo is truly in love with another person.

510
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,260
No way!

511
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,500
He loves me the most!

512
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,619
Your Highness, Prince of Bo is currently walking towards here.

513
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,679
It hurts!

514
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,320
It hurts so much!

515
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,439
Prince of Bo, I knew you cared about me.

516
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:36,020
My leg is in so much pain. I can't even get down from my bed.

517
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,139
Please check on me.

518
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:45,019
I heard that Bing'er is your favorite pet.

519
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,219
Prince of Bo, you know me well.

520
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,419
You're right. I was the one who raised Bing'er.

521
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:53,740
I accompanied her every day.

522
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:59,919
But I had to kill that horse.

523
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:03,839
Bing'er!

524
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,560
Your Highness, it seems that you're not injured at all.

525
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,178
I drank the medicine. So I feel better now!

526
00:38:11,178 --> 00:38:15,320
But the medicine you drank wasn't the right medicine at all.

527
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,880
It's just an ordinary tonic.

528
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,019
The imperial physician prescribed it.

529
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,339
How should I know that it's not right?

530
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,818
Of course, you don't know.

531
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,538
But I asked your physician in person

532
00:38:24,539 --> 00:38:27,299
and the officers responsible for your horse.

533
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:29,479
I didn't expect...

534
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,699
Yes!

535
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,459
I'm not injured at all!

536
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,139
And Ma Zhaixing falling off the horse was also under my command!

537
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:39,260
So what?

538
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,359
Every one of you here still has to obey my command and treat me as your precious guest!

539
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:45,579
Why did you hurt Zhaixing?

540
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,519
Because of this!

541
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,479
You clearly should be liking me.

542
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:54,859
Falling head over heels for me.

543
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:58,439
But you gave Ma Zhaixing the perfumed sachet!

544
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,519
How am I inferior to her?

545
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:03,460
In every way!

546
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,560
Zhaixing and I are engaged to be married.

547
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,160
Indeed.

548
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,039
These past days,

549
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:15,239
you have been giving me the cold shoulder,

550
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,820
but you were always caring for her.

551
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,199
I should've known that you two had an extraordinary relationship!

552
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,119
Your Highness, did you know that

553
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:25,760
her leg was injured before?

554
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,600
If her leg gets injured again, she may be paralyzed.

555
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,778
I didn't know!

556
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:33,718
She didn't tell me! How can you blame me for that?

557
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:35,220
Of course, you didn't know,

558
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,339
because you only have yourself in your eyes.

559
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:38,759
Aren't you, too?

560
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:41,419
Didn't you try to please me because you wanted to borrow troops from me?

561
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:43,739
If I really am using you to borrow troops,

562
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,199
I would've used you years ago.

563
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:49,360
I kept you here

564
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,800
because of the mutual agreement between our kingdoms

565
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,859
and Zhaixing's kindness.

566
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,339
She didn't want you to return in disappointment.

567
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,979
But I didn't expect Zhaixing to be hurt because of this.

568
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,759
Prince of Bo, you're too much.

569
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:06,578
I was never in your heart!

570
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,039
You only care about Ma Zhaixing!

571
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,080
I can't give you the relationship you're seeking.

572
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,819
Your scheme caused Zhaixing to get hurt.

573
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,139
Logically, I shouldn't let you off.

574
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,259
But I wronged you first since I hid my engagement from you.

575
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:32,819
Now, we don't owe each other anything.

576
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:34,419
Mo Xiao...

577
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,539
I can only return you the gift you gave to me.

578
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:48,120
You never intended to unwrap my gift in the first place.

579
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,680
And now, you're returning it to me?

580
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,019
I've never suffered such humiliation before!

581
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,259
I will make you all regret this!

582
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,579
Someone! Open it!

583
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,419
Look closely!

584
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,778
You hid a treaty inside? What are you up to?

585
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:11,679
I gave you hints before.

586
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:14,679
I told you that inside this gift is something priceless.

587
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,699
If you had been sincere about our relationship,

588
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,859
you would have treasured my gift.

589
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,999
But you treated it as nothing,

590
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:24,560
whether it's the gift or me!

591
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,020
Since you don't want this, I'll make it hard for you to borrow troops!

592
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,620
Stop!

593
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,140
Our feud has nothing to do with the fate of our kingdoms.

594
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,759
Who said so?

595
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,700
What will I get if I lend you my troops?

596
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,238
If I lend you my troops, you and Ma Zhaixing will enjoy your happily ever after.

597
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:47,679
And I still can't get the love I wanted from you.

598
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,199
If that's so, let us just both suffer defeat then!

599
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:01,479
I thought you were just willful,

600
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,020
so I tolerated your temper.

601
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,999
I never thought you would burn the agreement.

602
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,800
I will report your outrageous action to His Majesty tomorrow.

603
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,120
Let us have His Majesty decide on this.
