♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate

♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,030
[Episode 17]

21
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,019
I went to visit Sister Zhaixing just now.

22
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,360
She is much better now.

23
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,339
Finally, I can stop worrying and have a good sleep.

24
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,279
Besides this alliance treaty,

25
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:48,019
I've prepared another gift for you, Brother Bo.

26
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,040
Bring him in.

27
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,199
You scoundrels!

28
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,019
How dare you treat me so rudely.
[Chu Youzhen- Fourth Prince of the Yang Kingdom- Prince of Xun]

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,240
Do you want to die?

30
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,680
Chu Youzhen, be quiet!

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,080
Don't you see that I have a guest here?

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,839
I know. You have to catch the assailants and

33
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,759
take care of Sister Zhaixing at the same time.

34
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,139
So, I brought the Fourth Prince here.

35
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:18,578
But I know that both of you do not get along well.

36
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:22,678
I was afraid that he'll run away, so I tied him up.

37
00:02:22,678 --> 00:02:26,019
You are indeed very meticulous.

38
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,399
I think this is your idea all along!

39
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,759
Untie me now!

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Chu Youzhe, why are you like this?

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,698
You haven't seen your brother for so long and you didn't even greet him.

42
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,419
How rude. Can you show some manners?

43
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:41,498
Manners?

44
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:42,979
Yelu Bao Na, are you crazy?

45
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,100
If I show some manners towards Prince of Bo, it'll be like fire and ice!

46
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,699
I'll never get along with him!

47
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,578
All these years, I've been telling you how good Brother Bo is.

48
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,298
Why can't I change your mind about him?

49
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:59,920
You are really not worth teaching.

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,459
I'll say it one last time.

51
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:03,379
Untie me now.

52
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,138
I won't go back with him!

53
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,818
- You!
- Your Highness.

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,400
Forget it.

55
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:14,180
Untie Fourth Prince.

56
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:27,899
Move aside!

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,300
Fourth Brother, how are you?

58
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,938
Fine.

59
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:39,578
I was perfectly fine before this.

60
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,460
Everything was great.

61
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,779
But now that you are here, I feel ill.

62
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:47,259
My head aches, my eyes ache, my nose aches, my stomach aches,

63
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,979
and now, even my hair aches.

64
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,599
Third Brother,

65
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,299
I think we are not meant to get along.

66
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,080
At first, I wanted to pick you up myself.

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,939
- But something happened.
- I heard about it.

68
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,879
Should I thank you?

69
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,259
If you had come to pick me up, the one who's barely alive now

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,499
would not be Commandery Princess Ma but me instead.

71
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:10,498
Chu Youzhe, that is too much!

72
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,540
My eyelid has been twitching a lot lately.

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,180
I had this ominous feeling.

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,138
Now, I know that it's because of you.

75
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,179
If I had known, I would have sent a letter to Father to forbid you from picking me up.

76
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,459
You have no choice.

77
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,579
Indeed, I have no choice.

78
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:31,080
But now, I can choose to stay away from you!

79
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,778
- Chu Youzhen! Come back!
- Your Highness, forget it!

80
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,720
Let him go.

81
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,939
Father must have done this on purpose.

82
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,738
He knows that we don't get along, but he purposely sent him to pick me up.

83
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:46,679
What was he thinking?

84
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,378
Hurry up and catch that eagle for me.

85
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:54,879
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,300
What is this?

87
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,360
Whose tent is that?

88
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,698
Your Highness, that is Commandery Princess Ma's tent.

89
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:12,719
The person who is as unlucky as I am.

90
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:14,219
Let's go and visit her.

91
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,520
Yes, Your Highness.

92
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,619
Who are you?

93
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,199
You're the one that should state your identity first.

94
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,259
I came to find it.

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,800
Its name is Zhuiri.

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
I am its master.

97
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,620
Now, you can tell me

98
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,020
who you are, right?

99
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,059
Insolent fool!

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,039
How dare you disrespect Fourth Prince!

101
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,439
Greetings, Your Highness.

102
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,220
Be at ease.

103
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,699
Is Commandery Princess Ma getting better?

104
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,719
Why don't you enter the tent yourself and pay her a visit?

105
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,080
We are both unfortunate people.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,479
No need to be courteous.

107
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:19,080
What do you mean, Your Highness?

108
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,020
I don't understand.

109
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,039
You despise Prince of Bo as much as I do.

110
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,859
I think you've misunderstood.

111
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:33,139
Why would I despise Prince of Bo?

112
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:34,098
It's not a misunderstanding.

113
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,798
I heard that you kicked him out of your tent because you didn't want to see him.

114
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,578
Don't worry. Prince of Bo and I are not real brothers.

115
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,219
We never get along.

116
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,779
So, you can just admit it.

117
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,699
You hate Prince of Bo, too. Right?

118
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,060
So you are one of us.

119
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,019
You dislike Prince of Bo, too.

120
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,198
I don't only dislike him. I abhor him.

121
00:06:57,198 --> 00:06:58,499
He makes me feel sick.

122
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,699
He always has this scowling and icy face.

123
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,439
It's like everyone owes him something.

124
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,799
That's right!

125
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:09,180
And he's always so arrogant, capricious, autocratic, forceful, and unreasonable.

126
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,780
I've never seen someone so shameless.

127
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,899
Are you a ghost? You don't even make a sound when you walk.

128
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:20,959
Are you trying to scare us?

129
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,739
I don't want to ruin your mood.

130
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,219
Don't come here then.

131
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,479
Nobody welcomes you here.

132
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,899
I've already sent my men to investigate.

133
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:34,479
The enemies who ambushed me are most likely from the Kingdom of Jin.

134
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,579
If this is really their doing,

135
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:41,319
that ambush was just their usual dirty tactics.

136
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,139
You are still unwell.

137
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,939
Looks like we have to stay here for a few more days.

138
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,020
I'll bring you back to the capital when you've recovered.

139
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,959
Your Majesty.

140
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,420
I wonder if Prince of Bo and his men have picked up Zhen'er or not.

141
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,659
According to the date,

142
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,340
Prince of Bo should have reached Qitan and

143
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,800
met Fourth Prince already.

144
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:37,870
My youngest son is the late empress's only son.

145
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,639
I wonder how tall he is now.

146
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,440
I don't know if he'll blame me

147
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,680
for sending him away from home so often.

148
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,059
He was kept as a hostage for so long.

149
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:56,540
Now, he'll be back soon.

150
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,660
How is Chuchu's recovery going?

151
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,519
Make sure that the imperial physician takes good care of her.

152
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,059
Princess Consort Yun is doing well.

153
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,920
But she asked me to

154
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,519
give you this letter in private.

155
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,680
A letter from Chuchu?

156
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:20,440
Please take a look at it.

157
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:28,220
Hurry up.

158
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,020
Summon Prince of Bo back at once.

159
00:09:37,739 --> 00:09:42,839
Master, His Majesty has sent you an urgent letter.

160
00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,100
How is this possible?

161
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,018
How is it possible that Second Brother is the one who tried to assassinate you?

162
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,220
Pass down my order. We'll head back at once.

163
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,792
[Imperial City of Yang, Suyang]

164
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,900
Second Brother!

165
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,639
Let go of him!

166
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:39,739
- Your Highness, don't do that!
- Are you okay?

167
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,339
My older brother has risked his life to save you so many times.

168
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,320
But when my brother was in danger,

169
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,059
he just watched coldly from the sidelines and ran away from battle.

170
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,159
He caused him to die on the battlefield all alone!

171
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,680
Although you are his princess consort,

172
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,300
he just thinks of you as a backer who can support him with the Ma troops!

173
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,000
Enough!

174
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,140
Prince of Bo,

175
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,619
detain this unfilial son to the Imperial Mausoleum.

176
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,400
I accept...

177
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,939
- this order.
- Youzhen! Youzhen!

178
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,938
Second Brother! Second Brother!

179
00:11:21,938 --> 00:11:24,300
Youzhen!

180
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,159
Youzhen!

181
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,539
Imperial Father, Second Brother is the only real brother I have in the palace.

182
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:38,639
I just came back today.

183
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:44,280
Please have mercy on him and think of it as our family's first reunion after so many years.

184
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,659
Fourth Prince, please get up now.

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,660
This punishment is already very lenient towards him.

186
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,879
Even a vicious tiger will not eat its cubs.

187
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,240
How can he be so cruel?

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,100
Insolent fool.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,378
How dare you speak to me like this!

190
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,439
I'm just stating the facts.

191
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:09,500
Prince of Bo is just a bastard you brought in from outside.

192
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,839
My First Brother is dead because of him.

193
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,019
Today, Second Brother was just led astray.

194
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,579
but you won't pardon him.

195
00:12:18,579 --> 00:12:20,419
I understand now.

196
00:12:20,419 --> 00:12:23,539
In your heart, you value that illegitimate child

197
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,498
more than your own biological sons!

198
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:29,579
You... You shut up!

199
00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:33,039
I'm just telling you how I really feel.

200
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,020
If you don't want to hear it,

201
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,299
I'll just leave tomorrow.

202
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,579
You are threatening me?

203
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,020
My first brother is dead.

204
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,220
My second brother is deposed.

205
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,200
You just care about that illegitimate son.

206
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,679
I think there's no point for me

207
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:53,800
to stay in the palace.

208
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,159
Farewell, Father.

209
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,580
Youzhen.

210
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:06,579
- Youzhen!
- Fourth Prince!

211
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,178
Your Majesty.

212
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:14,899
You are his cousin.

213
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,138
You are connected to him by blood.

214
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,220
Go and talk to him on my behalf.

215
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

216
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,240
Your Majesty.

217
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,059
Actually, Fourth Prince had been thinking about you all the way here.

218
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,359
Is that so? What did he say?

219
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,278
He said that when he left the capital

220
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:55,279
to become a hostage in the neighboring country, you didn't send him off.

221
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,879
But he knew that you didn't show up because you couldn't bear to let him go.

222
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,099
So, he has never blamed you or despised you for it.

223
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,659
He really said that?

224
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,199
On the way here, he kept asking me about your well-being

225
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,780
and whether or not you have white hair now.

226
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,800
Although he didn't say it, I know that he was looking forward

227
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,480
to coming back this time to be reunited with

228
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,519
his father and brothers again.

229
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,860
They are all my real sons.

230
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,699
Your Majesty, this is the best pear from the northwest.

231
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,559
My four sons used to be so close together.

232
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,979
They all understood "Kong Rong yielding pears".
(T/N: a moral story in which Kong Rong picks the smaller pears while leaving the bigger ones to his older brothers)

233
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,779
But now?

234
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:14,960
They've fallen apart from each other and have their own mindset now.

235
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
Go.

236
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,719
Give this pear to Youzhen.

237
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:24,820
I hope that he can understand me.

238
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:28,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

239
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:39,900
Are you feeling better?

240
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,279
Commandery Princess Ma,

241
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:50,839
I heard that you risked your life to save Prince of Bo from assassination this time.

242
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,419
Well, did he thank you well?

243
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,079
Prince of Bo is your son. He's protected by God.

244
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,179
For him to come back in one piece is not a credit that I can claim for myself.

245
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,240
Very good.

246
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,819
I can see that you and Youzhen got along very well.

247
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:21,919
And you have always been so loyal towards Prince of Bo.

248
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:26,059
I really hope that you can help me bring them together.

249
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:31,539
Even if you can't mend the bond between them,

250
00:16:31,539 --> 00:16:34,550
please stop them from fighting against each other.

251
00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:37,860
I'll try my best.

252
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,239
But as far as I know,

253
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:44,261
First Prince chose to sacrifice himself for the country back then.

254
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:51,540
So, why will the Fourth Prince be so hostile towards Prince of Bo?

255
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,519
That is...

256
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:04,820
Youzhen's demon.

257
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:09,019
It was the last time I sent Youyu to attack Jin.

258
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:11,098
Why are First Brother and Third Brother still not here yet?

259
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,819
They'll definitely cross this path.
[A few years ago- Battle of Pi- Battleground]

260
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,720
This is so strange.

261
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,039
Your Highness, we sneaked here to welcome First Prince.

262
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,098
What should we do if His Majesty finds out about it?

263
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,778
What are you afraid of? My first brother will speak up for me.

264
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:31,739
But we are too close to the battlefield.

265
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm worried about your safety.

266
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,479
Don't worry. My first brother is smart and courageous.

267
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:42,480
With him here, our enemies will tremble in fear.

268
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:51,419
Third Brother!

269
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,940
Where is First Brother?

270
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,759
Third Brother, why did you come back alone full of blood?

271
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,258
Our assistant general betrayed us and we were ambushed by our enemies.

272
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:10,358
Our army was surrounded.

273
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,459
What?

274
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,618
What about First Brother then?

275
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,480
Where is First Brother?

276
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,280
He...

277
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,960
He insisted on bringing up the rear and asked me to bring our men back first.

278
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:26,859
Coward!

279
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:29,059
He saved you so many times.

280
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:34,379
Now, he said he was going to bring up the rear all alone in the battlefield and you really left him behind?

281
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,620
We made a pledge to live and die together.

282
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,259
How could you just save yourself?

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,358
Listen to my order. Follow me at once to save my first brother!

284
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,619
Your Highness, there are just a few of us here.

285
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:51,940
Well...

286
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,399
Fine. You don't want to come with me?

287
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,498
I'll go there myself!

288
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,179
Well... Your Highness.

289
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,459
Reconsider it, Your Highness.

290
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:07,260
First Brother.

291
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,300
I need to save First Brother.

292
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,780
After so many years, I'm still not convinced.

293
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,079
Based on his personality, he will lead his men to fight their way out.

294
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:22,979
He wouldn't stay there and wait for his death.

295
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,780
That is not my brother's style.

296
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,679
Even if my brother really ordered Prince of Bo to save himself back then,

297
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,000
I will never be his brother anymore.

298
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:41,038
It's unfortunate that His Majesty dotes on Prince of Bo.

299
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:43,540
He believes in Prince of Bo.

300
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:46,879
My father is insane.

301
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:50,138
He hands over my first brother's whole army to Prince of Bo.

302
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:54,138
If it wasn't because my first brother had trained them well, Prince of Bo would not be so invincible in battle!

303
00:19:54,138 --> 00:19:58,060
He took advantage of it and got himself the nobility title.

304
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,659
I'm so furious whenever I think about it.

305
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,180
Is there anyone who still remembers my first brother?

306
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,800
Don't worry, Your Highness. No matter what the actions of Prince of Bo were,

307
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,858
First Prince sacrificed himself for the country.

308
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,959
He'll forever be remembered as a hero, and he'll go down in history.

309
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:16,738
Sister Zhaixing.

310
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:20,799
That's right. Everybody knows about First Prince's death

311
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,759
and Prince of Bo's actions back then.

312
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:26,400
All of them say that Prince of Bo is cruel and heartless.

313
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:35,559
Looks like you are still unwell from the arrow injury.

314
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,558
Sister Zhaixing, you are so seriously wounded.

315
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:40,700
Brother Ji Chong is the one who worries about you all the way here.

316
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,740
But your husband by name doesn't even ask about you.

317
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,138
I really don't understand.

318
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:49,479
Why does my father always dote on a heartless person like him?

319
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,999
Your Highness, stop being mad at His Majesty.

320
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,858
His Majesty said that when First Prince passed away back then,

321
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:59,940
his funeral was simple because the country was at war.

322
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,060
But it'll be First Prince's death anniversary in four months' time.

323
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:08,679
His Majesty is planning to hold a grand ceremony to honor him for his contributions to the country.

324
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:11,540
You'll be the one in charge of this ceremony

325
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,220
and I am to help you with it.

326
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,900
Really?

327
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:22,639
My father has finally done something right;

328
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:25,320
or else, I'll really go back to Qitan.

329
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,000
Report!

330
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,999
Your Highness, Bo Royal Manor has sent someone to bring Commandery Princess Ma back.

331
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:36,778
Fine. I know. You are dismissed.

332
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:38,339
Yes, Your Highness.

333
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,070
[Bo Royal Manor]

334
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,018
Your Highness, I never thought that you would go through so many hardships.

335
00:21:53,018 --> 00:21:54,920
Don't spread this around.

336
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:58,638
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to make a big deal out of it.

337
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:06,977
[Bo Royal Manor]

338
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:12,339
Young Feudal Mistress.

339
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,959
Ma Jing,

340
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:18,059
I...

341
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,640
am so afraid.

342
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,900
I'm afraid that once I step into the manor,

343
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,259
I'll remember his kiss,

344
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:31,380
about him calling me Xing'er,

345
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:37,520
about him comforting me like Wolf Boy.

346
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm even more afraid to remember that when I was mad at him and Bao Na,

347
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,059
he appeared suddenly and forced me to pierce his heart with an arrow.

348
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,740
Shoot the heart.

349
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,580
I don't know how to face the perfumed sachet

350
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:00,780
that he hung up in my room.

351
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:09,360
Listen to me.

352
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,420
He did those because he was temporarily seduced by you.

353
00:23:16,459 --> 00:23:18,499
This is so unfair.

354
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,340
This is a mistake for him,

355
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,079
but I've fallen in love with him.

356
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,580
You haven't known him for very long anyway.

357
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,900
Just forget about him.

358
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,760
What is it? Are you feeling unwell?

359
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,558
Master, Ma Jing went to bring Princess Ma back.

360
00:24:03,558 --> 00:24:07,358
Maybe something has held them up. Do you want me to check on them?

361
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,259
No need to do that.

362
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:11,338
She was right outside the manor for a while.

363
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,319
She has entered the manor now.

364
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:18,780
Wen Yan, Commandery Princess Ma was seriously wounded from that arrow.

365
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,059
Make sure to take care of her well,

366
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,439
no matter how expensive or rare the medicine is.

367
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,419
Understand?

368
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,499
Yes, Master.

369
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,200
Master, Commandery Princess Ma is here.

370
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,499
Your Highness, be careful.

371
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:51,260
Did you catch a cold because it was too windy outside?

372
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,720
You know that it's windy and she has yet to recover,

373
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,840
why did you let her stand outside for so long?

374
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,999
Your Highness, I was being inconsiderate.

375
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:06,161
But how do you know that we were standing outside for a long time?

376
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:12,240
Do I have to inform you about everything that my servants report to me?

377
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,279
Of course not.

378
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,859
But there's no need to blame Ma Jing for this.

379
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:22,300
I was the one who asked her to stay outside with me for a while.

380
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:27,739
I just wanted to clear my mind with the cold breeze.

381
00:25:27,739 --> 00:25:31,059
If your mind is clear now, go back and rest well.

382
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:33,619
I don't like to look at a sickly face.

383
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:40,579
Your Highness...

384
00:25:45,379 --> 00:25:50,380
I'll do as you say and not let you see my sickly face again.

385
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,720
Just now, Fourth Prince invited me to stay for a while in his manor.

386
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,798
His Majesty also hopes that I can spend more time with Fourth Prince, too.

387
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:04,220
So, I've decided to leave tonight.

388
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:13,820
I think you want to leave Bo Royal Manor

389
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,980
because you don't want to see me.

390
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,480
Or else, why would you linger outside?

391
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,940
Get me my Fang Sword.

392
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,640
Your Highness, this is my fault.

393
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,800
If you want to kill someone, kill me.

394
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,159
Commandery Princess Ma, for the next three months,

395
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:49,139
I'll be staying at the Ministry of War to discuss war strategies against Jin.

396
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:54,539
So, don't worry. You won't see me in this manor.

397
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:04,799
This is the Bo Royal Manor. I'm the one who should leave.

398
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,999
You're the Commandery Princess of the Ma troops. You are my father's important guest.

399
00:27:11,999 --> 00:27:15,899
You are the future Princess Consort Bo. How can I treat you badly?

400
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:19,540
Wen Yan, take good care of our honored guest.

401
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,378
[Bo Royal Manor]

402
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:56,320
Wen Yan.

403
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,719
What happened?

404
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,338
Come.

405
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:01,939
Be gentle.

406
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,238
- Hai Die!
- Hai Die.

407
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:05,319
Get me my medical kit.

408
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,219
Hurry up. Bring him the best one.

409
00:29:07,219 --> 00:29:09,379
Slow down.

410
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,780
Why are you like this again?

411
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:19,699
Do you think that I want to be like this?

412
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:24,359
Ever since our master left Bo Royal Manor a few days ago, he trains with me every day.

413
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:29,359
And he gets more and more vicious and unforgiving.

414
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,239
It must be hard on you.

415
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,719
This is so unfair to me.

416
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:39,179
What I mean is, it must be hard on him and Commandery Princess Ma.

417
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:50,200
For the past few days, besides training himself and the soldiers, he does nothing else.

418
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,899
He doesn't even eat much.

419
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,420
But he drinks more and more every day.

420
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:03,820
Sometimes, I feel bad for him when I see him like this.

421
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,120
Same with Commandery Princess Ma, too.

422
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,998
Although she looks like she's busy about First Prince's death anniversary in four months,

423
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:15,840
actually, Ma Jing told me in secret that she's using this as an excuse to avoid Master.

424
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,659
But don't forget it.

425
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:23,459
Master is the one who broke the red thread between him and Commandery Princess Ma.

426
00:30:23,459 --> 00:30:26,459
But I object.

427
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:31,639
What I want to say next is not spoken out of fear to train with him.

428
00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:35,920
I really think that he is afraid.

429
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,379
He's afraid that people will one day find out what we did at Ma Manor.

430
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,579
That's why he is staying away from her.

431
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:47,019
Or else, he and Commandery Princess Ma would be a match made in heaven.

432
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,738
I just feel that it's unfair to him.

433
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:50,960
That's right.

434
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,058
Since he's so lovesick now, I think we should at least let him see Commandery Princess.

435
00:30:57,058 --> 00:30:58,859
At least...

436
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:02,700
At least, he can feel better.

437
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,280
Then, it won't be so hard on you, too, Mo Xiao.

438
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,050
You have a plan?

439
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,240
I do.

440
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:25,239
First Brother, these are the best northwest pears that father has sent to me.

441
00:31:27,339 --> 00:31:29,259
You can eat them first.

442
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,880
Brother Ji Chong,

443
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,100
did you go to find Sister Zhaixing again?

444
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,380
To be honest, compared to Prince of Bo,

445
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,138
I hope that Sister Zhaixing can one day be married to you.

446
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:52,219
I'm sincere about it.

447
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,878
For the past few days, Prince of Bo hasn't been in the manor and you've gone there every day.

448
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:02,140
Did you make any progress?

449
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,240
What progress?

450
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,039
Sister Zhaixing is running around the capital for your First Brother's death anniversary.

451
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,738
She is putting so much effort into it!

452
00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:18,040
She is too busy to think about anything else.

453
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,479
Sister Zhaixing really puts her heart into it.

454
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,839
During this time, I want to do something for my first brother, too.

455
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,400
Your First Brother's Dragon Tongue Sword is too hard to find.

456
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,020
Zhaixing did everything she could think of.

457
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,039
Back then, after my brother passed away,

458
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,580
this Dragon Tongue Sword was gone from the battlefield.

459
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,059
If it wasn't because of Prince of Bo who left him to die,

460
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,579
my first brother would still be alive and the sword would still be here.

461
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:07,459
Your Highness, to be honest,

462
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:13,720
I think your first brother will want to see you living a good life first.

463
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,899
Right?

464
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,580
But I have to make my third brother's life miserable first.

465
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,679
By the way, Brother Ji Chong. How're your archery skills?

466
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,659
Of course, I'm the best.

467
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,000
You are that good?

468
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,178
If that's the case, can you bring Sister Zhaixing and I to the East Market?

469
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:38,500
I heard that there's a new game in the East Market. It's a challenge set for archers.

470
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:43,538
If you are really the best archer, why don't you show off in front of Sister Zhaixing and me?

471
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:48,298
Maybe then, you can cheer Sister Zhaixing up and she'll forget about Prince of Bo.

472
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:57,139
Master, I have a report for you.

473
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,719
Lately, Mo Xiao made a shooting bet with a certain Mr. Xiao in the market.

474
00:35:01,719 --> 00:35:04,039
He lost a lot of money.

475
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:07,419
If he lost, he should practice harder.

476
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:08,458
Of course.

477
00:35:08,459 --> 00:35:12,738
But that Mr. Xiao has thought of even more tricky challenges

478
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:16,159
to attract the best of the best archers to step forward and accept his challenge.

479
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,379
I was thinking that you are very appreciative of great talents.

480
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,580
So...

481
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,839
Real talent is hard to find.

482
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,760
Although he's in a market, he might still be a hidden gem.

483
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,419
Let's go and check him out.

484
00:35:36,939 --> 00:35:40,519
By the way, he's always looking out for talents.

485
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,640
This bait is really effective.

486
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,100
But what about Commandery Princess Ma?

487
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:48,878
Don't worry. Ma Jing already told me about it.

488
00:35:48,878 --> 00:35:52,339
Commandery Princess Ma and Ji Chong will definitely go to the East Market today.

489
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,399
East Market is not that big. They'll definitely run into each other.

490
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:55,258
Whenever Princess Ma sees a butterfly, she'll think of Wolf Boy

491
00:36:55,259 --> 00:36:57,800
and she'll be especially happy.

492
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,819
But I think it's not right to be so happy.

493
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:06,040
How can the two of them look so alike?

494
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,898
Wait. Who are you talking about?

495
00:37:10,898 --> 00:37:12,760
Don't you know?

496
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,159
Wolf Boy and Prince of Bo look exactly the same.

497
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:19,059
When Commandery Princess Ma first saw Prince of Bo, she was shocked.

498
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,019
She thought he was Wolf Boy. It's true.

499
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,799
Now I know.

500
00:37:26,799 --> 00:37:28,860
Now I know!

501
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,939
Now he knows?

502
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,820
What are you looking at?

503
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,839
I couldn't figure it out before this.

504
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,939
Why are you so loyal to Prince of Bo although he treats you so badly?

505
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:56,660
So, the answer is Wolf Boy.

506
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:04,559
You miss Wolf Boy too much.

507
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,819
Moreover, you were not in your right mind when you first met Prince of Bo

508
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,779
and you were in extreme danger.

509
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,460
Not only did you mistake Prince of Bo for Wolf Boy,

510
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:18,100
you moved all of your feelings towards Wolf Boy onto Prince of Bo.

511
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,159
After that, when you were spending time with Prince of Bo,

512
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:30,239
you must have been looking for Wolf Boy's shadow on Prince of Bo without realizing it.

513
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,099
In other words, whenever Prince of Bo acted just a little bit like Wolf Boy,

514
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,519
you would be moved by him.

515
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:46,139
Although you are ugly,

516
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:48,278
you are ugly like him.

517
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:51,119
Wolf Boy is only nice towards me

518
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,140
and he's very loyal.

519
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,539
I am the only one for him.

520
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:57,320
No one else.

00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:01,559
Xing'er.

522
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:05,380
I know that you were just trying to comfort me.

523
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:11,619
But I was in a trance and thought that it was Wolf Boy forgiving me.

524
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,460
I've never thought about what you said just now.

525
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,059
To be frank, you think that you have feelings towards Prince of Bo.

526
00:39:23,059 --> 00:39:30,540
But you are just transferring your feelings for Wolf Boy to Prince of Bo without realizing it.

527

Ji Chong, go and chase down the thief for Ma Jing.

All of our expenses for today are in there.

531

532
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,639
Go now.

533
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,459
Hurry up.

534
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:58,279
Thief!

535
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:03,060
Did someone see the thief who stole my money?

It's not hard to hit the bullseye, right?

00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,380
Of course, I have some rules.

for you to win this valuable jade butterfly.

Ask your lover to get this jade butterfly for you.

This is not for sale.
