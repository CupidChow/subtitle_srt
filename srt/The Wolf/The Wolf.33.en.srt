♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,100
[Episode 33]

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,200
I've got proof.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,600
This woman is...

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,200
This is indeed the portrait that I once saw Chu Zhen drawing.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,600
But the woman in the portrait is clearly Ma Zhaixing.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
They do look similar.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
However, she's not Ma Zhaixing,

27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,000
but Princess Pingyuan who was only 18 years old at that time.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,900
The woman in the portrait is General Ma Ying's second wife.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Princess Pingyuan?

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,000
But why does she look exactly like my mother?

31
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,800
Back then, General Ma Ying felt sorry for her.

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
So, he took the risk and rescued the pregnant princess of the previous dynasty.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The baby girl born afterward was you.

34
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
This is utter nonsense.

35
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
There're many similar-looking people in this world.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
It's just a coincidence.

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Bring the man here!

38
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Princess Pingyuan?

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,000
You...

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,600
Your Majesty, do you still remember the court painter, Chu Zhen?

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,900
Lord Bo asked Mo Xiao to bring him here,

42
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,400
but I intercepted them in midway.

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,100
It's impossible that he can be an impostor.

44
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,400
Although Chu Zhen once drew a portrait for Princess Pingyuan,

45
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,200
he has never met the princess's daughter.

46
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,000
Even if you brought him here to appear before me,

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,300
it wouldn't make any difference.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,600
While I was in the imperial court,

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,300
I heard that General Ma Ying owed his entire career to Lord Wen.

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,700
Even though they served different masters,

51
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,600
they were still in contact.

52
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,500
After Chu Kui massacred the royals,

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,200
he couldn't find the princess's dead body.

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,200
It's highly likely that General Ma Ying had given shelter to Princess Pingyuan.

55
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
These are pure conjectures.

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,600
It can be a pure coincidence that they look similar.

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
It can be another coincidence that both of them like usnea herb.

58
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
However, if Ma Zhaixing has the relic of the previous dynasty,

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,200
the tricolor clapper stone,

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,600
it can't be mere coincidence. Right?

61
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,400
In order to manifest the status of royals, the late emperor of the previous dynasty

62
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,100
ordered a sophisticated hermit to craft a unique Water Moon Jade.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,400
The jade has three colors: green, white and black.

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
They look unattractive from the outside.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,200
But when they're thrown into the water, they shine in all their splendor.

66
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,600
Ma Zhaixing,

67
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,000
if you have the pledge of the previous dynasty, Water Moon Jade,

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll acknowledge your identity as Princess Pingyuan's daughter.

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Zhaixing, take it out.

70
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
I... don't have it!

71
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,200
Your Majesty, Zhaixing surely has it.

72
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,700
Where is your bronze bell?

73
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,400
Isn't that the only thing left by your mother?

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,100
Bronze bell?

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Princess Pingyuan's tricolor bracelet in the portrait

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,200
looks exactly like the black clapper stone you gave me.

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,300
So, I guess your mother must've put the Water Moon Jade in the bronze bell to protect you.

78
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Hurry! Go fetch some water!

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,400
You do it.

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,900
It appears Sister Zhaixing is really a princess.

81
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,900
You're really...

82
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,300
You're really my benefactor, Princess Pingyuan's daughter!

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,400
I almost made a grave mistake just now!

84
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,200
Forgive me, Your Highness!

85
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,400
- I, Ji Chong, pay respect to Your Highness.
- I pay respect to Your Highness.

86
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
Your Majesty. Your Highness. Please get up!

87
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,700
It's too burdensome for me.

88
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,800
Sister Zhaixing, this is so amazing!

89
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,000
In such a short time, you've turned from prisoner to princess.

90
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,900
Ji Chong, you're really something!

91
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,700
Ji Chong, if it wasn't because of you,

92
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,000
perhaps I would never have known the truth of my identity.

93
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,000
Thank you.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,500
Brother,

95
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,000
you must not set yourself against the princess!

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,600
Or else, you would've wronged your benefactor!

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,900
Lord Bo, Ma Zhaixing is the daughter of my benefactor.

98
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,600
She has sought refugee with Jin,

99
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,100
but now you want to borrow troops to make war with Jin.

100
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,100
This... I can't bite the hand that feeds me.

101
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Since Your Majesty has acknowledged the identity of the princess from the previous dynasty in front of me,

102
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,900
whether it be personally or politically, Your Majesty and I will be going along different paths from each other.

103
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,500
The alliance treaty has become a piece of waste paper.

104
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,600
Even if I can't borrow your troops, it's just a matter of time before I defeat Jin.

105
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,600
Lord Bo, I'm wrong for breaking the treaty.

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,900
I promise if there's a day where Jin and you are at war,

107
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,400
I won't assist any one of you.

108
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,500
I hope you can keep your promise.

109
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,400
You finally have the right to fight neck and neck with me.

110
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,300
I am the royal princess of the previous dynasty.

111
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:08,200
But you are just an unidentified wolf raised by the villain, Chu Kui.

112
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,700
What gives you the right to fight neck and neck with me?

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,400
You assassinated Ma Mansion where I was raised,

114
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,000
while Chu Kui massacred the country where I was born.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,900
These unfair behaviors are despised by the world.

116
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,600
Heaven's watching.

117
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,300
The last descendant of the previous dynasty is still alive.

118
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,600
Now that I've survived,

119
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,400
I'll no longer be the softhearted Ma Zhaixing I used to be.

120
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,300
I hope the new Ma Zhaixing is more than just a paper tiger.

121
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,000
Since you're the princess of the previous dynasty who shouldn't even exist,

122
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
then I'll definitely personally take away your life on the battlefield.

123
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,900
Darn it!

124
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Ji Chong is so lucky!

125
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,800
He actually revealed Ma Zhaixing's true identity as the princess of the previous dynasty!

126
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
This is truly unexpected!

127
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
At this rate, it'll surely raise the morale of the Jin Troops!

128
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,600
Master, how about we...

129
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,200
kill Ma Zhaixing on their way...

130
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,539
back to Jin!

131
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,578
Do not act rashly!

132
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:52,539
Why?

133
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,138
The king has said that he'll escort Ma Zhaixing safely back to Jin.

134
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,539
Then, he won't assist any one of us.

135
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,659
If you hastily assassinate her now, they might gang up on us.

136
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,299
- At that time...
- So we just have to let her go?

137
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,000
We must look at the big picture!

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,400
- How did I...
- What Hai Die said is true.

139
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,500
The main concern now is Youzhen's well-being.

140
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,600
Your Highness, Fourth Prince's arrow wound isn't serious.

141
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I've diagnosed him and his pulse is relatively stable.

142
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
The wound isn't life-threatening.

143
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,100
You can rest assured, Your Highness.

144
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
If there's nothing serious,

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,300
why is there no indication that he'll wake up?

146
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Your Highness, the poor blood circulation in Fourth Prince's body has resulted in

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,900
slow blood flow to all parts of the body.

148
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,800
He'll only wake up after a few days.

149
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,200
I suggest returning to the palace as soon as possible

150
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,600
as blood flows well in warm temperatures and coagulates in low temperatures.

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,400
The current weather in our country is warmer and much more pleasant than here.

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,800
Do what the imperial physician said.

153
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,600
Hai Die, pass on my order.

154
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,800
We'll return to the palace immediately.

155
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,000
Sister Zhaizing, are you okay?

156
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
How is Youzhen doing?

157
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,600
He's fine. They've already departed.

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,200
You should stop blaming yourself.

159
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,200
Although I hate Lord Bo to the core,

160
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,600
I regret that I accidentally injured the innocent Youzhen.

161
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
I hope he'll recover soon.

162
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,600
Bao Na,

163
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,400
do you blame me for not telling you about Liu Xin?

164
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I forgot that I should be mad at you.

165
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,300
If you had let me know earlier that Princess Pingyuan was a fake,

166
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,600
I wouldn't have been so panicky in front of my brother.

167
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,800
Do you not blame me at all?

168
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
If I were you,

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,400
I would do whatever is necessary to bring down Lord Bo, too.

170
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,900
I still have the chance to ask for your forgiveness,

171
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
but it's too late for me to apologize to Liu Xin

172
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
and tell her that

173
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,700
the elder princess that she'd been thinking about was actually my mother.

174
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,400
I never got a chance to ask her

175
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,300
about my biological father and my identity.

176
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,299
Don't be afraid.

177
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:14,000
When the sky gets dark, follow the plan and everything will go smoothly.

178
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Princess, it's all my fault.

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
If it wasn't because of my mistakes,

180
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
Lord Bo wouldn't have suspected anything.

181
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,100
Just like Elder Princess,

182
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
my mother can play the pipa, too.

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,300
When I was young, she taught me how to play it.

184
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,500
But I wonder if it's because I've got no talent or that I'm all thumbs,

185
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,300
I just couldn't learn it no matter how hard I tried.

186
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,900
But Mother never got mad at me.

187
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,100
I asked her if she ever blamed me.

188
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,000
Guess what she said.

189
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,400
What did she say?

190
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,000
She said that I had tried my best and that I wasn't doing it on purpose.

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,100
Besides, it made her heart ache to see me blaming myself thousands of times.

192
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
So, she didn't blame me at all.

193
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,400
It seems like your mother and Elder Princess

194
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,800
have similar temperaments and act in a similar manner.

195
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,400
There're so many coincidences.

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Elder Princess was pregnant at that time.

197
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,800
I wonder if she'd given birth to a prince or a princess.

198
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,200
If the baby had the chance to grow up,

199
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,500
both of you would be of the same age.

200
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,600
Although I've never met Princess Pingyuan,

201
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,300
somehow I feel an odd sense of familiarity as I listened to what you have said.

202
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,400
I was told that they didn't find

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,200
the dead body of Elder Princess in the Wen Manor.

204
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,400
So, I sought shelter from the King of Jin

205
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,400
and requested him to locate Elder Princess's whereabouts.

206
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,700
But in all these years, there had never been any news of her.

207
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,400
Later on, the King of Jin asked me to pretend to be Elder Princess

208
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,800
so that they would stop asking him to make himself king.

209
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,000
It wasn't what he wanted.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,400
Princess, please don't misunderstand the King of Jin.

211
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,200
I know.

212
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
Princess,

213
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm not afraid of death,

214
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,300
but I couldn't die in peace before

215
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,000
I'd found Elder Princess.

216
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,400
Liu Xin,

217
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,200
forgive me for I'm not going to bring you back to Taiyuan.

218
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,600
There's no hatred and resentment here.

219
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,200
You'll have nothing but radiant sunlight with you.

220
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,400
Rest in peace.

221
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,600
If she hadn't acted hastily and run away,

222
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,400
perhaps these would not have happened.

223
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
It's all my fault.

224
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,000
If I had come back earlier,

225
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,800
Liu Xin might not have died.

226
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm the one to blame.

227
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I shouldn't have let her go.

228
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,300
None of you are at fault.

229
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,600
I'm the one who's wrong.

230
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
My biological and foster fathers

231
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,800
were both murdered by Chu Kui,

232
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,900
and yet I still pledged loyalty to Chu Kui, that brigand.

233
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,800
I even foolishly fell in love with Lord Bo.

234
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,500
Sister Zhaixing, that's enough! Just drop it!

235
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,000
This isn't your fault.

236
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,600
Stop blaming yourself!

237
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Feudal Master had always treated you like his own daughter.

238
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,600
As he watched you from Heaven, he wouldn't want you to be so hard on yourself.

239
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,800
Only now do I understand

240
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,300
what Mother said to Father before she died.

241
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,000
She wanted Father to take an oath that

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
no matter what happens,

243
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,800
he would never let me leave the Ma Manor.

244
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,400
She wanted me to live my life like an ordinary girl.

245
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,200
Mother,

246
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,900
forgive me for my ignorance.

247
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I knew nothing about the sorrow in your heart.

248
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,000
You chose to live in degradation to protect Imperial Father's bloodline.

249
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,800
You watched Chu Kui as he was seated merrily upon the throne.

250
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,300
It must've torn your heart to pieces.

251
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,900
Now, I finally understand Father's unfinished words.

252
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,000
The daughter of a king.

253
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
He was talking about my identity.

254
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,600
- Sister Zhaixing...
- Bao Na.

255
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,700
Lord Bo,

256
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,000
someday I'll see you on the battlefield.

257
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,140
[Taiyuan City, Jin]

258
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,200
You must've known what was happening and had a round of discussion.

259
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,500
According to the letter I received from the army,

260
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,800
we're going to greet the return of the princess of the previous dynasty.

261
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,800
We shall swear allegiance to Ma Zhaixing.

262
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,100
Father, with all due respect,

263
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,600
I refuse to obey.

264
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,800
I believe the civil officials, military officials, and Six Armies will refuse to obey as well.

265
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Ma Zhaixing is a descendant of the previous dynasty.

266
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,400
Our family owes a debt of gratitude to the previous dynasty for centuries.

267
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Besides, Chu Kui's alliance treaty had failed all because of her.

268
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
She has rendered great service to us.

269
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Indeed.

270
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,300
Even though she's of the royal bloodline, let's put aside the doubt about

271
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,100
her capability to rule Jin and talk about this trip.

272
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,600
If Ju Yao didn't prove her identity as the princess of the previous dynasty,

273
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,200
she would've been killed by Lord Bo long ago.

274
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,100
To put it bluntly, she's just lucky enough to reap where she has not sown.

275
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,900
That's right. The full credit shall go to Lord Chuan instead.
[Zhou Hai: Assistant General of Jin's Six Armies]

276
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,500
We won't accept Ma Zhaixng!

277
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,100
That's right! We refuse to obey! We refuse to obey!

278
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,600
How could we entrust her with such important errands?

279
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,800
Yes.

280
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,500
Have some water.

281
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,600
We've 20 li to go before we reach Taiyuan.

282
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Princess,

283
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,900
when we return, the King of Jin will surely make a grand gesture to welcome the princess of the previous dynasty.

284
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,100
It's not necessarily a good thing to return to Jin

285
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,500
as the princess of the previous dynasty.

286
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,800
Then... what do you mean?

287
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,600
Do you really think a mere woman

288
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,400
can make the officials and generals of the Six Armies in Jin

289
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,100
willingly swear allegiance to the princess of the previous dynasty who popped up out of nowhere?

290
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,800
After all,

291
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,600
the King of Jin is indebted to the previous dynasty and not me, Ma Zhaixing.

292
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,100
The old man might truly be loyal before

293
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,800
but now his loyalty might be swallowed up in power.

294
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:23,360
Ma Zhaixing, as the princess of the previous dynasty,

295
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,419
you've such a bleak future.

296
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,280
Don't worry, I've got a solution.

297
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,420
What's that?

298
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,399
You'll know later.

299
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,720
I've counted the days.

300
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:43,621
Lord Bo should've reached our enemy country now.

301
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:46,739
The emperor must be

302
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:51,619
so infuriated after hearing the bad news of the failure to borrow troops.

303
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,540
I pay respect to Your Majesty.

304
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:04,839
- Imperial Father, I...
- Shut up!

305
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,020
I don't want to see you right now!

306
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,579
Youzhen!

307
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,319
My own son!

308
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:15,919
Youzhen! Youzhen!

309
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:20,279
Imperial physician! Hurry up! Diagnose my son!

310
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:29,180
Third Prince, don't take it personally.

311
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,599
Once His Majesty knew that Fourth Prince was injured,

312
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,679
he ordered everyone in the Imperial Hospital to stand by since morning.

313
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,959
Third Prince, please have regard to His Majesty's feelings of worry.

314
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,819
It's my fault.

315
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:47,159
I failed to protect Fourth Brother.

316
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:56,620
How's he doing?

317
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,439
Tell me!

318
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,179
Your Majesty, we're incompetent.

319
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,879
We couldn't find the cause.

320
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,378
- Please forgive us, Your Majesty.
- Get lost!

321
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,800
Zhen'er.

322
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,699
Imperial Father, I know someone who can save Fourth Brother.

323
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,260
What are you waiting for? Get him here!

324
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,879
I need Your Majesty's oral decree to bring that person here.

325
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:20,679
Go!

326
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,939
Tell him I want him here!

327
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,340
Yes.

328
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,179
Youzhen!

329
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,880
Youzhen!

330
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,439
Master, Lord Bo has returned to the palace.

331
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:39,440
I've heard that Fourth Prince was severely injured and His Majesty is infuriated.

332
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,819
Fourth Prince was injured?

333
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,200
What about Lord Bo?

334
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,059
Did he get hurt, too?

335
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,700
Master, do you want Lord Bo to get hurt or not?

336
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,079
Of course, I want him to get hurt!

337
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,679
I'll be so happy if Lord Bo gets hurt.

338
00:24:57,679 --> 00:24:59,879
I've disappointed you.

339
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,700
You're Lord Bo, yet you condescended to come to the dungeon.

340
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,339
I believe the imperial physicians must be helpless in the face of Fourth Prince's injury.

341
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:25,080
I'm begging you to put aside our old scores.

342
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,339
Can you save my fourth brother?

343
00:25:29,459 --> 00:25:35,020
This is my first time seeing Lord Bo groveling and begging.

344
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:41,980
It seems like you truly put Fourth Prince's life before yourself.

345
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,439
If you can cure Fourth Brother,

346
00:25:44,439 --> 00:25:48,039
I'll let you have whatever you want.

347
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,999
It sounds familiar.

348
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,539
Now I remember.

349
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,358
When you wanted me to save Ma Zhaixing before,

350
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:02,020
you said the exact same thing.

351
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,258
What do you want me to do?

352
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,700
You've got to kneel down to my master, apologize, beg, and plead with her.

353
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:11,839
My master was imprisoned twice in this loathsome dungeon because of you.

354
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,620
Shouldn't Lord Bo at least show some sincerity?

355
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:20,859
Never mind.

356
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,499
If I can't cure Fourth Prince later,

357
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm afraid Lord Bo might blame me for that.

358
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,059
At that time, His Majesty won't be punishing Lord Bo,

359
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,100
but me instead.

360
00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:46,859
I'll go with you.

361
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:55,199
Master, Fourth Prince is awake.

362
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,600
Imperial Father, didn't Fourth Brother wake up already?

363
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,518
Take a look yourself. Is he awake?

364
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:21,379
Or is he more dead than alive? He doesn't respond at all!

365
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:24,579
Yao Ji, take a look at him.

366
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,119
Yes.

367
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,080
How is it?

368
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,659
When will Zhen'er wake up?

369
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,899
Your Majesty,

370
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,858
Fourth Prince's breath and blood circulation are working well,

371
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,059
but he won't wake up.

372
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,459
I'm afraid he's suffering from a rare disease known as stupor.

373
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,480
What's stupor?

374
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:15,040
I've seen a Soul Separation Syndrome case before. Are they similar?

375
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:19,200
It's possible to cure Soul Separation Syndrome by relying on external stimuli.

376
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,240
However, stupor is different.

377
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,659
Stuporose patients are like rigid wood.

378
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,759
They're mute and insensible.

379
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,739
They cannot hear people talking.

380
00:28:29,739 --> 00:28:33,239
They have to rely on others to move them around and feed them.

381
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,440
A few days ago, he was still unconscious.

382
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,299
But now, he can open his eyes.

383
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Does that mean he's getting better?

384
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,280
It seems like he has opened his eyes,

385
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,959
but it's totally meaningless for a stuporous patient.

386
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:57,179
Stuporose patients are unresponsive to stimulation

387
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,639
and remain insensible forever.

388
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:06,019
You've found the root cause.

389
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,059
Can you prescribe the right medicine for the illness?

390
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,019
Stuporose patients are incurable.

391
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,380
They have to wake up on their own,

392
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,579
but it's uncertain how long it'll take.

393
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,260
It could be 10 days,

394
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:19,899
one month, or...

395
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,181
some people never ever regain consciousness.

396
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,080
Imperial Father...

397
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,560
Why did I even raise you?

398
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,679
It's all your fault that my own son has become a living dead!

399
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,539
Why aren't you the one lying half dead here?

400
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,559
Why?

401
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,899
Your Majesty, it's what it is now.

402
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,680
Lord Bo couldn't have foreseen what happened.

403
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,799
It's my fault.

404
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:00,219
Your guilt is far greater than this!

405
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,760
You failed to borrow the troops

406
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,800
and offered a chance for Ma Zhaixing to hurt Zhen'er!

407
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,259
I'm asking you...

408
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:12,200
Why didn't you kill Ma Zhaixing and avenge Zhen'er?

409
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,020
Or else,

410
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,878
she wouldn't have revealed her identity as a princess of the previous dynasty!

411
00:30:16,878 --> 00:30:20,258
Do you still have feelings for Ma Zhaixing?

412
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:22,059
Did you intend to cover up for her?

413
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:24,319
I've no such intentions.

414
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:26,239
Please believe me, Imperial Father.

415
00:30:26,239 --> 00:30:29,100
Your Majesty, Lord Bo had already succeeded

416
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,458
and it wasn't long before we could catch Ma Zhaixing alive.

417
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:38,141
But... But the King of Qitan suddenly found out Ma Zhaixing's identity and protected her.

418
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:42,540
That was why Lord Bo missed the opportunity to take Ma Zhaixing into custody.

419
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,919
At that time, if we did take down Ma Zhaixing,

420
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,760
Lord Bo and Fourth Prince might not even have been able to return.

421
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,119
Even if you didn't betray me,

422
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,138
you've failed me anyway.

423
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:58,618
I'm willing to receive punishment.

424
00:30:58,619 --> 00:30:59,959
Punishment?

425
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,059
You were raised by wolves!

426
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,858
For you, suffering in the flesh won't cause you any pain at all!

427
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:08,480
It can't ease the hatred in my heart!

428
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:15,320
If the whip is soaked in the Wolfbone Flower before flagellation,

429
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,759
will it soothe your anger?

430
00:31:18,379 --> 00:31:21,359
Your Majesty, you mustn't do that!

431
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,718
- Please think twice about it!
- Shut up!

432
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:29,400
Whoever pleads for Lord Bo will be punished together!

433
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,959
Lord Bo, I want you to remember that

434
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:39,520
your mistake has resulted in this catastrophe.

435
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,700
Yao Ji, prepare the whip.

436
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,520
You'll execute the sanction.

437
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,000
I'll do as instructed.

438
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,659
Guards,

439
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:53,159
take down Lord Bo!

440
00:32:05,739 --> 00:32:07,339
Get lost!

441
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:08,920
Yes.

442
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,460
Youzhen.

443
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:29,980
Youzhen, you...

444
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,440
Tables have turned in an instant.

445
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,879
I was still held up in the dungeon a moment ago,

446
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,219
but now it's your turn.

447
00:32:56,499 --> 00:32:58,579
Kings and bears often worry about their keepers.

448
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,059
Even if you're a prince, you're nothing compared to his own son.

449
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:04,919
You're just the same as me.

450
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,899
Our lives mean nothing.

451
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,800
I made a mistake.

452
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,220
His Majesty must remain impartial and handle the matter fairly.

453
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,860
Lord Bo, you're really a good son of His Majesty.

454
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,979
Perhaps I should've listened to you.

455
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:24,339
Then, you might not have been held in the dungeon and I wouldn't have been punished now.

456
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:28,320
Do you mean killing Hong'er and her father?

457
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,259
Didn't you say that it's a curse that Zhaixing and I were in love?

458
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,920
If I had killed her earlier,

459
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,300
Fourth Brother wouldn't have had to suffer and become a living dead.

460
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:49,999
Why did you ask for the flagellation?

461
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,600
You hate flagellation and the Wolfbone Flower the most.

462
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,559
You hate that these things will trample on your pride

463
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,098
and turn you into a beast despised by others.

464
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:05,080
Because it'll make me remember that my love for Ma Zhaixing is wrong,

465
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,680
and it has made me pay dearly.

466
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:14,480
If only you knew then what you know now.

467
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,580
Be ready for my whip.

468
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,960
That's what keeps me going.

469
00:34:31,899 --> 00:34:38,239
Master, the whip has been soaked repeatedly in the juice of the Wolfbone Flower.

470
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,520
I can assure you that the whip is thoroughly soaked.

471
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,359
You're really dedicated.

472
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:50,320
This show is even better than just seeing Lord Bo kneel down,

473
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,019
how can I miss it?

474
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,780
Master, why are you giving me this look?

475
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,720
What look?

476
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,579
You seem unwilling to see Lord Bo get hit.

477
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,219
Nonsense!

478
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:13,319
Even His Majesty is okay with it, why would I be unwilling?

479
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:17,320
His Majesty has arrived.

480
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,258
Greetings, Your Majesty.

481
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,860
Get up.

482
00:35:50,739 --> 00:35:52,499
Execute the punishment.

483
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,779
Pass on my order.

484
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,099
Lord Bo is grounded in his manor for reflection.

485
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,979
Nobody can see him without my permission!

486
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,080
Your Majesty, with all due respect,

487
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,299
the news of the failure to borrow troops and Ma Ying harboring the princess of the previous dynasty have spread through the court.

488
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:31,700
I fear the news of Lord Bo being grounded will result in panic among the officials.

489
00:36:32,499 --> 00:36:34,340
Ma Zhaixing...

490
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:42,040
is just a dreg that I've yet to exterminate.

491
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,218
She's hardly worth mentioning.

492
00:36:43,219 --> 00:36:44,859
Indeed, Your Majesty.

493
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,260
I'm simply being paranoid.

494
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:52,760
However, I do need a victorious battle to

495
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,639
inflict heavy losses on Jin before they enhance their prestige

496
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,620
by introducing the princess of the previous dynasty to the world.

497
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,399
- Colonel Yang.
- Yes.

498
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:04,139
Pass on my military order immediately.

499
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,278
Summon the marquises from all the states to appear before me with their troops.

500
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:13,319
I want Lord Bo to personally command the army and strike

501
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:15,539
a death blow to Jin.

502
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

503
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,010
Also, Wang Rong from Zhenzhou

504
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,810
and Han Qing from Luzhou are near to Taiyuan.

505
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:24,998
They know the topography very well.

506
00:37:24,998 --> 00:37:28,259
I want them to enter the palace and discuss it with me as soon as they can.

507
00:37:28,259 --> 00:37:29,299
I understand.

508
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,200
I'll instantly send messengers to inform the marquises from all the states.

509
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,339
I will excuse myself.

510
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,458
Hurry up!

511
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:35,759
Yes.

512
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,679
Your Majesty, Lord Bo's badly wounded now.

513
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,620
What shall we do?

514
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,778
Yao Ji will help heal his wounds. He'll be fine.

515
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:55,059
I want to teach him a lesson

516
00:37:55,059 --> 00:38:00,179
so that he'll know that I'm the one who grants him his life.

517
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,420
I once defeated the previous dynasty.

518
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:13,619
Now I'll continue to defeat Jin even if they have the princess of the previous dynasty.

519
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,399
The princess has arrived.

520
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:29,658
I, together with my son and the generals of Six Armies,

521
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,760
have been expecting the princess to return.

522
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:36,258
Your Highness, you've had a long journey.

523
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:37,859
That must be tiring.

524
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,559
King of Jin, please forgo formality.

525
00:38:41,179 --> 00:38:42,779
After this,

526
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,019
I hope you'll call me Zhaixing, just like before.

527
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:52,039
I really can't get used to being called Princess or Your Highness.

528
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,099
It's fine if the princess is not used to it,

529
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,520
but someone else has to get used to it.

530
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,380
Ji Chong.

531
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:10,459
Since Your Highness has ordered so, I'll do as instructed.

532
00:39:10,459 --> 00:39:14,440
I've had the throne ready for Your Highness.

533
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:17,159
Please.

534
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,760
As expected, the chair doesn't suit me.

535
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:27,659
Although I managed to return safely,

536
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,920
thanks to God and Lord Chuan for his help,

537
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,399
I've let you down, King of Jin.

538
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,659
I know I'm not competent enough to be the chief marshal of the Ma Troop.

539
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:44,600
Hence, I'll hand over the military seal and power of the Ma Troop.

540
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,080
Your Highness, why so sudden?

541
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,960
As the princess of the previous dynasty,

542
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,319
I shall look at the big picture.

543
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,199
I'm not good at leading an army into battle

544
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,100
and so it's best for me to rely on the King of Jin.

545
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,420
From now on, the Ma Troop will be under the King of Jin's command.

546
00:41:10,939 --> 00:41:14,340
If you insist.

547
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:18,340
Ju Qi, take the seal.

548
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,740
Yes.

549
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,280
Pass on my order!

550
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:34,579
Assign all the soldiers in the Ma Troop to each army group of the Jin Troop.

551
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,360
I'll do as instructed.

552
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:39,579
Your Majesty, I'll let you handle your affairs.

553
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,680
I'll excuse myself now.

554
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,898
Grand Supervisor.

555
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm here.

556
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:49,499
Escort Princess to the Tangxing Garden.

557
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:51,479
Yes.

558
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:54,020
Your Highness, let's go.

559
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,658
Princess, you're finally back!

560
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:03,978
You're actually the princess of the previous dynasty!

561
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,219
This is so amazing!

562
00:42:07,899 --> 00:42:11,040
Ma Zhaixing, how foolish are you?

563
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,178
Handing over your military power is not a solution,

564
00:42:13,179 --> 00:42:15,239
it's being at your wits' end.
