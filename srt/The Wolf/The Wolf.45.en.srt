00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,000
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,400
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,000
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,200
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,800
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,200
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,300
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,600
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,800
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,100
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,000
[Episode 45]

21
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Your Majesty, it's time for medicine.

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,700
Bring it here.

23
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,900
I'll test the medicine for Your Majesty.

24
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,200
Chuchu, do me a favor.

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
Yes.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,100
Good.

27
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Greetings, Your Majesty.

28
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,500
Greetings, Prince of Yun.

29
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,400
After seeing the Longevity Forest myself,

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,700
that is indeed a prosperous place.

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,600
It's the perfect place for our ritual.

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Well done, Grand Diviner.

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
I discussed it with my father.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,700
Since the sacrifices we're using are Lord Bo's past comrades,

35
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,300
why not use this chance to lure Lord Bo here to save them?

36
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,600
We can finish them off all at once.

37
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,000
Good.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
We'll proceed with your plan.

39
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,200
I'll leave it to you.

40
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,500
Come with me to the Longevity Forest.

41
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Yes, Father.

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
I will start preparing now.

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,500
Your Highness, please at least take some food.

44
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,600
His Majesty said the prayer ritual shouldn't be your concern.

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm not eating it!

46
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,300
If you want me to eat, then bring my brother here!

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,400
What?

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
He refused to see me?

49
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,400
He ignored my objection and insisted on serving Chu Kui!

50
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,700
Between that evil-doer and his own sister, I wasn't his priority!

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,300
Your Highness.

52
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,400
What is it? Do you have any news?

53
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,299
This is a serious matter. Much is at stake here.

54
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm headed for Jin right now!

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,400
You! Pack my belongings. We're going to Jin!

56
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
Yes.

57
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,100
I'll take the food away for you.

58
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
No!

59
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you want me to starve?

60
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,400
I won't have strength for battle without food.

61
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,800
We didn't expect you, Princess Bao Na.

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,100
I apologize for not welcoming you.

63
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,300
I'll drink to make up for it.

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,400
Same goes for me.

65
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,800
Lord Bo has sided with Jin and now you're married.

66
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
I should be celebrating the newly wedded.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But the situation is worrying.

68
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,700
Do you know Yao Ji is holding a prayer ritual for Chu Kui?

69
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,400
According to my spies, Chu Youkui will be joining.

70
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
He plans to secretly meet my brother.

71
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,900
I am worried Chu Youkui might pull off some evil plan on my brother.

72
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
We can't let this happen.

73
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,500
Which is why I rushed here to ask you to come with me and stop all of this.

74
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,000
We need to act fast.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll inform my father right away.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,900
We must stop Chu Yougui's plan.

77
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,700
Chu Youkui still has another plan for this ritual.

78
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,300
He wants to lure Lord Bo out and kill him.

79
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,200
Princess, the general is here.

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,700
General?

81
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,800
Lord Chuan. Princess.

82
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
Princess Bao Na.

83
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
I asked you to come here.

84
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,000
Wen Yan and your other comrades are about to become human sacrifices.

85
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,600
I'm sure you've been told.

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
So you do know.

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,300
Chu Youkui must have leaked the information to bait you.

88
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,400
I'll be honest with you.

89
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,800
I plan to face them alone and save the Night Fiends.

90
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,700
No!

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,900
You're the key to our whole operation.

92
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
If you get into trouble,

93
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,000
wouldn't it jeopardize everything?

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,200
You need not be worried about me.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,900
Yao Ji and I will be working together.

96
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,800
She is the only one that I promised to live and die as one.

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
I have complete trust in her.

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Right now, in order to not fall into Chu Youkui's treacherous plan,

99
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,200
the general has decided to rescue the Night Fiends on his own.

100
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,000
But at least we can stand by for help.

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,800
If you need aid, we can send backup at any time.

102
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,300
Yes, Lord Bo. Don't hesitate about this.

103
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,700
We insist on helping and we will all return in one piece.

104
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,500
[Somewhere on the way to Mu Ye Mountain, Chu Kui's base camp]

105
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Back to your work.

106
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

107
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,800
Emperor Father, the King of Qitan has asked for you.

108
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Come.

109
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,200
- Your Majesty!
- Emperor Father!

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,600
- Emperor Father!
-Your Majesty!

111
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,100
Yao Ji, check his pulse.

112
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
His Majesty's body is reacting to the ginseng soup from earlier.

113
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,300
That's why he passed out.

114
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,200
Yao Ji, help me up.

115
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,800
Yes.

116
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,400
Lord Yun.

117
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,800
Yes, Father.

118
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,600
I need you to take care of King Qing Lan.

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I need to get some rest.

120
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Emperor Father, please allow me to stay and look after you.

121
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,700
No.

122
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,200
You must go with Lord Yun.

123
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,400
- Emperor Father!
- Did you not hear what I said?

124
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,400
All of you leave!

125
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,700
I want to rest alone.

126
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
Chuchu.

128
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,800
Let me help you to the bed.

129
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,000
His Majesty is ill.

130
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,400
So where are you going?

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,000
Get out!

132
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,800
I told you I would see no one.

133
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
Your Majesty, it's me.

134
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,000
A bunch of worthless fools.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
My health is getting worse by the day.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,600
And why do I even need you anymore?

137
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,500
Your Majesty,

138
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,200
this might offend Your Majesty,

139
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
but has your sight been damaged?

140
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,800
I am not blind!

141
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,000
How would I be blind?

142
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,200
I was merely too exhausted.

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,900
Your Majesty, this is all my fault.

144
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,500
Your Majesty has fallen ill and the medication didn't help.

145
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,000
And now Your Majesty has lost your sight.

146
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,600
The cause wasn't the defeat at Boxiang.

147
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Someone meant to harm Your Majesty.

148
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,800
What did you say?

149
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,200
Bring him in.

150
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,700
Move.

151
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Your Majesty!

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,900
Your Majesty, I never meant you harm!

153
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,600
Zhang Jin? It was you?

154
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,300
Your Majesty, I was a fool!

155
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,200
It's Lord Yun who forced me to do this!

156
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
Your Majesty!

157
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,200
You bastard!

158
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Your Majesty!

159
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
Your Majesty, have mercy!

160
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,600
Your Majesty, have mercy on me!

161
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,800
Your Majesty, have mercy on me!

162
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,400
Your Majesty, please calm down.

163
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,700
Your Majesty.

164
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,000
Your Majesty, I am well aware of your anger.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,200
But if Your Majesty kills Zhang Jin now,

166
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
it will only draw Lord Yun's suspicion!

167
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,700
He might take desperate action against Your Majesty.

168
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,300
I know.

169
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,500
You're mocking me for my incapability.

170
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,600
I can't even kill this lowly eunuch.

171
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,900
How would I be capable of killing that treacherous son of mine?

172
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,200
I am as good as a dead man walking.

173
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,200
Your Majesty must take care.

174
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,300
I...

175
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,700
Am I to die by the hand of this treacherous son?

176
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,300
Your Majesty,

177
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,400
there is still hope to thwart his plan.

178
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,200
I must request for Your Majesty to spare Zhang Jin for the time being.

179
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,100
Let him atone for his crime and avoid Lord Yun's suspicion.

180
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,700
Brother, don't fall for his trick!

181
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,900
Bao Na!

182
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,900
Why have you brought the Prince and Princess of Jin here?

183
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,400
- Greetings, King.
- Greetings, King.

184
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,000
Brother, I had to bring them here.

185
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,400
Lord Yun is known to have alienated people. He is a vile man!

186
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,900
He even set me up once!

187
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Princess Bao Na, it's been a while.

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,500
I was once abducted. I almost died because of him!

189
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
- Brother.
- You...

190
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,800
Jin is not any better if you ask me!

191
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Because of the difference in cultures,

192
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,600
misunderstanding is expected.

193
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
It's such a regret.

194
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:31,700
But what's worse is that some people would use our past differences for personal gain.

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,400
King, I think we need people like you

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,200
to resolve the misunderstandings.

197
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,600
You know the customs and cultures of both regions.

198
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,900
You must be capable of resolving the disputes between both sides.

199
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,600
If we can move on and not fall for the instigation

200
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,400
to wage war against others, it will be a blessing for all people.

201
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:00,300
Should I address you as Lord Bo's princess consort or Lord Chuan's princess consort?

202
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,700
Your fancy speech was impressive.

203
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,900
Enough of your taunting.

204
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,800
Enough!

205
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,000
That's enough! Stop arguing!

206
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,700
I think...

207
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,600
what she said does make sense.

208
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Brother, Sister Zhaixing is right.

209
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I think you should ask Chu Youkui to leave.

210
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,700
Discuss your work with Sister Zhaixing and Ji Chong instead.

211
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
It's indeed time to send the guests out.

212
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,300
Everyone, please leave.

213
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Bao Na, you, too.

214
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,800
Who is it?

215
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,800
How is this possible?

216
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,000
Emperor Father.

217
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,200
You...

218
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,400
You have come for Ma Zhaixing

219
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,100
and the King of Jin...

220
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,000
to take my life?

221
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,400
I have no such intention.

222
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,500
Even though I am no longer Lord Bo,

223
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,400
but my promise to my eldest brother still stands today,

224
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,400
which is why I cannot allow Chu Youkui to hurt my fourth brother.

225
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,000
So you are in cahoots with Yao Ji.

226
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
Yes.

227
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,900
Another one has betrayed me.

228
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,800
I requested for her to help.

229
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,500
I want to rescue Wen Yan and the others.

230
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,000
Please do not blame her for aiding me.

231
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,400
You...

232
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,400
You may be traitors but you are loyal to one another.

233
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Come on, get up.

234
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,400
The one who wants to betray you and end your life

235
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,500
wasn't my eldest brother or Fourth Brother.

236
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
It wasn't Yao Ji, either.

237
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,600
It was Chu Youkui.

238
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,800
Are you saying you will help me remove this threat?

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,800
On the prayer ritual,

240
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,600
I hope Your Majesty can stall Chu Youkui.

241
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Help me rescue my friends.

242
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,600
For my bond with my brothers,

243
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,800
I will protect Youzhen.

244
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,000
Is that all?

245
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
After we take down Youkui,

246
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,300
Youzhen must ascend to the throne in the next six months.

247
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,500
What you seek is my throne.

248
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I can swear on my life,

249
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,300
Fourth Brother has a kind soul. He will treat you well.

250
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,700
It seems like I have no other option.

251
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,500
I must either hand over the throne,

252
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:17,800
or you'll kill me to get the throne.

253
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,900
Fine.

254
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,400
I knew this would happen.

255
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,900
But I don't get it.

256
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,900
You have been serving me for years.

257
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,200
Yet you haven't learned any cruelty.

258
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You even came here to rescue your Night Fiends.

259
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,600
Fine.

260
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,200
I will pass the throne to Youzhen.

261
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,800
Much obliged, Your Majesty.

262
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,600
Sister Zhaixing!

263
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,000
You did well in front of my brother yesterday.

264
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,900
Chu Youkui failed to persuade my brother.

265
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,300
No.

266
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Now that Chu Youkui knows Ji Chong and I are here,

267
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,800
he will know Lord Bo is here as well.

268
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,500
Lord Bo is the key to defeating our enemy.

269
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,200
This time, he will do whatever it takes to get rid of Lord Bo.

270
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,200
For now, the three of us can wait in hiding

271
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,000
and stand to aid Lord Bo's plan.

272
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,700
With me around, Chu Youkui wouldn't dare to commit evil here.

273
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,500
We're going to the Longevity Forest to conduct a human sacrifice ritual.

274
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Today is the day to pray for my health.

275
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,100
This ritual must go well in order to extend my life.

276
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,300
I was also told you had been working yesterday.

277
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Other than the king,

278
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,200
you've met the other nobles of Qitan as well.

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,600
You were very friendly with them.

280
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Yes. That was my duty.

281
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,900
Well done.

282
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,900
We still have use of their power.

283
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,300
Your approach with the nobles

284
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,500
is what I like to see.

285
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,200
Yes, Emperor Father.

286
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,600
As for using the Night Fiends for human sacrifices,

287
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,800
I've given it much thought.

288
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,600
It's important to lure Lord Bo from hiding,

289
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,100
but traitors like Wen Yan and his friends

290
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,200
don't deserve an easy end.

291
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,000
Yao Ji, I'm sure you know what to do.

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Your Majesty, I have my way to deal with the Night Fiends.

293
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,500
I'll leave the matter in your hands.

294
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,000
Emperor Father,

295
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
I fear Lord Bo might break them out.

296
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,700
I humbly request to assist Grand Diviner Yao Ji in this task.

297
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,900
After all, capturing Lord Bo and the prayer ritual are both our top priorities.

298
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
Very well.

299
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,400
Lord Yun will join you, Yao Ji.

300
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,200
I'll be waiting for your success.

301
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,200
- Yes, Emepror Father.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

302
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,219
The auspicious time for the ritual has arrived!

303
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:46,739
The human sacrifice ritual starts now!

304
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,459
Be more gentle to the lady.

305
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:54,039
You're dying, anyway. Stop being so nosy.

306
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,260
Lord Bo was a fool,

307
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,420
but the three of you were even more foolish.

308
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:04,019
Your Highness, ignore this filth.

309
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:08,299
When their blood is drained dry, they won't be speaking again.

310
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,859
Zi Shen, bring me the silver-snake needle.

311
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,159
Yes, Master.

312
00:23:16,199 --> 00:23:18,299
I will leave them to you, Grand Diviner.

313
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,420
Your Highness,

314
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,419
these people are doomed. Not even Lord Bo can save them now.

315
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,539
His Majesty ordered for you to meet the other nobles.

316
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:50,160
It seems like that monster Lord Bo isn't so loyal.

317
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,920
He won't even rescue his own comrades.

318
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,260
Ji Chong, fog is forming.

319
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,680
We must find Lord Bo and the others.

320
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,060
Let's spilt up.

321
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,318
No.

322
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,019
I can't let you go there alone.

323
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,519
This will protect me for you.

324
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,819
You taught me martial arts.

325
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,760
At least have faith in me.

326
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,439
We'll regroup later.

327
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:32,779
Zhaixing, stay safe.

328
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:06,039
Who's there?

329
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:18,399
Mo Xiao! Mo Xiao!

330
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,739
Master, I won't die so easily.

331
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:28,719
How are Hai Die and Wen Yan?

332
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,319
Be careful, lie down.

333
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,660
Hai Die.

334
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,538
Hai Die. Hai Die!

335
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:54,199
Hai Die?

336
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,739
Wen Yan.

337
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,160
Wen Yan.

338
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,219
Wen Yan?

339
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,780
Wen Yan!

340
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,420
Wen Yan!

341
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,540
Stop!

342
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,578
Turn back.

343
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:30,180
We've gone far enough.

344
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,880
Lord Bo should have come by now.

345
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,719
Your Highness,

346
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:38,500
perhaps Your Highness can carry on without us.

347
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,819
- I will check on the ritual site.
- No.

348
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:42,879
I must see to it myself.

349
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:46,079
Perhaps there will be a surprise for me there.

350
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,699
We're turning back!

351
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,340
Wen Yan, wake up!

352
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,919
Master is here to our rescue.

353
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,519
We're saved, Wen Yan.

354
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,958
- Wen Yan.
- Wen Yan?

355
00:26:59,959 --> 00:27:01,959
Wen Yan!

356
00:27:01,959 --> 00:27:03,839
Why is his blood black?

357
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,639
He is poisoned.

358
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,520
Master.

359
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,079
Chu Kui was afraid we might escape, so he forced us to take poison.

360
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,880
But Wen Yan gave us the antidote he was carrying with him.

361
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,280
Antidote?

362
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,159
The pack he hides in his leg pocket?

363
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,500
Yes.

364
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,560
That antidote can cure any poison,

365
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,519
but it's useless if the meridian vessels aren't connecting.

366
00:27:39,439 --> 00:27:43,880
For those like Wen Yan whose meridian vessels are severed,

367
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,920
the antidote won't work.

368
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,660
It won't work?

369
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,759
But why did he...

370
00:27:52,479 --> 00:27:55,239
Why didn't he tell us?

371
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:01,260
Because if you knew the truth,

372
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,220
you wouldn't have lived leaving him to die.

373
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,439
Wen Yan.

374
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,440
We're going to capture Lord Bo in the Longevity Forest.

375
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,000
Ready your bows and arrows.

376
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,740
If you see Lord Bo, kill on sight.

377
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,460
Ma Zhaixing.

378
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,198
Grand Diviner, go to the Longevity Forest.

379
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,399
The others, follow me. Capture the princess!

380
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,779
Your Highness! She might be here as a decoy.

381
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,238
We should fall back.

382
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:03,860
She is singled out.

383
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,559
Capturing her will crush Jin's morale.

384
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,820
Soldiers, come with me!

385
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:11,939
Let's go!

386
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,779
Master, what do we do now?

387
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:20,379
We must inform Lord Bo.

388
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,580
Ma Zhaixing is in danger.

389
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,999
Surround her! Don't let her get away!

390
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:36,759
Ma Zhaixing, who would have thought? You really came here alone.

391
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,078
These arrows were meant for Lord Bo.

392
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,621
But now I'll use them on you instead.

393
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,840
Fate has a way of bringing you two together.

394
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,360
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

395
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,420
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

396
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,800
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate ♫

397
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,600
Run!

398
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,910
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

399
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,860
You're finally here.

400
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:22,359
Today, none of you will leave here alive.

401
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:30,410
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

402
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,798
I'll protect the rear. Take Zhaixing with you.

403
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:39,139
This time, I'll leave her in your care.

404
00:30:39,139 --> 00:30:41,239
Ji Chong.

405
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,920
Great! All of you are here.

406
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,939
My preparation was worth the while.

407
00:30:56,699 --> 00:30:58,299
Stop!

408
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,700
Princess Bao Na.

409
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:16,739
If you hurt them, I'll take my own life!

410
00:31:16,739 --> 00:31:17,980
Bring it on.

411
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,180
If I die here, not just you,

412
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,980
but even Chu Kui won't make it out alive!

413
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,420
You...

414
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,019
Fine.

415
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,260
Let's go.

416
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,440
Wen Yan.

417
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,339
As your master,

418
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,780
I failed to save you.

419
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,580
I've let you down.

420
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,660
We are brothers.

421
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,619
And with my blood,

422
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,099
I bid you farewell.

423
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,940
Black blood?

424
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:41,079
A sign before dying.

425
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,199
It seems like I'll be

426
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,060
meeting you very soon.

427
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,339
Sister Zhaixing, are you really not going to visit Lord Bo at all?

428
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,260
I don't need to.

429
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,640
Hai Die and Mo Xiao are there for him.

430
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,139
Ma Zhaixing, Lord Bo took an arrow for you earlier.

431
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:48,979
He just lost his friend

432
00:34:48,979 --> 00:34:52,938
and he got injured for you. And now you don't even care?

433
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,420
Can I even go to him?

434
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,780
Should I go to him?

435
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,400
I am Lord Chuan's princess consort.

436
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:12,840
Our blood-feud

437
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,420
makes me wonder how I can face him again.

438
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,139
Yes.

439
00:35:21,139 --> 00:35:23,339
I am worried for him.

440
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:26,599
I am worried for Wen Yan who looked after me.

441
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,560
But even if I went there,

442
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,859
should I show my feelings?

443
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
This is...

444
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:38,980
as close as we can get.

445
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,880
Ma Zhaixing,

446
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,319
now is not the time to be so calculating.

447
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,740
What my emotions should be to face the harsh truth,

448
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,820
was never my choice.

449
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,580
Yes.

450
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,680
You are making perfect sense.

451
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,760
But I don't like who you are right now!

452
00:36:14,479 --> 00:36:18,199
Lord Bo cleared his debt to you during the battle of Boxiang.

453
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,919
What do you mean?

454
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,940
Before the battle,

455
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,340
Lord Bo let the spy go so we could learn his weaknesses.

456
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,398
The Wolfbone flower and butterflies.

457
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:36,360
Lord Bo's injury.

458
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,400
The battle of Boxiang went so smoothly for us.

459
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,959
These only happened because he wanted to repay you on the battlefield with his life.

460
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,638
Back on Langshou Mountain,

461
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:49,319
you loved reading the breeze and watching the butterflies.

462
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,720
Fine.

463
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:54,339
For the butterflies,

464
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,160
I'll give you two more days.

465
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:03,400
After all, the butterflies were once precious to me.

466
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,960
Was that really Lord Bo?

467
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,320
Why didn't he dodge?

468
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,819
When he was shot, he looked as if

469
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,299
he was smiling.

470
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,220
♫ Can't dream, won't dream ♫

471
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,210
♫ I was born with no flesh and blood ♫

472
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:26,220
When your life was hanging by a thread,

473
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,360
he saved you from the battle.

474
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,158
He looked after you while you were recovering on Qi Mountain.

475
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:34,299
He did so to bring you back safely to me.

476
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
He left.

477
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,620
♫ I will be waiting here ♫

478
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,640
See you in the next lifetime Ma Zhaixing.

479
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,459
Chu Kui ordered the Night Fiends to assassinate your father,

480
00:38:02,459 --> 00:38:04,719
but Lord Bo didn't know.

481
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,039
Had he not protected you at his residence,

482
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:09,480
you wouldn't have been alive.

483
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,230
♫ I can only pretend to be moved by my own persistence ♫

484
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,059
So...

485
00:38:15,959 --> 00:38:17,280
Why didn't you tell me?

486
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,740
♫ Staying by your side until the sea dries,
but a stone can’t bear to decay ♫

487
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,720
♫ It won't hurt, it can't hurt ♫

488
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,430
♫ I will be the toughest stone ♫

489
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,360
Because he asked me to.

490
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,500
Both he and I think his attempt to save Lord Xun by returning will mean death.

491
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,640
Do not tell her the truth.

492
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:44,079
Throughout my life I've brought her too much pain.

493
00:38:44,879 --> 00:38:47,180
Since I am doomed either way,

494
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,640
then let the truth be buried with me.

495
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,859
Don't let her suffer any more sorrow.

496
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,200
Ji Chong,

497
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,259
I'm leaving all my hope for her to you.

498
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,219
He did so to free you of any burden.

499
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,319
He wanted me to keep this a secret

500
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:13,659
so you could have your revenge and be freed from the shackle of hate.

501
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,840
But...

502
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,539
no one knew we would get married.

503
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:23,379
No one knew he would have survived.

504
00:39:23,379 --> 00:39:25,198
No one knew he would come to Jin!

505
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,280
Enough!

506
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,939
What use is there to tell me this now?

507
00:39:32,939 --> 00:39:35,958
If this was a secret, you should have kept it that way!

508
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,760
Why didn't you keep me in the dark forever?

509
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,180
What should I do now?

510
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,840
What should I make of this?

511
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:04,439
Leave me and go back to him.

512
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:13,420
Lord Bo stayed with Chu Kui to protect the people of Suyang.

513
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:19,020
Although the massacre of Ma Manor was not Lord Bo's personal doing,

514
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,760
but he was deeply unsettled that Chu Kui kept him in the dark...

515
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,120
which led to your family's death.

516
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,520
The battle of Boxiang was his plan to repay his debt to you.

517
00:40:35,479 --> 00:40:38,620
He would rather have you hate him, ignore him,

518
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,439
than to let you know the whole truth.

519
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,599
You've wronged him.

520
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,340
- During the battle of Boxiang...
- Your princess consort is right.

521
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,700
Our work aside,

522
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,560
what's left between us is only grudges.

523
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,699
It's a fact that will never change.

524
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:59,600
As for other trivial matters that would bother her,

525
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,779
let's not bring them up again.

526
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,200
Zhaixing,

527
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,420
he has suffered enough.

528
00:41:07,959 --> 00:41:10,039
He has atoned for his past.

529
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:11,919
He has done enough.

530
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
It's time to let go.

531
00:41:27,879 --> 00:41:30,640
How am I supposed to let go?

532
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,740
Nothing is impossible.

533
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:46,420
I once thought I couldn't say it.

534
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,199
But when I saw someone as kind as you become so cold and cruel

535
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:57,220
because of your hate and grudge for him,

536
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:00,220
I pitied Lord Bo.

537
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,940
But it pains me to see you bound by hate.

538
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:14,880
My lie and our marriage

539
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,740
has become nothing but a cage for you.

540
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:29,690
