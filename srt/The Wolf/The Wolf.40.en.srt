[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,690
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,770
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,070
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,270
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:31,940
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,090
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:43,610
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,080
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,360
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,310
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,290
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,860
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,110
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,080
[Episode 40]

21
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:38,640
But you just told me you didn't know where he was,

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,500
and now you said he was really busy.

23
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,719
I...

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,918
He has always been busy.

25
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,819
He has tons of work to do.

26
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,439
Right?

27
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,840
What is this?

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,759
Nothing!

29
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,558
Nothing? Let me see it!

30
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,419
Let me take a look!

31
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:56,458
All right! It's nothing!

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,139
Collection of 100 Flowers?

33
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,518
Collection of 100 Flowers. Yes!

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,299
- Do you like gardening?
- Yes.

35
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,759
I've always liked flowers and plants.

36
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,719
Young Feudal Mistress loves gardening, too.

37
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,758
There's nothing wrong with men loving gardening.

38
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,799
Let me take a look.

39
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,739
What are the contents?

40
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,138
Chun Ju, 18 years old.

41
00:02:15,138 --> 00:02:17,279
Good at playing the flute.

42
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:19,779
Fu Rong, 16 years old.

43
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:22,539
Good in poetry.

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,339
Qiao Feng.

45
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:33,360
There's Yu Huan, too.

46
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,179
What is this?
[Collection of 100 Flowers]

47
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,539
This...

48
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,758
You're muttering because you're looking for this, right?

49
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:51,038
Speak! Is this for His Highness?
[Collection of 100 Flowers]

50
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,759
- Yes.
- Yes?

51
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,520
No!

52
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,198
It's for me.

53
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,679
- This is for me.
- For you?

54
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:01,038
Tomorrow is the wedding day,

55
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,959
but His Highness wants to try something new today. Is that it?

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Absolutely not!

57
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,838
Young Mistress!

58
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:08,639
- Ma Jing!
- Young Mistress!

59
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,640
I've done more wrong than right.

60
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,699
Prince!

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,258
Young Mistress!

62
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,460
Look at what Ji Chong and Ke Lang did!

63
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,238
Ji Chong actually wanted to call for a prostitute before the wedding day!

64
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,838
Are all the men in the world the same?

65
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:30,600
They're indecisive and always go after something new.

66
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,439
I thought Ji Chong had devoted himself to you,

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,119
but I was wrong.

68
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,879
Look at all the girls in there.

69
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,319
How could they be any better than your outstanding beauty?

70
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,500
You must be so disappointed with Ji Chong.

71
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,298
Don't make a scene.

72
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:50,639
Return it and apologize to Ke Lang and the prince.

73
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,359
Don't mention that I've seen this.

74
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,959
Why should I apologize?

75
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,520
Ji Chong is actually reading this kind of thing on the night before the wedding day.

76
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,999
He's a prince, not that fellow, Ji Chong.

77
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,919
He is using his reputation and marriage to protect me.

78
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,980
I'm indebted to him and so I shouldn't be unreasonable and make a scene.

79
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,920
Besides, it's normal for men to fool around.

80
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,319
Don't make a fuss about it.

81
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,059
Young Mistress.

82
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:22,760
All right, tomorrow is the big day.

83
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,759
Don't let this trivial matter spoil the great event.

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,240
But back then, when someone went to Hundred Flowers Brothel, you...

85
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
Stop talking about what happened in Bo Mansion.

86
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:44,140
Are you still thinking about what happened in Hundred Flowers Brothel?

87
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,480
How dare you laugh?

88
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,439
Fine.

89
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,140
Go and look for the girls in the brothel since they are so sweet like honey.

90
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,640
No matter how sweet honey is, it will last only for a little while.

91
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,599
But the brightness of a star is eternal.

92
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:15,100
Young Mistress, I know I shouldn't have compared it like that.

93
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,120
I don't want you to look back, either.

94
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:23,180
After all, that person owes a blood debt to us.

95
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,879
But do you still remember this?

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,238
Back when you heard that Prince of Bo went to the Hundred Flowers Brothel with Mo Xiao,

97
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:31,259
you acted...

98
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:37,599
in a very different manner than you had acted when you heard that Ji Chong

99
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,479
wanted to call for prostitutes.

100
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,579
Although I have never had a grand love,

101
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,740
I can tell that you're not in love with him.

102
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,700
You have never thought about yourself.

103
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,019
It was like that when you got engaged with Prince of Bo.

104
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,340
Now, it's the same thing with your engagement with Ji Chong.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,719
Young Mistress, you're so pitiable.

106
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:16,179
Silly girl, there's nothing pitiable about me.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,399
Ji Chong has sacrificed his own marriage, too.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,480
Ji Chong is the right man for me.

109
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,500
My future and my marriage

110
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,720
are never at my own disposal.

111
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:41,039
Whether I'm the princess of the previous dynasty

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,280
or the young feudal mistress of Ma Mansion,

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,520
these are my responsibilities.

114
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,180
Young Mistress.

115
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,319
You're hiding here and drinking alone.

116
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,459
I've never seen such a coward groom like you.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,680
Why didn't you ask the servant to clean it?

118
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,100
As the head eunuch, I have to take the trouble to clean it.

119
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,559
I can't stand the mess.

120
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:45,999
There's nothing I can do about the mess in your life,

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,459
but I can't ignore the mess here in the Jin Palace.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,520
Right.

123
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,560
My life as Li Juyao has been a mess,

124
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,119
and yet I've fallen in love with the good girl, Ma Zhaixing.

125
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,000
Why can't she be more self-indulgent and think more of herself?

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,759
Don't always compare your temper and life with others.

127
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,360
That's her wisdom of life.

128
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,700
Wisdom?

129
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Ma Zhaixing is a total idiot!

130
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,279
She doesn't have any bit of love or desire to have me.

131
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,059
In her heart, she hasn't let go of that man yet.

132
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,340
She just refuses to admit it.

133
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,979
Instead of whining here like a woman, go and say it to her face if you dare.

134
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,700
Chief Eunuch,

135
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:52,139
stop goading me.

136
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,540
Do you think I've never thought of that?

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,960
Ever since I found her on Qi Mountain,

138
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,699
I've been wanting to talk things out and tell her everything

139
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,020
so that she can make her own choices.

140
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,499
But you've never seen the face she makes when she thinks about that man.

141
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:13,339
How could I be so cruel to tell her the truth?

142
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:15,919
It would shatter her.

143
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,059
Truth? What truth?

144
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,819
Something like she doesn't love me

145
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,280
and shouldn't marry me.

146
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,059
Silly boy, I believe

147
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:37,000
that you've made all the decisions in her best interest.

148
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,379
However, as a princess, she's a phoenix and also a caged bird.

149
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,640
No, she's not.

150
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,940
When you open the cage,

151
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,160
a caged bird will fly away after a short hesitation.

152
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,620
Ma Zhaixing is a bird in a painting.

153
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,540
She can't fly away and she has no intention to fly away.

154
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:10,439
She'll just wait idly and be eaten away by reality.

155
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,619
You can't save her.

156
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:16,240
She was born to live for the whole painting.

157
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,358
If you cut her away, you'll destroy the painting

158
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:23,279
and the bird in the painting will have no real reason to exist.

159
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,599
But I just want her to be happy.

160
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,038
Your Highness, our spy said that Prince of Bo has been locked up in prison by Chu Kui.

161
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:38,399
He'll be put to death tomorrow.

162
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,559
This... This...

163
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,940
Although he got what he deserved,

164
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,259
this is still bad news.

165
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:49,239
Keep the news from Princess for now.

166
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:53,220
At least until after tomorrow.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,540
This is such a torment.

168
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,220
Mistress,

169
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,379
His Majesty has ordered to put Prince of Bo to death at noon tomorrow.

170
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,059
Mistress, take it easy.

171
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:48,499
Some things are just like the rain and thunder.

172
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,180
There's nothing we can do about it.

173
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,179
Right.

174
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
His Majesty is the one who wants to kill him.

175
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,700
That's why nobody will be able to save him.

176
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,619
Perhaps he can only rely on God.

177
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,580
Nonsense!

178
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,320
You're saying that if I were to kill Prince of Bo tomorrow,

179
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,040
it would be unfavorable to me?

180
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,640
Your Majesty, the current image of the sky is not a good omen.

181
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,158
- So...
- Enough!

182
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,520
I'm the emperor mandated by Heaven

183
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,919
while Prince of Bo has committed an unpardonable sin!

184
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,200
Besides, I've fulfilled my promise and agreed to his condition to exchange one life for another.

185
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,478
He actually turned against me for Ma Zhaixing.

186
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:48,679
Ma Zhaixing, she's the bane of my life!

187
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,918
Your Majesty! Your Majesty, please calm down.

188
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,939
Yao Ji, as the Grand Diviner,

189
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:58,159
can't you share His Majesty's burden and find a solution?

190
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,780
Yes.

191
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,399
Mistress.

192
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,839
Mistress, how was it?

193
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,760
Did His Majesty believe you?

194
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,900
Mistress, the Night Fiends spying on our enemy country has sent us huge news,

195
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,759
but I'm not sure if I should say it.

196
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,560
Quit dilly-dallying!

197
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,599
Things are already like this. Prince of Bo will be put to death tomorrow.

198
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,620
What else is there that you can't say?

199
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,440
It's about Ma Zhaixing.

200
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,059
Tomorrow, Ma Zhaixing will be married to the younger prince,

201
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,880
Ji Chong.

202
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,620
Ma Zhaixing is such a vicious woman.

203
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Prince of Bo, does she really deserve what you did for her?

204
00:14:48,239 --> 00:14:50,579
Leave!

205
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,598
Rumor has it that those who raise a wolf will use its fang as a lucky charm.

206
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:08,458
It'll protect you from danger.

207
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:10,159
Do you like it?

208
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:36,419
Xing'er, after you returned,

209
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,379
you must have been suspected and suffered grievances.

210
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,300
But once Prince of Bo dies tomorrow,

211
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,899
it'll get you out of that fix.

212
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:48,300
Everything will go back on the right track.

213
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:19,038
The wedding between the prince and princess is a major event in Prince Mansion!

214
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
- Be quick and neat on what you're doing!
- Take it there for me.

215
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,158
Okay, I'll take it.

216
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,280
All right, move away! Be careful not to bump into it!

217
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,218
It's here.

218
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,559
Be careful! Slow down!

219
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:28,378
- Hurry and deliver it.
- Okay.

220
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:30,499
They're waiting for this. Hurry and deliver it.

221
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,639
- This...
- Okay, I'll hop to it.

222
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:50,210
♫ The closer we are, the farther we become;
you brushed my shoulder and continued on ♫

As decreed by His Majesty, the traitor, Prince of Bo, is to be sentenced to death.

235
00:17:48,478 --> 00:17:50,659
Take him to the execution ground.

236
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:52,280
Open the door!

238

Your Highness, do you think I'm very shameless?

239
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,540
I'm just afraid that you'll

240
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
marry the wrong person.

241
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,159
After tomorrow, we'll be separated for a long time.

242
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,300
The wedding day is put off to the indefinite future.

243
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,219
I want you...

244
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,520
I want you to see how I look in a wedding dress

245
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,940
so that you'll understand that

246
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,079
the fate between a couple can surmount all the difficulties.

258
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,080
Third Brother, you have such a heroic bearing,

259
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,620
but I don't want you to die with everlasting regret.

260
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,138
I had pondered for a while before I decided to tell you this.

261
00:21:31,138 --> 00:21:34,179
Last night, we received news from the frontline.

262
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:35,799
You've betrayed your country

263
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,979
and hesitated at nothing to die for Ma Zhaixing,

264
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,839
and yet she's getting married to that Prince of Jin right now.

265
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,639
Thanks for informing me.

266
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:50,460
This is such great news.

267
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,700
I can finally feel at ease to go on my way without any regrets.

268
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,579
I'll just see how much longer you can pretend.

269
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,238
Guards, get ready for the execution!

270
00:22:06,239 --> 00:22:07,739
Yes, Your Highness!

271
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,519
The auspicious moment has come!

272
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,520
May the male and female phoenixes chirp in harmony!

273
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,480
Hold on!

274
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:17,040
Before the ceremony starts, there's something

275
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,719
I need to tell Ma Zhaixing,

276
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:23,580
as this is very important for her.

277
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,399
Last night, we received a secret report that Prince of Bo

278
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,740
will be put to death today at noon.

279
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,399
At noon?

280
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,079
That's right now, right?

281
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,358
Great! This is great!

282
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:47,860
Prince of Bo got what he deserved.

283
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,520
Your Highness, you have finally avenged your family.

284
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,479
And today, you are marrying Prince of Chuan.

285
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:55,260
It's indeed a double blessing!

286
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,079
That is within my expectations.

287
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,699
He chose his destiny himself.

288
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:18,759
That day, I didn't get to kill him at the Battle of Boxiang.

289
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:23,319
Today, it serves him right

290
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,699
to be put to death.

291
00:24:28,039 --> 00:24:29,839
Do you want to go back?

292
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,299
Aren't you going to die if you go back?

293
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,400
Hence, the next time she hears about me,

294
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,819
I would've died a graveless death for betraying my country.

295
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:44,520
She'll be pleased that I get what I deserve

296
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,740
and let go of the hatred.

297
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:58,516
Why are you telling me this right now?

298
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,590
Because I know, be it that he's a blessing

299
00:25:03,593 --> 00:25:05,700
or misfortune in your life,

300
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,839
he means something to you.

301
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:12,959
No,

302
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,819
I don't want to recall what happened in the past

303
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:22,800
as I had more suffering than happiness.

304
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:27,258
I just want to move forward

305
00:25:28,114 --> 00:25:30,274
and stop thinking about the agony.

306
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,599
As I move forward, you'll be with me at the front.

307
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,459
That's enough for me.

308
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,679
Don't ever tell her the truth.

309
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,780
Let the truth sink like a stone in the ocean

310
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,539
and free her from all the agony.

311
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,440
Ji Chong,

312
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,200
I'll entrust to you all my wishes for her.

313
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,380
Zhaixing, are you really willing to marry me

314
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,120
even if I might have made many selfish decisions

315
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,620
and hid something from you to make you stay?

316
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,499
Because I believe

317
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:32,800
that you've made all the decisions for my own good

318
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,620
and that's enough.

319
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,760
Great.

320
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,259
I, Li Juyao, swear to God

321
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:54,699
that I'll protect you forever!

322
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:57,220
I want to make you my wife!

323
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,419
I'll be the only one in the world

324
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:04,020
who truly cares about your happiness.

325
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,540
Thank you.

326
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,060
Fire up!

327
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:05,870
What's wrong with the weather?

328
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:10,269
- This...
- My goodness, why did the weather change?

329
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:12,508
What's happening?

330
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,748
Right.

331
00:28:13,749 --> 00:28:15,629
What's wrong?

332
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:26,789
Your Majesty!

333
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,429
Your Majesty!

334
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:32,749
What?

335
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,549
Has Prince of Bo been put to death?

336
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,829
Your Majesty, Prince of Bo has been taken to the execution ground.

337
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,389
When he was about to be executed, the thunder roared all of a sudden.

338
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:43,890
All the nine-millennium cypress trees

339
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,909
were struck down by lightning.

340
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:48,389
What?

341
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:51,628
All my Nine-Dragon Cyprss Trees were struck down?

342
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:54,169
Your Majesty, the guard reported

343
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:58,309
that there's strange snow at the Imperial Mausoleum.

344
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,508
Atrocious!

345
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:02,389
Your Majesty, I deserve to die.

346
00:29:02,389 --> 00:29:06,169
I'm worried about what Yao Ji said before.

347
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,650
She said the current sky vision wasn't a good omen.

348
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,230
I fear that it was somewhat credible.

349
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,588
Your Majesty, Grand Diviner Yao Ji requests to see you.

350
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:20,289
Let her in.

351
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,729
I pay respect to Your Majesty.

352
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:31,108
My Red Cloud Sword?

353
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:35,050
Your Majesty, I was praying in the Imperial Ancestral Temple

354
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:39,430
when a bolt of lightning struck the temple and hit the Red Cloud Sword.

355
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,468
The sword was broken into two.

356
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:45,789
The Red Cloud Sword was made of dark iron.

357
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,389
How could it possibly break into two?

358
00:29:57,469 --> 00:29:59,409
How did this happen?

359
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,710
This sword...

360
00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:07,090
This sword is a gift from Heaven.

361
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:09,309
Your Majesty, please sentence me to death.

362
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,349
I'm incompetent.

363
00:30:15,629 --> 00:30:18,268
Your Majesty, we received an urgent message from Military Marquis Liu.

364
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:21,068
The continuous rainfall has led to flooding at the Huai River this morning.

365
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:22,509
What?

366
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:31,549
Is Heaven making things difficult for me

367
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,789
because I want to kill Prince of Bo?

368
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,349
But if I don't kill him,

369
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,509
he would be uncontrollable!

370
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:45,050
Besides, if I don't kill him, I'll lose my dignity as the son of Heaven!

371
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:50,550
Your Majesty, I know a method that can make the best of both worlds.

372
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:01,949
Your Majesty, could it be that Prince of Bo is not fated to die?

373
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,109
That's a fallacy!

374
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:07,750
I'll just kill him myself then!

375
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,350
His Majesty has arrived!

376
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,190
Greetings, Your Majesty!

377
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,029
Get up. I've something to say.

378
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,549
Thank you, Your Majesty.

379
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:11,949
Your Highness, there's a reason behind His Majesty's action.

380
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,069
I'll tell you the truth later.

381
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,410
Please obey His Majesty's order first.

382
00:32:43,369 --> 00:32:47,570
It has been ascertained that Prince of Bo didn't intentionally

383
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:50,868
betray and flee from the Battle of Boxiang.

384
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,549
Instead, he was just negligent.

385
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,409
This... Is that real?

386
00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:59,390
However, it's undeniable that he lost the battle.

387
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:02,810
He's exempted from the death penalty but hardly from the punishment.

388
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:06,348
Prince of Bo will be banished to the Qiannu Camp.

389
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,100
He's demoted to a slave forever, with no chance to ever rise again.

390
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,090
I'll do as instructed.

391
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,710
Back then, if he didn't

392
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,389
give me this dagger which was made of dark iron, too,

393
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:31,009
I wouldn't be able to break the Red Cloud Sword

394
00:33:31,649 --> 00:33:34,630
and gain His Majesty's trust.

395
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,090
So, Prince of Bo has actually saved his own life

396
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:42,480
by being nice to you?

397
00:33:43,869 --> 00:33:48,029
Mistress, what about the flood caused by heavy rain at the Huai River

398
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,789
and the rain at the execution ground?

399
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:52,930
If a snake leaves its hole, it means rain is on its way.

400
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,810
I predicted the weather.

401
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:58,970
As for the flood at the Huai River, I've been holding up the news for today.

402
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,549
What about the meaning of the Emperor Star and Five Planets Alignment?

403
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:03,129
Those were sheer nonsense.

404
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:06,388
When His Majesty took his sword from the Imperial Ancestral Temple,

405
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:09,548
he looked uneasy, anxious, and terrified.

406
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:11,249
He kept talking to himself.

407
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,810
So, I purposely told him about the vision in the sky to provoke him.

408
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,629
When he was not in his right mind, I laid before him his genuine fear.

409
00:34:21,789 --> 00:34:26,009
Without further ado, we still need to deal with one person.

410
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:29,030
After losing in the War of Boxiang,

411
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:31,710
His Majesty has grown weaker as he's haunted by the devil within him.

412
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,470
That was why he easily believed in my astrological predictions.

413
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,449
But Prince of Yun...

414
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,610
Prince of Yun...

415
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,850
The odds are on his side.

416
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,650
I'm afraid it would be hard for Prince of Yun to

417
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,790
believe in these superstitions.

418
00:34:50,009 --> 00:34:54,170
But shouldn't we first help Prince of Bo survive his harsh punishment?

419
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,310
I have expected that

420
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,929
His Majesty wouldn't let Prince of Bo live comfortably

421
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:04,250
even if I try my best to save him.

422
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,310
But I never expected

423
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:10,370
him to end up in the Qiannu Camp.

424
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,410
I heard that all the slaves in the Qiannu Camp

425
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,389
were once military officers captured by Prince of Bo himself.

426
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:18,289
They are influential

427
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:22,009
and hate Prince of Bo to the core.

428
00:35:22,009 --> 00:35:24,529
Sending Prince of Bo there is

429
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:27,230
no different than sending him to hell.

430
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:32,130
Besides, all the slaves in the Qiannu Camp

431
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,270
will have the word "slave" stamped (by a hot iron) on their faces.

432
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,370
Lord Bo will face the same humiliation.

433
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,909
Not only did His Majesty want Prince of Bo to pay a heavy price,

434
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,828
but he also wanted him to suffer mentally, too.

435
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:46,569
He might as well die just now.

436
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,410
Xing'er.

437
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:51,769
Mistress, you've heard it wrong.

438
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:54,389
Prince of Bo didn't say anything.

439
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:58,348
It was the whistling sound of the wind outside.

440
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,969
Not Xing... Xing...

441
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:03,709
Xing'er.

442
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,709
I saved him out of my own free will.

443
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,269
I know he loves Ma Zhaixing.

444
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:35,969
But can she sacrifice everything

445
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,710
to help him like me?

446
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,230
You nasty fellow,

447
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,910
am I drinking for my wedding

448
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,689
or your death?

449
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:26,570
Today, I feel so sad

450
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,829
about the news of your death.

451
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,850
I don't want Zhaixing to be sad, too.

452
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,790
From now onward,

453
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:43,209
I'll take good care of her

454
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:46,009
so that she won't feel sad for you.

455
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,689
I'll keep my promise.

456
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,969
Your Highness, I received news from our spy.

457
00:38:07,969 --> 00:38:10,810
Prince of Bo was supposed to be put to death,

458
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,769
but he was demoted to slave at the last minute.

459
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,550
Life is truly unpredictable.

460
00:38:42,129 --> 00:38:45,769
Your Highness, you're the star tonight.

461
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:48,070
Go inside and drink with everyone.

462
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:54,190
Tonight, we're not celebrating my wedding,

463
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:58,249
but to congratulate that fellow

464
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:00,769
for escaping from death.

465
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:30,090
What's wrong with the groom?

466
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,550
Does he not know that the bride is waiting for him?

467
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:36,330
Today is a big day.

468
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,289
It's crowded with many guests.

469
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,569
He certainly has to drink with many people.

470
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,669
Let him have fun.

471
00:39:44,669 --> 00:39:45,890
I'm all right.

472
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:47,989
Today is your wedding day.

473
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,170
How could he neglect you?

474
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,570
Who neglected who?

475
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,410
What took you so long?

476
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,370
Hurry up! Say something nice.

477
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,109
Go!

478
00:40:08,629 --> 00:40:13,229
I've come to apologize to my bride.

479
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,190
I can't drink. Drink it yourself.

480
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,950
But you must drink this cup of wine.

481
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,810
I was worried about someone far away.

482
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,230
I thought he would die today,

483
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,650
but who would've expected that

484
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,829
he has survived.

485
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:54,389
You're saying that...

486
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,610
Prince of Bo didn't die,

487
00:40:58,029 --> 00:41:00,549
but he was banished to the Qiannu Camp.

488
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:12,149
You don't have to worry about your expression.

489
00:41:12,149 --> 00:41:14,230
I can understand.

490
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,570
Even if it was someone we didn't know who was going to die,

491
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,570
we would feel uneasy as well.

492
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,090
Not to mention you have a long past with Prince of Bo.

493
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,610
Although he escaped from death,

494
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:31,489
the situation didn't get any better for him.

495
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,090
Let's finish this cup of wine.

496
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:41,069
Consider him having died once.

497
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:45,490
It has lessened your hatred, right?

498
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,389
It's so strong.

499
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:26,929
Stong liquor is good. You can get drunk faster.

♫ Separation is not unbearable ♫

502

♫ What is unbearable is when two hearts
are not truly separated ♫

503
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:57,050
♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:02,450
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

507
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:24,060
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

♫ Forever being together ♫

♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫
