[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,660
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,780
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,960
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making)♫

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,370
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs)♫

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,850
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder)♫

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,040
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,740
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,090
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,380
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,240
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,230
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,510
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:07,790
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,950
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,210
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:26,630
♫ You know who I am ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,890
[Episode 15]

21
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,109
Your Highness, Young Feudal Mistress practiced this dance so many times.

22
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:40,820
She tried her very best in doing it especially for you.

23
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,100
If this continues,

24
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,960
I'm going to get a promotion and be successful soon.

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,918
I'm Ma Zhaixing from Kuizhou. The dance just now is called "Princess Dance."

26
00:03:05,918 --> 00:03:09,879
I hereby wish that you will be successful in this journey!

27
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,079
Good! Good! Good!

28
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:24,900
The Princess Dance is an auspicious dance.

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,078
Both of your legs have been injured before.

30
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,959
A lot of your dance moves are not on point.

31
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Not smooth enough.

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,339
You've embarrassed yourself.

33
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:36,939
Don't you know that you've destroyed the elegance of this dance as well as my mood?

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Your Highness, I just wanted to wish you all the best—

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,980
Although you were born in Kuizhou,

36
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,640
you are already engaged to marry me.

37
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,140
Please give importance to your present status.

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,639
- You discarded your duties as Princess Consort Bo and came to this banquet to expose yourself in public.
- That table has turned.

39
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,180
You always disobeyed me when I say no.

40
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,580
I don't want to see you, but here you are.

41
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,020
Why do you always like to rebel against me and infuriate me?

42
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,640
Calm down, Your Highness!

43
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,280
Calm down, Your Highness!

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,379
Don't let your mood be affected by a disobedient woman.

45
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,979
Disobedient?

46
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,079
This is an apt description.

47
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,218
Young Feudal Mistress has always been eccentric since young.

48
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:28,198
Everybody knows about it in Kuizhou.

49
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,000
You better be smart and restrain yourself.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,319
You better not aggravate His Highness and bring trouble to everyone in Kuizhou.

51
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,580
Mister,

52
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,358
do I know you?

53
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:43,299
Young Feudal Mistress,

54
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:46,038
you only remembered the man who has hurt you before.

55
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,779
But you don't remember the men whom you humiliated?

56
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,478
Let me remind you then.

57
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,999
What did you say again when we proposed to you?

58
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:59,679
"Guess the right wooden box by listening to the flapping wings of a butterfly."

59
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,399
You were so arrogant back then.

60
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,460
She even said that she would humiliate whoever proposed to her.

61
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,259
She was so supercilious.

62
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,580
You have mentioned the past.

63
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,679
If I have offended you back then,

64
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,699
please forgive me.

65
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:21,779
But for you to remember it until today,

66
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,198
I'm wondering if you have superb memories or are just narrow-minded.

67
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,358
You are still the same, Young Mistress.

68
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,318
Your tongue is as sharp as ever.

69
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,860
No wonder Prince of Bo despises you.

70
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,260
In this world, no man would like a woman like you.

71
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,440
Brother Qi, you are wrong.

72
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,638
There will be a man who will fall in love with a woman like her.

73
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,799
That's right!

74
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:52,779
A wolf-like man who can hear the sound of butterfly wings.

75
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,519
Prince of Bo, in my opinion,

76
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:03,400
that kind of man is either extinct or has never been born before.

77
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,519
Well said!

78
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,680
Your Highness,

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,460
the Princess Dance by the best courtesan in Kuizhou, Miss Lufu,

80
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,759
is way better than the performance of Young Mistress.

81
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,959
- Her face and dance moves are unbelievably beautiful.
- That's right.

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,198
The performance just now is a joke.

83
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,479
I want to watch a better performance.

84
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,519
Your Highness, I'll send someone to bring you Miss Lufu now.

85
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,899
- Go now.
- Roger that.

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
Come.

87
00:06:45,619 --> 00:06:47,639
Why are you still here?

88
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,740
Are you going to stay here and further ruin my mood?

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,119
Your Highness.

90
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:58,020
Fellow guests.

91
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,019
Farewell.

92
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,919
Cheers.

93
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,638
What kind of Princess Dance was that?

94
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,780
Even my maid can dance better than her.

95
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,038
That's right.

96
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,020
It must be torture for Your Highness to watch that.

97
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,060
You had to endure her dance for so long.

98
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,078
She's the embarrassment of Kuizhou.

99
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,259
I feel ashamed to admit that I had once proposed to her.

100
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,218
- Come.
- Let's drink.

101
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,659
Ma Zhaixing's karma has hit her so quickly.

102
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:47,660
Back then, she looked down on those who proposed to her

103
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,679
and she made us into a joke.

104
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:57,159
Today, Prince of Bo has helped us get even with her.

105
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:59,439
This is so satisfying.

106
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,520
That's right.

107
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,280
In the future,

108
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,380
just an order from you

109
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,760
and I'll hand in

110
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,120
all of my Qi's massive fortune to the court

111
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,779
to fund the Bo Army.

112
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,399
Great! Great!

113
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,080
Really?

114
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,770
I don't dare lie to you, Your Highness.

115
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,164
Good!

116
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:38,679
I'll grant your wish then.

117
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,479
The Qi family is so rich

118
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,419
because you used the name of the late Minister Qi

119
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:47,740
to oppress the people and earn that dirty money.

120
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,540
All properties of the Qi family will be confiscated.

121
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,560
What is the meaning of this?

122
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,900
Young Lord Qiao.

123
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,720
Your Highness.

124
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,739
I've already investigated.

125
00:09:04,739 --> 00:09:09,639
Your family has been paying the road tax and state tax to the court

126
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:15,959
for the past few years without a fault, right?

127
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:17,439
Yes, Your Highness.

128
00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:19,420
Very good.

129
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,899
Then, from this year onwards, you'll have to pay double.

130
00:09:22,899 --> 00:09:26,199
And that extra tax cannot be extorted from the people.

131
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,580
Find a way to pay for it yourself.

132
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,618
If you fool around with me, I'll kill all nine generations of your family.

133
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:34,218
- Your...
- Sit down.

134
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:42,040
Your turn.

135
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,319
Your Highness.

136
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,560
Spare my life, Your Highness.

137
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:54,338
You lied to me in front of everyone. How should I punish you?

138
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:56,100
Your... Highness...

139
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,979
No matter how brave I am, I wouldn't dare lie to you.

140
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:01,900
Please don't accuse me of that!

141
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,620
Just now, didn't you say that

142
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,000
if there's a wolf-like man who can hear the sound of butterfly wings,

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,540
then that man will either be dead or he has never been born before.

144
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,420
Unfortunately for you,

145
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,300
I've met that man before.

146
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,880
You lied to me in public.

147
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,338
- Wen Yan.
- Yes, Your Highness.

148
00:10:26,338 --> 00:10:28,459
Cane him 100 times.

149
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:29,679
Yes, Master.

150
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,779
Your Highness! Spare my life, Your Highness! Your Highness!

151
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,398
I didn't lie to you!

152
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,800
Please spare my life, Your Highness!

153
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,918
Master, Young Feudal Mistress Ma wouldn't leave.

154
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:44,040
She's waiting for you in your room.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,580
You've drunk many cups of wine tonight.

156
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,698
I've prepared some medicine and herbs that are famous for curing a hangover.

157
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,480
I won't disturb you then.

158
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
I'll go back now.

159
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
Your Highness.

160
00:11:25,359 --> 00:11:27,119
Your Highness.

161
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,819
You are really trying to win me over so tirelessly.

162
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,439
You... are so beautiful today.

163
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,739
I've never seen you...

164
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,839
like this.

165
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,980
Your Highness, you are really drunk!

166
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,179
I'll go and prepare the hangover soup for you now.

167
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,980
You are really a spoilsport.

168
00:12:16,619 --> 00:12:20,880
I don't want the hangover soup.

169
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
I want you.

170
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,719
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

171
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,839
Let go of me!

172
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,660
Your Highness!

173
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:36,580
I want you to pleasure me.

174
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,340
But we are not officially husband and wife yet.

175
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,180
You'll be mine eventually.

176
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,300
Your Highness!

177
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,619
Your Highness! No! Your Highness!

178
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,039
Your Highness!

179
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,839
No! Your Highness!

180
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,379
No, Your Highness!

181
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:09,159
You put in so much effort tonight.

182
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:12,019
Didn't you do it to get my attention?

183
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,839
Why are you avoiding me now?

184
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,398
Your Highness... No...

185
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,839
No! No! Your Highness!

186
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,319
Get lost!

187
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,759
You look so aggrieved,

188
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,619
like I'm forcing you.

189
00:14:18,619 --> 00:14:21,699
You've dampened my spirit. Get out!

190
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,379
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

191
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:54,020
Your Highness, I was just shocked.

192
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:12,060
If you really want to consummate our...

193
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,120
Teach me!

194
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,920
What should I do to make you fall out of love with me

195
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,939
and stay away from me from now on?

196
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:23,480
Listen to me.

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,700
I am the one who broke the red thread.

198
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:40,880
Didn't we fall for each other after going through thick and thin together?

199
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,620
How did everything change within a night?

200
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,639
What man will be able to stay unaffected when a woman says that she'll live and die with him?

201
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,760
I was touched at that time.

202
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:03,220
But when I heard that you want a pure relationship without any lies,

203
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,819
I realized that I can't do that.

204
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Although I can't treat you sincerely,

205
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,399
I was seduced by your performance tonight.

206
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,639
I thought that I could play with you.

207
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,800
But you are too dumb.

208
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,320
You don't know how to please me.

209
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,360
You are so boring.

210
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,199
Let me tell you truthfully.

211
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:46,860
If it wasn't because His Majesty bestowed you to me, you would never be the woman that I'd choose.

212
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:53,360
♫ But cannot stay for a while ♫

213
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,660
So, making things difficult for me,

214
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,960
being so cold and dissatisfied with me

215
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,480
at the banquet and the mansion

216
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,640
were all because you wanted to discourage me.

217
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,580
You don't have

218
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,220
any feelings towards me already.

219
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,080
It's good that you understand.

220
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,240
I don't have to act anymore.

221
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,379
Facing a woman I detest every day is more exhausting than going to war.

222
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,160
Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness!

223
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,940
I've already invited Miss Lufu here.

224
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,198
Zhaixing, Young Mistress,

225
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:57,759
I did this for the benefit of all the people in Kuizhou.

226
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,640
Since you can't give pleasure to His Highness, you might drag us down with you.

227
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,139
- Bring Miss Lufu here.
- Yes, Your Highness.

228
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:08,990
Tonight, I want a real woman.

229
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,200
♫ Personally burying this warmth ♫

230
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,710
♫ No matter how painful or how much love there is,
don't say it anymore ♫

231
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,299
Aren't you leaving?

232
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,380
What?

233
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,840
You want to watch how Miss Lufu pleasures me?

234
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,259
You can stay.

235
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,000
You can learn from her.

236
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,260
Maybe after that, I'll feel more attracted to you.

237
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,639
Prince of Bo,

238
00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:47,659
you are so shameless!

239
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,640
Master, I already sent someone to look for Ji Chong to ask about the Golden Eagle.

240
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,139
But he's neither at the stable nor the Feudal Lord Mansion.

241
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:12,398
Besides, someone saw him rushing towards Ma Mansion.

242
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,519
He was acting very suspicious.

243
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,200
Send someone.

244
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Your Highness, Miss Lufu is here.

245
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,320
Sir, where is His Highness going?

246
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,799
He has something important to do.

247
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,940
What about Miss Lufu?

248
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,019
Send her back to wherever she came from.

249
00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:28,319
Wait. This...

250
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,938
Why did he change his mind so suddenly?

251
00:19:47,939 --> 00:19:51,358
You were gone from Kuizhou the whole day and broke into Princess Consort's maiden house at night.

252
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,940
What are you trying to do?

253
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,659
Although I didn't attend the banquet today,

254
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:19,220
everyone in this manor already knows that you humiliated Young Feudal Mistress Ma in public today.

255
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,879
I know...

256
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,239
this is none of my business.

257
00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:26,339
But since young, I can't take it when a woman cries.

258
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,239
Someone from Ma Mansion told me that Young Mistress likes candied hawthorns.

259
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:35,300
So, I left the city at night and found an old friend to make these candied hawthorns.

260
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,859
Now,

261
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,060
you've ruined everything.

262
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,500
This is just a warning for you.

263
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,860
Stay out of others' business.

264
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,880
You don't like watching Zhaixing dance.

265
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,020
You don't like candied hawthorns, too. Right?

266
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,739
Let alone a candied hawthorn that fell onto the floor.

267
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:02,679
But people who love candied hawthorn won't mind that.

268
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,260
Let me remind you.

269
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,219
This is a fickle world.

270
00:21:10,219 --> 00:21:12,720
You better cherish the people around you.

271
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:25,039
Ma Zhaixing!

272
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,260
Ma Zhaixing,

273
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,940
open the door.

274
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:40,399
I know about what happened in the banquet today.

275
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,300
But I brought your favorite candied hawthorns!

276
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,199
It's free.

277
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:46,999
You just need to open the door.

278
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:50,979
Ma Zhaixing.

279
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,118
Young Feudal Mistress has gone missing since last night.

280
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,779
Please send someone to search the city for her.

281
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:11,399
Search the city?

282
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:13,560
Don't make a mountain out of a molehill.

283
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,219
She has been gone for a night.

284
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:18,060
What's wrong with searching the city for her?

285
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,600
We are in Kuizhou.

286
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,720
She'll want to walk around her home town.

287
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,980
What are you worried about?

288
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,759
She is Princess Consort of Bo.

289
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,599
Aren't you worried about her safety at all?

290
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,079
Since you know that she is my consort,

291
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,940
there's no need for you to worry.

292
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,720
If you won't look for her, I'll do it then.

293
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,599
Your Highnes, this horse expert is so rude.

294
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,260
You should behead him.

295
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:49,819
But I think that Young Feudal Mistress will be fine.

296
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,879
After all, since young, she liked to roam around Langshou Mountain.

297
00:22:53,879 --> 00:22:57,779
But she's still acting so wild even though she's now your consort.

298
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,940
Feudal Lord, how long have you been in this position?

299
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:11,280
More than half a year.

300
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:15,619
Since my trip here, I think you've performed a valuable service

301
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,179
and you've been serving me well.

302
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:19,619
You are too kind.

303
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,840
This is just my duty.

304
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:27,720
It'll be a waste of talent for you to just be the feudal lord of Kuizhou.

305
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,320
You should resign now.

306
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,499
I have another position for you.

307
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,860
Thank you for your kindness.

308
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,739
Your Highness, when will I enter Imperial City then?

309
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:44,279
What position will you give me?

310
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:50,128
You are now the gatekeeper and you'll guard Kuizhou's gate forever.

311
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,739
Let's go to Ma Mansion.

312
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,440
When you are sad, where will you go?

313
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,039
It's thundering. Get ready to pack up.

314
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,818
It's going to rain. Let's pack up!

315
00:24:29,818 --> 00:24:31,999
We'll pack up when it starts to rain.

316
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,039
There's a mountain outside of Kuizhou. It's called the Langshou Mountain.

317
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,200
His Highness loves the warrior wolf.

318
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,139
Maybe he'll be willing to visit the mountain with me.

319
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,459
Wolf Boy, I am back.

320
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,480
Xing'er,

321
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,139
I'm here.

322
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,260
Ma Zhaixing!

323
00:27:07,999 --> 00:27:09,719
Zhaixing!

324
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,319
Zhaixing.

325
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,060
Ma Zhaixing!

326
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,439
Ma Zhaixing!

327
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:31,959
Zhaixing!

328
00:27:31,959 --> 00:27:33,559
Zhaixing, wake up.

329
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,880
Ma Zhaixing,

330
00:27:41,879 --> 00:27:43,520
are you okay?

331
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,759
What happened?

332
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,019
Here.

333
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,480
I lost.

334
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,480
I was completely defeated.

335
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,500
Prince of Bo has never loved me sincerely.

336
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,919
It's all because of the bestowed marriage of His Majesty.

337
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,360
Since the beginning,

338
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,800
I've misinterpreted his feelings.

339
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,300
I'm sorry, Zhaixing.

340
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,019
I shouldn't have suggested that you dance for him.

341
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,560
I never thought that Prince of Bo would be so heartless.

342
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,359
Why did you come back to Langshou Mountain then?

343
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:34,480
Are you waiting for him to come and look for you?

344
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,340
I came back here

345
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,639
to look for courage.

346
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:57,859
Usnea is my mother's favorite flower.

347
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:00,340
My father said that it has another name.

348
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,400
- It's called—
- The Queen?

349
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:11,700
The Queen symbolizes courage.

350
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:15,960
I have to be brave, too.

351
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,159
Forget about him.

352
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,860
This red thread is what ties us together.

353
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:42,020
But we are not the only ones who are tied together.

354
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,939
There is also the weak trust His Majesty has over the Ma Family Army.

355
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:53,960
Although I know that my husband will never love me,

356
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,419
I can't end this marriage.

357
00:29:57,099 --> 00:29:59,779
Although I've been hurt by Prince of Bo,

358
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,139
I can't let the Ma Army find out that I'm not living well.

359
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,560
I need this marriage.

360
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,680
The court needs this marriage.

361
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,919
And most of all, Ma Army needs this marriage.

362
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,839
Everyone has to be trapped inside this marriage.

363
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,600
You are brave, Ma Zhaixing.

364
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:31,100
Bo Royal Mansion is just a prison for you.

365
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:34,964
People in prison can cry,

366
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,239
but when I go back to Bo Royal Mansion,

367
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,919
I can only smile.

368
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,618
Zhuiri has spotted someone. I have to check it out.

369
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:37,839
There's someone outside?

370
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:39,720
Prince of Bo.

371
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,200
What did you say?

372
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,199
You are really helpless.

373
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:45,319
Look at your reaction.

374
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,519
How could you believe me?

375
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,380
What kind of expression is this?

376
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,139
Are you still hoping that he will come?

377
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:00,639
Even if he comes,

378
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,259
that'll be because he's afraid that he has to explain to the court if anything happens to you.

379
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:07,059
That'll be the only reason.

380
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,340
In a relationship, both parties have to be willing.

381
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,238
You are deeply in love with Prince of Bo,

382
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:16,700
but does it mean that he has to be deeply in love with you, too?

383
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,119
Can't I even have the right to be sad?

384
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,080
Of course you can,

385
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,660
even if your sadness will never go away.

386
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,999
Everyone will fall in love with the wrong person.

387
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:35,719
But someday, someone will eventually carry this sadness for you.

388
00:32:43,999 --> 00:32:49,079
Is this what you've said to those ladies who you've hurt before?

389
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,859
Sometimes, I'll drink a cup of wine first.

390
00:32:54,859 --> 00:32:56,079
Why?

391
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:58,960
To boost my courage. I'm afraid of getting hit.

392
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:02,300
You are laughing.

393
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,119
Are you feeling better?

394
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,500
Looks like you are all better now.

395
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,859
Let me get you some water.

396
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:23,238
Let's take a rest for a while more.

397
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:26,759
We'll leave the mountain when your fever has gone down.

398
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,880
Wait for me.

399
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,580
Thank you.

400
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,159
Are you feeling better now?

401
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,479
You caught a cold on Langshou Mountain that day.

402
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,639
It must be hard for you to travel when you are still sick.

403
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm feeling much better now, Wen Yan.

404
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:04,200
Please tell Prince of Bo that I have something to report.

405
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
Please wait for a moment.

406
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,679
His Highness is in a meeting with the warrior sent by Princess Bao Na.

407
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,559
We are almost at the border.

408
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,479
Why did Bao Na send someone here at this time?

409
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,759
Young Feudal Mistress, please go in.

410
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,260
Princess Bao Na and I will be meeting soon.

411
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,160
So, why did she have to send you here first?

412
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,620
Your Highness, Princess Bao Na sent me to deliver a letter to you.

413
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,920
This is her seal.

414
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,580
[Qitan]

415
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:23,132
[I need to meet you urgently.]

416
00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:25,788
[Here's my seal to prove that I need to meet you alone at Fuhu (Hiding Tiger) Forest tomorrow.]

417
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,859
Go back and tell her that

418
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,259
I'll bring this seal to meet her tomorrow at Fuhu Forest alone.

419
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:42,339
Yes, Your Highness. Farewell.

420
00:35:58,999 --> 00:36:01,160
I heard that you are ill,

421
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:04,919
but I haven't visited you at all.

422
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,440
You won't blame me, right?

423
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,238
You are busy with work.

424
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,619
I wouldn't want you to be distracted by me.

425
00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:16,339
Good.

426
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,379
You've seen Princess Bao Na's handwriting before, right?

427
00:36:22,379 --> 00:36:27,799
Can you tell me whether or not this is her handwriting?

428
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,378
Princess Bao Na's handwriting is unique.

429
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:45,200
The writings in this letter do look like her handwriting.

430
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:50,179
I heard that Fuhu Forest is their hunting ground.

431
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,260
Outsiders are not allowed to go in.

432
00:36:54,700 --> 00:37:01,179
Looks like Princess Bao Na can't forget about you.

433
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:05,020
So, she wrote you a letter to meet you in private.

434
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,420
If you can stop loving me,

435
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,319
you won't be jealous of my love affairs anymore.

436
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,060
That is what I plan to do.

437
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,060
To this day,

438
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,879
I keep thinking about how to make you happy.

439
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,560
Meticulous care is not what you want.

440
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:44,620
Dancing to pray for blessings back at Kuizhou is not what you want, either.

441
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,120
The thing you want is the freedom that I can't give you.

442
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,579
Since this red thread is a blessing,

443
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,579
it should tie both of us together.

444
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:06,179
I shouldn't be the only one who cares.

445
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:13,580
I foolishly thought that if I just tie it back together,

446
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,520
you'll come back to me.

447
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,299
It's not too late now that you've realized it.

448
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,960
It's too late.

449
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,180
If I had rejected His Majesty's bestowed marriage from the start,

450
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:36,160
you wouldn't be stuck forever with a woman you don't love.

451
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,319
If you want our marriage to exist in name only,

452
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:48,540
I'll obey your order.

453
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,400
If you don't want me to travel with you,

454
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,040
I'll obey your order and go back to Kuizhou at once.

455
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:06,559
If you want me to stop loving you and to pretend to be your wife just when we are in public,

456
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,039
I'll obey your order.

457
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,660
I won't report to His Majesty about anything that happened in Kuizhou,

458
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,339
so His Majesty won't punish you.

459
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,619
Well done.

460
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:36,439
This is what I want.

461
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:49,299
Finally, I did something right and got your compliment.

462
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,219
Farewell.

463
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,220
Greetings, Your Highness.

464
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:39,300
I have a date with Princess Bao Na tomorrow.

465
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:45,540
Send your Golden Eagle to the hunting ground tomorrow to scout out Fuhu Forest.

466
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,479
I can't do that, Your Highness.

467
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:55,100
I'm here today to resign as your horse expert.

468
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:05,760
This money is what you paid me back then.

469
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,120
Today, I'll give it back to you.

470
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,899
You value money over life.

471
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:21,038
Why are you giving up such a well-paid job?

472
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,839
Because of Young Feudal Mistress.

473
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:27,419
Just now, I saw her packing up her luggage.

474
00:41:27,419 --> 00:41:35,499
Although I don't know why, only you are able to break her heart throughout our journey.

475
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:45,139
You are really considerate toward my consort.

476
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,519
I indeed admire her a lot.

477
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:53,240
But it's not in an improper way like what you are thinking.

478
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,359
I've roamed the world for years.

479
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,880
I've seen a lot of women.

480
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,999
But only Young Mistress was able to gain my respect and admiration.

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,640
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

487
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,590
Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

488
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:59,870
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there was still no hurt ♫

489
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,510
♫ Forever being together ♫

490
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,060
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

491
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:14,230
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

492
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:21,420
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

493
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:28,500
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

494
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,760
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

495
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,710
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

496
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:50,080
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there was still no hurt ♫

497
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:56,550
♫ Forever being together ♫

498
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,590
