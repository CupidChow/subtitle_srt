[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,630
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,830
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,190
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,440
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,930
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,060
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:43,950
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,090
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,470
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,230
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

13
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,290
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,610
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,860
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:12,030
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,380
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,590
♫ You know who I am ♫

[The Wolf]

[Episode 38]

21
00:01:32,469 --> 00:01:35,030
Zhang Jin! Zhang Jin!

22
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,040
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

23
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,059
You had a nightmare.

24
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,860
You are in the palace.

25
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,139
Thousands of imperial guards are outside protecting you.

26
00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,340
Your Majesty is safe here.

27
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,890
What is this medicine you gave me?

28
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,288
My mind has never known peace since!

29
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,189
Your Majesty, according to the imperial physicians,

30
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,730
Your Majesty must recuperate in peace for a time

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,789
in order to have a full recovery.

32
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,829
Get lost!

33
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,798
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,739
I've decided.

35
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:18,699
Prince of Bo, who was the leader of the Night Fiends, has betrayed me.

36
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,680
He must be removed from the ranks.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,359
You'll take over his place.

38
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:26,459
As Your Majesty wishes.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,270
But I still need another person

40
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,390
to overseer state affairs

41
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,320
and manage the court.

42
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:40,879
I need someone to take care of the situation after the defeat.

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,760
Yao Ji, as the leader of the Night Fiends,

44
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,800
I want to know if you could recommend someone for the job.

45
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,879
Your Majesty, the Second Prince may not be the perfect candidate,

46
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,099
but under the current circumstances,

47
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:00,979
he is our only viable option.

48
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:03,980
So I should let him out to handle state affairs?

49
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,120
Zhang Jin, make the arrangement.

50
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,740
I need to rest.

51
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,780
I understand.

52
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,640
Your Highness.

53
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840
I need to escape.

54
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,559
I can't be a sitting duck here.

55
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go.

56
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,320
Planning an escape by jumping off?

57
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,519
What are you doing? What are you doing?

58
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,319
Let go of me!

59
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,819
Come.

60
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,300
Do you enjoy having revenge on me?

61
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:25,859
You want revenge because

62
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,579
I trained Wolf Boy like he was a hound!

63
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:30,660
How is this revenge?

64
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:35,519
This is the best relationship we can have,

65
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,579
the most wonderful distance between us.

66
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:40,560
Is that so?

67
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
You're Chu Kui's lapdog,

68
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,139
do you think you're a man?

69
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
Stop lying to yourself.

70
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,239
You are completely devoid of humanity!

71
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,319
If you insist on insulting me,

72
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,679
you'll soon find out

73
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:06,540
if there is any humanity left in me.

74
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,379
Landslides frequently happen on Qi Mountain.

75
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:14,799
One wrong step and you will fall from the cliff.

76
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:19,980
Make sure both you and Young Feudal Mistress Ma are safe.

77
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,759
What are you doing?

78
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,360
Nothing.

79
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:01,160
Why won't you do as I say?

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,239
Put me down! Put me down!

81
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,419
Put me down!

82
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,199
Put me down!

83
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
You will come across a rapid stream.

84
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,919
You must pass it.

85
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,440
I am worried Young Mistress Ma is in no condition to overcome the current.

86
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,400
I am worried the water of that stream will make her wound fester.

87
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,959
It's too dangerous. I can walk on my own.

88
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,299
Shut it.

89
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,779
I told you I can walk. Do you hear me?

90
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,180
Put me down!

91
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,459
It's too dangerous. Put me down!

92
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,639
Crossing this stream recklessly will put both of us in danger.

93
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,539
Quickly put me down.

94
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,319
I want you to put me down!

95
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,439
Do you even hear me?

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,500
What should I do to make you listen to me for once?

97
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,480
Let go of me!

98
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,859
I tried playing nice.

99
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,800
Do you want it the rough way?

100
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,659
Let go of me.

101
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,060
Stop!

102
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,360
What are you doing? Stop!

103
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,580
Let go of me!

104
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,320
Stop! Let go of me!

105
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,930
You...

106
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,800
♫ You brushed my shoulder and continued on ♫

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,710
♫ We are clearly in love ♫

108
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,280
♫ Yet we gave up our persistence ♫

109
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,010
♫ Hiding in the night ♫

110
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,820
♫ Hiding one's weakness ♫

111
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,520
♫ We are all like trapped beasts ♫

112
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,360
♫ Having no freedom ♫

113
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,900
I initially thought of making you take it off yourself.

114
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,340
But you are such a nuisance.

115
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:46,060
It seems like I must do it myself.

116
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,939
When did you become so shameless and despicable?

117
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,360
♫ Watching you but I can't move forward ♫

118
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,140
♫ Love steps back into my memory ♫

119
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,659
If you ever try to escape again,

120
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,900
I will make sure you meet your end

121
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,800
in this wilderness.

122
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,118
Winter may have arrived.

123
00:11:23,118 --> 00:11:26,960
But Qi Mountain has a subsurface heat source.

124
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,740
When it's noon, the sun will be hot

125
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,710
and if the heat invades the body,

126
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,080
her life will be in danger.

127
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,100
Young Mistress Ma must not wear thick clothes.

128
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,790
♫ I still don't understand ♫

129
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,600
♫ How painful letting go is ♫

130
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,780
Come.

131
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,940
♫ Causing me to lose my freedom ♫

132
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,190
♫ I stand on the street across from you ♫

133
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,360
♫ Personally burying this warmth ♫

134
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,940
♫ No matter how painful or how much love there is,
don't say it anymore ♫

135
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,180
♫ Watching you but I can't move forward ♫

136
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,920
♫ Love steps back into my memory ♫

137
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,340
♫ Love in opposite sides ♫

138
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:26,220
♫ There's no you and me ♫

139
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,710
♫ I stand on the street across from you ♫

140
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,658
The plants are plagued by insects.

141
00:12:56,658 --> 00:12:58,318
Food is scarce.

142
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:02,479
Even if there were any fruits, most are already rotting.

143
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,518
Eating those fruits harms the body.

144
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,840
My Lord, you must be cautious.

145
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,719
Eat this.

146
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,660
I don't want to drag your corpse back.

147
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,940
What is it?

148
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,940
Help!

149
00:14:02,219 --> 00:14:04,539
Search! Check the area!

150
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,439
Area's clear! Search over there!

151
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:36,279
What? Finally came to your senses?

152
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,980
You gave up?

153
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,360
Who were those people?

154
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,620
Soldiers of Jin.

155
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,960
They were clearly the Bo Army.

156
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,140
But you hid from them.

157
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,180
You even lied to me.

158
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,419
Why did you lie to me?

159
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
How do you know they were the Bo Army?

160
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,098
The Jin Army use star-scale mails.

161
00:15:05,098 --> 00:15:08,200
The Bo Army uses chain-mail.

162
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,419
The sounds of their movements are entirely different.

163
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,999
I heard the sound of chain-mail earlier.

164
00:15:15,739 --> 00:15:18,679
Yes, they are the Bo Army.

165
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,600
They were once my subordinates.

166
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,900
But sadly they are now ordered to capture me.

167
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,800
If they find us,

168
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,900
they will trade me in for a reward,

169
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,080
the others will do the same with you.

170
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,319
What's in it for me anyway?

171
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:44,040
This is weird. With your wits,

172
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,159
you should know escaping and asking for help

173
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,900
will do you no good at all.

174
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,079
Why do you keep making the same mistake?

175
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,300
The Wolfbone Flower's side effects are getting worse.

176
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,680
If the pain makes me lose control, Zhaixing will be hurt.

177
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,139
It's almost nightfall.

178
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,000
I must take her to safety.

179
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,040
I mustn't put her in danger.

180
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,559
Come, we'll stay here for the night.

181
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,060
I'll get us some food.

182
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:31,539
You...

183
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,100
What's wrong?

184
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,219
What's wrong with you?

185
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,480
You're burning up.

186
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:21,440
Hurry. Hurry!

187
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,299
Run!

188
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,880
Wolf Boy...

189
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,440
Zhaixing.

190
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,860
You were in great pain.

191
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:55,100
Is it because I used the Wolfbone Flower on you?

192
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,219
I had never seen you suffer the side effects.

193
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
Why?

194
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,799
Because I want to live.

195
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
I realize...

196
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:23,039
I don't know you at all.

197
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,999
Then don't bother.

198
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:28,139
Don't even try to.

199
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,459
I can walk on my own.

200
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:18,279
Use this.

201
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,120
Tell me if you feel too warm.

202
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,820
I'll find a place for you to get changed.

203
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,460
Stop! What are you doing?

204
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,640
I initially thought of making you take it off yourself.

205
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,340
Let go of me!

206
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,219
But you are such a nuisance.

207
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,960
It seems like I must do it myself.

208
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,599
When did you become so shameless and despicable?

209
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,379
Is he worried I might get heatstroke?

210
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,220
Throughout the journey,

211
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,740
all the fruits he gave me weren't rotten.

212
00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:25,860
This is a spring stream.

213
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,899
Clean your body with the water.

214
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,139
It will help with your wound.

215
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,079
I'll ring the bell to let you know that I'm nearby.

216
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,639
You have nothing to be worried about.

217
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,720
But remember, you can't escape.

218
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,320
Is that clear?

219
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,060
Close your eyes and turn around!

220
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,919
What's wrong?

221
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:41,319
My clothing fell into the water.

222
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:43,119
Where is it now?

223
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,340
Southwest of where you're standing.

224
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,000
A little forward.

225
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,239
To the left.

226
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:09,820
Move forward a little.

227
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,340
Don't peek!

228
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,499
A little forward.

229
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,600
To the left!

230
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,539
To the left!

231
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:27,279
Almost there!

232
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,219
Why aren't you talking?

233
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,620
Here.

234
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,940
I miss Wolf Boy.

235
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:08,659
Do you?

236
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,890
♫ I have always been guarding here ♫

237
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,310
♫ Nothing has changed ♫

238
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,790
♫ Like that star a billion years ago ♫

239
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,700
♫ Still twinkling ♫

240
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,500
I'll start a fire.

241
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,520
♫ Looking past the starry night ♫

242
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,700
♫ Your gaze was firm and warm ♫

243
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,950
♫ Like it was telling me ♫

244
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:01,010
♫ Wait for me; Falling down for you ♫

245
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,100
♫ Falling down; Igniting the fireworks of love ♫

246
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:13,000
♫ Fireworks vibrating ♫

247
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,970
♫ Silence; Falling down soundless ♫

248
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,010
♫ Falling down; Falling down to love's embrace ♫

249
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:28,500
♫ Only for a promise ♫

250
00:30:31,419 --> 00:30:33,319
What are you doing?

251
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,920
It seems like we have the same doubt.

252
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,579
Don't play tricks on me.

253
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,299
Everything that is good was given by you.

254
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:57,559
The rules were set by you.

255
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:00,800
I was so confused.

256
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,479
When I hated you the most,

257
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,159
I realized you did everything for my own good.

258
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:11,159
I realized...

259
00:31:12,239 --> 00:31:15,439
Even as Prince of Bo,

260
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,100
you still have the nature of Wolf Boy.

261
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,780
Do you realize how disgusting you are right now?

262
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:39,220
You act like a woman in a brothel.

263
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,159
You pretend to play nice just to please the man.

264
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,720
You are seducing me, testing me,

265
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,420
to see if I still have feelings for you.

266
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,360
I'm not pretending.

267
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,439
I know Wolf Boy very well.

268
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,640
I'm not seducing you.

269
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,539
I just hope that you can realize the error of your ways.

270
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:03,819
You think too highly of yourself.

271
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,800
As you said earlier,

272
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,100
you don't know me at all.

273
00:32:10,379 --> 00:32:15,019
What I don't understand is why you hurt yourself because of Chu Kui!

274
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,440
You're not me! You won't understand it!

275
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:26,980
In front of you, I am Wolf Boy.

276
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:30,840
I was a man who could barely speak.

277
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:38,999
But I owe my life to my father emperor.

278
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,971
Will you really give up

279
00:32:41,971 --> 00:32:45,130
on your humanity over power and status?

280
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:51,079
You shouldn't try to understand me.

281
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,780
You shouldn't try to read my mind.

282
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,139
I've already become a monster you won't recognize.

283
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,980
You need to stay away from me.

284
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,820
You need to fear me.

285
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,240
Stop testing me.

286
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,119
You will only hurt yourself even deeper.

287
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:12,619
Normally people pay to watch a drama,

288
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,660
but your play last night was awful.

289
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:22,199
She cares about you so much but you treated her so poorly.

290
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:25,599
I could see your love for her in those eyes,

291
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:28,319
but you just wouldn't tell her.

292
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,739
That was so awful.

293
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:38,059
Here is a Wolfbone Flower for you.

294
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:42,940
After all, you should be paid for the effort.

295
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,059
Don't lose it.

296
00:36:46,059 --> 00:36:50,440
This is the Wolfbone Flower you specially prepared for Zhaixing.

297
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,740
When I found out it was you who saved Zhaixing

298
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,960
and sent Zhuiri to show me your location,

299
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,359
looking back at the past raises more doubts for me.

300
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,100
So I came for answers.

301
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,739
You've always been careful.

302
00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:13,199
How could you let the spy who knew your weakness reach me

303
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:16,200
and even divulge to me that the Wolfbone Flower can kill you?

304
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,460
The only possibility was that you let the spy reach me on purpose.

305
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:26,759
It's already irrational that the spy was so lucky.

306
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,118
But next, we managed to acquire the Wolfbone Flower.

307
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:35,258
Then you agreed to make a compromise back in Boxiang after seeing the butterflies were released.

308
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:39,460
All of these seemed too suspicious.

309
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:41,619
I have no idea what you are talking about.

310
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,920
In conclusion, you wanted Ma Zhaixing to take your life at Boxiang.

311
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,779
With your life, you could fulfill her wish to kill you.

312
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,259
Prince of Bo's change of heart was confusing and even baffling.

313
00:37:59,259 --> 00:38:01,319
I don't get it.

314
00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:06,419
I am sure Ma Zhaixing would want to know it, too.

315
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:11,639
Don't tell her.

316
00:38:12,879 --> 00:38:17,579
I wanted to use my life to pay her back.

317
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:23,259
But as Prince of Bo, I must stop Chu Kui from committing evil.

318
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:30,439
When I found out that my brother's death was part of my father's plan,

319
00:38:30,439 --> 00:38:32,760
I made my decision.

320
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,539
The battle of Boxiang will be the end of me.

321
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,180
I can help Youzhen thwart Chu Kui's tyranny.

322
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,260
I can finally win Ma Zhaixing back with my death.

323
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,439
She can be set free from grudges and know peace.

324
00:38:52,439 --> 00:38:55,700
Ma Ying's case isn't that simple, right?

325
00:38:56,259 --> 00:39:00,159
The Night Fiends and I were spying on Ma Ying in Kuizhou.

326
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,220
But Chu Kui gave the Night Fiends a kill order behind my back.

327
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,659
He spared Zhaixing so that he can restrain the Ma Army in the future.

328
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:10,520
I was kept in the dark.

329
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,279
When I found out the truth, it was too late.

330
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,020
Why didn't you tell her last night?

331
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,019
You made her believe you're an unforgivable villain!

332
00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:22,999
I was the leader of the Night Fiends.

333
00:39:22,999 --> 00:39:26,700
And I toyed with her love, I made her suffer so much sorrow.

334
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,240
Do you want her to hate you forever?

335
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,059
This hatred won't last long.

336
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,380
I'll return to the capital tomorrow.

337
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,500
You're going back?

338
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,380
You'll be charged with treason.

339
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,739
You're as good as dead.

340
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:51,760
So the next time she hears about me,

341
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,279
I will have been sentenced to death for treason.

342
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:59,020
She will feel satisfied that I got what I deserved.

343
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,959
She can finally be at peace with herself.

344
00:40:01,959 --> 00:40:06,640
What if she finds out the death of her family had nothing to do with you,

345
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,938
that you gave up the battle of Boxiang for her,

346
00:40:08,938 --> 00:40:11,499
that you protected her at Qi Mountain with your life,

347
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:15,019
and that you were never as heartless as she thought?

348
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:18,559
But then you are gone,

349
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,839
and she will never be happy.

350
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,540
So do not let her know the truth.

351
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,920
All my life I've brought her too much pain.

352
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:36,980
Since I am certain to die,

353
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,499
then let the truth be buried with me.

354
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,939
Don't let her suffer again.

355
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,439
I won't help you.

356
00:40:46,439 --> 00:40:49,100
This goes against my code.

357
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,619
I only know that the two people in this world who care

358
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,140
for her happiness the most are me...

359
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:02,619
and you.

360
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:10,020
In the battle of Boxiang, I saved Zhaixing.

361
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,719
Jin will suspect our relationship.

362
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:14,619
You must keep her safe.

363
00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:16,840
Do not let her name be tarnished.

364
00:41:18,939 --> 00:41:20,539
Ji Chong,

365
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,600
I place all my hopes for her in your hands.

366
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,440
Escape is an option for you!

367
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,960
You know you'll die, so why must you go back?

368
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,399
I should be the one to die,

369
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,640
not my innocent Brother Youzhen.

370
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:47,520
I must save him.

371
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,960
I have a feeling that had we not fallen in love with the same woman,

372
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,219
had we not been enemies,

373
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,499
we would have been friends.

374
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,460
Friends?

375
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,180
You won't have that chance.

376
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,120
I am destined to be alone forever.

377
