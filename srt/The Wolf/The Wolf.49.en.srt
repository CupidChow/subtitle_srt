Even if you only have half a year left,

you must live your life to the fullest.

I'm sorry.

Take a rest for now.

25
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,759
You need to fall asleep

26

so that I can leave and complete

promise me not to be stubborn.

You can do anything with others.

00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,159
Where is Chu Youwen?

52
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:09,519
He couldn't make it.

53
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,540
Pass my words to Chu Yougui.

54
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,480
I want to meet him.

55
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,479
Ma Zhaixing has come instead?

56
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,119
Your Majesty, Ma Zhaixing told me that Lord Bo is on the verge of death.

57
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,820
His final wish is to see Chu Youzhen safe and sound.

58
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,599
That's why she took the risk to come here.

59
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,238
She's willing to pay any price.

60
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,398
She's even willing to order the Jin Army to retreat,

61
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:37,879
in return for Chu Youzhen back.

62
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,659
Is Lord Bo really going to die soon?

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,019
Or are they scheming something

64
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,920
to make me let down my guard?

65
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:55,160
Your Majesty, as I see it, if it wasn't because Lord Bo was dying,

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,780
he wouldn't have let Ma Zhaixing jeopardize her life.

67
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,199
It's too soon to tell whether he really is dying or not.

68
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,939
As for what she said about withdrawing the army,

69
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:11,319
although she's nominally the princess,

70
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,040
would she really keep her promise to command the Jin Army?

71
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I asked her the same question.

72
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,820
Ma Zhaixing bluntly replied that even if the Jin Army refuses to obey her, once her Ma Family Army retreats,

73
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,859
the remaining Jin Army has no choice but to retreat as they are at a disadvantage.

74
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,079
She has a point.

75
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,319
But before I see Lord Bo die in front of me,

76
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,140
I will still have suspicions about his death.

77
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,520
Never mind, Ma Zhaixing is just a weak woman.

78
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,739
What tricks could she have up her sleeve?

79
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:59,720
Besides, she's entering Suyang like a lamb to the slaughter.

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,039
Let her in.

81
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,100
Yes.

82
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,720
Your Majesty, what about Yao Ji?

83
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,780

His Majesty has summoned you.

86
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,100
I'll only enter the city after Youzhen is released.

87
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,220
Release the traitor, Chu Youzhen, and bring him to the Grand Hall.

Hold on.

90
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,259
His Majesty has agreed to release Chu Youzhen

91
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,120
but he only allowed you to enter alone.

92
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,159
Please.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,940
Tell Chu Yougui that I'll enter the city alone.

94
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:32,690
You figured that Chu Yougui would take such precautions, right?

95
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,840
Even though I'm all on my own,

96
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,800
I have to enter the city

97
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,359
so that Lord Bo and the others have a chance to survive.

98
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,279
Today, I asked you to come together to Suyang

99
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,239
because I want to exchange something with you.

100
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
You...

101
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,720
After we exchange the hairpins,

102
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,320
it will enter the city with me on your behalf.

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,579
Now that we've exchanged the hairpins,

104
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:51,579
I'll see us as sworn friends now.

105
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,459
If I don't make it back,

106
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,059
take good care of Lord Bo on my behalf.

107
00:11:02,719 --> 00:11:07,220
Thank you, Yao Ji.

108
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,680
You're saying that you want to meet Chu Yougui?

109
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,339
Since I'll die very soon,

110
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,060
why not make use of my identity as the princess to have a peace talk with Chu Yougui?

111
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,900
I'll agree to withdraw my troops.

112
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,520
In this case, he'll certainly let Youzhen go.

113
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,259
Judging from the current situation,

114
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:45,160
as the princess, I will be more useful to him than Lord Bo anyway.

115
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,959
How can Jin possibly agree to this?

116
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,140
Of course, we have to keep it from them.

117
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,120
I want you to make arrangements

118
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,478
and secretly bring me to Yang without the King of Jin or anyone else being aware of it.

119
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:03,440
If you go to Yang

120
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,219
and Chu Yougui decides to kill indiscriminately,

121
00:12:08,219 --> 00:12:10,699
you will never come out alive.

I know how hard it will be.

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:44,900
When I didn't see you, I was chasing after our past,

constantly feeling guilty and remorseful.

133

When I saw you again, I was still chasing after Wolf Boy and Lord Bo.

Whether I love you or hate you, I've never let go of you.

Ma Zhaixing, the last time we met at Imperial City,

141
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,080
you were the princess consort of Lord Bo.

142
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,239
Then, you became the princess and fought with me at the Longevity Forest.

143
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:20,999
We finally meet again now. You've come a long way indeed.

144
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,659
Same to you.

145
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,059
You went through a lot on your way

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,220
and sacrificed everything.

147
00:15:29,439 --> 00:15:32,558
In order to gain something, you have to lose something.

148
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:35,300
Just like today, you came here to reconcile with us.

149

Don't you have to lose something in order to gain something as well?

My third brother is going to die soon, right?

He'll surely live a long life.

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,619
I only have one requirement for reconciliation.

153
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,739
If you open the gate and surrender the city,

154
00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:00,280
I'll accept your submission and I won't obliterate everyone.

How dare you, Ma Zhaixing!

How dare you speak such arrogant nonsense and humiliate His Majesty?

157

I repeat! Open the gate and surrender the city,

and I will spare your lives.

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,900
That's why you've lost your mind.

161
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,739
Kill!

162
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:42,799
- Lord Bo is here!
- Release the arrows!

163
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,860
Although you're now Lord Bo,

164
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,099
you'll always be the kind-hearted Wolf Boy on Langshou Mountain.

165
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,259
You have someone you'll do anything to protect, too.

166
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,420
Lord Bo,

167
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,840
there must someone whom you care about the most.

168
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,999
You're not a monster,

169
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,019
you're a human!

170
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,859
Life is short and unpredictable.

171
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,079
We never know who will leave us in the next moment of life.

172
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,719
I think

173
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,860
perhaps we should cherish every moment that we have.

174
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,320
Your life is beset with hardships.

175
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:37,239
I don't believe God will be so harsh on you.

176
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,999
I won't give up,

177
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:43,919
and you shouldn't give up, either.

178
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,240

I'm willing to grab the chance at all costs

00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:12,198
we wouldn't have had to wait so long to be together.

185

We've made it through eight to nine years.

186

We experienced misunderstandings,

that the real monsters

254

00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,200
If I repay evil for evil, the blood debt will never be cleared.

322
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,400
I'll take Sister Zhaixing as a model,

323
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,300
and try to reconcile with the enemies and get along with them.

324
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:52,600
Her Highness treated everyone as part of the same family.

325
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,500
Everyone in this world is part of the same family.

326
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,679
Young Feudal Princess, look at this.

327
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,800
Peace has returned to the world

328
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,339
all thanks to you.

329
00:33:53,419 --> 00:33:55,939
When the enemy troop shot me with an arrow,

330
00:33:55,939 --> 00:33:59,600
the amber on my chest saved me and so I survived.

331
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,760
But it broke because of that.

332
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,759
I tried every way to find someone to restore it.

333
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:11,000
Today, I'm here to express my gratitude and apologize as well.

334
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,900
I have no idea what you're talking about.

335
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,979
Is that so? I'll get going then.

336
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:01,020
Don't look at me! Get lost!

337
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,700
You have got to tell me why you gave it to me.

338
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,739
At first, I didn't intend to let you know.

339
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:15,079
But I didn't know how I should treat you.

340
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,158
I didn't want you to scold me or hate me.

341
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,579
Hence, I secretly left the Qitan Guardian Stone for you.

342
00:35:24,439 --> 00:35:28,040
I didn't expect you to put it on.

343
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,360
I'm so happy that it protected you on my behalf.

344
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,739
Go back and pack up your things quickly.

345
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:50,859
Are you chasing me away again?

346
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,300
Who is going to chase you away?

347
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,340
I want you to pack up your things and wander around the world with me.

348
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,920
We can enjoy the sea of beauties together.

349
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,239
♫ Eternity may not be far away ♫

350
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:11,279
Hurry up!

351
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,879
Wait for me!

352
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:18,100
Wait for me!

353
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,779
Slow down!

354
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:24,538
Little One, you're so slow. How are you going to travel around with me?

355
00:36:24,538 --> 00:36:26,000
Who are you calling Little One?

356
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,279
You.

357
00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:28,520
You...

358
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:33,959
I'll call you Little One from now on!

359
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,818
I'm not Little One! You are!

360
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,440
As for free-spirited Brother Ji Chong,

361
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,520
I heard that he has embarked on a new journey.

362
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,500
He goes where the wind blows.

363
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,059
But now he's accompanied by someone throughout his journey.

364
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:56,290
♫ One more gaze and let's see who will melt whom ♫

365
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,320
♫ One more hugging practice until perfection is achieved ♫

366
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:05,239
Mo Xiao and Hai Die kept their promise to Wen Yan.

367
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:08,898
They've in fact settled down in a small town in Jiangnan.

368
00:37:08,898 --> 00:37:13,199
They adopted many orphans and treat them like their own children.

369
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,019
Little Wen Yan.

370
00:37:20,019 --> 00:37:23,320
Wen Yan, get up.

371
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,638
Did you hurt yourself?

372
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:30,878
Don't cry. Little Wen Yan is the bravest boy, right?

373
00:37:30,878 --> 00:37:32,319
I won't cry.

374
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,160
When I grow up, I want to protect my little brothers and sisters.

375
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,640
That's great. It's all right now.

376
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,059
Are you still in pain?

377
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,279
- No.
- No?

378
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,360
Don't run so fast.

379
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,040
Are you thinking about him again?

380
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,400
How could I possibly forget about my brother?

381
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,198
- Be careful after this.
- Brother Mo Xiao.

382
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:02,558
- Brother Mo Xiao.
- Brother Mo Xiao, come play with us. Let's play the Eagle Catch Chicken, okay?

383
00:38:02,558 --> 00:38:05,178
Knock it off. Go play by yourself.

384
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:06,819
- Be good. We'll play for a while then.
- Just for a while.

385
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,999
- Just for a while.
- Okay. Let's go.

386
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:10,198
Come, let's go.

387
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:12,039
Let's go.

388
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,918
Go and play.

389
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:16,479
- As for Sister Yao Ji...
- I'm coming!

390
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:18,940
She's no longer working for the court,

391
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,460
but focusing on manufacturing medicine to save people.

392
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,040
It seems like his poison will wear off very soon.

393
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,779
After saving him, I still have to save millions of people more.

394
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,619
All these years, you have cured all kinds of strange poisons and saved countless people.

395
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:54,420
Your kindness will surely be rewarded.

396
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,279
Just leave all the rewards to Ma Zhaixing.

397
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:01,959
She has saved all of us.

398
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,400
As for Third Brother,

399
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,759
after he went away with Sister Zhaixing,

400
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:20,159
no one has ever seen them again.

401
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,339
However, in the world of wolves,

402
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:27,300
once they lose their partner...

403
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,999
Third Brother eventually chose to follow behind Sister Zhaixing.

404
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,620
Although they've left,

405
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,378
we'll always remember a story.

406
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,120
Once upon a time, there was

407
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,260
a little boy and a little girl

408
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,840
on Langshou Mountain.

409
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,699
They see each other as the most important person.

410
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,638
The boy brought the girl into the world of wolves.

411
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,900
Because he let

412
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,820
the girl forget the sorrow in the human world.

413
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,120
Don't come over.

414
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,638
I'm stronger than them. I can do it on my own.

415
00:40:17,638 --> 00:40:19,919
Back then, they didn't know

416
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:24,279
that they'd fallen in love with each other

417
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:27,999
long before they knew their feelings.

418
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:31,960
Although fate

419
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,279
made them hate each other,

420
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,320
love can cure everything.

421
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:45,579
This is the story of Wolf Boy and Xing'er.

422
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,180
Wishing them to be full of love

423
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,360
in another world.

424
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:16,120
Wolf Boy!
