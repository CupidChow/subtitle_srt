♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,460
[Episode 23]
Your Majesty, Lord Duan said that

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,978
my father had always been guarding the borders and was away from home.

22
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,139
He only came back once a year or every six months.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,938
Leaving the defense forces and going back home was a secret order.

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,499
If there was no spy among the higher-ups,

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,559
how would the murderer obtain such accurate information?

26
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,360
Second Prince colluded with our enemy, Jin.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,019
They had constant communication.

28
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,159
When we went to Qitan with Prince of Bo,

29
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
Second Prince tried to use the same method to kill us.

30
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,119
Shut up!

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,519
Kneel.

32
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,619
Your Majesty, now we're at this point,

33
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,560
if the real culprit is still hiding, I beg Your Majesty to seek justice for Ma Manor.

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,980
Ma Zhaixing, oh, Ma Zhaixing.

35
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
You...

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,060
I was heartbroken and couldn't sleep every night because of You Gui's matter.

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,359
And now you are working together with a criminal now to create rumors to defame a prince.

38
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:29,020
What you are doing is like stabbing a knife through my heart.

39
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,000
I dare not.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,819
I know I am acting recklessly.

41
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,959
I just hope Your Majesty can investigate the Ma Manor case again

42
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,519
and let me join the investigation so I can study all the details and doubtful points.

43
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,920
If I indeed misunderstand Second Prince, I am willing to be punished.

44
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,778
Shut up!

45
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:50,759
No one can investigate the Ma Manor case anymore!

46
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,800
Why?

47
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,839
Is Your Majesty protecting Second Prince because you are afraid that he's involved?

48
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:59,140
Or does Your Majesty know that there's more to it than meets the eye and is trying to hide it from the public?

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,418
How dare you! How dare you!

50
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,520
Men!

51
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,280
- Take the criminal, Ma Zhaixing, to prison!
- Your Majesty, the Ma Manor case is doubtful.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,540
Please re-investigate it, Your Majesty!

53
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,339
Your Majesty!

54
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,880
Please re-investigate it, Your Majesty!

55
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,479
My Lord,

56
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:21,179
Eunuch Jin sent someone to summon you and Prince of Bo to the palace to meet His Majesty.

57
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:24,559
What did Eunuch Zhang Jin say?

58
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,058
Tell Prince of Bo.

59
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,498
He said Commandery Princess went to see His Majesty

60
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:32,339
and suspected Second Prince of colluding with the Jin Army to kill her family.

61
00:03:32,339 --> 00:03:35,698
She requested His Majesty to re-investigate the assassination

62
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,639
which His Majesty got enraged and has forbidden anyone from investigating the Ma Manor case again.

63
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,659
She is now in prison.

64
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,458
Lord Bo, no matter how smart Ma Zhaixing is, she will still lose her cool

65
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:50,319
after she finds out about the real culprit.

66
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,659
So, this is what you've been aiming for.

67
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,320
I will definitely tell Father that Ma Zhaixing fell into your trap and you were the one who had pulled the strings from behind.

68
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,980
You won't.

69
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:04,740
Don't forget.

70
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,559
If His Majesty finds out about Hong'er,

71
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:10,039
not only will you become a criminal,

72
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,699
what do you think will happen to the people of the Night Fiends like Mo Xiao?

73
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:18,979
His Majesty has ordered that whenever anyone from the Night Fiends betrays, everyone will be punished.

74
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:23,640
If you don't obey me,

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,300
I will report this to His Majesty.

76
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,640
The price will be the lives of everyone from Bo Manor.

77
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,719
Idiot!

78
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:42,439
Look. How did you keep an eye on Ma Zhaixing?

79
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,039
How dare you bring this letter to me!

80
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,658
See for yourself! See for yourself!

81
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,439
Did you know about

82
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,159
this letter full of nonsense written by Duan Yanyu long ago?

83
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,520
I didn't.

84
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,779
You didn't?

85
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,439
Duan Yanyu's letter which is full of his imaginations and conjectures

86
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,759
have made Ma Zhaixing suspicious about the death of Ma Ying.

87
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,138
Yes!

88
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,840
This case is unrelated to You Gui.

89
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,840
But if Ma Zhaixing doesn't stop

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,899
and keeps investigating in detail, can you guarantee that she won't find the truth?

91
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:33,439
I've told you long ago.

92
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,999
Ma Zhaixing is not a simple person.

93
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:42,840
I've witnessed her wisdom in solving a case many years ago.

94
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,219
After that, she showed her decisiveness and wits in Bao Na's case.

95
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,599
In front of Youzhen, she even turned your case around in the First Prince's case.

96
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,900
That's enough to know

97
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,419
that she can't be underestimated.

98
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,619
Your Majesty, Ma Zhaixing must die.

99
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:04,940
Why don't we get rid of her?

100
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:10,740
Yes. I regret keeping her alive.

101
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,719
Youzhen sent back a military report today. Taibao Battalion is just as I expected.

102
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:21,640
I've ordered the Ma Army to prepare and attack them soon.

103
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,720
Once I'm done using the Ma Army and wait till they are no more than an army with injured and disabled men,

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,560
I will have

105
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,299
no more reason to keep Ma Zhaixing alive.

106
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:34,899
Emperor Father!

107
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:37,418
Prince of Bo!

108
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,560
Prince of Bo. Prince of Bo!

109
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,520
Do you know why I've never really tried to harm her before?

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,700
That's because I've always been taking into account your feelings.

111
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,740
Yes.

112
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,240
I remember.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,840
Prince of Bo, I don't care what methods you use.

114
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,960
You must stop Ma Zhaixing

115
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,039
from having any thoughts of reinvestigating the Ma Manor case.

116
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,939
Never!

117
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,719
I'm sure you hate me.

118
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:29,079
The letter that provoked Zhaixing was your scheme.

119
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:31,620
That's right.

120
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,599
Ma Zhaixing fell for it.

121
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:41,599
You can finally come back

122
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,599
and become the real Prince of Bo.

123
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:47,279
Even if I'm the Prince of Bo,

124
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,579
I will become one who wants to kill you every day.

125
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,840
Sir, your candied hawthorns.

126
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,759
The last Commandery Princess of Kuizhou

127
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,319
loved these candied hawthorns the most?

128
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,258
Do you mean Commandery Princess Zhaixing?

129
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,979
My candied hawthorns were her favorite.

130
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:33,698
Then, I want all your candied hawthorns.

131
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:38,560
Also, tell me everything about what Commandery Princess Zhaixing likes.

132
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:44,340
She and I are acquaintances.

133
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,879
I can't see her now and miss her a lot.

134
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,299
I can only remember her with an object.

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,659
Princess Zhaixing loved to go to the restaurant in front

136
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:02,639
and liked to watch their shadow plays.

137
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,399
She was always praising Mr. Fang's dishes.

138
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,880
Unfortunately, both Mr. Fang and his daughter died from an accident.

139
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,099
They are dead?

140
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,219
Yes.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,618
We thought it was just a fire in their house.

142
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:21,299
Unexpectedly, a few days ago,

143
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:24,440
Mr. Fang's corpse was found on a river bay

144
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,659
by a woodcutter dozens of li away from here.
(T/N: one li is around 500 meters)

145
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,760
They even reported it to the official.

146
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,300
Mr. Fang was actually killed and the accidental fire was just a cover-up.

147
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:40,399
The fire was just the murderer's distraction.

148
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,060
A distraction like that is very usual.

149
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,938
That's... But Mr. Fang was friendly and never had any enemies.

150
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,459
Even the local court had no clue.

151
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:57,499
They offered a reward of a hundred taels of gold to those who can assist in their investigation.

152
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,760
A reward of a hundred taels of gold?

153
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,240
Spinning Flower Leaf?

154
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,861
Isn't this a strong poison created secretly in the palace?

155
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,380
Why did the court do so much to kill a petty manager?

156
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,378
[Bo Royal Manor]

157
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,800
Mo Xiao, what should we do now?

158
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,440
All of us can't visit the Commandery Princess at the prison.

159
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
His Majesty has ordered that no one can visit her, not even Prince of Bo.

160
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,320
But you can prepare some clothes first.

161
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,039
Also, it's cold in the prison. Prepare some yellow wine, too.

162
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,558
I'll talk to the wardens and see if they will let us bring these things inside.

163
00:11:16,558 --> 00:11:18,998
- All right. I'll get it done.
- All right.

164
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:34,599
Yao Ji planned to let the Commandery Princess find out about the assassination accidentally

165
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:38,059
in order to destroy the Commandery Princess,

166
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:40,519
to get her revenge from five years ago.

167
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,039
It's my fault.

168
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:47,939
I knew that woman was planning something yet I still underestimated her.

169
00:11:47,939 --> 00:11:50,279
We have no time to blame ourselves right now.

170
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,339
We have to think of a way to rescue Commandery Princess.

171
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,699
Five days later, Zhaixing will be released.

172
00:11:56,699 --> 00:11:59,200
We have to clear her suspicion.

173
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,439
I couldn't even protect the girl I love.

174
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,459
How is he?

175
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:23,839
What's wrong?

176
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,138
Master can usually overcome pain and illnesses. What is going on?

177
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:29,379
Master has been restricting himself.

178
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:32,000
He must have been enduring it all this while.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,179
It must be Yao Ji!

180
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,299
Master!

181
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,680
- Master!
- Master!

182
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,499
Get the Heart Chains. Master!

183
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,100
Get the Heart Chains! Hurry!

184
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,539
Wen Yan.

185
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,399
- Wen...
- Wen Yan.

186
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,680
If Master couldn't kill Hong'er, you should have just done it for him!

187
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,739
But I didn't want to do that.

188
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,380
You've forgotten.

189
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,320
We are Night Fiends.

190
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,800
We are His Majesty's tools.

191
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:44,039
Master is confused because of Commandery Princess.

192
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,279
Have you turned stupid as well?

193
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,120
If His Majesty finds out, none of us can live.

194
00:13:53,179 --> 00:13:55,959
You are good at fighting, right?

195
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,880
Can you oppose His Majesty?

196
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,539
Can you oppose everyone?

197
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,940
You are right.

198
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,140
For Master, I am willing to oppose anyone.

199
00:14:08,619 --> 00:14:14,460
Mo Xiao, you had the chance to finish the job for Master.

200
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,621
But because of your vacillation, now...

201
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:20,099
But I like to see Master in his current situation. Can't I?

202
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:22,399
I've never seen Master smile.

203
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,259
I've never seen Master so happy before.

204
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,320
The same goes for all of you.

205
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,039
When did we ever have a hotpot together with messy faces

206
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,980
and laugh out loud happily?

207
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,739
When did we ever play pitch pot together and have so much fun regardless of our status?

208
00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:42,399
Never.

209
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,279
You and I both know that was just a short-lived moment.

210
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,860
That was not Prince of Bo.

211
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,959
Do you forget?

212
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,399
We are all orphans from the war.

213
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,980
We were neglected by the world.

214
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,959
Ever since we joined the Night Fiends,

215
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,120
we have had no choice.

216
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,320
At least this time,

217
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,039
my choice is the same as Master's.

218
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,739
What should we do now?

219
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,360
Mo Xiao and I will take care of Master.

220
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,320
Go to the prison

221
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,740
and ask Commandery Princess not to investigate the case anymore.

222
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:37,839
I will figure out how to deal with the rest.

223
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,440
All right. I'll go there now.

224
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,680
It's time to spy on the enemy.

225
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,879
Commandery Princess.

226
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,079
Hai Die.

227
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,719
These clothes can protect you from the cold.

228
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:07,100
If you feel cold, warm yourself up by drinking wine.

229
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,240
Hai Die, do me another favor.

230
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,498
I want to write a blood letter to His Majesty

231
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:17,039
to explain about the meeting which I had when Prince of Bo was not around

232
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,379
so His Majesty won't be angry with him.

233
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:23,659
I chose to meet His Majesty alone because I was hoping that Prince of Bo

234
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,599
would never get involved in anything.

235
00:16:26,599 --> 00:16:28,039
Prince of Bo returned suddenly.

236
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,599
He was summoned by His Majesty and told about this matter.

237
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:32,979
Is he well?

238
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,000
Commandery Princess, don't worry. His Highness is fine.

239
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,360
His Majesty did not punish him.

240
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,900
He was just anxious to know the details and sent me here.

241
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:45,659
That's great.

242
00:17:13,239 --> 00:17:16,159
I just sneaked into the Grand Diviner Palace.

243
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,800
The key reason for Master not being able to fight against Yao Ji

244
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:26,100
is that he didn't kill Hong'er.

245
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:30,320
The only way is to tell His Majesty

246
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,820
that I was the one who failed to kill Hong'er.

247
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,020
What did you say?

248
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,180
If no other people are related to what happened to Hong'er

249
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,540
and Master was only fooled by me, with me shouldering the blame,

250
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,720
Yao Ji will no longer have anything to threaten Master.

251
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:56,199
As for Commandery Princess,

252
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,459
I'll just say that after Yao Ji found out I failed, she threatened me with it,

253
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:05,260
and forced me to provoke and frame Ma Zhaixing.

254
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,919
Wen Ya, do you know what you are talking about?

255
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:14,420
If you do that, His Majesty will give you a harsh punishment.

256
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,480
You are gambling with your life.

257
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,499
If we don't solve this problem,

258
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:23,340
Master will forever be threatened by Yao Ji and be under her control.

259
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:33,559
When I first joined the Night Fiends,

260
00:18:34,219 --> 00:18:36,919
I was the slowest to improve my martial arts.

261
00:18:38,459 --> 00:18:43,720
Without Master's help, I would've died

262
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,680
in the first several missions.

263
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,980
If I have to repay Master,

264
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,920
my life alone will not be enough.

265
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:07,760
Also, you must not let Mo Xiao find out about this.

266
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,759
If he knows, that fool will be the first to sacrifice himself to protect every one of Bo Manor.

267
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:16,299
Mo Xiao and I owe Master a lot, too.

268
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,901
You shouldn't be the one to shoulder this alone.

269
00:19:18,901 --> 00:19:21,779
I treated His Majesty's injuries from previous wars.

270
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,820
I have some contributions.

271
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,339
I'm the only one who has a chance of not getting killed.

272
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:29,279
Will His Majesty believe you?

273
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,940
I have my own way.

274
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,538
I've found out that Hong'er's body is still in the Grand Diviner Palace.

275
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:37,339
I've also hidden some evidence there.

276
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,419
If His Majesty starts an investigation,

277
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,640
he will surely find the evidence.

278
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,859
Wen Yan...

279
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,000
We have no time.

280
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,280
Farewell.

281
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:22,120
You are saying there's another reason for Ma Zhaixing

282
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,800
to reinvestigate the Ma Manor case?

283
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,219
This is a serious matter.

284
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:29,900
Stand up and tell me.

285
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,540
No.

286
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,258
I am guilty of a grave crime. I can't stand up.

287
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:37,420
You are the most cautious in the Night Fiends.

288
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,300
What crimes could have you committed?

289
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,200
After Your Majesty ordered me to assassinate Hong'er and her father,

290
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,420
I made a mistake so they managed to escape from us.

291
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:52,219
You didn't do it?

292
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:57,518
After Mr. Fang's death, Prince of Bo ordered me to assassinate Hong'er in the attic.

293
00:20:57,518 --> 00:21:01,279
I was guilty and violated the Night Fiend's code.

294
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,339
I got emotional and failed to kill Hong'er.

295
00:21:04,339 --> 00:21:06,859
I only burned the place down

296
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,499
and reported to Prince of Bo that I had killed her.

297
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:16,740
When I left, I didn't expect Hong'er to still be alive.

298
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,359
Finally, she fell into Prince of Bo's enemy's hands.

299
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,919
Who is it?

300
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,339
Yao Ji.

301
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:30,359
Yao Ji blackmailed me when she found out that I failed the mission.

302
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,120
Your Majesty should know Yao Ji lost to Prince of Bo before.

303
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,659
When Yao Ji found out Prince of Bo was infatuated with Ma Zhaixing,

304
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,978
she wanted Prince of Bo to feel the pain of losing someone he loves.

305
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:42,218
Yao Ji ordered me to work with her in collusion

306
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,939
and tricked Ma Zhaixing into visiting Duan Yanyu's old house.

307
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,579
With the help of the Duan Family's servant, we forged Lord Duan's letter

308
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,720
to confuse Ma Zhaixing.

309
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,039
I don't believe you.

310
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,219
You are someone from the Night Fiends and you are most loyal to Prince of Bo.

311
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:02,659
You would never fail this easily and betray Prince of Bo.

312
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:07,880
Wen Ya, are you sure you are not trying to save Bo Manor

313
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,440
by making up such nonsense to fool me?

314
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,979
I dare not!

315
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,400
Your Majesty,

316
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,259
do you still remember?

317
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,520
When I was young and first met Your Majesty,

318
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:29,020
I was holding a female corpse in my arms.

319
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,099
I remember.

320
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:35,179
It was your younger sister who died of illness

321
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:40,099
who inspired you to study medicine for your whole life. Am I right?

322
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:45,599
Hong'er looked similar to my younger sister who died of illness.

323
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,840
I got emotional and betrayed Master.

324
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,138
Your Majesty, everything was manipulated by Yao Ji.

325
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:53,940
As far as I know,

326
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,560
the Duan Family's servant and Hong'er's corpse are still in Grand Diviner Palace.

327
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,279
The army seal used to forge Lord Duan's letter is in Grand Diviner Palace, too.

328
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,579
Your Majesty can investigate to verify it.

329
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,498
How do I dare to lie to Your Majesty?

330
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:05,859
Does Prince of Bo know about this?

331
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,470
Master has always been in the dark about this.

332
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:12,320
I did everything by myself.

333
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,858
You were emotional and failed your assassination.

334
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:20,239
You were even threatened by Yao Ji

335
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:24,279
to betray Prince of Bo and lie to me.

336
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:29,499
Aren't you afraid that I will sentence you to death?

337
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,480
I've been feeling anxious.

338
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,840
I'm telling Your Majesty the truth

339
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:39,019
because I don't want to disappoint Your Majesty and Prince of Bo.

340
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,960
I can only redeem myself with death.

341
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:54,780
You've been loyal all these years.

342
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,419
Your misconduct was because of your sister's death.

343
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:01,560
You've made a lot of contributions in the Night Fiends

344
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,339
and treated my injuries.

345
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,739
I can spare you from the death penalty

346
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:13,499
but do you know what the punishment is for failing a mission

347
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:16,540
as a member of the Night Fiends?

348
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,920
Destruction of every meridian vessel.

349
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:24,598
Your Majesty, I am not afraid of death.

350
00:24:24,598 --> 00:24:26,180
I only wish for Yao Ji to be executed.

351
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,600
To prevent Prince of Bo from saving Ma Zhaixing,

352
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,250
she even used Wolfbone Flower secretly to stimulate the adverse effects hidden within Prince of Bo!

353
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:40,499
I'll know whether you're telling the truth

354
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:45,039
after I have the Grand Diviner Palace searched.

355
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,140
Come in.

356
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:57,218
Lord Yao Ji, bad news.

357
00:24:57,219 --> 00:25:00,698
The imperial guard commander has ordered for the Grand Diviner Palace to be surrounded.

358
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:02,140
What?

359
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,059
- Let's have a look.
- Yes, Master.

360
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,978
This is the Grand Diviner Palace.

361
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:22,098
All of you are unqualified to come here.

362
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,080
Get lost!

363
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,539
If the Imperial Guard are unqualified to enter the Grand Diviner Palace,

364
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:30,700
what about me?

365
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,979
Yao Ji greets Your Majesty.

366
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:39,919
I wonder why Your Majesty visits here so late at night?

367
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,899
- Zhang Jin.
- Yes.

368
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:05,519
Your Majesty, this is the letter written by Duan Family's servant to Commandery Princess Ma.

369
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:07,458
Yao Ji read it in the Grand Hall.

370
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:09,979
Tell me the truth.

371
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:13,200
Was this letter forged by you?

372
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,019
I wonder who framed me and fooled Your Majesty into believing such nonsense.

373
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,720
I am willing to confront him.

374
00:26:21,499 --> 00:26:22,579
Search this place.

375
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,579
Yes.

376
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,180
Search this place!

377
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,218
Bring out all the corpses!

378
00:26:53,219 --> 00:26:54,619
Yes!

379
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:02,258
Your Majesty,

380
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,499
I've found two corpses in the secret room.

381
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:06,599
One of them is a girl around 14 years old.

382
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,700
The other is the corpse of the Duan Family's servant.

383
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:16,338
I was doubtful at first.

384
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:19,720
It seems that Wen Yan is telling the truth after all.

385
00:27:21,739 --> 00:27:26,540
You threatened him to work with you to provoke Ma Zhai Xing

386
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:32,030
to be suspicious of the Ma Manor case because he failed to kill Hong'er.

387
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,778
Your Majesty, Wen Yan is making a baseless accusation.

388
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,940
He must know that I... Your Majesty.

389
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,561
We've found the Duan Family's army seal and Wolfbone Flower.

390
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,979
All the evidence is here.

391
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:56,359
If you didn't threaten Wen Yan with Hong'er

392
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:59,759
and use the Duan Family to forge the letter,

393
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:04,980
how do you explain the corpses and the army seal in your palace?

394
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:11,759
Besides, you even have the guts to make Prince of Bo lose his mind.

395
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,780
I've got solid proof.

396
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:19,300
You did all these to get revenge on Prince of Bo, right?

397
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,300
Yao Ji, you are so good at scheming.

398
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,539
I dare not.

399
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:26,859
- I was just–
- Shut up!

400
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,300
Besides tricking me,

401
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,858
you even dared to manipulate the case of the Ma Family and frame Second Prince.

402
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,780
Men!

403
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,339
Take Yao Ji into prison.

404
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:42,659
Seal the Grand Diviner Palace.

405
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,060
Yes!

406
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,179
Your Majesty.

407
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,780
Shut up!

408
00:28:57,499 --> 00:29:01,419
Your Majesty, about Princess Ma in prison...

409
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:04,979
Go to the prison and bring her to me.

410
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:07,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

411
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,850
By His Majesty's decree,

412
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:17,130
after you confess your crimes to Commandery Princess Ma

413
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:21,700
and clear Commandery Princess Ma's doubts on the Ma Family annihilation,

414
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,519
His Majesty will consider sparing your life if he finds you worth using.

415
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,080
I obey His Majesty's decree.

416
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,500
Commandery Princess.

417
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,900
His Majesty summons you.

418
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,200
Eunuch Zhang, what is going on?

419
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,218
Princess,

420
00:30:13,219 --> 00:30:16,459
the letter from Lord Duan that you gave to His Majesty

421
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:20,519
was a set-up by Yao Ji.

422
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,939
Why would she do that?

423
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,739
Yao Ji has always been holding a grudge toward Prince of Bo.

424
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,900
She lied to you and tricked you to go to Duan Manor.

425
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:39,299
After that, she handed you a letter written by Lord Duan

426
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,019
that she forged to provoke you to take revenge

427
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,180
and persuade you to lie to His Majesty,

428
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,779
so His Majesty would punish Prince of Bo and his subordinates.

429
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:53,379
This was all planned by Yao Ji.

430
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,920
Yao Ji,

431
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:15,600
you deliberately went against me only to take revenge on Prince of Bo?

432
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,180
Five years ago, he made me lose everything.

433
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,980
Now, I'm going to make him suffer.

434
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,300
Ma Zhaixing, don't think that you will be safe after this.

435
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,540
If you really love Prince of Bo, leave him.

436
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,339
I'm telling you clearly.

437
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:39,159
Your ending with Prince of Bo is cursed.

438
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,760
His true self is not what you can accept.

439
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,339
How dare you!

440
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,440
How dare a criminal like you speak nonsense?

441
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,480
Do you have a death wish?

442
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:57,018
Commandery Princess, His Majesty is still waiting for you.

443
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:21,700
Do you think I will just go down like this?

444
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:26,999
I will get more opportunities by hiding in the dark.

445
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,999
Criminal Ma Zhaixing is here to see Your Majesty.

446
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:44,558
As you were. I don't blame you.

447
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,560
I can only blame the culprit for setting you up.

448
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:55,180
Even so, I still have to be blamed for suspecting Second Prince.

449
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,739
It's just that I still have some doubts.

450
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:01,440
If Yao Ji wanted to frame me to take revenge on Prince of Bo,

451
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,320
there were many ways for her to harm me.

452
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,500
Why would she do that to provoke me to ask Your Majesty

453
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,580
to reinvestigate the Ma Manor case?

454
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,258
I'm sure she was afraid of getting involved in it.

455
00:33:16,259 --> 00:33:17,820
For her own safety,

456
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,460
it was better to use me to achieve her goals.

457
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:27,839
By doing that, even Prince of Bo could do nothing about it.

458
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:32,739
How could she guarantee that Your Majesty would be angry when I requested it?

459
00:33:32,739 --> 00:33:36,259
If you still have doubts,

460
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:39,780
that means you are blaming me for being careless

461
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,939
and concluding this case hastily.

462
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,179
I dare not.

463
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:47,019
Since Yao Ji confessed her crimes, the culprit has been found.

464
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,738
I was just overthinking.

465
00:33:48,739 --> 00:33:51,299
Your Majesty has already explained.

466
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,099
I dare not speak another word.

467
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:55,338
All right.

468
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:57,338
Since the case has been solved,

469
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:59,840
I don't want to cause any more trouble.

470
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,879
The most important issue at hand is Prince of Bo.

471
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,498
What's wrong with Prince of Bo?

472
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:09,720
In order to stop Prince of Bo

473
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,060
from protecting you in this matter, Yao Ji stabbed Prince of Bo.

474
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:18,958
Fortunately, his injuries were treated immediately. He is fine now.

475
00:34:18,958 --> 00:34:24,219
But Prince of Bo is still in a coma.

476
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,938
Go and visit him.

477
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,259
I've prepared the carriage for you.

478
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:30,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

479
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,079
I will be leaving.

480
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,620
Ma Zhaixing is very smart.

481
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,159
She worries me.

482
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,860
She shouldn't be kept alive any longer.

483
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,419
Your Majesty is wise.

484
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:54,079
However, this involves Prince of Bo...

485
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,000
Don't worry.

486
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,119
As the leader of the Night Fiends,

487
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,480
he knows what to do.

488
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,380
Everything has been decided.

489
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,879
This will be a good lesson for him

490
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:11,399
so he will not be foolish and get emotional next time.

491
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:13,199
Reporting!

492
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:21,198
Your Majesty, Fourth Prince has sent an urgent military report.

493
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:24,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,859
You may leave.

495
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,160
Yes.

496
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:47,859
Great. Fantastic.

497
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,259
As expected.

498
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:55,020
The Jin Army's Taibao Battalion is indeed located by the Beiliao River.

499
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:00,319
Also, the Jin Army's rations are all gathered here.

500
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:05,759
Taking down this place will definitely hurt the Jin Army's morale.

501
00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:10,240
Your Majesty has captured the Jin Army by its throat.

502
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,000
We can't miss this opportunity.

503
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,979
We need to strike before they make a move.

504
00:36:16,979 --> 00:36:19,440
But according to the report,

505
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,639
Taibao Battalion is heavily guarded by elite soldiers.

506
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,898
It is stronger than I expected.

507
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:31,020
Any army deployed for this battle will suffer from heavy casualties,

508
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,920
and won't be able to recover no matter if they win or lose the battle.

509
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,700
Come here.

510
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,280
Which unit do you think is the most suitable for this job?

511
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,040
Ma Family Army.

512
00:37:26,259 --> 00:37:29,558
Move! Zhaixing is my princess consort.

513
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:34,099
Only Wolf Boy...

514
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,698
Xing'er!

515
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,900
You made it in time to save me.

516
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,920
Every time I was in danger,

517
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,899
His Highness sacrificed himself to save me.

518
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:51,899
But what have I ever done for him?

519
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:53,839
Who are you?

520
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,259
Do I still know you?

521
00:37:56,259 --> 00:37:59,619
No matter how much you refuse to believe this, you still have to eat.

522
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,219
Remember to take care of yourself.

523
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:25,298
Commandery Princess, don't worry.

524
00:38:25,298 --> 00:38:27,979
Master is strong. They are just flesh wounds.

525
00:38:27,979 --> 00:38:30,920
The wounds will recover after a few days of rest.

526
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,639
Yao Ji is so despicable.

527
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,839
She used my feelings for the Ma Family.

528
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:45,220
It's also my fault for not being alert enough so His Highness has been harmed.

529
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,280
Commandery Princess, don't worry.

530
00:39:05,419 --> 00:39:07,299
It's all my fault.

531
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,379
Commandery Princess, Master will wake up soon.

532
00:39:12,379 --> 00:39:17,059
I'm sure Master wouldn't want to see you feeling sad and blaming yourself.

533
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,500
Young Feudal Mistress, I think Hai Die is right.

534
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,539
Why don't we go back and take a rest?

535
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,499
We will visit Prince of Bo again when he wakes up.

536
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,399
No.

537
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:36,820
I'm staying here with him until he wakes up.

538
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:41,780
Commandery Princess, since you've decided,

539
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,780
we will leave for now.

540
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,738
Call us if you need anything at night.

541
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:48,760
We will be right outside.

542
00:39:52,419 --> 00:39:53,719
Let's go.

543
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,980
Your Highness.

544
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,410
Your Highness, have you woken up?

545
00:40:16,179 --> 00:40:18,179
Xing'er.

546
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:19,879
What did you say?

547
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,939
Are you thirsty? Do you want a drink?

548
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,000
What did you say?

549
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,680
Xing'er.

550
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,440
Xing'er.

551
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,620
Xing'er is here.

552
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,920
Xing'er will not go anywhere.

553
00:41:57,699 --> 00:41:59,199
Your Highness.

554
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,720
Your Highness.

555
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:14,199
You are awake.

556
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,320
It really is you.
