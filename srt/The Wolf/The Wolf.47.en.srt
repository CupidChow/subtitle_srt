♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:31,910
♫ But gentleness is always invincible

8
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,090

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,099
[Episode 47]

21
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:36,979
I didn't see anything.

22
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:39,838
I'm here just to send you some water.

23
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,918
Just pretend I'm not here.

24
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:43,438
I'm not here. Carry on with it.

25
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,259
Don't go.

26
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,100
I was looking for you.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,060
Hold the horse stance properly.

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,340
And sit down.

29
00:01:55,919 --> 00:01:58,838
- Sit down.
- I have.

30
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:00,479
Stand properly.

31
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,880
Use your strength.

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,280
I want to drink water.

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,639
Why does your leader suddenly want to teach you martial arts?

34
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,800
I have no clue, either.

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,038
He said he may not be able to always protect you.

36
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:30,659
So he wants to teach me all he knows.

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,379
I found it strange, so I asked him where he's going.

38
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,379
Then, what did he say?

39
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,638
He said he wants to go to the front line.

40
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,758
And he may be away for a year and a half.

41
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,180
He hoped I can learn to protect myself and you, Sis Zhaixing.

42
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,398
And I said, "You should protect your woman yourself.

43
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:01,420
Why should I protect Sis Zhaixing?"

44
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:07,220
Then, why did he say?

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,620
He said he hopes he can always protect you, too.

46
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,819
But the world is unpredictable.

47
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,780
Actually, I don't understand what he said.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,739
It's nothing.

49
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,759
He's just too worried.

50
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,120
I won't let him leave us.

51
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,080
He wants to leave?

52
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,599
He's surely forgotten his promise with my father.

53
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,719
He has to take care of me until I grow up.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,199
Don't think he can use the war as a pretext to abandon me.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,160
He's not abandoning anyone.

56
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,999
The real him is very kind,

57
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:10,200
and he always thinks of others.

58
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,519
I think he's becoming more and more like my father.

59
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,739
He worries too much about everything.

60
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,480
He's doing all this for your sake.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,600
Don't let him down. Got it?

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,359
Got it.

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,839
Liu'er, come and practice sword fighting.

64
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,580
Go ahead.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,840
Do you know when you were still the Princess Consort Bo of the Bo Royal Manor,

66
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,179
what the moment of the day I liked the most?

67
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,019
Dusk.

68
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,139
It suggested the end of a busy day,

69
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:15,259
and I could go back and see you.

70
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,540
To see you waiting for me sillily at the Bo Royal Manor.

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,780
Once I was back,

72
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,300
you would call me Your Highness.

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,860
That calling...

74
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,620
made all of my exhaustion of that day disappear.

75
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:38,920
What happened when I left the Bo Royal Manor

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,220
and came to Jin?

77
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,660
I busied myself until late every night.

78
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,859
I had no time to think of you.

79
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:54,079
But it's strange.

80
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,600
When I was back,

81
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,160
I could still hear you calling me Your Highness.

82
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,499
But when I turned around,

83
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:04,620
nobody was there.

84
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,518
Sometimes, I would be like the walking dead.

85
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:09,459
I'd walk into your room.

86
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,299
But no one was in there.

87
00:06:20,059 --> 00:06:22,040
That won't happen again.

88
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,240
It's so strange.

89
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,700
How can one affect another's heart

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,270
this strongly and deeply?

91
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,078
Stop being a sweet talker.

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,358
I don't believe that in all these years I was away,

93
00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:00,660
you had no other woman whom you cared about.

94
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,479
No, you're the only one.

95
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,019
Nonsense!

96
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,980
Yao Ji is utterly charming.

97
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,380
Both of you spent a long time together.

98
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,459
I don't believe...

99
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:17,120
you two have never had an ambiguous relationship.

100
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,900
We really haven't had one.

101
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,599
You have no idea how hard the usual Night Fiends training is.

102
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,259
That's the glamorous and considerate Yao Ji!

103
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,060
I don't believe...

104
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,879
You didn't fantasize about it at all?

105
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,459
No.

106
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,138
Tell me the truth. I won't be mad.

107
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:43,279
It's true.

108
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,200
Then what about that courtesan of Kuizhou,

109
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,580
Miss Lu Fu?

110
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,078
You have a good memory.

111
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,379
That's so long ago, that I'd forgotten it.

112
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,760
Then, who told me that

113
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,960
Miss Lu Fu is so coquettish and he's pleased?

114
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,940
That year,

115
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,339
did this Miss Lu Fu

116
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,799
do a very good job?

117
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,120
That year...

118
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,839
You said only I could cheer you up.

119
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,820
But when I talk about Miss Lu Fu, you...

120
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,110
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

121

124
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,180
I'm not done yet.

125
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,359
You've been doing all the talking.

126
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,320
It's my turn to talk.

127
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,560
Shall we talk about Ji Chong?

128
00:09:20,479 --> 00:09:23,798
And that Prince of Tongzhou whom you almost dated.

129
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,299
Is that so?

130
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,019
You do know that, since I was young, I've only...

131
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,600
I know you desperately missed me.

132
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,700
You rejected ten proposals in Kuizhou because of me.

133
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,470

135
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,810
You're smug.

♫ Who am I without you? ♫

137
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:54,439
How can you be so lovely even when you get jealous and throw a tantrum?

138
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:57,630
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

How good it would be

142
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,040
if we could spend the rest of our life

143
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,759
taking a walk together,

144
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,780
like what we're doing now.

145
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:29,280
♫ You know who I am ♫

146
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,019
No peeking.

147

You can open your eyes now.

Qiaoguo? (T/N: a sesame-flavored Chinese festival food)

149
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:05,939
Qixi Festival is in a few days.

150
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,060
Let's celebrate it together in advance.

151
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,380
It's so fast.

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,059
One year has passed.

153
00:11:17,239 --> 00:11:18,519
Yes.

154
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,659
It's been a hard year.

155
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:30,740
If we had found out the truth sooner,

156
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,279
we wouldn't have had to wait for so long to get together.

157
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,560
We've been through a lot in eight to nine years.

158
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
We've had misunderstandings,

159
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,240
love,

160
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,580
hatred, and regret.

161
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,499
And we're finally together.

162
00:11:54,599 --> 00:12:01,799
All the past tells us that we need to cherish each other more in the present.

163
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,460
Why is there no red thread?

164
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,540
I don't believe in those things.

165
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,779
I just know that

166
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,659
it's enough to have you by my side.

167
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,080
I don't want to think about the many things in the future.

168
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,881
This morning, you refused to tell me what you were making.

169
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,219
I knew it was Qiaoguo.

170
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:06,480
That's why I got the red thread prepared.

171
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,180
You've become good at acting.

172
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,520
You're good at making girls happy.

173
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,599
I'll only be good to you.

174
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,080
Zhaixing, I have something important to tell you.

175
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,480
I tied a dead knot in this red thread.

176
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,540
Because I only want you for my whole life.

177
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,580
But I tied a slip knot here.

178
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,019
If one day I'm gone,

179
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,800
don't be stubborn.

180
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,770
I am that stubborn.

181
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,519
It's been eight years.

182
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,340
For the next eighteen years,

183
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,359
twenty-eight years, I plan to live like this.

184
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,699
Zhaixing...

185
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:50,019
I'm not listening. I don't want to.

186
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,100
I'll say no more.

187
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,830
Okay, I'll never mention it again.

188
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:23,920
What's in there? Why is it hard?

189
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,800
It hurt too much to lose you.

190
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,620
I couldn't lose the memories between you and me.

191
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,100
You're the stubborn one.

192
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,530
Get some rest early tonight.

193
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,979
I need to practice sword fighting every night,

194
00:16:20,979 --> 00:16:24,139
and prepare to deal with Chu Yougui.

195
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,679
You're not feeling well. Don't practice for too long.

196
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,679
You're leaving in two days.

197
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,739
I don't want you to get too tired.

198
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,600
Whether it's practicing sword fighting or saving people,

199
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,440
you must come back soon.

200
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,079
I promise you.

201
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,040
Brother, why do we practice sword fighting late at night?

202
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,960
Why do I have to blindfold myself?

203
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,359
This is mind training. It's to feel the breath of all things.

204
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,039
Also, you're gifted.

205
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:39,159
You'll definitely be invincible in night battle.

206
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,660
Let's begin!

207
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,260
Older Brother,

208
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,740
is that you?

209
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Older Brother, did you show yourself

210
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,660
to give me a warning?

211
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,920
Fourth Brother is in danger.

212
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,939
By the order of His Majesty, you cannot leave at will, Your Highness.

213
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:55,598
Imperial guards, how many of our men are hiding among them?

214
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:57,100
About five hundred.

215
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,938
Here's my decree. An assassin broke into the palace.

216
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:03,180
Without my order, no one cannot act recklessly.

217
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,599
- Yes!
- Yes!

218
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,000
Lord Zi Shen!

219
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,279
Lord Zi Shen, Eunuch Zhang Jin is out there.

220
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,940
He said it's a matter of life and death.

221
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,799
Life and death?

222
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,100
Yes.

223
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,338
Grand Diviner isn't around, and he came here at this late hour.

224
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,759
Could it be that the plan to catch him has gone wrong?

225
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,060
Eunuch Jin, this is Zi Shen.

226
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,999
We're in trouble.

227
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,380
Lord Yun wants to revolt.

228
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,339
He's really mobilized the troops.

229
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,278
How did he... That's impossible.

230
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:06,999
Could it be that he's seen through it, and beat us to it?

231
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,600
So...

232
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,520
His Majesty asked me to come and ask

233
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,299
if your lord has received any news?

234
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,478
She just received the decree and left to dispatch troops.

235
00:21:17,478 --> 00:21:19,960
Why did he revolt all of a sudden?

236
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,660
His Majesty assumed that the news about dealing with Lord Yun has probably leaked out accidentally.

237
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,879
That's impossible!

238
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,238
Only a few people know about the action.

239
00:21:31,238 --> 00:21:32,619
How could it...

240
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:36,660
Who is most likely the spy?

241
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,720
It can't be an outsider.

242
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,619
Could it... Could it be Lord Bo?

243
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,180
Outrageous! How dare you catch me!

244
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,619
Lord Yun?

245
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,519
It's a trap.

246
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,039
He really wanted to kill me.

247
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,379
And he even joined hands with Lord Bo.

248
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,059
Until now, I'm still no better than that brute!

249
00:22:22,059 --> 00:22:23,598
Eunuch Jin, go!

250
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:27,259
Tell His Majesty that Chu Yougui wants to revolt!

251
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Don't you understand?

252
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,139
I no longer trust Zhang Jin.

253
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:37,000
He is not Zhang Jin.

254
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,599
He just looks like him.

255
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,020
Your Highness, we have caught Eunuch Zhang.

256
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,460
Kill him.

257
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,740
It's time for me to greet my emperor father.

258
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,239
Zhang Jin, fetch me some water.

259
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:08,939
Zhang Jin!

260
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:22,399
Anyone there? Guards!

261
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,879
Where are you all?

262
00:23:39,699 --> 00:23:41,540
Zhang Jin!

263
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,719
Who's that?

264
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,620
Who are you?

265
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:25,880
Are you Zhang Jin?

266
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,099
Who are you?

267
00:25:37,459 --> 00:25:42,519
Emperor Father, it's me,

268
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:46,539
Yougui, who resembles you the most among all your sons.

269
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,420
I am here to greet you.

270
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:14,099
Grand Diviner, the general and soldiers have gathered.

271
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:16,418
We'll be back to the capital tomorrow, and follow His Majesty's order.

272
00:26:16,418 --> 00:26:17,819
Okay.

273
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,600
Could it be...

274
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,859
Surround her!

275
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,318
On this sword is the strong poison hidden in Grand Diviner Palace.

276
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,538
Even though you're able to save your life by getting rid of it, you must be feeling dizzy now!

277
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,279
Brothers, kill her!

278
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,259
We'll be rewarded by Lord Yun! Charge!

279
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,780
Have you heard about it?

280
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,479
- His Majesty has finally decided to let our Fourth Prince take over.
- We've heard about it.

281
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:12,759
That's why we're here.

282
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,460
Yes.

283
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,938
Why did they close the gates?

284
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,019
I don't know. Why?

285
00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:21,118
This...

286
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,679
What's going on?

287
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:23,899
Why did you lock us in here?

288
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:27,919
- Fourth Prince!
- Fourth Prince!

289
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,979
- Why did you tie Fourth Prince?
- I don't know.

290
00:27:29,979 --> 00:27:31,520
Fourth Prince!

291
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,780
Let go!

292
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,239
Release Fourth Prince!

293
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,760
Is everyone here?

294
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,899
You should be the last batch.

295
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:44,480
You...

296
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,180
The last batch who deserves to be killed for being loyal to Lord Xun.

297
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,179
Here is the decree, my fellow soldiers.

298
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:02,639
"The supporters of Lord Xun attempted a rebellion and killed His Late Majesty."

299
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,679
What did you do to my father?

300
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,160
"Fortunately, the wise Lord Yun is blessed by God.

301
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,159
- Before His Late Majesty passed away–"
- Chu Yougui.

302
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,919
"The throne was passed to Lord Yun."

303
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:18,719
Emperor Father has passed away.

304
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:23,879
You killed my father!

305
00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:25,159
Your Highness!

306
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,999
No matter what, you must endure it!

307
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:32,179
Only by living can you take revenge!

308
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,639
"In order to avenge His Late Majesty's death, except for Lord Xun,

309
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,299
all rebels will to be executed!

310
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:41,920
By the order of His Majesty."

311
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,839
Drivel!

312
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,359
Your Highness.

313
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,738
Your Highness! Don't worry.

314
00:28:47,738 --> 00:28:49,838
Lord Bo will definitely come and save you.

315
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,259
He will surely come and save you!

316
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:56,540
He's right!

317
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,359
Lord Bo and Ma Zhaixing will come and save you for sure.

318
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:14,020
So, as long as you're here,

319
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,379
Lord Bo will lose the war even before he fights it.

320
00:29:17,379 --> 00:29:21,439
This is why I spared your life.

321
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,779
Chu Yougui, I'm going to kill you!

322
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,020
I will definitely keep you alive.

323
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,919
You murderer! You killed Father!

324
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,019
How dare you seize the throne!

325
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,639
- Cousin! Cousin!
- Your Highness!

326
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,799
- Your Highness!
- Cousin!

327
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,520
Shoot!

328
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,939
It seems that Imperial City has fallen.

329
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:02,079
The plan against Chu Yougui has failed.

330
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,219
Lord Bo is still waiting for me.

331
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:11,500
I can't fall down.

332
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,079
Lord Bo is waiting for me.

333
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,019
Everyone, you have probably heard about the emergency military situation.

334
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,279
Chu Youzhen has killed Chu Kui.

335
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,885
Youzhen wouldn't do that.

336
00:30:41,886 --> 00:30:44,419
It's impossible that he'd do so.

337
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:46,439
It must be Chu Yougui.

338
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:49,660
What makes you so sure?

339
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,799
I made a deal with Chu Kui.

340
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,479
That we'd enter the capital and capture Chu Yougui in few days,

341
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,280
and Youzhen would take over the throne.

342
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,580
I think Chu Yougui was made aware of our plan and beat us to it.

343
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,419
King of Jin, please pardon me for hiding the truth.

344
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,400
I understand why you did so.

345
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:21,339
General, Chu Kui has just passed away.

346
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:24,380
This is our opportunity.

347
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,579
But it's hard to take down Mingzhou immediately.

348
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:30,718
I'm afraid we need to give up on this opportunity to attack the enemy.

349
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,219
No.

350
00:31:32,219 --> 00:31:34,639
Chu Kui left a will when he was still alive.

351
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,479
If something happens to him, we can attack Mingzhou within three days.

352
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,139
Great!

353
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,899
Although Chu Kui wasn't a wise ruler,

354
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:50,020
he sure was far-seeing.

355
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,239
He left us a countermeasure.

356
00:31:54,239 --> 00:31:55,639
Great.

357
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,519
Our troops will ambush around Mingzhou, and respond in advance.

358
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,560
Once we break through Mingzhou, we can slowly advance on the capital and save your brother.

359
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,039
Yelu Bao Na!

360
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,639
Do you have to disobey me, our father,

361
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,340
and the traditions left behind by our ancestors, and marry that man?

362
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,598
Brother!

363
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:24,838
Even if you put me under house arrest for ten days or ten months,

364
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,420
I won't change my mind!

365
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,819
Say it! Who is that man?

366
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:31,560
I won't say it!

367
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:46,290
My good Bao Na,

368
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:51,280
you can have any kind of good man that you want.

369
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,780
But you can't marry someone who lives far away.

370
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,279
This... You...

371
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,559
Stop fooling around!

372
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,938
Hurry up. Put it down!

373
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,699
No matter how open-minded we are, we can't tolerate a princess who takes off her pants on the spot.

374
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:15,180
You...

375
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:17,099
Look, Brother!

376
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:20,678
Hurry up. Quickly untie it.

377
00:33:20,678 --> 00:33:23,399
No! Take a good look!

378
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:27,039
This is the fetter you gave to me.

379
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,799
There's no way I can head towards happiness.

380
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,819
I...

381
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,880
I...

382
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:37,979
Stop fooling around!

383
00:33:37,979 --> 00:33:40,779
I'll have to jump like this for my whole life!

384
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:42,280
You...

385
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,159
Quickly get over here.

386
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,219
Keep an eye on the princess.

387
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:48,820
Yes.

388
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,819
Brother!

389
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:54,800
Princess!

390
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:00,920
I will definitely escape from here!

391
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,319

[Yang, Mingzhou]

393
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,140
The guards have retreated from Mingzhou.

394
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:37,659
It seems that Chu Kui's plan has worked.

395
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,438
This general has extraordinary hearing.

396
00:34:40,439 --> 00:34:42,678
It's impressive that he can hear the guards' whereabouts.

397
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,660
Why does it seem that the princess can hear it, too?

398
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,020
Naturally, I can't hear it.

399
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,420
But I can read his expressions.

400
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,220
Your hearing is correct.

401
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,640
Zhuiri has come with the signal.

402
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,799
The last decree of Chu Kui is indeed to have all the guards retreat.

403
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,718
Our troops can go and take down Mingzhou at once.

404
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,640
Even if the enemy fights back, it's no use.

405
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,158
Because Mingzhou has fallen.

406
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,380
If we keep pursuing and attacking the enemy,

407
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,958
our troop will surely break through Imperial City of Suyang.

408
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:27,700
That's risky! We should explore the surroundings again!

409
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,020
Both of them have such great chemistry.

410
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,959
They look like a perfect match in every way.

411
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,840
Young Marshal, I've said the wrong thing.

412
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,720
No, they're indeed a match made in heaven.

413
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,479
That's undeniable.

414
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,778
Let's go back with the general first.

415
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:05,560
Ke Lang, you'll stay in Taiyuan and gather forces.

416
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,100
To attack Mingzhou, we need to expand armed forces for the war.

417
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,059
Yes, Young Marshal.

418
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Are you all right?

419
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,700
I'm all right.

420
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:51,320
You amber, aren't you supposed to give me courage and luck?

421
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,180
I came all the way here to Jin.

422
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,580
You...

423
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,798
I beg you, please have a heart. Let me be by Ji Chong's side. I beg you.

424
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:04,039
Lord Chuan is not short of weapons or food!

425
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,519
He is short of ambitious men to join his new troop

426
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,519
and kill the Chu and destroy Yang together!

427
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,559
Those enlisted will receive food rations!

428
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,279
Let's end the tyranny together!

429
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,819
Those enlisted will receive food rations!

430
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,638
Let's end the tyranny together!

431
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,100
Those enlisted will receive food rations!

432
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,900
Let's end the tyranny together!

433
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,319
You!

434
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,918
Did you say those enlisted get to meet Lord Chuan and receive food?

435
00:37:30,919 --> 00:37:31,799
Yes.

436
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,438
We're about to attack Suyang.

437

In order to train the troops, he worked late into the night.

438
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,420
The new troops will be led by Lord Chuan himself.

439
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,438
Brother, you want to join?

440
00:37:43,439 --> 00:37:46,379
Of course! Lord Chuan is my...

441
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:50,638
He's my inspiration.

442
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:53,439
I'll work late into the night with him.

443
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:54,899
Great.

444
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:36,999
Are you okay?

445
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,060
All this time,

446
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,400
you've relied on the medicine that Yao Ji left behind.

447
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,519
- I'm afraid...
- You underestimate me.

448
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,020

Where can one find such a hospitable woman who cooks so well?

I've learned a few dishes to make your body stronger.

Let me do it.

00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,238
Careful.

454
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:24,039
No problem.

455
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,560
I'm here.

456
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,200
It's okay.

I've overestimated myself.

I can't even manage such a small thing.

463

That's not the case.

464
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,099
I'm kidding.

I'm all right.

For you. For Liu'er.

He managed to get enlisted with that body?

474
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,359
Shorty, I heard you've been taking good care of the war horses.

475
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:05,459
- Keep it up.
- Yes.

477
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:08,520
Lord Chuan has arrived at the drill ground.

478
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,020
Send these two outfits over.

492
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,220
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

493
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:51,150
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

494
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:58,400
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

495
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,890
♫ Forever being together ♫

496
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,010
