[Who Am I (我是谁) by Jolin Tsai (蔡依林) & Jony J (肖佳)]

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,710
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,800
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,200
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,280
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,920
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,110
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,860
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,100
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,460
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,300
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,270
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

14
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,620
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:05,820
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:12,020
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey (You took away what I care about and all my attention)  ♫

17
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,310
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey 
(But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

18
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:25,020
♫ You know who I am ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,040
[Episode 41]

21
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,420
It's so strong.

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,799
Stronger is better.

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,699
We can get drunk faster.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,559
You know how much I like you.

25
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,039
In this perfect hour,

26
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,600
it's just the two of us in this room.

27
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:51,579
If I hadn't gotten myself drunk out there

28
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,000
and had another strong drink here,

29
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,980
how would I be able to control myself?

30
00:03:05,559 --> 00:03:07,919
Why would you want to control yourself?

31
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,219
Because I want to wait until you really fall in love with me,

32
00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:40,279
and when you want to become my wife without any other reasons.

33
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:47,079
That is when I will truly have you.

34
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:51,400
Today's our wedding day.

35
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,819
I'm perfectly content

36
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,299
to see you blushing.

37
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,980
Don't be afraid.

38
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,380
There will be ample time for us.

39
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,499
Tonight, let's get a good sleep first.

40
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,899
A decree from His Majesty.

41
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,700
You won't be executed,

42
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,799
but you'll still be punished.

43
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:47,000
You'll be a slave forever.

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,920
You'll be escorted to Qiannu Battalion tomorrow between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m.

45
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,399
Second Prince will escort you there personally.

46
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,720
He finally figured it out?

47
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,739
He knew he wouldn't vent his hatred by killing me.

48
00:07:01,739 --> 00:07:04,100
So he made me go crazy.

49
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,239
I know you hate Wolfbone Flower.

50
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:12,400
But this is the only way to save your life.

51
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,100
So what if I'm alive?

52
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
I might as well die.

53
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,359
At the execution ground,

54
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,039
the whole world would get to see my terrifying look.

55
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,040
Staying alive is just being on my last legs.

56
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:35,240
If you've given up on yourself and want to die,

57
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,660
there's no rush.

58
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,320
Your life in the Qiannu Battalion will be a very dangerous one.

59
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,000
Second Prince won't have to do it himself.

60
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,359
Those slaves in the battalion hate you very much.

61
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:51,099
They can kill you anytime, anywhere.

62
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,079
Does it matter?

63
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:56,019
I deserve to die.

64
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,300
You feel that you're very sinful.

65
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,219
You feel guilty about what you did to First Prince and Ma Zhaixing.

66
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:08,298
So you want to repent by taking your own life?

67
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:13,300
Do you think you can dismiss your mistakes by killing yourself?

68
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,640
It's not that easy.

69
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,300
You don't get to get off lightly.

70
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,899
If you really want to repent, stay alive

71
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:27,758
and see yourself about how happy Ma Zhaixing is without you, lying in some other man's arms!

72
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,379
Provocation doesn't work on me.

73
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,539
But you're right.

74
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,379
I can't be let off lightly.

75
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,038
Here.

76
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,059
Take this medicine with you.

77
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,440
It can temporarily relieve your pain.

78
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:24,059
All this time,

79
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,639
I can't tell if you're an enemy or a friend.

80
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,760
We seem to be using each other.

81
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,580
It also seems that we're born to be rivals.

82
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:41,140
Now that I've ended up this way,

83
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,640
I can see clearly now.

84
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,499
Yao Ji, why did you help me

85
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,019
and put yourself in danger?

86
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:07,579
You're underestimating me.

87
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm very capable.

88
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,800
If I weren't confident,

89
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,059
I wouldn't have risked my life to save you.

90
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,139
But saving me wouldn't do you any good.

91
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,719
Of course it would.

92
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,059
But you need not know it.

93
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:43,340
I want to know.

94
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,079
Do you have to sacrifice yourself for giving me this medicine?

95
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm going to beat you to death!

96
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,619
Your Majesty.

97
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,080
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

98
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,419
All this happened because of you.

99
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,980
How dare you ask for mercy!

100
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,340
You...

101
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,159
You... Who allowed you to get whipped for her?

102
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,581
She and I are Night Fiends members that share the same fate.

103
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:27,440
I will recapture the runaway rebels.

104
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,639
Fine.

105
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:40,539
You have three days to recapture them.

106
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:45,719
If not, both of you will go down into hell together!

107
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,880
You were underestimating me.

108
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:11,139
And now you're overestimating my kindness.

109
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,220
Don't worry.

110
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,420
No one will find out that I'm treating you in secret.

111
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,600
And you need not worry about me.

112
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,739
You shouldn't put yourself in danger for a monster.

113
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,540
It's not worth it.

114
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,520
I need your help with two things.

115
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,259
I know what to do with Wen Yan and the rest.

116
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,460
I'll figure out a way to get them out.

117
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,100
What's the other thing?

118
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:58,819
I want to see Fourth Brother tonight.

119
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:04,939
His Majesty has ordered the Imperial guard

120
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:08,239
to surround the Xun Royal Manor.

121
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:11,579
It's protection in name, but it's in fact imprisonment.

122
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,880
Without His Majesty's decree token,

123
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,980
no one can see Fourth Prince in private.

124
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,259
Lord Grand Diviner.

125
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,519
Put the slave into the prison cart.

126
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,020
Yes.

127
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:47,699
Greetings, Prince of Yun.

128
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,380
Your Highness, recently,

129
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,820
there has been a plague nearby the Qiannu Battalion.

130
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,250
Therefore, His Majesty ordered me to come with you to escort the prisoner to the battalion

131
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,220
and check the plague situation.

132
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,239
Last night, Father sent Eunuch Zhang to my manor to deliver the decree.

133
00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:07,059
Since this will put Emperor Father at ease,

134
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,478
thank you for your help.

135
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,158
Don't mention it, Your Highness.

136
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,799
It is my duty after all.

137
00:15:40,479 --> 00:15:43,539
You and Fourth Brother are close to each other.

138
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,159
Although he's in a stupor,

139
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,239
I think he really wants to see you off.

140
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:55,200
So I asked for Father's permission.

141
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,780
After all, it's very likely that this is the last time

142
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,959
you see each other.

143
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,600
Shouldn't you thank me for my mercy?

144
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,540
Thank you, Your Highness.

145
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,580
Remember, don't expose it.

146
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,559
If not, you will let Father down.

147
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:36,679
Fourth Brother, don't be afraid.

148
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,419
Although I can no longer stay by your side and protect you,

149
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,520
but in my eyes,

150
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,699
you're no longer a kid.

151
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,238
You're becoming more and more like Eldest Brother.

152
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:54,599
Be strong and you'll move forward courageously.

153
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:56,500
You'll be fearless.

154
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:05,739
Perhaps we won't get to see each other again.

155
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,519
But you must remember what I said.

156
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,360
I'll live for myself.

157
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,359
You have to promise me, too.

158
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,080
No matter how difficult life is,

159
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,319
you have to live well.

160
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,119
Where there is life, there is hope.

161
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,119
That's so touching.

162
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:44,480
Yet, to live doesn't necessarily come with hope.

163
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
It may be endless despair.

164
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,539
You're right, Your Highness.

165
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:55,239
Due to my misdeeds, I will be a slave forever.

166
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:01,420
I hope you'll learn from my mistakes,

167
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,440
and have mercy on your only brother.

168
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,399
Fourth Brother and I are brothers.

169
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,399
Naturally, we won't kill each other.

170
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,838
Unlike you.

171
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,560
You're not only a slave but also an intolerable monster.

172
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,319
Guards, send Fourth Prince back to the manor.

173
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,579
Yes, Your Highness.

174
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,800
How stubborn he is.

175
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,899
Your Highness, you need not take the monster seriously.

176
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:39,120
Why don't you let me escort the sinful slave to Qiannu Battalion?

177
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,378
You may head back to Imperial City and keep His Majesty company.

178
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:44,580
No, I'll go there myself.

179
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,800
Get ready. Let's go!

180
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,598
Lord Bo isn't dead and became a slave.

181
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:05,438
The situation has changed drastically.

182
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:09,019
I guess you all have found out last night.

183
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,760
We found out the details last night.

184
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,879
Surprisingly, there's infighting in the enemy country

185
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,039
behind the War of Boxiang.

186
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:21,960
It's a dog eat dog world. Serves them right!

187
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,618
Since all this happened because Chu Youyu was killed by his father's conspiracy,

188
00:19:26,618 --> 00:19:31,359
Lord Bo committed treason by trying to conspire with Chu Youzhen

189
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:33,720
and redress his grievance.

190
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,560
Then, how did Lord Bo get away from the execution?

191
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,300
Chu Kui is sinister and cunning.

192
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,739
, Of course, he did so not out of mercy.

193
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,399
You're right, Marquis Wang.

194
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,399
Now it seems that not only has Lord Bo lost a war in Boxiang,

195
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,600
he's also started a rebellion.

196
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,919
Since it's a capital offense, why did he choose to go back?

197
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,519
Of course, it was to ask for mercy.

198
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,600
Didn't he manage to get away?

199
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,100
Juyao, why don't you say something?

200
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,600
You're talking about something that's happened.

201
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,380
There's no need to talk about it anymore.

202
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,678
What we need to focus on is that Lord Bo isn't dead yet,

203
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:19,979
and he's been exiled to Qiannu Battalion.

204
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:26,619
Our army won the War of Boxiang out of luck.

205
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:29,799
Now that the enemy has retreated to Mingzhou,

206
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,519
which is easy to defend but hard to attack, it's strongly defended.

207
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,279
The enemy can use this chance to recuperate and prepare for the war.

208
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,980
But our army is in a deadlock.

209
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,539
Yes.

210
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,060
Mingzhou City is the forefront of the enemy's imperial city.

211
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,479
If we can take over Mingzhou City, we'll defeat the enemy real soon.

212
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:56,159
But our army knows nothing about its topography.

213
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,919
Our troops are now in high spirits.

214
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,139
If we want to keep winning,

215
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:05,700
we need someone who knows the military situation of the enemy.

216
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,839
That's why I think we should sneak into Qiannu Battalion and rescue Lord Bo.

217
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,499
When I found out last night that Lord Bo wasn't dead,

218
00:21:19,499 --> 00:21:21,360
I thought about it the entire night.

219
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,079
The rift between him and Chu Kui is a God-given opportunity for us.

220
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,679
He's the only one in this world who knows everything about the enemy's military situation.

221
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,778
If we manage to save him and persuade him to help us break through Mingzhou City,

222
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:38,239
it will definitely help us a lot with winning the war.

223
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,239
No way! That's too risky!

224
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,579
Despite the rift between Lord Bo and Chu Kui,

225
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,819
everyone knows the evil things Lord Bo did.

226
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,879
Asking for his help is like asking a tiger for its hide.

227
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,159
Yes.

228
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,199
Even if he agrees to it,

229
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,760
I will not be his compatriot.

230
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,639
What if he has repented?

231
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,780
He kidnapped Princess while in Boxiang.

232
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,179
I guess it's because people found out about his rebellion.

233
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:25,319
In order to head back and ask for mercy, he tried to exchange the princess' life for his.

234
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,279
Fortunately, Juyao managed to save Princess at once.

235
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,919
If not, the consequences would be unimaginable.

236
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,480
Would someone who repents do such a thing?

237
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,840
Zhaixing, when we were in the enemy's country,

238
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,420
we both saw how loyal Lord Bo was.

239
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,020
In dealing with the case of First Prince,

240
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,318
he was forced to suffer humiliation for the sake of his eldest brother and Fourth Brother.

241
00:22:54,318 --> 00:22:58,540
He rebelled because he tried to redress his eldest brother's grievance.

242
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,359
Perhaps Lord Bo is loyal to his brothers.

243
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,099
And he rebelled simply because he hated the fact that Chu Kui deceived and used him.

244
00:23:10,479 --> 00:23:14,680
So even if he is not Lord Bo, he has no reason to help us.

245
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,899
That's right.

246
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:20,960
Among us all, Lord Bo deceived and hurt Princess the most.

247
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,660
Nephew, it's not easy for one to change.

248
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,060
It's just your wishful thinking.

249
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,299
I agree with Juyao's suggestion.

250
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:34,600
Save Lord Bo.

251
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
King of Jin!

252
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:44,680
Please listen to me first, Princess.

253
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,999
Princess, do you have any great wishes?

254
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,039
May the world be peaceful,

255
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,219
and to save the people being controlled by Chu Kui.

256
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:02,059
I, too, wish for world peace.

257
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,360
But I've been on the battlefield for years.

258
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,099
What I want more is to fight a bloodless war.

259
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,439
It sounds ridiculous.

260
00:24:12,439 --> 00:24:16,640
But with Lord Bo here, it's possible.

261
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
As you know, Lord Bo knows the enemy's military situation well.

262
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,040
If he can help us to destroy it from within,

263
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:28,259
it can minimize casualties. Am I not right?

264
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:32,950
If the alliance can save thousands of soldiers,

265
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,460
why don't we try it?

266
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:37,699
Father.

267
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,760
Even if we ignore whether Prince of Bo is good or evil right now,

268
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,559
or if he's willing to form an alliance with us.

269
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,900
Considering the crimes he did,

270
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,839
how would the world perceive us with him joining our troops?

271
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,000
It's the other way around.

272
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,279
If our troops can pardon Lord Bo and make him turn over a new leaf,

273
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,539
it will shock the whole world.

274
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,280
And we will show the world the power of benevolence.

275
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,159
It will be a blow to Chu Kui.

276
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,780
What do you think, Princess?

277
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:15,299
I've learned something new today.

278
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:19,380
What you said is truly admirable.

279
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,940
To shock the world with benevolence.

280
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,180
Today, if we manage to ask for Lord Bo's help

281
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:32,680
to fight a bloodless war, that's my great wish as well.

282
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,339
Thank you for your understanding, Princess.

283
00:25:38,219 --> 00:25:42,279
Everyone, even Princess is willing to let go of the past

284
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,640
and accept Lord Bo.

285
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,760
Will you support my initiative?

286
00:25:51,199 --> 00:25:53,000
How wise you are, Princess.

287
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,900
How wise you are, Father.

288
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,019
I have no objection to it.

289
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,400
How wise you are, Father.

290
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,859
I shall make this action a success.

291
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:06,459
I have a request.

292
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,819
I would like to go with Prince of Chuan.

293
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:10,939
I was once deceived by Prince of Bo.

294
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:13,059
So I know him better than anyone.

295
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,199
Will we bring ruin upon ourselves, or get an ally?

296
00:26:18,199 --> 00:26:20,459
I need to judge for myself.

297
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:24,499
I can't let Lord Bo sabotage my army again.

298
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,179
Don't worry, Emperor Father.

299
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,199
Zhaixing and I will work together to overcome everything.

300
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:38,339
It will be a triumphant return.

301
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:42,359
Also, we'll take Lord Bo back to Taiyuan City.

302
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,520
Fine.

303
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,599
Be careful with everything.

304
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:54,280
- Remember that.
- We can't delay it anymore.

305
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:58,800
Tomorrow morning, Zhaixing and I will sneak into the enemy's Qiannu Battalion.

306
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,800
I'm taking off.

307
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:27,899
Father, I've always heard about bloody and brutal rumors about Qiannu Battalion.

308
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:32,339
And now it's heavily guarded for sure.

309
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,019
How can both of them save Lord Bo?

310
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:40,400
That's my concern, too.

311
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,339
Therefore, after their departure tomorrow,

312
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:47,280
you will get the troops ready and stand by.

313
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,760
I'll obey your command.

314
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,680
In rescuing Lord Bo,

315
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,819
the only odds lie in himself.

316
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:19,039
I don't get it.

317
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,619
Before this, you and I despised Lord Bo.

318
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:28,860
Why did you go against the rest in the court today

319
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,100
and defend him uncharacteristically?

320
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,239
Because I have a personal motive.

321
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,379
What do you mean?

322
00:28:55,379 --> 00:28:59,260
Although we're married, your heart

323
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:03,319
won't let go of the war until the day the tyranny ends.

324
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,839
And we won't get to live like a normal couple.

325
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,699
Now that we're in a deadlock,

326
00:29:13,699 --> 00:29:18,319
I'm willing to try anything so that we and the people

327
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,019
can live a stable and peaceful life,

328
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:29,299
even if that means an alliance with Lord Bo.

329
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,959
You and King of Jin are magnanimous indeed.

330
00:29:56,959 --> 00:30:00,940
You care for the world and are forgiving.

331
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,079
I'm not as good as you.

332
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,979
I'm just afraid that you'll be hurt by gossip

333
00:30:10,719 --> 00:30:12,859
for saving Lord Bo.

334
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:21,839
I won't.

335
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,780
This time, I need you to talk Lord Bo into taking refuge in Jin.

336
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,380
If we can get Lord Bo's help,

337
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,520
we'll win the war soon.

338
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,099
I just hope when peace descends to the world,

339
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,059
you and I won't be too old,

340
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:50,939
and I will still have the energy to travel the world with you and Zhuiri,

341
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,920
to the ends of the world.

342
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,300
I hope we can persuade Lord Bo to change for the better.

343
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,780
[Qiannu Battalion]

344
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,039
Hurry up!

345
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,500
Hurry up! Do you hear me?

346
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,020
Don't slack off! Hurry up!

347
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,419
We don't give you food for nothing!

348
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,599
I'm talking about you! Hurry up!

349
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,560
Hurry up and work!

350
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,019
- Li Qiang!
- Are you all right?

351
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,719
- What?
- Li Qiang!

352
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,460
- Li Qiang, what happened?
- Get back to work.

353
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,800
Li Qiang, are you all right?

354
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,519
- Are you hurt?
- Stay put! Go back to work!

355
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,798
They're all animals! They don't treat us like humans at all!

356
00:32:11,459 --> 00:32:13,159
Instead of working, you're slacking off here!

357
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,719
Kneel, now!

358
00:32:14,719 --> 00:32:16,560
Kneel!

359
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,380
Guard Corp Zhao, you think you're still a general?

360
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,839
In Qiannu Battalion, you are all merely detestable slaves!

361
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,219
Mine properly.

362
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:34,040
Don't think of dying all the time.

363
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,919
I'm very busy.

364
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,500
I decide who lives or dies.

365
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,959
A report!

366
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:45,178
Here's a letter from the Ministry of Justice. Two sinful slaves will be escorted here today.

367
00:32:45,178 --> 00:32:48,999
One of them is here and Prince of Yun will escort the other one here by himself.

368
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,160
Prince of Yun will do so himself?

369
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:54,879
Take care of the body at once.

370
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,740
I'll go and receive him.

371
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,040
Yes!

372
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,479
Li Qiang!

373
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,079
- Get to work!
- Li Qiang.

374
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:05,639
- Get up!
- Can you make it?

375
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:07,838
I'm fine.

376
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:09,819
Thank you, Guard Corp Zhao.

377
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,760
Li Qiang, can you make it?

378
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,479
Guard Corp Zhao, thank you for your concern.

379
00:33:47,479 --> 00:33:49,740
I can make it.

380
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,318
I'm wondering who that is.

381
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:54,799
Lord Yun even escorted him here by himself.

382
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,758
- Greetings Lord Yun.
- Rise.

383
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,900
Warden Gu, I heard that you never leave your post.

384
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,339
Today, I'm here to escort a special offender.

385
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,520
And I need to punish him myself.

386
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,238
Send the offender in!

387
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,940
Send him in!

388
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,319
It's Lord Bo.

389
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,859
- Yes, it's Lord Bo!
- It's Lord Bo.

390
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:41,238
And there's Lord Yun.

391
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:44,220
I want to kill both of them so bad!

392
00:34:53,539 --> 00:34:55,119
Send him in.

393
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,700
Yes!

394
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:18,000
Kill him!

395
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,359
Brothers, calm down first.

396
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:23,699
The Chu family has sent us one of their sons here.

397
00:35:23,699 --> 00:35:25,959
It's a god-given opportunity.

398
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,280
All of us will take revenge on him.

399
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,839
We can't let him walk out of Qiannu Battalion alive.

400
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,439
Yes, kill him! Kill him!

401
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,398
- He needs to die!
- Yes!

402
00:35:36,399 --> 00:35:37,639
Kill him!

403
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,059
Second Prince, every sinful slave that's new to the battalion has to have their face marked.

404
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:44,779
- Lord Bo needs to...
- What Lord Bo?

405
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,259
After the defeat of War of Boxiang,

406
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:53,520
he's just a lowly, nameless sinful slave.

407
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,239
Since I'm a sinful slave,

408
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,140
you don't need to help me.

409
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,840
I'll do it myself.

410
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,100
You've ended up this way,

411
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,339
but you still want to act like a hero.

412
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:18,840
Fine, I won't let you have your way.

413
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,880
Since you were part of the imperial family,

414
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,579
you don't have to have your face marked.

415
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,099
Why?

416
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,480
Why does he have that right,

417
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,639
but the rest have no such privilege!

418
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,299
We will kill him eventually!

419
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,719
Just wait and see!

420
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,600
You see.

421
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,560
Among all here, you're the only one who has such a privilege.

422
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,459
- Warden Gu!
- Here!

423
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:03,399
I'll leave this monster to you!

424
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:05,240
Yes, Your Highness.

425
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,159
Take him down!

426
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,559
I want to kill him now!

427
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,260
Yes, kill him!

428
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,018
- Your Highness.
- It's karma!

429
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:16,638
Why did you let this monster off?

430
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:18,979
I have my reasons.

431
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:21,399
I need to protect him so that he won't die here.

432
00:37:21,399 --> 00:37:24,900
Grand Diviner, don't you have to attend to some business?

433
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,559
I have some other things to tell Warden Gu.

434
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,560
You may get back to work.

435
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,479
Yes. I will go and check the plague situation.

436
00:37:35,479 --> 00:37:37,220
I am taking off.

437
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,638
My Lord, Lord Yun seems to be guarding against us.

438
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,359
Could he have found out that we're helping Lord Bo?

439
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,519
See to it accordingly.

440
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,499
All in all, we can't let Lord Yun hurt Lord Bo.

441
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,940
Have a safe journey, Lord Yun.

442
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,379
What's all this fuss?

443
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,779
Keep up!

444
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,378
- Liu'er.
- Brother.

445
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:11,139
Put that down.

446
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,100
Brother, who's that?

447
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,739
It's my first time seeing Warden Gu this submissive.

448
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:22,539
He came from Imperial City.

449
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:27,238
Then, why did they come all the way here to Qiannu Battalion?

450
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:29,579
I bet you don't know.

451
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:32,670
- Let me tell you... They're keeping–
- Warden!

452
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,299
Hello, Warden!

453
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:36,398
Warden! How may I help you?

454
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:37,878
Just tell me.

455
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,800
I will definitely do anything for you.

456
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:43,239
Liu'er,

457
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,520
you and I love money.

458
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,420
I have a job for you.

459
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,379
Go to hell!

460
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:59,480
Let's go. Where are you looking at?

461
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,639
I'm talking about you.

462
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,259
Zhang Yuan, Gu Teng is watching.

463
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:04,800
Don't be so obvious.

464
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,919
Since he's in our hands, I will not let him walk out of here alive.

465
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,080
Haven't you eaten? Hurry up!

466
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,399
Don't slack off!

467
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:18,099
Guard Corp Zhao, Liu'er has sent firewood here.

468
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,198
That kid lost his mother when he was born,

469
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:22,639
and he went into exile here with me.

470
00:39:23,439 --> 00:39:28,280
With a father like me, he has had a lot of hardship.

471
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,779
He's fended for himself since he was small.

472
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,120
And he even needs to hide our relationship.

473
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,459
He's just right in front of me, but I can't reunite with him.

474
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,539
My son, you've suffered.

475
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,320
I'll surely figure out a way to get you out of here.

476
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:08,198
Lord Bo, just rest yourself.

477
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:12,059
You need not lower yourself and work along with these war slaves.

478
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:14,919
I don't care what you're up to,

479
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:16,579
just stay away from me,

480
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:20,059
and don't call me Lord Bo.

481
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,960
I'll see how long you can keep being haughty.

482
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,079
Guards!

483
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,120
The slave we marked this morning, bring him here.

484
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,878
The iron rule of Qiannu Battalion.

485
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:44,499
The newcomer gets to do the most dangerous labor.

486
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:48,059
Get in there with the explosives and blast the cave.

487
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:51,940
Warden, I can't do it.

488
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,540
The wound on my face is still not healed. My eyes can't see clearly at all.

489
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,100
Please have mercy on me.

490
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,158
It's the iron rule of the Qiannu Battalion.

491
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:02,579
Why would we break the rule for you? You're not Lord Bo.

492
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:05,039
Warden, this brother is not recovered yet.

493
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,738
And he's not the only newcomer here. Don't we have that one?

494
00:41:07,738 --> 00:41:10,420
Yes.

495
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,359
Lord Bo told me just now

496
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,320
he's different from you war slaves.

497
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,519
He gets to enjoy privileges given by Lord Yun.

498
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,839
He doesn't need to have his face marked.

499
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,579
He doesn't even need to risk his life.

500
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,718
Shut up, or I'll blow you up at once!

501
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:24,639
Get him into the cave!

502
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,478
No!

503
00:41:26,479 --> 00:41:28,140
I beg you! Please let me go!

504
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,719
No!

505
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:32,459
Stop!

506
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,220
Open your eyes wide and have a good look!

507
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,819
Just because you're Lord Bo,

508
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:47,260
that new slave who came in with you has to endure the pain on his face

509
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,439
and head in there carrying explosives.

510
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:53,800
The most damned person in Qiannu Battalion is you!

511
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,860
Why aren't you the person that’s doing the deadly task?

512
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,500
Speak!

513
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:14,039
- I'll take his place.
- Yes, Lord Bo.
