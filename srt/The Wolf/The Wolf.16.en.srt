2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,770
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:19,100
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
 (I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,230
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,320
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
 (Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,930
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
 (I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,130
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,750
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,170
♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,480
♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,270
♫ (You took away what I care about and all my attention) ♫

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,310
♫ Who am I without you? ♫

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,830
♫ When a puppet hanging on a string has experienced warmth ♫

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:12,140
♫ The pupil is no longer black, white, or grey

[The Wolf]

00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:32,298
[Episode 16]

21
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:34,919
I indeed admire her a lot.

22
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:38,559
But it's not in an improper way like what you are thinking.

23
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,720
I've roamed the world for years.

24
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,279
I've seen a lot of women.

25
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:47,559
But only Young Mistress was able to gain my respect and admiration.

26
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,839
When I first saw her,

27
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:58,720
she was a rich family's daughter wearing luxurious clothes.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,279
Facing a group of well-trained soldiers,

29
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:04,660
she was calm and collected when she commanded them.

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,720
She has the spirit and strategy that doesn't lose to men.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,919
When I met her again,

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,479
she didn't have any prejudice

33
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,900
against an adventurer like me.

34
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,520
She made friends with me instead.

35
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:20,479
And in this journey,

36
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,067
you pretended to ignore all the

37
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:27,026
sincere caring efforts she showed you.

38
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,499
But I'm the one who felt the pain.

39
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:38,919
I'm not interested in the story of how you and Ma Zhaixing cherish each other.

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,359
Since Your Highness knows that she is my friend,

41
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:51,360
I will surely protect her well.

42
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,960
Farewell.

43
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:29,279
Why do I always end up picking you up when you cry for Prince of Bo?

44
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,479
I thought I wouldn't cry.

45
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,299
I chose to leave him on my own.

46
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:39,979
But...

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,399
it hurts.

48
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,639
I've never heard of anyone dying from heartaches.

49
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,339
When it ends, you will forget about Prince of Bo.

50
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,559
This is not a red string.

51
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,640
This is a chain.

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,460
Now that the chain is broken

53
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,780
and you are willing to leave Prince of Bo,

54
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,240
why don't you learn from me

55
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,179
and live a free life without worries?

56
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:23,379
Forget about the marriage agreement and imperial responsibility.

57
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:24,799
Just leave it all behind.

58
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,480
Even if you've broken the chains,

59
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Prince of Bo still exists.

60
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,059
His Majesty's marriage agreement is still present.

61
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:36,020
The court and Ma Army are all still here.

62
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,819
One day, I will still have to return.

63
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:45,739
From here to Kuizhou, no matter where you go,

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,219
it will still take you three days.

65
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:52,859
I know there are a few inns in front.

66
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's stay there to rest before the sun sets.

67
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,540
Don't turn back.

68
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,559
Raise your head, move forward.

69
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,259
You are the courageous Ma Zhaixing.

70
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,338
Hurry up!

71
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:16,279
It's getting dark soon!

72
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,980
Coming.

73
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,319
Master, the scouts in front reported that there is nothing unusual in Fuhu Forest.

74
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,320
All right.

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,179
I will go and meet Princess Bao Na immediately.

76
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,480
Mo Xiao, listen to my order.

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,299
Bring everyone to Nanliao Tower to welcome Fourth Prince.

78
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,239
I will meet up with you later.

79
00:05:57,239 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes, Master.

80
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,820
Ji Chong, are you awake?

81
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,140
Ji Chong!

82
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,780
Where is Ji Chong?

83
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,819
This guy...

84
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,600
Where did he run off to early in the morning?

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,820
Did he seek Prince of Bo for revenge without telling me?

86
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,120
Move out! Head towards Fuhu Forest!

87
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,579
The prey has fallen into the trap.

88
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,020
This is a fine day to kill all of you.

89
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,359
Ji Chong!

90
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,079
This guy really disappeared.

91
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,760
Sister Zhaixing!

92
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,059
Bao Na?

93
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,099
Sister Zhaixing, it's been a long time.

94
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,980
Why are you here?

95
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,618
I reached Nanliao Tower early.

96
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:32,320
I was so bored so I came out to find you.

97
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,359
Surprisingly, I met you here.

98
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:37,760
Why did it seem like you'd seen a ghost when you saw me?

99
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,399
Princess, did you ask someone to send a letter to Prince of Bo

100
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,160
and change the meeting place to Fuhu Forest?

101
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,040
But the warrior who delivered the letter had your seal.

102
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,739
And the words in the letter were written in your handwriting indeed.

103
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,819
Impossible!

104
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,019
I just sent my confidants with my seal to Fuhu Forest days ago.

105
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,320
Why would it appear here?

106
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,760
The seal is not a fake.

107
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,140
The handwriting is genuine, too.

108
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,340
This is bad!

109
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,880
Someone pretended to be you

110
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,699
and asked Prince of Bo to meet alone in Fuhu Forest.

111
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,119
Setting a trap to get Prince of Bo to be alone.

112
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:17,839
The culprit must have bad intentions.

113
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,720
He is in danger!

114
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,579
Princess, I think Prince of Bo will meet you without bringing many men.

115
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,099
Please send your confidants to Nanliao Tower

116
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,340
and get the Bo Troop to rescue him.

117
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:41,059
Did you hear that?

118
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:42,859
Quickly send a message and head to Fuhu Forest!

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,919
Yes, Princess.

120
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,479
Leave your bow and arrow!

121
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:57,180
Prince of Bo, this way, please.

122
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,620
Greetings, Prince of Bo.

123
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,859
Where is the princess?

124
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,000
The princess is on her way.

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,019
She sent me to prepare some dishes to welcome Your Highness.

126
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,840
This way, Your Highness.

127
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,759
Zhaixing!

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,120
Where did she go?

129
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,440
Met Bao Na. Prince of Bo is in danger in Fuhu Forest.

130
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,459
Quickly come to help us!

131
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,259
Bao Na?

132
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,719
This is bad.

133
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,159
Sister Zhaixing, this is Fuhu Forest.

134
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,880
Sister Zhaixing.

135
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,580
Don't be afraid.

136
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,218
They are the warriors who were guarding Fuhu Forest

137
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,200
and the confidants I sent.

138
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,459
Why are they all dead with their clothes taken?

139
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:19,179
Looks like the enemy knew of your movements and used this chance

140
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,860
to steal the seal and kill everyone.

141
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:27,539
Let's go.

142
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,539
We are still a step late.

143
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,540
Prince of Bo is already here.

144
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,018
It is too late to inform Prince of Bo now.

145
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,479
He might be harmed even before rescue arrives.

146
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,760
Let's distract the enemy's attention.

147
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,460
Follow me.

148
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,280
Master.

149
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,699
Master!

150
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,980
Master! Quickly run!

151
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:21,100
How is it?

152
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,960
It's done.

153
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
Let's go.

154
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,279
Master!

155
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,100
Master!

156
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,479
We caught Prince of Bo, that filthy animal!

157
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,840
Bao Na!

158
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,940
Help me out later.

159
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,259
Don't scream.

160
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,279
Who is it?

161
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,500
We are under attack!

162
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:11,340
Bao Na, are you all right?

163
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,239
I'm fine.

164
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,039
Surround them!

165
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:22,239
Kill Prince of Bo and the two girls!

166
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:26,599
Surround them! Don't let them escape!

167
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,179
Go!

168
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:55,179
Let's go.

169
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:56,739
Stand there!

170
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,900
Give chase!

171
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,000
Wen Yan!

172
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,800
Ma Zhaixing!

173
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,699
Ji Chong?

174
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,699
I saw the note.

175
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,699
Why did you come back and save this heartless man?

176
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,520
Do you still value your life?

177
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,540
They are right behind us. We should escape first.

178
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,578
Move!

179
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,359
Ji Chong! Be careful!

180
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,218
- Zhaixing!
- Master!

181
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:05,979
Ma Zhaixing!

182
00:17:05,979 --> 00:17:07,759
Zhaixing.

183
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,959
Quickly take her away.

184
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,819
I will handle the pursuers.

185
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,800
Go!

186
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,020
Zhaixing is more important!

187
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,859
Give chase!

188
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,419
Bao Na, meet up with Mo Xiao.

189
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:26,100
Wen Yan, follow me back to camp!

190
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,260
You are trying to stop us alone?

191
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,539
I want to fight with you,

192
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,100
but I'm afraid you don't dare to fight me.

193
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,260
It's been a long time.

194
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:24,759
Quickly kneel!

195
00:18:26,219 --> 00:18:27,659
Greetings, Young Marshal!

196
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,840
Greetings, Young Marshal!

197
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,019
Stand up.

198
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,660
I'm no longer the Young Marshal and a Jin citizen anymore.

199
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,859
Stand up.

200
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,779
No. You will forever be our marshal.

201
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,478
All of us even thought of attacking you earlier.

202
00:18:40,478 --> 00:18:42,879
I don't dare to stand.

203
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:45,800
If you like to kneel, so be it.

204
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,060
But you can stop chasing.

205
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,260
The plan to assassinate Prince of Bo has failed.

206
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,280
If you chase him further, you will only endanger your lives.

207
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,119
So you were the one who contacted me.

208
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,319
No wonder I found the voice familiar.

209
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,619
Cheng Liang, follow me.

210
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes, Young Marshal.

211
00:19:11,199 --> 00:19:12,499
Let me ask you.

212
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:15,438
The case of the annihilation of General Ma Ying and his family at Kuizhou,

213
00:19:15,438 --> 00:19:17,259
was it Jin who did it?

214
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,579
Who from Jin did it?

215
00:19:19,579 --> 00:19:22,100
Young Marshal, why are you concerned about this?

216
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,480
What happened to the world no longer concerns me.

217
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,660
It is none of my business.

218
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,380
But now it is important to the person I care about.

219
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,640
I don't know the details.

220
00:19:36,239 --> 00:19:38,719
It was most probably done by Jin.

221
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,099
Investigate it.

222
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,720
I will find you again when I get the chance.

223
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,440
Young Marshal, you have to be careful.

224
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,879
Even if Prince of Bo doesn't suspect you,

225
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:55,060
I'm worried that they will harm you and put you in danger if you are discovered.

226
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:59,600
He won't get anything by exposing my identity.

227
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,339
If the situation changes, I will act accordingly.

228
00:20:03,959 --> 00:20:06,299
Young Marshal, are you truly not returning to Jin anymore?

229
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,660
Jin is no longer my home.

230
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,780
Furthermore, I have someone I care about now.

231
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,000
See you again.

232
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:21,959
Farewell, Young Marshal.

233
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,339
Farewell, Young Marshal!

234
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:41,559
The princess is under treatment. No one may enter.

235
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,198
Zhaixing was shot because of me.

236
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:46,239
I have the right to know if she is safe!

237
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,200
Master, the wound is too deep.

238
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,319
It is in a dangerous position, too.

239
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,799
I'm afraid the bleeding won't stop even if we pull the arrow out,

240
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,860
due to the deep wound.

241
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:18,119
Her life is very critical at the moment.

242
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

243
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:26,419
Ma Zhaixing cannot die!

244
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,639
If you are not confident, call another physician here!

245
00:21:30,639 --> 00:21:33,800
She will die no matter if we pull the arrow or not.

246
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,140
What should we do?

247
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,540
Wen Yan,

248
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,420
I've never seen anyone die in your hands.

249
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,000
Not this time as well.

250
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,920
You have to save her!

251
00:21:48,719 --> 00:21:51,079
Ma Zhaixing needs to live.

252
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,460
Zhaixing,

253
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,400
just endure the pain for a while.

254
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,920
Check her pulse.

255
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,298
How is it?

256
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:30,899
Speak!

257
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,880
Master...

258
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,960
Young Feudal Mistress... has no pulse.

259
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,040
Impossible.

260
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,420
Ma Zhaixing won't die!

261
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:54,219
Don't die.

262
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:56,160
You can't die.

263
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,180
You can't!

264
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,160
Ma Zhaixing!

265
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,640
Move!

266
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,538
This...

267
00:23:14,539 --> 00:23:16,058
Let Sister Zhaixing swallow this!

268
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,760
This is the Life-Saving Pill made by our state priest.

269
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,199
There are only three in all of Qitan.

270
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,239
He gave it to my father, me, and Chu Youzhen.

271
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:22,359
Quickly make her swallow it!

272
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,760
She might have a chance to live!

273
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,560
Sister Zhaixing.

274
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:36,159
Princess.

275
00:23:41,699 --> 00:23:44,980
Sister Zhaixing, please wake up.

276
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,659
You saved my life.

277
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,079
You have to wake up so I can get a chance to repay you.

278
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,520
Master, the Young Feudal Mistress is no longer in danger.

279
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:21,080
Master, please wait outside.

280
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,599
I will do my best to treat her.

281
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,760
I thank you in Zhaixing's place for saving her life.

282
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,599
When I saw Sister Zhaixing alone outside without your company,

283
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,578
I suspected that you two might be having a lover's quarrel.

284
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:49,119
Now, after I've seen you getting anxious for Sister Zhaixing's injury,

285
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:51,699
I know I was worried for no reason.

286
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:54,880
I wanted to leave when Sister Zhaixing wakes up,

287
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,179
but my father got anxious when he found out something happened at Fuhu Forest.

288
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,159
He is waiting for me to explain to him what happened.

289
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,760
Please report it to the king then.

290
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:10,600
I am relieved to have Prince of Bo guarding Sister Zhaixing here.

291
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,160
I'm leaving.

292
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:27,400
Affection shows in hardships.

293
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,959
Looks like Prince of Bo still cares about the Young Feudal Mistress.

294
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,140
But I don't get it.

295
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,499
Why did you act so heartless towards her back in Kuizhou?

296
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:42,980
Do you have difficulties that you can't speak of?

297
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,800
If Ma Zhaixing dies,

298
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,060
how can I explain to His Majesty?

299
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,859
What can I use to calm the Ma Family Army down?

300
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:04,779
Ji Chong, what are you doing?

301
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,379
You are offending your superior!

302
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,140
Move aside!

303
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,720
What's wrong? Are you afraid?

304
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,900
Do you need to hide behind your subordinate?

305
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,500
Mo Xiao, move.

306
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,400
He can't defeat me.

307
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
I have to try even if I know that!

308
00:26:46,699 --> 00:26:50,479
If I take half a step back, that counts as I lose.

309
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,660
I will make you do that even if I risk breaking my legs!

310
00:27:42,459 --> 00:27:44,000
You lose.

311
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,180
Don't think that Ma Zhaixing cannot live without you.

312
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,239
You are not worthy for her to turn back around.

313
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,139
Every time, when she knew that you were in danger,

314
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:59,920
she would risk her life to save you.

315
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,040
She deserves it!

316
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,000
I thought you appeared at Langshou Mountain that day

317
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,860
because you were worried about her.

318
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,020
But now,

319
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,059
I can see that you are just a cruel animal.

320
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,079
You are no human.

321
00:28:26,819 --> 00:28:30,119
You are just a wolf that Chu Kui keeps.

322
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:42,179
Even if I was scolded and misunderstood,

323
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,719
I have to continue secretly hindering Chu Kui's evil deeds.

324
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,719
When will Ma Zhaixing wake up?

325
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,439
I'm asking you!

326
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,939
I don't have to answer you.

327
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,520
I will just answer to His Highness.

328
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,439
Your Prince doesn't even care about his princess consort!

329
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,839
No.

330
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,839
He will still pretend to take care of his Princess Consort of Bo.

331
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,219
It's not that Master doesn't care about Young Feudal Mistress.

332
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:36,419
- He is—
- Ma Zhaixing's injury is her own fault.

333
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,280
She wouldn't have ended up this way if she didn't decide to come here without permission.

334
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,779
This is the Princess Consort of Bo's tent.

335
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,180
Get out.

336
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,460
No.

337
00:29:53,699 --> 00:29:55,299
You're awake?

338
00:29:58,059 --> 00:29:59,859
Ji Chong stays.

339
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:02,839
You, go out.

340
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,339
What?

341
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,119
I only want Ji Chong to stay.

342
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:13,879
All of you, go out.

343
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,400
It's good that you are alive.

344
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,239
I can give Emperor Father an explanation, at least.

345
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,120
Master.

346
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,160
You won't explain even if

347
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,540
the Young Feudal Mistress misunderstands you?

348
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,739
Nothing is more important than her being alive.

349
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,659
Your injuries are no better than mine.

350
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,578
It wasn't worth it to injure yourself.

351
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,600
My injuries came from the glory of defeating Prince of Bo.

352
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,579
Ma Zhaixing, listen here.

353
00:31:30,579 --> 00:31:32,179
From now on,

354
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,779
I won't let you do foolish things alone again.

355
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,420
What do you mean?

356
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,920
Whenever you are alone,

357
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,599
your every decision can truly anger others!

358
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,579
Who allowed you to leave the inn?

359
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:49,760
Who allowed you to turn back and seek Prince of Bo?

360
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,260
Who allowed you to save me?

361
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,260
But... I don't–

362
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,070
Do you know?

363
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,599
You would already be dead

364
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,099
without the state priest's pill!

365
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,514
What would I do then?

366
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:07,019
Do you want me to live my life in guilt?

367
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:13,020
I won't let you feel guilty.

368
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,239
After Wolf Boy left,

369
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,680
I felt guilty for a long time, too.

370
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,280
Who is Wolf Boy?

371
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,739
Whenever I was sad

372
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:29,339
and hid in a faraway place,

373
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:33,940
he could always find me and accompany me.

374
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:41,559
The owner of that cave in Langshou Mountain...

375
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,760
Then, where is he now?

376
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,020
He died because of me.

377
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,719
I wanted to protect him.

378
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,819
But I still...

379
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,280
failed in the end.

380
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,939
Long ago, I had a friend.

381
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:29,160
He saw his friends in the army die for him with his own eyes,

382
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,459
yet he couldn't do anything.

383
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,400
I understand his sufferings.

384
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:43,599
Which is why I can understand your pain, too.

385
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,839
Has he moved on?

386
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:54,560
Impossible.

387
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,359
People with regrets in their hearts

388
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,699
will forever be lonely.

389
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,760
If you see him again,

390
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,940
tell him that there's a girl called Xing'er

391
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,850
who understands his regrets.

392
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:24,140
He is not alone.

393
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:41,820
Can he stop blaming himself right now?

394
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,499
All right.

395
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:51,639
I will tell him if I get the chance.

396
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:56,999
But I hope you can promise a request of mine, too.

397
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,320
Let me be your second Wolf Boy.

398
00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:15,699
When you feel like disappearing,

399
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:19,120
I will find you and accompany you

400
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,660
like how I did in Langshou Mountain.

401
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,220
I won't allow you to push me away.

402
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:28,840
When you are in pain,

403
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,080
I will catch you.

404
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,940
I won't allow you to sink into suffering again.

405
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,339
Are you drunk?

406
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:49,999
Your smile is enough to make me drunk.

407
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,760
You are fine if you can smile.

408
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,420
Go to sleep, Xing'er.

409
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,320
I will be here.

410
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,400

411
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,830

412

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:37,000
♫ Still twinkling ♫

414
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,179
Master,

415
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,140
this is the arrowhead removed from the Young Feudal Mistress.

416
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,439
The arrowhead was sharpened.

417
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:59,790
The edges are protruding and the tip was made sharper.

418
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:04,560
Its purpose was to increase damage and penetration.

419
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,320
I think I saw this before.

420
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,320
This type of arrowhead is used by the Jin troops.

421
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,499
It was done by the Jin troops?

422
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,320
Now that Master mentioned it,

423
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,058
the Qitan soldiers who attacked us today were

424
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,220
all well-trained elite soldiers.

425
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,579
Their martial arts and archery did look like that of the Jin troops.

426
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:36,579
If my guess about the culprit being Jin is correct,

427
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,700
that means there's a spy within the Bo troops.

428
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,919
Get the Night Fiends to investigate in secret.

429
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:47,120
Don't alert the enemy.

430
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,239
Yes, Master.

431
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,199
Your Highness, please calm down!

432
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:02,560
We will find a way to defeat Prince of Bo's people.

433
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,399
You know nothing!

434
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,380
Prince of Bo will definitely find the culprit now that he's alive.

435
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,600
Maybe he already has evidence to accuse me!

436
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:15,699
Yes.

437
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,040
Now that it's come to this,

438
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,819
I had to make the last gamble.

439
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,899
I will not do anything while awaiting my fate

440
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,260
and let Prince of Bo return to meet His Majesty in the capital!

441
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,758
- Get the war map!
- Yes!

442
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,000
Prince of Bo and his men will get more relaxed as

443
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,879
they get close to the capital.

444
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,280
Especially the terrain here.

445
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
If we arrange it well, plus dispatch my elite army,

446
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,738
we should be successful if we ambush them here.

447
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,099
- If we fight them head-on, Fourth Prince and his men...
- Kill them all!

448
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,899
Leave no one alive!

449
00:38:58,499 --> 00:38:59,899
Your Highness!

450
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,059
They are your biological brothers.

451
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:12,700
What about Fourth Prince?

452
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:27,819
So what?

453
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,399
I thought you repented for real.

454
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,639
So you lied to me that day.

455
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,719
You've fallen so deep.

456
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,738
Even my father's death couldn't bring you back!

457
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:51,120
I will truly disappoint your father if I don't become the emperor!

458
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,420
When will you understand?

459
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,819
Prince of Bo and his men are rushing back to the capital.

460
00:39:57,819 --> 00:39:59,460
If he beats me to it,

461
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:02,059
I will be dead!

462
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:07,819
Your Highness, I beg you.

463
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:10,239
Please stop this.

464
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:14,879
Just think of Lin'er begging you as well.

465

Chuchu!

481
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:06,979
How is she?

482
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,100
Your Highness, the Princess Consort had a miscarriage.

483
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,279
I'll be leaving.

484
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,760
No more.

485
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:34,619
No more.

486
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,180
My son is no more.

487
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,819
After many troubles,

488
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:04,100
the alliance treaty has finally been passed to your hands.

489
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,959
Thank you, Princess.

490
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,978
I just went to visit Sister Zhaixing.

491
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:11,320
She has mostly recovered from her wounds.

492
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:17,199
I can finally be relieved and sleep well.

493
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,239
Besides the alliance treaty,

494
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:23,980
I also prepared another gift for you, Brother Bo.

♫ I had to move forward, but I did not say ♫

499
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:00,310
♫ That the only one who can change me is still you ♫

500
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:07,670
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

501
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:14,700
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

502
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:21,940
♫ Flowing backward to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

503
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,520
♫ Forever being together ♫

504
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,190
♫ Going backward to that second in time ♫

505
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:36,310
♫ Firmly holding your hand and keep walking like that ♫

506
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:43,470
♫ I am willing to wait, wait until you understand ♫

507
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:50,510
♫ Eternity actually is hiding within the love that we believed in ♫

508
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:57,850
♫ I really want to run into your embrace ♫

509
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:04,800
♫ Thank you for indulging me to be superstitious ♫

510
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,990
♫ Returning to when we started to love,
when there is still no hurt ♫

511
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:17,700
♫ Forever being together ♫

512
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,640
