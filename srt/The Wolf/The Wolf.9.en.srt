00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,680
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,910
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:19,030
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
 (I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,240
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,310
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
 (Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,960
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
 (I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,080
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,849
Lord Bo barged into the ancestral temple to save me. Can he come back unharmed?
 [Episode 9]

21
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:36,150
It's not difficult for Lord of Bo to escape unharmed.

22
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,250
The difficult thing is your opinion on Lin Guang's case.

23
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,800
I knelt in the temple thinking about this.

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,270
By doing so, I have concluded that, first, Lin Guang is not an assassin.

25
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:55,430
Otherwise, he'd rather die than get caught.

26
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,969
Second. If he really wanted to kill himself,

27
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,210
or he knew he would be dead if he followed the prime minister

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,735
but he still went with him,

29
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:11,090
that means he was willing to sacrifice himself

30
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,090
to protect someone or something.

31
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,520
Your reasoning is almost the same as Master's.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,290
I'm impressed.

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,689
Of course! Our princess is very clever.

34
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:25,349
As for my opinion on Lin Guang's case,

35
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,165
since I was the one who chose to believe in his kindness,

36
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:35,149
I'm not going to force out the truth on what he was trying to protect with his life.

37
00:02:35,149 --> 00:02:38,789
I will regard this case as a rock dropped in the sea.

38
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:42,669
Housekeeper Wen, you especially came here to talk with me about this.

39
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:47,030
Is it not just to remind me that there are things in the court

40
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,309
that I shouldn't get to the bottom of?

41
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:52,789
Lord of Bo also warned me before

42
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:54,608
and now I get it.

43
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,929
Feudal Young Mistress is sensible, pretty, and intelligent.

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,429
You're a good match for His Highness.

45
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:05,730
Master asked me to invite you to meet him in the adjacent courtyard tonight.

46
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,430
Adjacent courtyard? Which courtyard?

47
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,768
Is that the one where others are not allowed to go in?

48
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,269
Exactly.

49
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:19,370
It seems Master sees you in a different way now.

50
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,710
May I ask if you're willing to come?

51
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,230
Not going.

52
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,450
These are gifts from Feudal Young Mistress Ma.

53
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,769
Since it's her kindness,

54
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,790
take it all.

55
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,089
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,210
Don't thank me, though.

57
00:03:53,638 --> 00:03:56,498
Master, sorry for being bold.

58
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:59,910
Back then, I was afraid you were just being rash,

59
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,050
so I didn't dare to throw it away.

60
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:14,229
Will she come on time?

61
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:19,129
Her reply is, "Not going to leave if I don't see him."

62
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,390
Feudal Young Mistress, please go in.

63
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,370
Master has been waiting for you for a while.

64
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:48,089
Thank you.

65
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:49,789
This way.

66
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,230
Fireflies flitting the hall during sunset, while I wallow in thoughts and my heart is at a loss.

67
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,829
The lonely lamp wick burned out, yet I still could not fall asleep.

68
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,649
By slowly counting the drumbeat of the clock, the night began to grow long;

69
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:23,509
Looking at the bright faraway sea of stars,

70
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:26,109
until a ray of light is spitted at the east.

71
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:30,730
The dead and the living were parted for a year now;

72
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,250
Her soul came not in dreams to see the brokenhearted.

73
00:06:43,929 --> 00:06:47,469
Your Highness also knows "The Everlasting Regret"?

74
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:52,909
Bai Juyi also now under the name Letian.

75
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,929
His name means easy and relaxed,

76
00:06:55,929 --> 00:06:59,050
yet he wrote a poem like "The Everlasting Regret."

77
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,349
I want to know what he is resenting?

78
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,510
Can he stop hating in the end?

79
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:13,429
And does Your Highness have the answer?

80
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,589
The last two verses answered it.

81
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,490
The boundless sky and endless earth may pass away;

82
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,870
But this vow unfulfilled will be regretted for aye.

83
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:33,009
Has Your Highness forgotten the two verses before those?

84
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,689
If our two hearts as firm as gold should remain;

85
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:41,790
We will meet again in Heaven or on Earth.

86
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,329
On the seventh day of the seventh month, let us meet at the Long Life Hall;

87
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,930
Whispering in each other's ear during midnight when no one is around.

88
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,450
On high, we'd be two lovebirds flying wing to wing;

89
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,710
On Earth, we'd be two trees with branches twined from spring to spring.

90
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:02,489
So, how do you interpret that?

91
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,729
I think as long as it's in the middle of the night, when no one else is around,

92
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,190
when the fireflies are dancing, anything could happen.

93
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,370
Bai Letian said that if two hearts remain as firm as gold,

94
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,369
they will eventually meet whether in Heaven or on Earth.

95
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,390
That's the imagination of a poet.

96
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,229
I like this imagination

97
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:34,730
and your courtyard, too.

98
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,450
It's just your courtyard is so beautiful,

99
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,830
why do you forbid others to come?

100
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,630
Why did you invite me to come here today?

101
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:01,989
Because the sago palm has bloomed.

102
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,350
You're the first person to come to my forbidden area.

103
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,709
Do you know why I saved you?

104
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,329
Because I thought our betrothal was all about self gains

105
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:38,307
so I had prejudices against you.

106
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,150
Until last night,

107
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,850
I accidentally discovered that you are indeed a kind-hearted person

108
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,089
who will persist until the end and disregard the misunderstanding of others

109
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,189
just to protect what you believe in.

110
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,270
Thank you for your kind words.

111
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,030
I have prepared a feast for you.

112
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,630
Please.

113
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,669
I can't drink much.

114
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:19,950
I'm afraid I'll be like during our wedding betrothal night and trouble you.

115
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:25,270
I promise not to put any blame on you.

116
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,830
That night, you mistook me for someone else.

117
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,990
Ma Jing once told me you had a friend as a child,

118
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,510
named Wolf Boy, raised by wolves.

119
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,950
I guess he must be the friend whom you said looks like me.

120
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:01,150
The chronic injury on your leg was also due to him.

121
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,290
Wolf Boy was my important childhood friend.

122
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,490
The day we parted,

123
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,409
we both got hurt.

124
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:15,809
I just had an injury on my leg.

125
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,849
But he was hurt badly due to my deception.

126
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,649
I knew that his chances of survival were almost zero,

127
00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:32,630
but I'd rather believe that he's still alive.

128
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,309
It's just we haven't met yet.

129
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,569
There's so much I want to say to him,

130
00:11:42,349 --> 00:11:44,590
but there's no more chances.

131
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:48,989
I have many things I want to experience with him,

132
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,930
but that's impossible, too.

133
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,790
How did he call you

134
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:17,909
when you were together back then?

135
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,009
He called me...

136
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,709
Xing'er.

137
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:32,669
Xing... Xing'er.

138
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,010
All these years,

139
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:53,950
I always hoped Wolf Boy would call me Xing'er again.

140
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:00,510
But even if he was still alive,

141
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,349
he would only feel hate towards me.

142
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,490
I betrayed him.

143
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,710
But you didn't mean it.

144
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,189
Your cruelness was to protect him.

145
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:19,889
Even though he's dead,

146
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:26,170
he surely knows that everything you did was for him.

147
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:29,889
He would only feel grateful and guilty towards you.

148
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,790
I know you are just trying to comfort me.

149
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:47,170
I was a bit confused earlier and thought that Wolf Boy had forgiven me.

150
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,870
Xing'er,

151
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,869
Wolf Boy will forgive you.

152
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,170
Although you both look similar,

153
00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:07,510
you aren't him.

154
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,490
How would you know what's in his mind?

155
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,249
But he surely knows that you have suffered a lot.

156
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,810
He was gone.

157
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,669
You were put in confinement.

158
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:27,869
All these years, did you ever truly feel happy?

159
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,620
♫ Looking past the starry night ♫

160
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,329
I once was.

161
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,209
Once.

162
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,160
♫ Wait for me; Falling down for you ♫

163
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,130
♫ Falling down; Igniting the fireworks of love ♫

164
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:50,889
On Langshou Mountain,

165
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,050
we were running together.

166
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,240
He showed me the wind.

167
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,080
♫ Silence; Falling down soundless ♫

168
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,490
♫ Falling down ♫

169
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,070
Let me hear the sound of butterflies flapping their wind.

170
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,050
He ate meat buns with me.

171
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:23,009
He took the candied hawthorns from me.

172
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,469
Wolf Boy still likes to eat meat buns.

173
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,269
Really?

174
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:40,710
What about candied hawthorns?

175
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,410
Yeah.

176
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,089
Xing'er, what about you? Do you still like to eat them?

177
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,889
Meat buns. Yes.

178
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,190
They just don't taste good anymore.

179
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,190
Candied hawthorns. Yes.

180
00:15:59,677 --> 00:16:01,937
They're just not sweet anymore.

181
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,540
No matter what I do or eat,

182
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,860
they are not as tasty or sweet anymore.

183
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:15,329
I didn't like to eat meat buns before.

184
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,020
But they became tasty because I ate them with Wolf Boy.

185
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,149
Candied hawthorns also became sweet when I ate them with him.

186
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,130
Back then, the day after you disappeared,

187
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,830
I bought a stick of candied hawthorns

188
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,050
but it was so bitter.

189
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:42,830
So bitter.

190
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,869
All these years, all candied hawthorns are bitter.

191
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:50,750
Bitter...

192
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,950
Not anymore. Not anymore.

193
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:15,209
As long as Wolf Boy returns, I won't feel bitter anymore.

194
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,430
Wolf Boy can't come back.

195
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,970
Just let it go.

196
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,570
You've been blaming yourself for so long.

197
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,544
It's time to put the past behind you.

198
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,430
Live your life.

199
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,810
♫ I have always been guarding ♫

200
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,280
♫ Nothing has changed ♫

201
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,580
♫ Like that star a billion years ago ♫

202
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,060
♫ Still twinkling ♫

203
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,389
Was that kiss real

204
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:55,569
or was it just my imagination?

205
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,530
Whose kiss?

206
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,929
You scared me!

207
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:03,049
What are you doing here?

208
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,610
I'm supposed to be here.

209
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,469
But you, Young Feudal Mistress,

210
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,288
were out all night.

211
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:16,550
That's not normal.

212
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,689
Tell me everything.

213
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,380
Under such a perfect night,

214
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,449
you and Lord of Bo were all alone in his courtyard.

215
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:32,490
Did you...

216
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,349
No! Absolutely not!

217
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:41,110
I was drunk and confused.

218
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:43,770
Drunk and confused?

219
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:47,929
Well, in that case, when you were drunk,

220
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:52,610
you were asking Lord of Bo to kiss you?

221
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,369
I didn't take him as Lord of Bo, but Wolf Boy.

222
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,069
Wolf Boy?

223
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,869
How come?

224
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:08,988
Young Mistress, come on.

225
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:13,729
You're Lord of Bo's wife now. Right?

226
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:18,708
How could you think about another man?

227
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:26,269
You're right.

228
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:30,230
I should stop taking him as Wolf Boy.

229
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,330
Even if he shows me kindness out of a moment of confusion,

230
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,730
I shouldn't be careless.

231
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,349
Did you...

232
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,009
Wen Yan,

233
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:52,289
how do you judge the current situation and respond accordingly?

234
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:56,968
I think each has its own merits.

235
00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:00,668
May I ask who the enemy is so I can decide what to do?

236
00:23:00,668 --> 00:23:02,470
Please enlighten me.

237
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,028
If it's not a friend, then it's an enemy. Don't you see?

238
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,409
Is it so hard?

239
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,729
I can't believe you and Mo Xiao don't have a plan!

240
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,430
Sorry.

241
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,670
Master, may I dare to ask if Feudal Young Mistress is a friend or foe?

242
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,650
Neither of them.

243
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,049
I see.

244
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:25,530
Master, it turns out you're seriously picking your clothes this early in the morning to please the Feudal Young Mistress!

245
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,509
No need for all this trouble. Just tell it to me directly.

246
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:32,729
I'll just ask Ma Jing what clothes the Young Mistress likes on men.

247
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,529
That solves it, right?

248
00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:37,448
Must I have a reason to try on clothes?

249
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,349
If so, I'll give you one.

250
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,168
Besides warding off heat and cold, warding off wind and rain,

251
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,590
covering our bodies, making us look beautiful,

252
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,110
clothes also show etiquette and honor.

253
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,328
Are those enough?

254
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:54,709
I'm sorry. Forgive me, please.

255
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,649
Leave it. You are so unprofessional.

256
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,470
I should have asked Hai Die.

257
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,090
The one on the left.

258
00:24:14,209 --> 00:24:16,709
Didn't he wear that the day before yesterday?

259
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,769
Maybe he likes it a lot.

260
00:24:23,449 --> 00:24:24,949
Master.

261
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:28,948
You disobeyed the imperial edict for her, then invited her into your forbidden courtyard.

262
00:24:28,948 --> 00:24:31,769
Does this mean you will completely obey the imperial edict

263
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:34,290
and treat her as your wife-to-be?

264
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,509
Then, shall I still continue to keep an eye on her?

265
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,869
No need to monitor her like a criminal,

266
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,209
but keep her safe.

267
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:46,210
I went to the palace to rescue her. Father knows it.

268
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,529
But rumors are already spreading in the court.

269
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,768
Many political enemies have been hiding in the shadows, waiting for their chance.

270
00:24:51,768 --> 00:24:55,329
They dare not hurt me, but Ma Zhaixing will be an easy target.

271
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:59,410
I will send the Night Fiends to better monitor the activities of court officials.

272
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,030
Listen up.

273
00:25:03,685 --> 00:25:08,129
As long as she's the princessconsort bestowed by His Majesty,

274
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:10,430
I will keep her safe.

275
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,430
Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,349
Wen Yan, did you get the things ready?

277
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,589
No offense. But will Young Mistress like that kind of gift?

278
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:24,530
She will.

279
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:31,550
Prince of Bo asks you to go to the training field.

280
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,889
Feudal Young Mistress.

281
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:53,069
After last night,

282
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,650
you should be closer to Lord of Bo.

283
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,270
Why are you nervous?

284
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:04,450
That's exactly the reason why I'm nervous.

285
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,570
When we meet later, it'll be so awkward.

286
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,409
Young Mistress, where are you going? Come back!

287
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:13,529
His Highness is not afraid.

288
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,790
What are you afraid of?

289
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,703
Isn't he handsome?

290
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,729
Young Mistress, look.

291
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,069
Your future husband looking so valiant and mighty is so charming!

292
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,208
Come out here!

293
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,790
Come out, Young Mistress.

294
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,330
Calm down.

295
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,710
Three moves will be all.

296
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,949
Don't be shy.

297
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:40,989
You are here.

298
00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:46,649
You must be curious as to why I asked you to come here so early in the morning.

299
00:27:48,689 --> 00:27:52,888
Martial arts can help you defend yourself and make you strong.

300
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:56,389
It's good for your leg recovery.

301
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,950
You want to teach me martial arts?

302
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,288
How did you know I'd always wanted to learn to use weapons

303
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:06,249
but my mother disapproved,

304
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,689
so I never got a chance.

305
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,850
I'm glad you like it.

306
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,730
Come on.

307
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,010
What kind of weapon do you like?

308
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,930
Be careful.

309
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,130
A long weapon isn't suitable for you.

310
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,530
Pick something else.

311
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,130
Please help me choose one.

312
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,310
Wen Yan.

313
00:29:33,163 --> 00:29:34,663
Yes, Your Highness.

314
00:29:45,089 --> 00:29:47,949
So you had prepared it beforehand.

315
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,590
It's a wolf bow.

316
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,669
A part of my collection.

317
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,129
Since you gave me a gift, that is my gift to you.

318
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,630
What's more, a bow and arrow is a powerful long-range weapon.

319
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,569
It's perfect for you.

320
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:10,279
It has a beautiful totem.

321
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,643
It must be pretty expensive.

322
00:30:15,329 --> 00:30:17,029
Do you like it?

323
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:19,385
Yes.

324
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:20,889

How did Master know that Feudal Young Mistress would love that bow?

331
00:30:49,189 --> 00:30:51,469
Look at them.

332
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:56,689
Is Master teaching the Young Mistress how to shoot arrows or is he courting her?

I have a good teacher.

343
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:36,890
Thank you, Your Highness.

344
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,469
Come back to the palace with me.

345
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:42,610
I found an imperial physician to treat your leg.

♫ Lingering in love for one more day ♫

347
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,090
Imperial Physician,

348
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,789
Young Feudal Mistress has delicate health and is afraid of pain.

349
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,288
You'd better be careful.

350
00:32:05,288 --> 00:32:08,449
Yes, Your Highness.

351
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,269
It's okay.

352
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:31,170
Go on.

353
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:44,209
Young Mistress, I am done with my examination.

354
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:59,089
Is it possible to heal her leg?

355
00:32:59,089 --> 00:33:02,409
Lord of Bo, the injury has been too long ago.

356
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,849
Her muscles, blood, and bones are weak.

357
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,529
The right leg is worse than the left.

358
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,288
But luckily, you stopped her from kneeling too long,

359
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:15,550
or else the consequences would have been dire.

360
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,649
I want you to do everything you can to cure her.

361
00:33:20,649 --> 00:33:21,609
Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,930
I will surely do my best.

363
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:31,230
But Young Mistress' legs will be too hard to cure even if Hua Tuo (best ancient doctor) is reborn.

364
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,469
Fortunately, it doesn't affect her daily activity.

365
00:33:34,469 --> 00:33:39,130
I'm going to prescribe some medicine that can strengthen her bone, muscle, qi, and blood.

366
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,668
Take it once a day and have it for a month.

367
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:46,249
Remember not to put pressure to your legs during the course of

368
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,450
the medication, like riding a horse.

369
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,009
If you get hurt again, it'll be worse.

370
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,450
Your Highness,

371
00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:01,329
if there's nothing else, please excuse me.

372
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,679
Did you hear what the doctor said?

373
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,548
It's an old illness. All these years, I've seen many doctors.

374
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:27,228
They all said the same thing. I can even recite them.

375
00:34:27,228 --> 00:34:30,570
I will ask around for excellent physicians among the commoners.

376
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,109
The world is big.

377
00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:34,610
There must be someone who can cure your legs.

378
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,009
It wasn't your fault.

379
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:41,909
Why would you do so much for me?

380
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,248
Because you are betrothed to me.

381
00:34:46,249 --> 00:34:48,249
It is my duty.

382
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:53,849
You will do your duty.

383
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:56,189
And I will do mine.

384
00:34:56,189 --> 00:35:00,049
I'll try to be a competent princess consort.

385
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:15,210
Your Highness,

386
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,728
His Majesty asked you to meet him in the imperial study

387
00:35:19,729 --> 00:35:22,970
and discuss the emissary's visit.

388
00:35:28,569 --> 00:35:31,770
Get some rest. I'll be right back.

389
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,550
Father has summoned me.

390
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,550
He'll be here in a minute.

391
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,690
How are Feudal Young Mistress Ma's legs?

392
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,409
The vital part was not damaged, right?

393
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:15,289
She is fine.

394
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,989
How are you?

395
00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:24,108
I'm standing right in front of you. I'm fine.

396
00:36:24,108 --> 00:36:28,549
Or do you think I'm the one who's supposed to be badly hurt?

397
00:36:28,549 --> 00:36:33,009
It's me who found out the truth behind Lin Guang's case.

398
00:36:39,089 --> 00:36:40,689
Well done.

399
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,180
Though it's late, will you accept my apology?

400
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:05,630
This case almost jeopardized the innocent Zhaixing.

401
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,757
Thank God, she's fine,

402
00:37:07,757 --> 00:37:11,370
or I'd surely make you explain.

403
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:20,830
Your Majesty is here!

404
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,509
Greetings, Father Emperor!

405
00:37:54,509 --> 00:38:00,690
Those are the memorials from the ministers in the levee.

406
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:08,469
They all plead on your behalf, Prince of Yun, begging me to allow you to make up for your crime by leading the army.

407
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,399
I'm shocked.

408
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,860
But my words are to be taken seriously.

409
00:38:16,404 --> 00:38:20,364
I've already asked Prince of Bo to take care of the Minister from Qitan.

410
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:25,709
If you really want to make up for your mistake, you may assist him.

411
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,530
I'd like to see that.

412
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,207
Prince of Bo, what's your opinion?

413
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,210
Father Emperor,

414
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,329
Second Brother's diplomatic skills have always been better than mine.

415
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:43,310
If he's willing to help me, it'd be great.

416
00:38:45,629 --> 00:38:49,629
Yougui, what do you think?

417
00:38:49,629 --> 00:38:51,029
I made a terrible mistake.

418
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:55,129
Yet Father and Third Brother are willing to give me a chance to make up for it.

419
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,089
I will not dishonor Your Majesty's grace.

420
00:38:57,089 --> 00:38:59,049
I'll try my best to assist Third Brother.

421
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:02,769
Great that you know to reflect and repent.

422
00:39:03,895 --> 00:39:05,555
Five days from now,

423
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:12,010
a little princess will come instead of an ambassador.

424
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:15,930
Three years ago, you sent Youzhen to Qitan.

425
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,589
Have you seen her there?

426
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,549
Emperor Father, Princess Bao Na is like an old friend.

427
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:24,868
She is the favorite little princess of the King of Qitan.

428
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:26,729
When I was there,

429
00:39:26,729 --> 00:39:33,269
I saw with my own eyes that the king listened to whatever she said and favored her.

430
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,209
Father Emperor, I think taking good care of Princess Bao Na

431
00:39:39,209 --> 00:39:42,650
will help us in borrowing manpower from them later.

432
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,148
Good point.

433
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:48,188
Girls are indecisive and soft-hearted.

434
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:49,489
Prince of Bo,

435
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:53,348
I command you to be polite to her. No negligence is allowed.

436
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,569
Don't piss her off.

437
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,148
You two handle this matter well on my behalf.

438
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:05,388
As for borrowing manpower, I will not allow failure.

439
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,650
I will obey your command.

440
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,150
Your Highness!

441
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:48,488
I asked you to wait inside. Why did you come out?

442
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,348
I've rested for a while.

443
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,768
I came out after taking the medicine prescribed by the imperial physician.

444
00:40:54,768 --> 00:40:56,990
Don't be nervous.

445
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:02,249
Greetings, Second Prince.

446
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:03,970
No need to be polite.

447
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,789
Didn't you meet with His Majesty to discuss the coming ambassador?

448
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:13,049
Why so glum?

449
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:15,310
Did somethiing go wrong?

450
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,550
No.

451
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:20,749
It's just the coming ambassador is actually Princess Bao Na.

452
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:25,149
Isn't that better? It means the King of Qitan takes this visit seriously.

453
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:30,389
I am afraid she's coming for personal matters.

454
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:37,309
Does she have something to do with Prince of Bo?

455
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,869
I have nothing to do with her.

456
00:41:42,389 --> 00:41:45,348
Years ago, Third Brother and I escorted Fourth Brother to Qitan.

457
00:41:45,349 --> 00:41:48,869
The young princess fell in love with him at first sight,

458
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:51,970
and even asked the king to decree that she marry him.

459
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,849
If it weren't for their tradition disallowing the princess to be married off to a faraway land,

460
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:59,909
I'm afraid that a marriage engagement would have been made at that time.

461
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:08,690
I never thought that the cold-faced Prince of Bo was so popular with girls!
