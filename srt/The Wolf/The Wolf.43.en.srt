00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,700
♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,850
♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:19,060
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,220
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,330
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,870
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:38,120
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,730
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

♫ Who am I if I didn’t meet you? ♫

[The Wolf]

20
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:32,529
[Episode 43]

21
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,689
If we don't receive Lord Bo's signal within three days,

22
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,750
we'll head back to Jin.

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,450
I can't let you be in danger for too long.

24
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,389
He was fine yesterday... How could something like this happen?

25
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:01,549
He died a horrible death.

26
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:03,889
He was obviously bitten to death by a beast.

27
00:02:03,889 --> 00:02:06,830
He was definitely killed by that beast.

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,928
I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill him!

29
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,390
Brother Zhang Yuan, calm down first!

30
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,909
Judging from the strength, he was obviously bitten to death by a beast.

31
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:18,769
Warden, the wolf monster is still in prison.

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,449
And the prison door isn't damaged at all.

33
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,550
My Lord!

34
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,688
Lord Bo took revenge because he's not happy being locked up.

35
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,369
He controlled the warrior wolf to bite Li Qiang to death.

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,829
My Lord, please look into it!

37
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,290
- And bring justice to Li Qiang!
- Uncle Qiang.

38
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,709
Having a warrior wolf that wreaks havoc is a big deal.

39
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:38,809
I'll surely investigate it.

40
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:41,069
I'm reporting it to Lord Yun.

41
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,209
Bring that monster here.

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,009
Figure out a way to provoke the hatred of war slaves.

43
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,248
It'd be better to let them beat him to death accidentally.

44
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:50,410
Give them the weapons when necessary.

45
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,629
Yes, Warden.

46
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:03,329
Uncle Qiang, I'll avenge your death.

47
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:09,729
I'll inform Warden Gu.

48
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:14,249
Someone is trying to get Lord Bo out of prison.

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,190
Isn't the warden going to report to Second Prince?

50
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,050
Why is he going back to Qiannu Camp?

51
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,609
Your Highness, I've successfully framed Lord Bo for Li Qiang's death.

52
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:40,850
Last night, I killed that war slave named Li Qiang myself.

53
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,129
And I let the wolf dogs bite the body.

54
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,368
I made it look like Lord Bo killed him by controlling the warrior wolf in the full moon night.

55
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:49,608
Together with the rumors spread by Liu'er,

56
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:53,069
the war slaves have been convinced that Lord Bo is the murderer.

57
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:55,850
Everything is seamless.

58
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,269
Good job.

59
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,370
Just wait for those ignorant war slaves to kill that monster together.

60
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,489
Once those lowly slaves kill him,

61
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,209
you'll use the opportunity and execute them all at once, so as to prevent any trouble.

62
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:10,770
Yes.

63
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,649
Warden Gu, you've done me a big favor.

64
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:19,950
I'll definitely ask His Majesty to let you get out of this ghastly place.

65
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,669
You'll be an official in the Ministry of Justice.

66
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:25,269
Thank you for the promotion, Your Highness!

67
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:28,170
I will surely do my very best!

68
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:33,830
Uncle Qiang.

69
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,228
Liu'er! Maybe you don't believe it, but rumors can really kill.

70
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:41,608
I don't want you to make a grave mistake that will make you regret it!

71
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:46,029
I hope the rumous about the wolf monster can kill Lord Bo!

72
00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,309
I'm sorry, I brought you harm.

73
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,990
Warden Gu, are you in there?

74
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,690
Come in.

75
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:02,408
Lord Zi Shen? Why are you here?

76
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,809
The Grand Diviner ordered me to go and report to Your Highness,

77
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,090
but you're not in the tent.

78
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,288
What happened?

79
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:09,470
Your Highness, it's no good.

80
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,370
Princess Consort is here.

81
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,229
I shouldn't have suspected His Highness.

82
00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:22,529
But I just felt uneasy.

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,669
The rumors about Lord Bo controlling the wolf warrior

84
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:30,409
have been spread in Imperial City for some time.

85
00:05:30,409 --> 00:05:34,909
What do you think that Lord Yun has to do with it?

86
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:39,509
I'll be honest with you, Grand Diviner.

87
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:42,649
That day I heard the conversation between His Highness and Lord Feng.

88
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,309
His Highness ordered to stop the rumors.

89
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,229
But people can't stop spreading them.

90
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,449
Lord Feng is loyal to His Highness.

91
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:57,668
If His Highness hadn't ordered to do so, Lord Feng wouldn't have dared to feign compliance.

92
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:01,689
Maybe they wee spread by the Bo Army general.

93
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,570
Then, why has His Highness been staying in Qiannu Camp for so many days, instead of heading back to Imperial City?

94
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,709
Isn't he staying here to hurt Lord Bo?

95
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,470
This...

96
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,789
Lord Grand Diviner, I need to go there and check on Lord Bo.

97
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,990
If not, it's hard for me to believe that His Highness is innocent.

98
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,209
You care about His Highness so much, Princess Consort.

99
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,970
That's why you're afraid that he'll make mistakes.

100
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,329
- Kill him!
- Zhang Yuan, don't be reckless.

101
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:39,509
We haven't figured out what happened!

102
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,549
Zhang Yuan, listen to me!

103
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:44,889
There's something fishy about it!

104
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,809
Stop!

105
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,690
Stop!

106
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,288
Do you hear me?

107
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,149
Stop! Stop!

108
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,229
Hurry up and step back! Step back!

109
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,350
Warden Gu told me that last night

110
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,810
you controlled the wolf warrior to bite the war slave to death.

111
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,270
I will look into it.

112
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:08,209
I did it.

113
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,089
You're pleading guilty?

114
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,969
Yes, I'm pleading guilty.

115
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,390
I hope calm can be restored to Qiannu Camp

116
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:26,649
after you kill me.

117
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,209
Since you're the root of the problem, without you

118
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,509
the disaster will go away.

119
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,490
- Warden Gu.
- Here.

120
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,729
You will take care of this murderer.

121
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:42,329
Yes.

122
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:46,489
Lord Bo didn't kill Uncle Qiang!

123
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,328
He wasn't killed by Lord Bo!

124
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,408
Liu'er, why are you here?

125
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,369
I heard your secret conversation with Gu Teng.

126
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,770
You ordered him to kill Uncle Qiang and frame Lord Bo!

127
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,489
You wanted the whole Qiannu Camp to beat Lord Bo to death!

128
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:01,390
Nonsense!

129
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,670
Guards! Take this brat down!

130
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,529
My father taught me to be honest.

131
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,429
Even though Chu Kui is my enemy, I will still say the truth!

132
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:13,150
Lord Bo is not a monster!

133
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,369
He didn't kill or control the wolf warrior!

134
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,010
I will kill this kid who's full of lies!

135
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,929
I killed him.

136
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:25,750
This kid has nothing to do with it.

137
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,309
Just come at me.

138
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,690
In the face of death, you still want to be a nice guy.

139
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,590
Your Highness, I am doing you a favor.

140
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,529
Kill me and you'll get to live a good life.

141
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:44,329
What are you waiting for?

142
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,870
- Gu Teng!
- Here!

143
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,449
Place Liu'er in prison at once!

144
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,849
No food for him, until the war slaves kill that beast!

145
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,910
The time at which the beast dies,

146
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,810
is when Liu'er will be set free!

147
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:02,910
Yes!

148
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,330
Guards!

149
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,129
Lock the war slaves up!

150
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,728
Put Liu'er in prison!

151
00:09:07,729 --> 00:09:09,350
Yes!

152
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,408
Hurry up! Move! Stop looking!

153
00:09:11,408 --> 00:09:12,728
Hurry! What are you looking at?

154
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,009
Get back to work!

155
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,949
Work! Hurry up and work!

156
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,690
What are you looking at? Stop looking!

157
00:09:29,729 --> 00:09:33,550
Your Highness, Princess Consort's carriage is here.

158
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,829
It seems that you worried too much, Princess Consort.

159
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,030
Lord Bo is not in danger.

160
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,310
Chuchu.

161
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:53,968
Qiannu Camp is a ghastly place.

162
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,169
Why are you here?

163
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,849
I...

164
00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:01,889
I told Princess Consort about the camp's harsh environment

165
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,050
and she was concerned about your health.

166
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:08,810
That's why she insisted on visiting you here.

167
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,250
Is that so?

168
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,590
Thanks, Chuchu.

169
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,889
Grand Diviner, you need not lie for me.

170
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:25,309
Actually, I was afraid that you were behind the rumors about controlling the wolf warrior.

171
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,370
That's why I came here.

172
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,769
Your Highness,

173
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:36,509
I shouldn't have suspected your motive of staying here for days.

174
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,408
Silly you.

175
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,249
I'm here to check on the life of those who live around the camp,

176
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,009
and to smooth out the groundless rumors.

177
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,309
I never thought that I'd have to stay here for days.

178
00:10:51,309 --> 00:10:52,990
It's all my fault.

179
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,710
I shouldn't have doubted your sincerity.

180
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,769
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

181
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,749
You're not to blame.

182
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,049
I am to blame.

183
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,330
I've done many wrong things in the past.

184
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,350
How about this? To make you feel relieved,

185
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,089
I'll go back to the capital with you.

186
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:11,769
You've finished your business in the battalion?

187
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:13,690
I don't need to handle the rest.

188
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,669
Someone will do it for me.

189
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:23,109
You should leave first. I'll join you later.

190
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,648
Thank you for coming back to inform me of it.

191
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:36,169
I'll remember your kindness.

192
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,209
It's my duty.

193
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:42,529
Let's go back to the capital together.

194
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:46,408
Gu Teng, do as I said.

195
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,809
Yes.

196
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,289
Luckily you came up with such a nice plan.

197
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,809
You used the conflict between Princess Consort and Lord Yun,

198
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,169
as well as the rumors to secretly lure the princess here.

199
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:06,408
Lord Bo is saved.

200
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:09,050
And Lord Yun even bought into what we said.

201
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:13,608
If I hadn't found out from that crony of Feng Ting'e

202
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:17,450
that the princess had always suspected Lord Yun,

203
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:20,370
that she even eavesdropped outside the study,

204
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,830
I wouldn't have been able to save Lord Bo even if I wanted to.

205
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,449
Even though I managed to save him this time,

206
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:37,010
who would save him next time?

207
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,249
Stay here and keep an eye out.

208
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,489
Let me know at once if anything happens.

209
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,090
Yes.

210
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:57,168
What? Liu'er is locked up?

211
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:00,230
We went to their place, but he's not there.

212
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,470
- I never thought...
- That's what happened.

213
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,509
Liu'er suddenly said that Li Qiang wasn't killed by Lord Bo.

214
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:09,089
Lord Yun got furious and put him in prison.

215
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,730
Liu'er will be killed unless Lord Bo dies.

216
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:21,910
Thanks, Brother.

217
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:24,749
Zhaixing, let's go.

218
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:30,329
Chu Yougui must be behind it.

219
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,529
He wants to kill Lord Bo.

220
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:37,750
Lord Bo has two options.

221
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,709
Number one, sacrifice himself to let Liu'er live.

222
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,390
I hope he will choose the other one.

223
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:00,090
Guard Corp Zhao, you should just stab that monster to death.

224
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,010
Don't you want to save Liu'er?

225
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:04,570
I want to,

226
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,729
but I can't kill an innocent person.

227
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:09,410
He didn't kill Li Qiang.

228
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,009
And Lord Bo once saved Liu'er.

229
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:16,208
If I kill him, I am no different from those executioners who kill innocent people!

230
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,209
Fine.

231
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,669
Tell me then!

232
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,050
What is this?

233
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,950
Why don't you want to kill that beast, too?

234
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,709
Guard Corp Zhao, I have no clue what you're thinking!

235
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:43,790
After what happened today, I finally realized it.

236
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,769
Chu Yougui and Gu Teng have been acting all along!

237
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:53,209
They are trying to provoke our hatred towards Lord Bo,

238
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,430
and use us to kill him.

239
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,010
When we've ceased to be useful,

240
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,169
he'll get rid of us.

241
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,710
And then Liu'er will die too!

242
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:14,150
None of us can get out.

243
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:17,910
In Qiannu Camp,

244
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:25,130
every single one of us is just their pawn.

245
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,669
When all this is over,

246
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,350
we'll still be killed.

247
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,710
Are you willing to try your luck at that?

248
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:00,649
Trust me. I can save Liuer.

249
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,188
Do you have any good ideas? Tell us.

250
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:21,270
Qiannu Camp is heavily guarded and we're not armed.

251
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,489
But there's gun powder in Gu Teng's military office.

252
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,630
We can sneak it out, blow the battalion up, and save Liu'er.

253
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:32,230
What a good idea.

254
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,208
I have a question, Your Highness Prince of Bo.

255
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:37,129
We can't even get out of here.

256
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,730
How can we steal the explosives?

257
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,789
When the night falls, I will join hands with some people out there.

258
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,249
They have a way to steal the explosives.

259
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:53,130
We need to think that through.

260
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,370
Even if we manage to get out,

261
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,528
there are marks on our faces.

262
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,490
People will recognize us at a glance.

263
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,769
Where can we run to?

264
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,150
To Jin.

265
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,575
Jin?

266
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:18,409
Those I'm joining hands with are the princess of the previous dynasty and the Prince of Jin.

267
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:23,709
Submit to Jin and you all will be saved.

268
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:28,849
Only by living can you protect those you care about.

269
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,950
If we all believe you,

270
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,330
does that mean we'll go down the path of self-destruction?

271
00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:38,470
If the operation fails,

272
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:42,510
you can kill me on the spot and save Liu'er.

273
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,710
I believe you.

274
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,550
If I'm not mistaken,

275
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,610
you made up your mind to take refuge in Jin

276
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:59,330
so as to save us all, didn't you?

277
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:06,309
You could have taken refuge in Jin after the War of Boxiang.

278
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:10,350
Why did you come back to become a slave?

279
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,649
We came to Qiannu Camp for only one thing.

280
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,209
It's to repent.

281
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:25,230
You will try to repent by saving us all.

282
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,429
Although I can't forgive you now,

283
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:36,469
I do believe that your repentance is sincere.

284
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,369
I believe Lord Bo, too!

285
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,830
- Me too!
- We believe him, too!

286
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,649
What did you say? What?

287
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:46,089
Do you want to die?

288
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,030
If you want to, join him then!

289
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,870
I'm not going!

290
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,348
- Zhang Yuan!
- Leave me alone!

291
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,769
The late Li Qiang was his best friend.

292
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:02,489
It's reasonable that he can't accept it.

293
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:06,169
Give me some time. I'll persuade him.

294
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,690
What did you say?

295
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,560
Lord Bo is collaborating with the war slaves to steal the explosives, blow the battalion up, and run away?

296
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,110
Yes.

297
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,189
That's simply ridiculous!

298
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,528
I'm in charge of the explosives in Qiannu Camp.

299
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:29,429
There's no way they can steal them.

300
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,569
I think so, too.

301
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,649
That's why I refused to collaborate with them.

302
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:40,029
I'm willing to be your spy and inform you of everything.

303
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,648
Zhang Yuan! What are you doing in there?

304
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:48,329
This... My Lord, you need to save me. This... This...

305
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,648
Come out!

306
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,769
Stay in here.

307
00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:54,269
Yes.

308
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:58,849
Zhang Yuan! You framed us!

309
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:00,049
Come out!

310
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,268
What are you yelling about? Zhang Yuan is not here!

311
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:06,050
Where else could he go besides the outhouse?

312
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,090
Since he's not in the outhouse, he's definitely in there!

313
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,109
Warden, please let me in and take a look.

314
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,550
How dare you!

315
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,608
Guards! Lock him up along with Zhao Liu and the rest!

316
00:20:16,608 --> 00:20:19,450
Zhang Yuan, come out!

317
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,429
Come out!

318
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,630
Come out!

319
00:20:25,249 --> 00:20:28,528
My Lord, how... how's it?

320
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:31,408
Don't worry, he's been put in prison.

321
00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:33,390
No one knows that you informed me of it.

322
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,369
Okay.

323
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:37,710
Thank you, Warden.

324
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:44,430
Then, what do you plan to do next?

325
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,210
Are you going to kill them all?

326
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,288
No.

327
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,189
I'll set up a trap, and wait for them to come and steal the explosives.

328
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:55,129
And then I'll catch them all.

329
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,689
I'll write His Highness a letter, and get rid of Lord Bo

330
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,869
and the slaves for the crime of trying to escape.

331
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,470
How wise you are, Warden.

332
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:10,969
Go back and help me to keep a close watch on them. Keep me updated.

333
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,769
Yes, I'll do so at once.

334
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:21,128
Creating a signal with a fire igniter is a good idea, indeed.

335
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:23,450
And it's not noticeable.

336
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,870
It's just that the walls of Qiannu Camp are rather tall.

337
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,529
I'm afraid the Prince of Jin can't see it.

338
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,310
Zhao Jiu.

339
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,610
Sure.

340
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:56,930
My Lord, Li Qiang's body will be burned tomorrow.

341
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:00,790
Have a heart, let us burn some joss paper for him.
(T/N: paper money burned in a Chinese burial ceremony)

342
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,049
Go ahead. Do it somewhere far. I don't want to get into trouble.

343
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,750
Thank you, My Lord.

344
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,869
Look, Ji Chong.

345
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,970
It's the signal from Lord Bo.

346
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,970
Let's split up as planned.

347
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,270
Zhaixing, be careful.

348
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,969
I've done as you said and sent out the signal using the fire igniter.

349
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,490
But I'm not sure if the Prince of Jin can see it.

350
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,289
He's seen it.

351
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,909
This eagle is really smart.

352
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:51,249
Once Lord Chuan received the letter,

353
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:54,610
he'll come and save us as planned.

354
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,509
Hurry up!

355
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,128
Warden, hurry up!

356
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:05,430
What happened?

357
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,329
My Lord, Lord Bo managed to steal the explosives last night

358
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,089
and he's escaped the prison already!

359
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,649
Nonsense!

360
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:15,008
The explosive cabinet key has always been with me.

361
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:16,829
And the guards were here all night.

362
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,529
How could they steal it?

363
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:20,330
Why would I lie to you?

364
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:22,829
Open up and take a look. Go take a look.

365
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,269
Take a look.

366
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:41,529
Guards, gather all the guards and search the camp!

367
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,769
Get out, now!

368
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,550
Move! Move, now!

369
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,570
Hurry up! Move!

370
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,049
Search thoroughly!

371
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,810
Find all the explosives!

372
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,450
Lord Bo, as requested by you,

373
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,389
everyone has all the explosives tied to their legs.

374
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:11,009
Everything is ready.

375
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,309
We're just waiting for your order.

376
00:25:14,289 --> 00:25:16,669
Zhang Yuan, thank you.

377
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,168
Do you want to die?

378
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,569
If you want to, join him then!

379
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,330
I'll believe you this once, but the walls have ears.

380
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,110
I'll steal the explosives for you.

381
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:39,029
Let me tell you.

382
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:41,049
You must get all of us out of here.

383
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,850
If not, I won't let you go.

384
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,969
Zhang Yuan!

385
00:25:46,969 --> 00:25:51,049
My Lord, you need to save me. This...

386
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,449
Come out!

387
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,530
Stay here.

388
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,989
Yes.

389
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,450
Zhang Yuan! You framed us!

390
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,729
Come out!

391
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,988
What are you yelling about? Zhang Yuan is not here!

392
00:26:03,988 --> 00:26:07,730
Where else could he go besides the outhouse?

393
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,850
Since he's not in the outhouse, he's definitely in there!

394
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,768
Warden, please let me in and take a look.

395
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:14,249
How dare you!

396
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:18,448
Guards. Lock him up along with Zhao Liu and the rest!

397
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:20,169
Zhang Yuan!

398
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,149
Lord Bo.

399
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,488
Did anyone see you?

400
00:26:24,489 --> 00:26:27,589
I sent someone to buy you some time.

401
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:28,729
I know.

402
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,049
I did as you said and stole the explosives from Gu Teng.

403
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,189
I hid them in the old water jar by his window.

404
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:40,389
We'll take them out and plant them around the place tonight.

405
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,510
Let's move!

406
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:09,969
Charge!

407
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,089
None of them can get away!

408
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,089
Guard Corp Zhao!

409
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,410
Go save Liu'er! Hurry up!!

410
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,228
Ji Chong! You'll take them first!

411
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:48,669
- I'll go help Zhao Jiu!
- Okay!

412
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,849
Go north! The Jin Troop will be there for you!

413
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,830
And be careful!

414
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,230
Charge!

415
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,509
Ju Yao. Princess.

416
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:29,010
You must return safely.

417
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,689
Oh no, they don't have the key.

418
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,009
Step aside!

419
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,228
- Liu'er!
- Dad!

420
00:28:43,228 --> 00:28:45,090
- Liu'er, are you all right?
- Father, I'm okay.

421
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,629
Great.

422
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:49,089
You're not only a wolf monster that kills,

423
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,049
you also save people at the crucial moment.

424
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,449
Liu'er, don't talk nonsense!

425
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,128
If it hadn't been for Lord Bo,

426
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:57,049
I wouldn't have been able to save you all.

427
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,689
Thank you for saving us, Lord Bo!

428
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,909
You don't have to thank me. I owe you this. Go now.

429
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:04,149
None of you can go!

430
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,709
You'll go first.

431
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:15,670
- That way!
- Let's go!

432
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,189
I won't kill you because I don't want my hands to be covered in blood again.

433
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:24,969
Chu Yougui will deal with you!

434
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,690
Warden!

435
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,128
Warden, what do we do now?

436
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:43,968
What else? Report it to Second Prince!

437
00:29:43,968 --> 00:29:45,450
Yes!

438
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,690
- Warden.
- As for the rest, put poison on your weapons! And go after them!

439
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:51,990
Yes!

440
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:08,850
Quick!

441
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:21,830
Father! Father!

442
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:25,909
Zhao Jiu!

443
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,408
- Zhao Jiu!
- Father!

444
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,789
- Guard Corp Zhao!
- Father! Father!

445
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,330
- Father!
- Lord Bo, I can't make it.

446
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:36,168
- Take Liu'er with you and leave at once!
- Dad, you can't leave me!

447
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,969
We've just reunited!

448
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,628
You and Liu'er have just reunited. You can't give up!

449
00:30:40,628 --> 00:30:42,290
Father!

450
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:46,089
Lord Bo, Liu'er is still young.

451
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,331
- Please take care of him.
- Father.

452
00:30:48,331 --> 00:30:50,368
You must raise him up!

453
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:51,850
Father!

454
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,529
I promise. Let's go!

455
00:30:53,529 --> 00:30:54,749
- No!
- Come!

456
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,930
- No! Father!
- Go now! Go now!

457
00:30:56,930 --> 00:31:00,430
- If not, it'll be too late!
- I'm not leaving! No!

458
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:07,690
Go now!

459
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,489
Stop!

460
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,550
The big rocks have their way blocked.

461
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:28,489
That kid needs to be treated at once.

462
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,269
Let's go back to Jin.

463
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:43,248
Your Highness!

464
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:44,909
You just let him go like that?

465
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:47,710
The heavily guarded Qiannu Camp couldn't even catch him!

466
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,949
Are you all good-for-nothings?

467
00:32:48,949 --> 00:32:51,488
I deserve to die! I fell into the trap!

468
00:32:51,489 --> 00:32:55,168
That Lord Bo... Lord Bo took those war slaves and ran away!

469
00:32:55,169 --> 00:32:57,509
And they were helped by the Jin Army!

470
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,730
There's no use in sparing this useless man!

471
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:14,309
Lord Bo, your sacrifice and efforts have paid off.

472
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:18,969
No matter what the reason is, she still came and rescued you in the end.

473
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:22,709
My Lord, you ordered me to keep a close watch on the Qiannu Camp.

474
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,049
And I found that there are other people doing the same.

475
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,669
And you wouldn't expect them to be there.

476
00:33:27,669 --> 00:33:30,350
They're Ma Zhaixing and Ji Chong.

477
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:36,130
If they're here

478
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:39,230
to kill Lord Bo,

479
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:42,549
wouldn't that be too risky for them?

480
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,390
I think they're here to save Lord Bo.

481
00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:51,949
- Zi Shen.
- Here.

482
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,610
Let Ma Zhaixing save Lord Bo.

483
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:57,209
Get our men out of there.

484
00:33:57,209 --> 00:34:00,070
Yes, My Lord.

485
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,460
[Boxiang City]

486
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,170
Father!

487
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,270
Where's my father?

488
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,109
Your father is dead.

489
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,870
I want my father!

490
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,730
I want my father!

491
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,370
From today onward, whether you like it or not, you can only be with me.

492
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,928
You're such a cold-hearted person!

493
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,728
Can't you say some comforting words?

494
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:57,270
I'm still a kid!

495
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,469
There was once a little girl.

496
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,570
She was not much older than you.

497
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,490
When her mother passed away, she ran to the mountain.

498
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,508
At that time, I was learning how to talk from her, but I couldn't talk clearly.

499
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:16,450
How would I know that she was sad?

500
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,910
But she saw me as her best friend.

501
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:23,208
That little girl was so silly.

502
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:27,048
What's the use of having a friend who couldn't comfort her while she's crying?

503
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,210
She was silly indeed.

504
00:35:31,489 --> 00:35:34,710
She's been so silly since she was small.

505
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:39,970
She acts tough in front of people and cries behind them.

506
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:45,709
When she's hurt, she'll hide herself,

507
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:49,550
lick her own wounds, and get recovered herself.

508
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,550
Be gentle, it hurts!

509
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,710
Did you do that on purpose?

510
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,009
If only she could be like you.

511
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:04,310
Shout out loud when it hurts.

512
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:10,430
Otherwise, how would other people know if she was hurt if she just hid the pain in her heart?

513
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,189
Then how is this little girl doing now?

514
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:17,410
She must be having a hard time.

515
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:24,510
♫ The closer we are, the farther we become ♫

516
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,730
She's had too many hardships.

517
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,529
And those who tortured her.

518
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:34,410
Like you, she lost her family a long time ago,

519
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,949
but she couldn't stay sad for too long.

520
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,369
Because the responsibility on her shoulders was too heavy.

521
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,309
From then on,

522
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,950
she lost the right to be an ordinary girl.

523
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,949
Feudal Master Ma Ying is dead.

524
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:52,409
Tens of thousands who live in the Ma Family Army depend on whether

525
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,909
you can make it back to the capital in time to stop the war.

526
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:59,650
Surely you know how important it is.

527
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,750
The cruelest thing is that

528
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,410
the man she trusted the most let her down.

529
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,450
She thought she had the future in her hands.

530
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,669
But it contains all traps and lies one after another.

531
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:24,270
The fact is Wolf Boy and Xing'er will never be together!

532
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:31,449
The fact is you and I are cursed by Heaven!

533
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,210
The fact is,

534
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,710
until this moment,

535
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,210
I still hoped that you could lie to me!

536
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:44,990
It's so miserable that she met this kind of man.

537
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,750
That's why she's become tougher.

538
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,429
She endures pain, forces herself to become strong,

539
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:56,629
and leads the troops into battle.

540
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:59,809
She sounds pretty amazing.

541
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,470
But it's not what she wants.

542
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:10,110
She just wants to live like an ordinary girl.

543
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,289
Parents who dote on her.

544
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,929
And a husband who's fond of her.

545
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:18,670
Her hard work paid off.

546
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,430
And now she has a man who makes her happy.

547
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:25,449
Then, what about you? Don't you like that little girl, too?

Even though we're no longer friends,

always wish her well.

Come in.

554
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,589
Zhaixing has brought you a decoction.

555
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,750
I haven't congratulated you on your marriage.

556
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:12,870
When we're back to Taiyuan, we'll buy you a drink, for sure.

Thank you.

559
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:20,600
I should be the one thanking you.

560
00:39:21,389 --> 00:39:25,210
Your persuasion reminded me

561
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,050
what sins I should repent for.

562
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:39,370
Liu'er, your uncles are so worried about you. Do you want to go visit them?

563
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,229
Yes!

564
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:49,069
Lord Bo, you promised my father that you'll take care of me until I grow up.

565
00:39:49,069 --> 00:39:51,790
Don't you abandon me. You owe my father this.

566
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,949
You owe me this. Do you hear me?

567
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,110
Thanks.

568
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:11,410
Why did you thank me again?

569
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:18,129
I saved you and those in Qiannu Camp merely for the sake of Jin and everyone else.

570
00:40:18,929 --> 00:40:21,410
Thank you for keeping the promise.

571
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,629
For helping me to keep everything from Zhaixing.

572
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:27,170
I know it's not what you want.

573
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,990
I'm not doing this for you,

574
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:38,550
but for Zhaixing.

575
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,929
But I didn't expect that you'd survive it.

576
00:40:41,929 --> 00:40:46,589
Yet, even if you feel regret and want to win Zhaixing back,

577
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:48,389
it's too late now.

578
00:40:50,209 --> 00:40:53,290
I don't regret the request I made.

579
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:55,470
Just keep her in the dark.

580
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:00,110
Zhaixing and I can remain this way.

581
00:41:01,149 --> 00:41:04,330
After all, she lost her family because of me.

582
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:10,429
Knowing the truth of the War of Boxiang won't do her any good.

doing well.

Sis Zhaixing,

I'm not as brave as the little girl that Lord Bo knows.

I'm afraid of the days without my father.

Actually, that little girl is not brave, either.
