♫ Used to the depth of the darkness ♫

3

♫ No matter how wild, there is no fear ♫

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:19,120
♫ Waiting for a star to fall to see who its afterglow will illuminate
(I tell myself to keep pushing on by feeling, it’s history in the making) ♫

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,190
♫ Of the same kind as the banished ♫

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,290
♫ Hiding the loneliness in defense 
(Climbing mountains and cliffs) ♫

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,930
♫ But gentleness is always invincible 
(I’m earth-shatteringly alone, with no purpose and no worry, just so I can push on harder) ♫

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:38,130
♫ Refusing to compromise with fate
because my heart has a home ♫

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:43,820
♫ It's yours; I don't belong to anyone else ♫

10

♫ (But let me know who I am and give me a destination) ♫

[Episode 37]

21
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,770
Bo Army, listen to my command!

22
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,810
Today, nobody is allowed to go past the spear!

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,370
Whoever disobeys me will be killed!

24
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,170
Understood!

25
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,429
Archers, stand by.

26
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,289
Aim the Wolfbone Flower Arrow at Lord Bo.

27
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:19,789
Yes!

28
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,029
Go to Mo Xiao.

29
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,710
Master, stop going forward!

30
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,430
What are you planning to do all alone?

31
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,530
Wen Yan, what took you so long?

32
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,230
Something's wrong with Master.

33
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,929
I received a secret order from Master

34
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:44,810
to assemble all the agents in the city.

35
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,428
Hurry up and give them a signal to work with us and attack them on both sides.

36
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,869
As ordered by Master,

37
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,170
I've withdrawn all the agents

38
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,769
from Boxiang City.

39
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,330
Withdrawn?

40
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,470
My 100,000 troops are no joke.

41
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,569
What exactly does he want to do?

42
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,750
Third Brother has spent his whole life feeling guilty over Big Brother's death.

43
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,908
For all his life, he'd felt he owed Big Brother his life.

44
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,270
He's been using his identity as Lord Bo

45
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,850
to secretly prevent you from doing evil so that the people are free from your oppression.

46
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,469
That day when Third Brother came to visit me,

47
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:38,509
I told him everything you said in the Imperial Ancestral temple when nobody was around.

48
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:41,249
Third Brother finally knew that you'd killed Big Brother yourself!

49
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:43,590
Big Brother's death had nothing to do with him!

50
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,430
He knew he owed no one

51
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,589
and he was no longer bound to you.

52
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,049
He's finally able to do what he wants to do.

53
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:57,560
Release!

♫ I will be waiting here ♫

62
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,170
Third Brother owes Sister Zhaixing too much.

63
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,950
He had never wanted to hold up his sword and fight with Zhaixing.

64
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,289
He wants to put down the sword,

65
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,689
and make up for his failure to save the Ma Manor

66
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,529
and everything he owes Sister Zhaixing.

67
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:54,550
Could it be that Lord Bo is doing this to pay her back with his life?

68
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,869
Imperial Father,

69
00:05:56,869 --> 00:06:01,569
you finally got one thing right!

70
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,589
Are you prepared mentally for the War of Boxiang tomorrow?

71
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:17,230
Third Brother, you asked Wen Yan to release the spy from the enemy country on purpose

72
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:23,590
so that Sister Zhaizing will know that the Wolfbone Flower can cause great damage to you.

73
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,089
Third Brother, why are you so silly?

74
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,849
Do you really want to be killed by Sister Zhaixing?

75
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:32,209
I've taken away too much from her,

76
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,110
but I can't take away her right for revenge.

77
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,890
A few days ago, I purposely left

78
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,289
so that she can prepare the Wolfbone Flower to avenge for herself.

79
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,030
Sister Zhaixing used the butterfly as an excuse to put things off.

80
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,689
Have you never thought of the possibility that she still has feelings for you?

81
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:57,689
If she really uses our past relationship against me,

82
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:01,429
that means she's truly heartless now.

83
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,050
Third Brother, I'll go see Sister Zhaixing.

84
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,369
I... I'll kneel down! I'll kowtow to her!

85
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,349
Even if we kneel and beg her,

86
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,130
how can she forget about taking revenge on us?

87
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,010
The last thing I can do

88
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:23,910
is to make Zhaixing believe that she has avenged for herself

89
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,590
and killed the one who murdered her father.

90
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:33,829
Then, she can finally leave this bloody swirl of paying back evil with evil.

91
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:39,330
However, from now on, in Sister Zhaixing's heart,

92
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,129
you'll always be an atrocious criminal!

93
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,930
I owe her too much.

94
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,809
I'm bound to repay with my life.

95
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:52,990
Since I'm going to repay her, why should I let her know about the truth?

96
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,089
I've left my words to Wen Yan.

97
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:02,069
Tomorrow, after I pass out and die under the enemy's rain of arrows,

98
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:07,910
Wen Yan will take out the marshal seal and command the troops to fall back.

99
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,929
In the future, you'll have to take over the Bo Army.

100
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,930
Consider me having gone to accompany Big Brother.

101
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,969
He's been lonely for too long.

102
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,409
I miss him so much.

103
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,409
I'll never agree to this!

104
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,250
Youzhen,

105
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:42,310
do you remember why Big Brother was willing to sacrifice his life back then?

106
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,090
Big Brother did it so that I could stay alive.

107
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:52,369
I'm choosing to repay with my life

108
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:55,250
because I hope Zhaixing can live her life, too.

109
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:58,650
If I don't die,

110
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,310
it means the foe who killed her whole family is still alive.

111
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,350
Every day will be a torment to Zhaixing.

112
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,190
So, it's time to set Zhaixing free.

113
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,270
For all my life, I couldn't choose how to live my life.

114
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,450
I couldn't even live like a human.

115
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,729
I had no command over myself.

116
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:30,990
It may seem like I'm seeking death now,

117
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,450
but actually, I've lived for myself at last.

118
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:51,150
This time, I'm living for myself.

119
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,489
Is that really Lord Bo?

120
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:06,770
Why didn't he try to dodge?

121
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,550
After being hit by arrows, he seems to be

122
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,029
smiling?

123
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:21,549
Your Highness, in my opinion, the Wolfbone Flower burned by

124
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:24,029
our troops must've affected Lord Bo.

125
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,110
I guess Lord Bo might not even know where he is right now.

126
00:10:31,229 --> 00:10:32,890
Great!

127
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,509
Shoot the arrows! Continue!

128
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,850
Continue shooting!

129
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:38,650
Release!

130
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,609
Xing'er,

131
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,410
I've finally paid you back.

132
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,709
So,

133
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,970
this is how it feels like to live.

134
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,310
There has never been a day

135
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,249
where I haven't looked back to our days on Langshou Mountain.

136
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,070
But unfortunately,

137
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,289
when I opened my eyes,

138
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,049
there was nothing left.

139
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,269
Today, I'm willing to repay with my life.

If there's another life,

146
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:38,380

- Are you all going to...
- Mo Xiao!

152
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,230
...disobey my order?

153
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,910
I've killed Mo Xiao for he dared to defy my order!

154
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,369
If there's another one like him,

155
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,910
I won't let you off!

156
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,070
Wen Yan, have you forgotten my order?

157
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,269
I know...

158
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,110
it's hard to do,

159
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,708
that's why I chose you.

160
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:22,428
Don't disappoint me. Understood?

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,690
Yes!

162
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:32,629
No matter what happens, I won't make things difficult for Master!

163
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,929
Is that person really Lord Bo?

164
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,769
Somehow,

165
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,469
I have an odd feeling regarding his action.

166
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,429
We've succeeded.

167
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,849
Shoot again!

168
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,449
- Wen Yan!
- Mo Xiao!

169
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:27,910
Save Master!

170
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,770
Save Master!

171
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,670
Ready!

172
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,430
Shoot!

173
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,629
Marquis Wang, it's now or never.

174
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:14,088
The Wolfbone Flower clearly has had an effect and Lord Bo has lost his mind.

175
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,740
How dare he?

176
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,030
They're leaderless now, let's charge forward.

177
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,510
Exactly.

178
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,829
Pass on this order! Take the field immediately!

179
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,869
This time, I must kill Lord Bo and avenge the late Feudal Master.

180
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,170
Hold on!

181
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,350
Lord Bo is mine!

182
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,769
Aside from me, nobody is allowed to kill him!

183
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,400
Today, I'll avenge my fathers' death to comfort the spirits of both my fathers!

184
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:50,327
[Chu Kui Batallion, Weizhou]

185
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,768
His Majesty has ordered to depart to Boxiang City and join forces with the Bo Army.

186
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,790
Brothers,

187
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,949
it's time for us to charge forward.

188
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,130
Send the signal.

189
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,349
Attack!

190
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,668
Protect His Majesty!

191
00:17:03,668 --> 00:17:06,629
Guard the emperor!

192
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,408
Kill!

193
00:17:31,408 --> 00:17:43,389
Kill!

194
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,530
The princess fell off her horse!

195
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,570
I got the princess!

♫ You know who I am ♫

228
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:20,809
We've succeeded.

229
00:23:20,809 --> 00:23:23,070
We can kill Chu Kui today.

230
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:33,629
Return to Boxiang immediately!

231
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:35,208
Something has happened to Zhaixing.

232
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,289
Return to Boxiang!

233
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,410
Your Highness, if we don't capture Chu Kui now, when will we get another chance like this?

234
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,070
Hurry up! Protect His Majesty!

235
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,689
Hurry up!

236
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:49,488
Split the troop in half.

237
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:51,128
Ke Lang, lead the troops.

238
00:23:51,128 --> 00:23:53,509
You must capture Chu Kui!

239
00:23:53,509 --> 00:23:55,549
If you can catch Chu Kui alive,

240
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:57,730
perhaps we can relieve the crisis in Boxiang.

241
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,969
Yes, I understand.

242
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:08,529
Catch Chu Kui!

243
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:09,529
Don't let him run away!

244
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:11,169
Capture him!

245
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,689
Catch that brigand!

246
00:24:12,689 --> 00:24:14,589
Catch him! Don't let him go!

247
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:16,169
Quick! Catch him!

248
00:24:16,169 --> 00:24:17,268
Catch Chu Kui!

249
00:24:17,268 --> 00:24:18,748
Catch that brigand!

250
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,490
Catch him!

251
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,510
General.

252
00:24:50,969 --> 00:24:52,928
- Where is Zhaixing?
- I'm incompetent.

253
00:24:52,928 --> 00:24:56,148
The princess was almost killed just now and there's no sign of her now.

254
00:24:56,148 --> 00:24:57,670
Speak clearly!

255
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,790
I suppose Her Highness has been saved by Lord Bo.

256
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,870
Lord Bo was the one who saved Zhaixing?

257
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,169
It sounds like utter nonsense, right?

258
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:08,209
But if Lord Bo didn't interfere just now,

259
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:11,349
the princess would've died under the Bo Army's swords.

260
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,569
Lord Bo has rescued Zhaixing.

261
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:17,369
There must be an ulterior motive behind this.

262
00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:19,570
Where is Zhaixing now?

263
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:22,769
After Lord Bo rescued Her Highness,

264
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:25,649
both the troops were left leaderless and so we had to fall back.

265
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,490
Crown Prince wanted to go after them,

266
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:30,409
but the Ma Family Army puts Princess's safety above everything else.

267
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,730
Hence, we came to look for her and ran into you, General.

268
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:36,889
I'll go with you. Let's look for Zhaixing together.

269
00:25:36,889 --> 00:25:39,010
But, General, what about capturing Chu Kui?

270
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:41,289
Just talk as we go along. It's more important to look for her.

271
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,449
Which direction did they go?

272
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,869
Almsgiver, the injuries on your body...

273
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:22,530
Master, please save her.

274
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,809
Hurry!

275
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,949
Put her on the bed!

276
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,969
She's badly wounded.

277
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,190
It seems like she has sustained a severe attack.

278
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,629
Master, please do your best to save her.

279
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,269
I'll try my best.

280
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:04,029
However, I'm worried about your severe injuries caused by arrows.

281
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:09,968
If you don't treat the wounds, you won't have the luck to see her even if she wakes up later.

282
00:27:09,968 --> 00:27:14,210
For her sake, you should...

283
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,910
I know.

284
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,069
General Ma Ying, had I known earlier about Chu Kui's scheme,

285
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:40,029
Zhaixing wouldn't have had to lose her family.

286
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,849
What's done is done.

287
00:27:43,849 --> 00:27:46,750
I can only repay you with the War of Boxiang.

288
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,630
I'm begging you...

289
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:52,770
to let Zhaixing survive this tragedy.

290
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,950
I'll certainly...

291
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,109
repay with my life later.

292
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,870
Your Majesty, I think we should go after the enemy.

293
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,590
No.

294
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,650
Rescuing the princess is of the utmost importance.

295
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,248
The princess is being held captive by Lord Bo.

296
00:28:29,248 --> 00:28:32,009
It's still unclear whether Lord Bo is a friend or foe.

297
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:34,170
We can't take the risk.

298
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,170
Once they retreat to their line of defense,

299
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,529
it'll be difficult for us to attack in the future.

300
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:42,410
We've plenty of chances in the future.

301
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,728
Before I see Princess returning safely,

302
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,729
I won't simply send out the troops.

303
00:28:47,729 --> 00:28:52,349
Juyao has brought along his forces to search for the princess.

304
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,510
Yes.

305
00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:01,890
The most dangerous moment is over, she'll wake up within two days.

306
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,010
Thank you, Master. Thank you.

307
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:13,329
Almsgiver, your injuries...

308
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,470
Hurry and get inside to treat them.

309
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,829
This medicine can only relieve your pain temporarily,

310
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:01,670
but it can't cure your injuries.

311
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:03,430
Never mind.

312
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:09,469
It was an emergency yesterday and I haven't expressed my gratitude to you.

313
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:15,949
I pay respect to Lord Bo and Princess.

314
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:21,970
Apparently, you know who we are.

315
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,769
However, she's no longer the princess.

316
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,088
She's the royal princess of the previous dynasty.

317
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:34,949
But you didn't treat her like a royal princess.

318
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:40,069
Instead, you still treat her as though she's your future wife.

319
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:45,210
How did you know?

320
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,649
I've traveled around the world to pray for the people.

321
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:52,369
This is just my temporary place of rest.

322
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:57,210
I see. Thank you, Master.

323
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,809
You're welcome.

324
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:01,848
I hope you can treat your injuries properly

325
00:33:01,848 --> 00:33:05,869
so that you won't waste my herbs.

326
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,830
Why do you say so?

327
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,830
You're the valiant general of Yang,

328
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,610
yet you're worried about the Princess of Jin.

329
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,428
This alone is odd enough.

330
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,909
Besides, you're skilled in battle.

331
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,828
Even if you wanted to protect the princess, you wouldn't have let yourself

332
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:26,909
sustain such severe injuries that would imperil your life.

333
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,990
But now, your body is in a bloody mess.

334
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:37,009
You must have something up your sleeve or have abandoned your life

335
00:33:37,009 --> 00:33:39,850
as if it were worthless.

336
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,250
It seems like...

337
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,728
you can read me like an open book.

338
00:33:46,728 --> 00:33:51,009
It's just that the onlooker sees more of the game.

339
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,870
Indeed.

340
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,190
But I would rather...

341
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,750
I would rather want her to know that

342
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:16,950
Ma Zhaixing has won...

343
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:18,930
and killed Lord Bo.

344
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,550
That's all.

345
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:22,789
As for the rest,

346
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,529
it would only...

347
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,430
trouble her if she knows too much.

348
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,489
Only if I die,

349
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,830
can she live without sorrow and anxiety.

350
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,349
Imperial Father is still on the throne.

351
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:51,950
Fourth Brother's plan must've failed.

352
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,728
I felt worried and so I sent someone to see what was happening in the capital.

353
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:02,148
The news I received is that the King of Yang has returned to the capital,

354
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:05,570
but there has been no news of Prince of Xun.

355
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:09,030
People still think he's in a state of stupor.

356
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,610
Imperial Father must've blocked the news to reassure the public.

357
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,949
Nevertheless, your current situation is no less difficult than Prince of Xun.

358
00:35:21,949 --> 00:35:27,568
The Yang Army are looking for you and the princess all over the place.

359
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,909
You made up your mind to kill yourself,

360
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:47,209
but apparently, you're not free from worldly attachment yet.

361
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:48,690
Master,

362
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:56,449
how long will it take to reach Jin on foot?

363
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,488
About five to six days.

364
00:35:59,488 --> 00:36:04,230
If you can cross over the Qi Mountain, it'll only take two days.

365
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:10,108
However, it's a rugged mountain region where menace is lurking everywhere.

366
00:36:10,108 --> 00:36:12,029
But...

367
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:15,170
it's also difficult for the Yang Army to make an ambush, right?

368
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,969
Perhaps.

369
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,728
Why? Do you want to cross the Qi Mountain?

370
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,770
As long as I can send Zhaixing back to Jin safely,

371
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,610
I'll undertake

372
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,969
all the risks and dangers.

373
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,689
Amitabha. (Buddhist saying)

374
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,569
Master,

375
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:44,090
I have another favor to ask.

376
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,869
Why aren't you dead yet?

377
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,290
Is this how you treat the person who saved your life?

378
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,089
What are you talking about?

379
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,709
What exactly has happened at the War of Boxiang?

380
00:38:21,709 --> 00:38:25,110
Why are we here?

381
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,490
I've left Yang

382
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:32,570
to pay you back

383
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:40,609
because I discovered that Chu Kui had been using and deceiving me.

384
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,490
I hate being deceived and cheated.

385
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,769
What causes me more regret and shattering pain...

386
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,849
is...

387
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,750
that I've wronged and hurt you.

388
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,809
Hence,

389
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,389
in the War of Boxiang,

390
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:14,190
I chose not to fight or surrender.

391
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:20,449
I chose to pay you back with my life.

392
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,290
I knew that.

393
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,349
When I saw you greeting the rain of arrows alone,

394
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,130
all I could think about was you.

395
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,609
I was thinking that it was really a good idea to take it out on you!

396
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:45,889
Not only did it make you suffer setbacks on the battlefield,

397
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:49,290
but it also made you spout nonsense now.

398
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,689
As expected, I couldn't deceive you.

399
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,669
You're right.

400
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,330
The Wolfbone Flower is really my weakness,

401
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,749
but at least I'm conscious enough to abduct you

402
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:14,190
and take you, a defeated general,

403
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,470
as a useful hostage.

404
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,050
As long as I bring you back,

405
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,589
I can definitely make up for my error.

406
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,709
The noteworthy Lord Bo

407
00:40:27,709 --> 00:40:31,169
has actually ended up taking me hostage to redeem himself.

408
00:40:31,169 --> 00:40:34,149
It seems like Chu Kui has suffered a devastating defeat.

409
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:42,389
But how did you know that

410
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:45,069
I'll do as you wish?

411
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,629
I would rather die than

412
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,090
let you have your way.

413
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,989
I can save you

414
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:08,490
and I can kill you.

415
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,649
This is my ability.

416
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,850
We'll depart right away.

417
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:35,149
I shouldn't let you have any attachment for me.

418
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:38,549
Even until I go back and exchange my life for Youzhen's safety,

419
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:41,149
you should continue seeing me as your enemy

420
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:43,610
and move forward without being swayed.

421
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,649
I must send you to a safe place as soon as possible.

422
