Thank you for your support for our beta test.

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
We’ll hold our first offline dating activity

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,720
Hope to see you then!

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,800

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,480
The app should have sent you a notice.

18
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,320
Xiaochuan, Mr. Du and I will all be there.

19
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
As a member of West World,

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,450
you’ve got to be there, too!

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,160
You’re fed up with your job at MH, right?

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,970
You want to change your job so eagerly, right?

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,640
It’s just a weekend activity.

24
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,160
Why don’t you go as well?

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,760
You can see what Xiaochuan has achieved.

26
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,560
Then maybe your opinions

27
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,220
about West World will change.

28
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,980
There’s no way I’ll go.

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,240
To see the fish?

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,520
I’m not going!

32
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,740
I’m going to sleep.

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Thank you, Mr. Du.

40
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Don’t mention it.

41
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,840
Jun, here.

42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,120
Mr. Du, Jun’s here.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,370
You’re so early, Mr. Du.

44
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,720
Today’s West World's first activity.

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,780
I had to come early.

46
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,440
Jun,

47
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,920
your task today

48
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,360
is to keep Mr. Du company.

49
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,520
Xiaochuan and I will go and do something else.

50
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,760
Don’t you need my help?

51
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,400
That’s ok.

52
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,920
Let’s take a look over there.

53
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,200
So beautiful!

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
These are Moon Jellyfish.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,010
Their bodies are transparent.

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,770
But when the light reflects against them,

57
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,370
they become very colorful.

58
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,040
I heard a story

59
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,120
about Moon Jellyfish long ago.

60
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
A long time ago,

61
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,829
the Earth had two satellites.

62
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,040
One is called Moon, and the other is called Zhou Star.

63
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,829
These two satellites loved each other.

64
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,280
One day, a meteorite was going to hit the Earth

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,000
and then the Moon would go out of orbit.

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
To protect the Moon, the Zhou Star

67
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,440
dashed towards the meteorite without hesitation.

68
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
After the Zhou Star vanished,

69
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,640
the Moon shed tears.

70
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,400
The tears fell into the sea,

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
and became Moon Jellyfish over time.

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,000
Sometimes, humans do the same.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,080
When you fall in love with someone,

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,560
you’ll protect that person at any cost,

75
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,320
just like the Zhou Star.

76
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,680
That's right.

77
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
So beautiful!

78
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Have you heard about Stygiomedusa gigantea?

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,720
Stygiomedusa gigantea?

80
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,720
What a weird name!

81
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
They’re called ghosts in the ocean.

82
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,360
They live deep in the sea.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,400
But that dark place with high pressure

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,440
is like a paradise

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,760
for them.

86
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,720
They like to live in darkness?

87
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,280
Maybe.

88
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,880
They’ve been evolving

89
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,680
over the long course of time.

90
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
Maybe they got used to it long ago.

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,280
But I think,

92
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,100
if they ever had a chance to see the sunlight,

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,450
they’d no longer want to

94
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,880
live in the dark deep sea,

95
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,530
and would strive to head toward the sunlight.

96
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,640
If I were them,

97
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,080
I’d do the same.

98
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,280

99
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,850

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,600
So beautiful!

101
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,420
Like some parachutes.

102
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,640
You’ve been staring at that uncle and that aunt

103
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,920

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,040

105
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,520

106
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,880
Wait!

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,760
Do me a favor

109
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,920

110
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,610

111
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Ok!

112
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
But what favor?

113
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,680

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,840
Uncle!

115
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
Uncle!

116
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,280

117
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,240
-Uncle!
-Uncle!

118
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,760
Uncle!

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,680
Stop calling me!

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,140
Did I hit the right person?

121
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,159
Where’s my lollipop?

122
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,520
Lollipop? Go away!

123
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,450
Didn’t you say you weren’t coming?

124
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
I came to buy fish.

125
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
Buy fish from an aquarium?

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,740
You have a problem with it?

127
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,200
No.

128
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,980
There’s something I want to correct.

129
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,760
Stygiomedusa gigantea is different from others.

130
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,200
There is a speculation that

131
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,520
they already lost their light sensors

132
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,600
in the process of evolution.

133
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,380
That means,

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,410
the dark deep sea

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,300
is the only place they can live in.

136
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,120
Just like certain people,

137
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,780
living in darkness suits them very well.

138
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,840
If Stygiomedusa gigantea seeks sunlight,

139
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,080
maybe they’ll develop new life mechanisms

140
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,760
to adapt to the environment.

141
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Living in darkness

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,800
doesn't mean they can’t strive to
head toward the sunlight, right?

143
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,320
Seems Mr. Du knows a lot about

144
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,480
this venomous creature.

145
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
I know a little.

146
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,030
Then do you know what jellyfish

147
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,400
are the most venomous?

148
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,909
Chironex fleckeri.

149
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,360
They live in the northern coastal waters

150
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,789
of Australia and New Guinea.

151
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,240
People who touch their tentacles

152
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,280
will die immediately.

153
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,880
They’re known as the most lethal

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,480
jellyfish in the world.

155
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,610
Am I right, Mr. Yuan?

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,520
Oh, right.

157
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,200

Irukandji jellyfish.

160
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,680
Their umbrellas are only 1.5 cm in diameter,

161
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,960
and resemble the shape of a cube.

162
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,120
They are mainly found at Great Barrier Reef,

163
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,080
and a hundred times more poisonous than cobras.

164
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,740

Here you are.

195
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,760

Thank you.

197
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Come closer to me!

198
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,680
Just give him the water.

199
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,000
Don't get too close to him.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,920
You're a girl. Do you know that?

201
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,650

202
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,180

203
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,610
Mr. Du doesn’t even want the water.

204
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,520
Hello?

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,640
Du,

206
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,940
dad is in the hospital.

207
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,640
Can you come take a look at him?

208
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,840
What happened to dad?

209
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,370
He suddenly passed out at home.

210
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,520
Now he’s receiving the emergency treatment.

211
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,650
Send me the address.

Yes, I am.

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,680
Is she an idiot?

230
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Thank you very much

Move away!

250
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,440
I thought children cannot

251
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,890
sign up for an account of Xiaochuan’s app.

252
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,360
Don’t tell me you've got a match?

253
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,760
How... How is that possible?

254
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,880
I came to help as a friend.

255
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,840
You've got a match?

256
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,180
You’re kidding me?

257
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,440
I haven't even used the app.

258
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,160
I just came to take a look.

259
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
-I’ll go to Li then.
-I’ll go to Xiaochuan then.

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,880
See you later.

261
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,480
Why are you still here?

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,200
You owe me a lollipop!

263
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,260
Still remembering the lollipop?

264
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,410
I don’t have lollipops.

265
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,450
No money. I only have a heating pad.

267

Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

What about now?

272
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,080
Of course you should go in.

275
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,720

277
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
But I don't want to attend a blind date.

00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,380
[Oh my!
Mr. Yuan just came to welcome a girl personally.]

568
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,580
Did you see that? Did you see that?

569
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,440
Look! Look!

570
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,770
Right. What’s going on?

571
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,240
How come Mr. Yuan is ushering a girl in?

572
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,720
What a rare scene!

573
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Ms. Xinxin, this way.

574
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,040
Hello.

575
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,120
Hello.

576
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:26,760
Wait.

577
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,080
Where is Ms. Jiang?

578
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,280
She went to a client’s company.

579
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,680
She’ll be back later.

580
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,760
I see.

581
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,240
I also brought some food for you two.

582
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,100
Thank you, Ms. Xinxin.

583
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,120
This way.

584
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,640
Oh my! Who is this girl?

585
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,280
Mr. Yuan is so polite to her.

586
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,560
There’s only one reason for this.

587
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,040
It must be that Mr. Yuan

588
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,360
landed a key client on his own merits.

589
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Not necessarily.

590
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,080
She looks so young.

591
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,540
She could be the daughter of a key client.

592
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
That makes sense.

593
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,720
Mr. Yuan is so handsome.

594
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,700
He should take advantage of that.

595
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,040
Seems that

596
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Mr. Yuan also needs to make use of
his good appearance.

597
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
Cut the gossip.

598
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,170
It’d be bad if Mr. Yuan heard it.

599
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,190
Like we don’t know?

600
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,440
Mr. Su, Ms. Xinxin is here.

601
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,560
Honey.

602
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,840
Let me know in advance if you come again.

603
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,190
I got it.

604
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,520
Again?

605
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,960
No again.

606
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,520
I was wrong, Boss.

607
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,920
Mr. Su, I’ll leave if there’s nothing else.

608
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,200
Yuan...

609
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
Ms. Jiang is here.

610
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,890
Ms. Xinxin is here, too.

611
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
The thing I wanted to tell Mr. Su

612
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,200
is actually not very urgent.

613
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,440
I’ll excuse myself then.

614
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,120
Wait!

615
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,080
I’ve also brought lunch for you.

616
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,000
Come eat with us.

617
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,040
And Yuan.

618
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,280
-Ok then.
-Ok.

619
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,280
Thank you.

620
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,160
Yuan, I’m thirsty.

621
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,480
Get me some water.

622
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,600
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

623
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Ms. Jiang,

624
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
you and Yuan

625
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,320
are having an office romance.

626
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,240
Is it exciting?

627
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,400
Ms. Jiang, slowly.

628
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,920
Don’t choke.

629
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,920
Not bad.

630
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,000
You're shy?

631
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,040
Really.

632
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,440
Hurry! Eat up!

633
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,320
Ok.

634
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,280
Yuanyuan,

635
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,440
open it for me.

636
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,600
You call him Yuanyuan?

637
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,920
So sweet.

638
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,000
Of course.

639
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,920
Yuanyuan is very caring.

640
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,080
He’d separate meat and vegetables for me,

641
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,280
and I don’t eat carrots and soybeans.

642
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,320
He separates them for me every time.

643
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,280
Am I right?

644
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,200
So caring.

645
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
How come there are so many soybeans?

646
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,120
And there. There’s one more.

647
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,240
I'm not blind.

648
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,010
Ms. Jiang, enjoy your food.

649
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,840
Thank you.

650
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
I dropped my chopsticks.

651
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,800
Yuanyuan, pick them up for me.

652
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

653
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,340
Please, Ms. Jiang.

654
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,040
I don’t want to use chopsticks anymore.

655
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,280
How about…

656
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,240
You feed me?

657
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,640
It’d be my honor to feed you.

658
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,600
By the way, Ms. Jiang,

659
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,600
I heard from Su Chang that

660
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,200
he has a boss

661
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,120
who’s very difficult to handle.

662
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:13,490
He’s very fierce when he punishes people.

663
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,720
Right!

664
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,680
He’s very fierce,

665
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,200
narcissistic and cocky.

666
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I don’t dare to mess with him either.

667
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,640
So exaggerating?

668
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,560
I heard from Su Chang that

669
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,880
he’s still single

670
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,240
even at his age,

671
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,680
and he was always envious of Su Chang.

672
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,320
He’s so evil-minded.

673
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,000
He must be very ugly-looking.

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,040
Maybe he’s even bald.

675
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
Besides,

676
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,040
since he has such a high position,

677
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,680
it’s so bizarre that he doesn't

678
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,040
even have one woman around him.

679
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,280
So I guess,

680
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,360
could it be that he...

681
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,440
Honey,

682
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,760
the food is getting cold.

683
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,960
Hurry and have some.

684
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,560
Ms. Jiang,

685
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,400
Su Chang doesn’t really think

686
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
before he speaks sometimes.

687
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,660
He tends to offend people.

688
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,140
Especially when his leader bullies him,

689
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,800
I hope you can

690
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,320
do something to help him.

691
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,040
How is that possible?

692
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,080
Mr. Su is the most likable person

693
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,480
in the company.

694
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,760
His boss and subordinates

695
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,760
all like him very much.

696
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,680
He’ll never get bullied.

697
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
Right, Mr. Su?

698
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,600
Right.

699
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,880
And now with your support,

700
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
I’m sure

701
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,800
Mr. Su will take his career

702
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,080
to the next level.

703
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,820
It’s getting late.

704
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,800
I need to go to a nail salon with my friend.

705
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,840
You keep chatting.

706
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
I should get going.

707
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,210
Bye-bye.

708
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:54,960
Bye-bye.

709
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,280
Oh, Honey.

710
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,560
My friend wants to

711
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,850
eat with us tonight.

712
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,120
Her husband came back.

713
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,720
He always wanted to meet you.

714
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,800
Don't forget this.

715
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,680
I’ll be there if I’m still alive by then.

716
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,200
Nothing...

717
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,130
I’ll see you off.

718
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,880
Mr. Su!

719
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,120
I have something to tell you.

720
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,280
Let Yuanyuan see her off.

721
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,080
Yuanyuan,

722
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,240
go.

723
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,720
Ok, Ms. Jiang.

724
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,080
Ms. Xinxin, please.

725
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,120
This way.

726
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,280
Yuan, you can go back.

727
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,120
Print this and inform everyone.

728
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,560
Ok.

729
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,400
Work hard.

730
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,360
Keep it up.

731
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
Ok, Ms. Xinxin.

732
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,680
I’m leaving then.

733
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,320
Ok.

734
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,840
Bye-bye.

735
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,040
Hello.

736
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,760
I’m the VP of MH, Qiao Na.

737
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,720
Which company do you represent?

738
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,850
I’m not a client.

739
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,420
I came to see my boyfriend.

740
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,490
Your boyfriend?

741
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,300
Yuan Shuai?

742
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,240
No! No!

743
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
Please don’t misunderstand.

744
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,960
Yuan already has a girlfriend.

745
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,240
I’ve been working with him for many years.

746
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,120
How come I don't know he has a girlfriend?

747
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,200
Can you tell me who she is?

748
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,080
Anyway, try to stay away from them..

749
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,240
If she knew you find out her secret,,

750
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,500
she’d give me a hard time at work..

751
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,720
I... I don’t know who she is.

752
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,960
That’s just what I’ve heard.

753
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,800
I have something else to do.

754
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,060
I'm leaving. Bye-bye.

755
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,460
Love Is Sweet
