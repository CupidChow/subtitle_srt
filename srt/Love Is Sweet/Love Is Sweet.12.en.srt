Love is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love is Sweet

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 12

5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,920
You don’t have to thank me officially

6
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,759
since it’s my job to help a newbie.

7
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,440
But,

8
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,240
given that you become one of us,

9
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,520
and you took charge of the case of
Wanxing Entertainment particularly,

10
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,640
and as your leader,

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,240
I should remind you of this.

12
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,840
Take a closer look at this.

13
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,720
I’ve told you to stay away from

14
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,040
Mr. Du.

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Du Lei has always

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,400
aimed at me, the person in front of you.

17
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,600
He and Wan Shan

18
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,920
are just two cunning companions.

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
He’s the reason why Tang Xin
dropped the case.

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Jiang Jun.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
You have to know this.

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,000
There’s no free lunch,

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,360
or a free teacher.

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,240
Yeah?

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
So, is there a free house in this world?

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,290
What do you mean?

27
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,640
Mr. landlord.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,000
You’ve been hiding it from me so well.

29
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,560
No, Jiang Jun.

30
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,980
Don’t get me wrong.

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,240
Actually, I think

32
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,320
it’s my bad that I didn’t
let you join MH before.

33
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,360
So,

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,160
considering we’ve known
each other for years,

35
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,240
I hope you can live in a good place

36
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,040
which helps you recover from
the unemployment.

37
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
I didn’t have other intentions.

38
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,080
“Help me”?

39
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,360
You raised my rent.

40
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,580
I could go nowhere.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,160
You let me live in the house you arranged

42
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,280
through all kinds of tricks.

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,079
“Help me”?

44
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,800
Or you should say you’ve been used to

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
telling others what to do about their lives.

46
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,360
You played me because you’re bored.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Is it funny to see me

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
move in and out?

49
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,780
This is how you think of me?

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,800
My house is so much better

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,960
than your previous one, isn’t it?

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,560
Liar.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,240
I...

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
I’m not living in a liar’s house.

55
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,740
I’ll move out tonight.

56
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,040
Why do you take so many stuff here?

57
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,880
Are you going to live here for a long time?

58
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,480
Why? You don’t want me here?

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,320
Don’t worry.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,660
I’ve already started to look for houses.

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
Houses?

62
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,080
Where do you think you can find a good house
like the one you live in?

63
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,440
I saw Yuan Shuai and Xiaochuan were

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,840
having a joyful conversation.

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought he has become a good man.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,200
I didn’t expect he would play you again.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,240
They’re from one family.

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,720
Why are they so different?

69
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,300
Do you think he fools Xiaochuan, too?

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Jiang Jun,

71
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,320
I think you could help me ask Yuan Shuai out.

72
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,880
Are you going to revenge on him for me?

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,640
No.

74
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,840
I’m publishing my novel in installments.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,240
They wrote in the comment that

76
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,720
my villain is too flat.

77
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,320
I think I could ask him out

78
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,580
and interview him.

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
He can tell me about the ways

80
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
he fooled you.

81
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,400
Gosh.

82
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,360
How could he keep fooling you

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,200
for over 10 years?

84
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,120
Now that I have such a stubborn
villain around me,

85
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,120
I should take advantage of this chance

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,380
and put him in my novel.

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,480
He will be famous forever.

88
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,200
Jiang Jun.

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,600
Brother Yuanyuan.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,400
Jiang Jun, jump off.

91
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,680
I’m scared.

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,370
It’s okay. You can jump off.

93
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,320
I’m scared.

94
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Don’t be scared.

95
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,760
Trust me.

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,160
I will  catch you. Come on.

97
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Come on.

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,320
Brother Yuanyuan.

99
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,160
I’m jumping.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
You have to catch me.

101
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,560
Come on. ready?

102
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,880
One,

103
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,120
two,

104
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,520
three.

105
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Jump.

106
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,900
Did you hurt yourself?

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,060
You deserve it.

108
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
You said you would catch me.

109
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,320
Liar.

110
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,280
I wanted to give you a lesson.

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,360
Don’t believe a man’s words.

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,920
That’s harsh.

113
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,170
I don’t think it’s reasonable.

114
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,280
How?

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,160
Lied about the house?

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Or lied about catching me?

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,040
All of them.

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,360
I think

119
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,440
Yuan Shuai was thinking that you
grew up together,

120
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,330
and now you joined the company,

121
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,000
so he wanted you to live in a good place.

122
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Stop your unrealistic imagination.

123
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,360
He is a guileful man.

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,600
There’s no excuse.

125
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,100
And there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

126
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,880
It’s sweetness and pain.

127
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,480
No.

128
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
What's wrong?

129
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
This can’t be solved.

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,040
Well. Tell me.

131
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,720
Why did she think I played her?

132
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,600
No.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,200
What did you do to her?

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,440
She

135
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
found out that I’m her landlord.

136
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,680
This is the reason why

137
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
you are here drinking?

138
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,320
Do you even have a clue?

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
So, you think you can stay around her

140
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,520
through all kinds of ways,

141
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
then she will start to like you?

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
Won’t she?

143
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,960
You’re being simple-minded.

144
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
Well.

145
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
For other girls,

146
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,320
it might work.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,480
But for that girl,

148
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,560
it won’t work.

149
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,000
You fooled her so many times.

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,400
I even thought you’re a cruel man.

151
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Unless she has Stockholm Syndrome,

152
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,560
she won’t believe

153
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
the super villain in her life

154
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,280
is in love with her.

155
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,880
Then, tell me.

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,760
Will she like me?

157
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,560
Do you think this Smurf will like Gargamel?

158
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,840
I’ll go back pack my stuff.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,360
Change my flight

160
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,200
to the earliest one tomorrow.

161
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,280
I’m leaving now.

162
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,610
I will go on a business trip.

163
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,360
Boss.

164
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,760
Boss.

165
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,690
Xiang Ding,

166
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,600
I need to get the signature of Mr. Yuan.

167
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,530
Isn’t he coming?

168
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,789
He went to Beijing.

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,010
Is it important?

170
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,080
It’s fine. I can wait.

171
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
Hello?

172
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Are you available?

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,220
I’m near your company.

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Can we meet?

175
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,960
I’m sorry.

176
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,650
I have some paper work to do.

177
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,040
I resigned from GE.

178
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,060
[CRYSTAL PALACE ARTS BOOKSTORE]

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,720
Why?

180
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,480
I met Yuan Shuai.

181
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
He thought I used you about
Wanxing’s case.

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,760
And you know

183
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
I know Wan Shan.

184
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,160
I’m afraid you would misunderstand me.

185
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:31,960
So...

186
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
Just because of this?

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,520
Actually, I...

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,920
GE has paid a lot attention
to this case.

189
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,650
And Wan Shan’s my dad’s
old acquaintance.

190
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,160
He came to me multiple times.

191
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,220
But I rejected him.

192
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,080
Why didn’t you tell me?

193
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Because we are rivals.

194
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,680
And we agreed that

195
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,640
We wouldn’t interfere with each other’s work.

196
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,920
Sorry, Mr. Du.

197
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,960
It’s okay.

198
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,400
It’s not important.

199
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,800
Actually, it’s a relief for me.

200
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,420
Having worked as an outsider,

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
now I finally have a chance

202
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,520
to do what I want to do.

203
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,290
So, what’re you going to do?

204
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,180
I haven’t thought it through.

205
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,560
I was an instructor in financial
training institutions.

206
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,720
I may head towards this.

207
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,050
It’s hard to say.

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
So,

209
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
you won’t be a teacher exclusive for me.

210
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,920
Forty seven.

211
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,040
Forty eight.

212
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,920
Forty nine.

213
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,520
Why haven’t you left work yet?

214
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,780
What are you counting?

215
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,840
If 50 people pass by,

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,680
and my love still hasn’t come,

217
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,440
I will leave.

218
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Your love is too magical.

219
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,040
I’ll go work then.

220
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,760
Is it because I pushed it too hard

221
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,440
when watching the movie?

222
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,640
He has been absent for a week.

223
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,660
[Wi-Fi]

224
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,440
The Wi-Fi is working well.

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,280
Is there a convenience store

226
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
with better network?

227
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,600
Xu Li,

228
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
there’s a delivery order.

229
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,440
Can you deliver it

230
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,240
when you leave?

231
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:57,800
Okay.

232
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,640
Thank you.

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
It’s okay.

234
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,040
Room 701?

235
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,480
Yuan Shuai?

236
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,480
This guileful man.

237
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,740
[Sandwich*5 Ramen*10
Sausage*20 Coffee*5 Cola*10]

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
This is a long list.

239
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,040
Wait for my prank.

240
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
You’ll be irritated.

241
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,340
How dare you fooled Jiang Jun!

242
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,440
I...

243
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I...

244
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,680
Well, why are you here?

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,240
Yuan Shuai went on a business trip.

246
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,560
He asked me to take care of his dog.

247
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,480
So...

248
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,440
A business trip?

249
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,940
You’re taking care of his dog!

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
So, you are at home alone?

251
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,720
Gosh, he’s so cute?

252
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,810
What’s his name?

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,560
Wealth.

254
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,520
Wealth.

255
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,800
Wealthy

256
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,840
Well, you bought a lot of fast food.

257
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,000
Are you going to stay indoors for long?

258
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
These days are very important to me.

259
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,440
Because I’m working on the last algorithm.

260
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,200
So, I will be very busy.

261
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,720
But dogs need exercise.

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,720
It is doing exercise on time.

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:54,880
Wealth.

264
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,320
Is this the exercise?

265
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,520
Does it have food?

266
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,860
Adequate food on time.

267
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,680
This is the only thing Yuan Shuai
asked me to do.

268
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,400
You’re so obedient.

269
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,240
But dogs need...

270
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,840
What?

271
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,720
Poop.

272
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,960
Defecate?

273
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,520
Since you’re busy,

274
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,760
I can help you walk the dog.

275
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,840
Okay, thank you.

276
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,040
This is the first time he said that to me.

277
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,600
I’m so happy.

278
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,760
I’ll go walk the dog for you.

279
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,720
Wealth, let’s go.

280
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,120
The leash.

281
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:06,960
Over there.

282
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
Wealth, come here.

283
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,080
I’m leaving, bye.

284
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,840
No.

285
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,800
No, no! I took it wrong.

286
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,640
I’m sorry. This is not yours.

287
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,560
Wrong delivery.

288
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,040
I’ll go deliver this first.

289
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
Go on with your work. Bye!

290
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,480
Let’s go.

291
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,120
Bye.

292
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,200
Jiang Jun, Bye.

293
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,760
Bye.

294
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,000
It seems you’ll stay up late again.

295
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,440
Come on.

296
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
I bought this at noon.

297
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Take care.

298
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:15,840
Thank you.

299
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,770
You’re welcome.

300
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,200
Turn off the light for me when you leave.

301
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,800
Okay, bye.

302
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,840
Bye.

303
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,640
This is the financial report
and supporting accounts of Hudi Group.

304
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,360
I want a complete

305
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,090
assets evaluation report.

306
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Am I doing this alone?

307
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,980
do you want me to do it with you?

308
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Okay, Mr. Ma.

309
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,780
Are you still working?

310
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You know everything.

311
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,620
Don’t sit for too long.

312
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,090
Stand up and do some jumping jacks.

313
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,920
It’s useful.

314
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
Hello, your food.

315
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,520
I didn’t order any.

316
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,240
Jiang Jun, right?

317
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,640
It’s yours.

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,260
Please rate five stars for me, thank you.

319
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
Did you get the food?

320
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,040
Yeah, I got it.

321
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,040
Thank you!

322
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,130
Work can never be finished.

323
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,450
Go home after you finish your food.

324
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
I will drop by in a minute.

325
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,420
Do you need me to take you home?

326
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,440
Home?

327
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,160
I don’t have one.

328
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,880
No, its okay

329
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
I still have a lot of stuff to do.

330
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
I will stay here.

331
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
I’m safe. Don’t worry.

332
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,400
Well...

333
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,040
How did you drive?

334
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,080
I’m sorry.

335
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
I was in a hurry.

336
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,200
I didn’t notice that.

337
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,760
You even broke the bumper.

338
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,440
Let’s just settle it in private.

339
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,700
Are you okay with that?

340
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,760
Or give me a price. Okay?

341
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,440
Bro.

342
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,680
He already took the photo.

343
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,600
I’m fully responsible for this.

344
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,400
Don’t mind me.

345
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,290
I just wanted to take a picture.

346
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
You can go on.

347
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,400
Okay, boss.

348
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,720
So, how do we solve in private?

349
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,780
[Yuan Shuai: I had a car accident]

350
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,560
A collision.

351
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,760
A like?

352
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
But why a like?

353
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,840
I had a car accident.

354
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,600
Liar. It’s none of my business.

355
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,960
But...

356
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,320
Not even a like?

357
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,040
How mean!

358
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,610
What do you mean, Jiang Jun?

359
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,000
I have a call.

360
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,940
Calculate the compensation.

361
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,680
Hello?

362
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,600
Baby.

363
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Are you sleeping?

364
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,820
I’m working overtime.

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,560
A good news!

366
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,400
I can go back in the last semester.

367
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,960
We don’t need to be separated.

368
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,160
Really? Great!

369
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,680
I’ll pick you up.

370
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,200
Are you done?

371
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,840
I’m going to work.

372
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,860
Baby, I have to hang up.

373
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,680
My boss is rushing me.
I gotta go.

374
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,650
If you keep doing like this,

375
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,650
and do something else during work,

376
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,120
you won’t have year-end bonus.

377
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,240
Boss, I didn’t.

378
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,560
My girlfriend told me

379
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,720
she would come back soon.

380
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,040
Are you doing this intentionally?

381
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,960
Definitely not

382
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,520
I just want to tell you

383
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,200
she and I also grew up together.

384
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,280
We’ve been together for years.

385
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,920
We never quarreled with each other.

386
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,960
I have some skills.

387
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,800
Skills?

388
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,080
But...

389
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,280
I posted the car accident on Moments.

390
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,240
She gave a like.

391
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
What does she mean?

392
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,160
Boss.

393
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,640
I think

394
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,800
you owe her a genuine apology.

395
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,880
An apology?

396
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,320
I didn’t order anything.

397
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,200
I’m here to help you walk the dog.

398
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,320
This is my compensation to the
wrong delivery.

399
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,480
I brought some strawberries, blueberries,

400
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,840
bread and milk.

401
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,500
I already washed them for you.

[Western World Upgrading]

403
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,640
And coffee, to refresh you.

404
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,640
Men who work hard are
really handsome.

405
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Wealth.

406
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,180
[Western World Upgraded]

407
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,040
I did it.

408
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,400
You’re the first one

409
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,240
to witness my Western World.

410
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,240
Listen.

411
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,890
I used an algorithm,

412
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,280
called Naive Bayesian algorithm.

413
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
I did a classification experiment

414
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,040
on all my data to simulate genes.

415
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,880
Do you know

416
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,800
what happened?

417
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,560
The match method I adopted
is extremely accurate.

418
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,760
It’s a huge breakthrough.

419
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,180
Congratulations!

420
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,640
What Bay algorithm?

421
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,960
I...

422
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,040
I can’t tell you exactly now.

423
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,600
But...

424
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,520
After I sorted everything

425
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,320
out,

426
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,600
I can explain it to you, okay?

427
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,720
My gosh.

428
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,720
He suddenly knows how to
enchant a girl.

429
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,000
What do I do?

430
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,920
My heart beats so fast.

431
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,000
Well...

432
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,610
I’ll walk the dog first.

433
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080
I’ve already done it.

434
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,800
Well...

435
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,960
Well...

436
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,360
I’m going to work then.

437
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,200
See you tomorrow.

438
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,240
Jiang Jun.

439
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,080
Mr. Ma, good morning.

440
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,400
You categorized the work briefs

441
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,280
according to the asset list

442
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,640
in a detailed way.

443
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,920
It’s easy for me to search anything I want.

444
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,240
This is what I should do.

445
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,700
I have joined MH for years,

446
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,360
and haven’t seen a newbie as careful
as you.

447
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,440
I’m flattered.

448
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,240
My English name is Bole.

449
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,720
In Chinese, it means talent scout.

450
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,640
In my opinion,

451
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,440
newbies are divided into two types.

452
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,480
One is wild boars.

453
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,840
The other is domestic pigs.

454
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,440
Do you know what I mean?

455
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,520
Wild boars are great.

456
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,460
They have a promising future.

457
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,640
They dare to explore and work hard.

458
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,850
It’s an interesting metaphor.

459
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,880
Be prepared

460
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,280
after work.

461
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,840
Mr. Qin from Wanbo is treating us.

462
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,080
You’re great.

463
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,360
I especially recommended you

464
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,760
to join the dinner on behalf of the company.

465
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,080
Me?

466
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,080
Work hard!

467
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,210
I believe in you.

468
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,840
Mr. Ma.

469
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,720
Morning.

470
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,000
Morning.

471
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,400
Mr. Yuan.

472
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,000
The offer is too low.

473
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
You have a big appetite.

474
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,290
Going back on your words

475
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,000
is a taboo in this industry.

476
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,160
It’s not too much to ask 20% more.

477
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,770
Impossible.

478
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
Do you know the offer

479
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,890
Jinding Investment Bank made?

480
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,380
They’re not on the same level.

481
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,040
Jinding is not as famous as MH.

482
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,040
But their offer is great.

483
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,240
Mr. Yuan.

484
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,570
Mr. Ma sent Jiang Jun

485
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
to see Mr. Qin from Wanbo.

486
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,280
I heard he’s hard to deal with.

487
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,880
Jiang Jun may have a trouble.

488
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,320
I’ll give you one minute.

489
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,740
If you don’t accept it,

490
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,880
the cooperation will be terminated.

491
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,360
But I want to remind you something.

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,840
If I announce the termination
of cooperation

493
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,040
with you in public,

494
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,840
I believe no companies will

495
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,780
be interested in you anymore.

496
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,280
Start the countdown.

497
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
Book the quickest flight back to Shanghai.

498
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:58,960
Okay.

499
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,840
Mr. Yuan.

500
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,250
We’re not finished.

501
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,210
Thirty seconds.

502
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,520
Hurry up.

503
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,160
Do you have an answer?

504
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,240
Everyone.

505
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,680
We’re going to

506
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,240
get really drunk.

507
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,120
-Today...
-Let’s drink to the dregs.

508
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,960
We have enough wine.

509
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,800
-Come on.
-Cheers.

510
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,480
Hey, you guys.

511
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,800
Drink up your wine. Hurry up.

512
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,240
Your wine’s not getting any less.

513
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
Okay, right away.

514
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,800
Jiang Jun, make it two.

515
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,860
One more glass.

516
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,440
Well, I can’t drink liquor.

517
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,840
I will drink it up.

518
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,240
Come on.

519
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,720
You’re a good drinker.

520
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Ms. Jiang, where are you going?

521
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,440
I’m sorry, Mr. Qin.

522
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,080
I have to use the bathroom.

523
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,360
Why are you carrying your bag?

524
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,280
I’m fixing my makeup.

525
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,680
Come on.

526
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,840
One more.

527
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,980
How about this?

528
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,480
I’ll make a drink for you.

529
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
But this first glass,

530
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,280
I have to drink it with Ms. Jiang.

531
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,280
Ms. Jiang,

532
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,960
Mr. Ma praised you a lot in front of me.

533
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
Although you’re a newbie,

534
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
you’re smart, competent and bold.

535
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,200
It’s a high evaluation.

536
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,240
But I do have a habit.

537
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,480
I don’t care about your
moral standing.

538
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,200
Everyone familiar with me knows that

539
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
my rule is that

540
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,300
the ability to drink is your
moral standing.

541
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,560
Wait.

542
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,840
This is the first time we met each other.

543
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,540
This is too simple.

544
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,620
We have to make it serious.

545
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,500
This is needed.

546
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,320
Come, hold it for me.

547
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,840
Right.

548
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,040
Come, give it to me.

549
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,440
The last step

550
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,680
is called a hundred flowers in bloom.

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,160
Ms. Jiang, can you feel my sincerity?

552
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,480
Come on.

553
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
Mr. Qin,

554
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
I would like to drink with you.

555
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,120
But I’m allergic to alcohol.

556
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,080
Look at my face.

557
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,400
Mr. Qin,

558
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Jiang Jun’s face has flushed.

559
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,920
She really can’t drink.

560
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,720
Please don’t force her

561
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,160
for the sake of me.

562
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,040
I’ll take her out for a ride.

563
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,120
So, Ms. Jiang doesn’t want to

564
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,920
drink with me.

565
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,280
It’s okay.

566
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,480
Sit.

567
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,560
Jiang Jun.

568
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,160
If you can’t drink it,

569
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,700
I will drink it for you.

570
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,120
Come, Mr. Qin. I can drink for her.

571
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,240
Okay, here.

572
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
Mr. Qin is a big client to MH.

573
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,200
I’ll definitely drink with you.

574
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,920
Okay, good.

575
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,960
No wonder Mr. Ma recommended you,

576
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,760
you’re great.

577
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,680
Sit now.

578
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,780
Excuse me, I have to pick it up.

579
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,160
Hello?

580
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,520
Is it convenient for you?

581
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,380
I’m having dinner with several clients.

582
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,520
Why is there so noisy?

583
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,600
Did you drink?

584
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,080
Send me your location. Stay there.

585
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,940
I’ll come over.

586
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,240
Let go of me.

587
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,770
Let go of your hands.

588
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,840
Come on.

589
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,240
How are you?

590
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,400
Let’s go home.

591
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Yuan?

592
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,480
Shut up!

593
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,840
Be careful.

594
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,820
[Mr. Du]

595
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,400
My phone.

596
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,710
Hello?

597
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,600
Is she okay?

598
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,190
It’s none of your business.

599
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,600
Tell me.

600
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,840
I shouldn’t drink during work hours.

601
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:57,960
It’s my fault.

602
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,080
What I mean is

603
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,280
how can you let Ma Xiuran

604
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,800
ride the high horse?

605
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,570
I told you so many times.

606
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,600
This is a battlefield.

607
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,600
Not an examination room.

608
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
It’s not like we have many rules here.

609
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,000
There’re no test monitors.

610
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,320
You cannot take it all

611
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,080
when dealing with Ma Xiuran.

612
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,720
When did I take it all?

613
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,820
Yuan Shuai, do you have a problem?

614
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,200
Can you be reasonable?

615
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,320
Yeah.

616
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I’m being stupid again.

617
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,360
What else can I do?

618
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,520
Can I deny Ma Xiuran’s orders?

619
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,200
Why can you deny me?

620
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
Don’t touch me.

621
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,700
What’re you doing?

622
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,610
Get down, Jiang Jun.

623
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,140
It’s dangerous there.

624
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,080
Hurry.

625
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,800
You’re a big liar.

626
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,720
Don’t be silly. Get down.

627
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,840
It’s dangerous.

628
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,320
Don’t puke.

629
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,960
Don’t.

630
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,280
Get down. I’ll catch you.

631
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,120
Get over it.

632
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,720
Do you think I’ll be fooled
by you again?

633
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,600
Get away.

634
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,580
Don’t fool around, Jiang Jun!

635
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
Get down!

636
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,220
What’re you doing?

637
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
It’s dangerous.

638
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,480
I’ll catch you, come on.

639
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:41,840
Get down.

640
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,620
Did you hurt yourself?

641
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,740
You deserve it.

642
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,240
You said you would catch me.

643
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,000
Liar.

644
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,080
I wanted to give you a lesson.

645
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,040
Don’t believe a man’s words.

646
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,640
I won’t believe you anymore.

647
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,760
Crying Girl.

648
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,400
I’ll catch you.

649
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,400
Three mistakes equal to a voluntary
turnover, right?

650
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,680
This is the second mistake.

651
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,040
You got me.

652
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:50,840
I promise there won’t be a third one.

653
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,040
You silly.

654
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,120
You’re already a regular employee.

655
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,720
I won’t let you leave.

656
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Shush!

657
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,720
Don’t bring Yuan Shuai,
the big wolf, here!

658
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,720
Got it, you little sheep.

659
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,200
Let’s go home.

660
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,460
Love is Sweet
