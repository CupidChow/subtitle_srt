00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,580
If it’s a play, make it a full play.

194
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,520
Isn't that the task you assigned me?

195
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,780
Mr. Yuan, you can't be so narrow-minded.

196
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,440
Come here.

197
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,560
What?

198
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,360
Come here!

199
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
Warm your cold hands.

200
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,040
Don’t fall sick.

201
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,920
Ok. Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

202
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
I’m afraid that if you get ill,
it might affect your work.

203
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,520
I’m not going to be easier on you
just because you are sick.

204
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,520
Warm?

205
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,520
Mr. Yuan,

206
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,210
it is said that
there will be the first snow this evening.

207
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,600
So?

208
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,370
How rare it is to have snow in Shanghai!

209
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Shouldn’t it be a little ritualistic?

210
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,210
What kind of ritual do you want?

211
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,600
Why don't we cook hot pot at home?

212
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,560
Hot pot?

213
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,920
Good idea.

214
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,800
I have something to do tonight,

215
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,530
but I'll go home as soon as I can.

216
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,540
Then I'll eat it by myself.

217
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,490
If you come back late,
you won't have anything to eat.

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,650
You really know how to make hot pot?

219
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,210
I remember the soup you made

220
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,080
was unbearable even for Wealth.

221
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
Who are you belittling?

222
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,400
I promise it will move you
to tears this time.

223
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,280
Ok, I'll wait.

224
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,240
Ok. I’m not cold any more.

225
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
I’m going.

226
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,720
First snow?

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,360
Wealth.

228
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,960
Are you here to welcome me?

229
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,760
Let’s go.

230
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,960
Come here.

231
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Come here.

232
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
Never mind.

233
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,180
If I set up the table with candles,
he'll laugh at me.

234
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,130
Where are Mr. Wu and Mrs. Wu?

235
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,010
Actually, they didn't ask you out.

236
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,880
It’s me.

237
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Is there something you can't say at work

238
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,480
so that you have to ask me out?

239
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,120
There are a lot of things that
I can't talk about in the office.

240
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's have dinner first.

241
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,650
These are your favorite foods.

242
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,520
Actually, I met a girl in the company today,

243
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,160
and she told me

244
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,780
you have a girlfriend.

245
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
Is it true?

246
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,940
I don't have a girlfriend.

247
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,600
So that’s it.

248
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,090
How could you possibly have a girlfriend?

249
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,080
Why can't I have a girlfriend?

250
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Yuan Shuai.

251
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,160
They said that

252
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,640
love is a momentary impulse.

253
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,530
Do you believe in the eternal love?

254
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,640
I do.

255
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,960
Of course I do.

256
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,120
I believe, like most people,

257
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,640
that an instant can become an eternity.

258
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you think

259
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,010
there will be a moment like that

260
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,040
between us?

261
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,080
No.

262
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,920
Why?

263
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,440
Everyone thinks we are

264
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,960
the perfect match.

265
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,960
Qiao Na,

266
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,580
you're my best partner

267
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,680
at work.

268
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,280
I also sincerely

269
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,240
regard you as my best friend.

270
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,040
But apart from that,

271
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,460
there is nothing else between us.

272
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Yuan Shuai!

273
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,040
Sorry! Sorry!

274
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
I didn't mean it.

275
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,380
That's ok. I'm going to the bathroom.

276
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,560
Wealth,

277
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,170
why isn't your father back yet?

278
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,180
Why don't I give him a call?

279
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,520
It's ok for the subordinate

280
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,840
to care about the leader.

281
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
It's not safe at night, is it?

282
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,360
See?

283
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,600
There’s so much to eat.

284
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,240
It’s too much for us. Right?

285
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,520
Call him?

286
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,720
Forget that.

287
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,280
Let’s eat it.

288
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,440
Some vinegar for you.

289
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,240
Wealth, there’s no vinegar.

290
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,000
I'll ask your father
to buy you a bottle of vinegar, okay?

291
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,330
Don’t you like vinegar?

292
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,800
Let me give him a call.

293
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,060
[Jiang Jun]

294
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,360
Hello. There's no vinegar left at home.

295
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,840
What vinegar?

296
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,400
Ms. Qiao?

297
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,880
Yes, it’s me.

298
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,320
Mr. Yuan has no time

299
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,760
to guide you in your work tonight.

300
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,800
We are very busy.

301
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,440
Don't call again.

302
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,120
Who cares if you don’t come back?

303
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,180
I’ll eat it myself!

304
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,800
You'll be sorry! You'll be sorry!

305
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,760
I have a few things to do, so I'm leaving.

306
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,420
Do you have something to do
with some other girl?

307
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,520
Whoever it is, it's my business.

308
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,560
Sit down!

309
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,720
Yuan Shuai,

310
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,200
I've been in love with you
for so many years.

311
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,320
Are you sure you don't feel a thing?

312
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,960
I'd rather you didn't feel it

313
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,560
than you know it

314
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
but pretend you don't.

315
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,320
But,

316
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,360
what's not good about me?

317
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,560
Is there something wrong with me
that I don't deserve you?

318
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,410
I don't want to hurt you.

319
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,760
But I'm really sorry.

320
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,320
I already have a girl I like.

321
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,970
What do you mean by that?

322
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,650
Ever since I met you,

323
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,160
you've never had a girl beside you.

324
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,560
Is it the girl from the company
who follows you around every day?

325
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,360
I have my reasons for liking her

326
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,200
It has nothing to do with her.

327
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,200
So I'm sorry.

328
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,120
I can't tell you.

329
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,440
Ok.

330
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Let me ask you one last question.

331
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,800
If the one you like doesn't like you,

332
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,320
can you

333
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,040
Consider me

334
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,600
Even if the girl I like doesn't like me,

335
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,720
I won't take a look at anyone else but her.

336
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,080
So rare!

337
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,520
The invincible man

338
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,120
is as humble as I am in love.

339
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,240
No.

340
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,000
We're not the same.

341
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,800
At least I can speak up.

342
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,560
But you

343
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,220
don't even have the courage to say it.

344
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,880
I’m leaving.

345
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,460
[West World]

346
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,520
It is snowing.

347
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,400
Xiaochuan,

348
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,160
hurry up.

349
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,520
Look!

350
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
It’s snowing.

351
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,700
It is said that
those who see the first snow together

352
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,720
will become gray-haired together.

353
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Those are the lies

354
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,360
to deceive little girls.

355
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,720
You are watching the first snow outside.

356
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,520
Of course your hair will be gray,

357
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,460
because the snow is falling on your head.

358
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,360
You're not romantic at all.

359
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,120
You just said that

360
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,560
those who see the first snow together
will become gray-haired together.

361
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,960
There's no data to back this up.

362
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,000
It's not reliable.

363
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,320
Ok. Ok.

364
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,160
Your big data is the most reliable.

365
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,920
So

366
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,850
why aren't your perfect couple

367
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,120
being together yet?

368
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,520
Why?

369
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,840
Why?

370
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,000
Hello.

371
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,130
Hello, Ms. Qiao.

372
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,720
Send me our financing proposal

373
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,380
right away.

374
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,450
Mr. Feng, how is this possible?

375
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,960
You agreed to give me a week.

376
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,120
It's only five days.

377
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,240
Now you suddenly want it.
I can't come up with it at all.

378
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:44,800
No.

379
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,280
My investors are suddenly changing
their investment ratio.

380
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,000
Anyway,

381
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,120
Give it to me by daybreak.

382
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,880
Hello?

383
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,120
Du!

384
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,500
Is dad feeling better?

385
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,520
Much better.

386
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,040
The doctor said he would be discharged

387
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,240
in a few more days.

388
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,160
I'm pretty much done
with the affairs of the company.

389
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,040
Don't worry.

390
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,160
You are here.

391
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,580
I have nothing to worry about.

392
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,680
Do you remember,

393
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,210
when you were a kid
and you didn't do well in a test,

394
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,610
you cried your eyes out.

395
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,760
And you got beaten up by dad.

396
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
And then

397
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,450
you stayed up all night comforting me.

398
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,240
The next day,
you looked exactly like a panda

399
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,360
with two dark circles under your eyes.

400
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,680
You still remember that?

401
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,680
Of course.

402
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,740
You are telling me.

403
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,090
You made me look like a ghost for a few days.

404
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,400
You look really nice

405
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,200
when you smile.

406
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,360
Du.

407
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,400
Now you are no longer a member of the Du family,

408
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,240
and we are no longer siblings.

409
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,330
Have you ever thought about

410
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,560
trying to get along with me in another way?

411
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,280
What way?

412
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,680
Can we be together?

413
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,240
Dishonest.

414
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,880
Hypocritical.

415
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,840
Playboy.

416
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,360
You led me on! Shame on you!

417
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,330
Yet you occupy half of my house,

418
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,720
half of my sofa, half of my living room,

419
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,200
half of my bedroom,

420
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,000
and half of my wardrobe. Why?

421
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,560
You are dreaming!

422
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,160
Get out of my wardrobe!

423
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,680
Get out!

424
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,520
Get out!

425
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,640
Get out!

426
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,440
What’s this?

427
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,440
Wealth.

428
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,160
Are you

429
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,440
the same Wealth from ten years ago?

430
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
So it is you.

431
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,100
[Love Is Sweet]

432
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,780
[Love and help each other;
choose the capable people; encourage all that is good]

433
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:10,320
He still has my notes

434
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,630
and love letters.

435
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,480
Crying Girl.

436
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,120
Hello.

437
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,560
I’m Brother Yuanyuan.

438
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,520
Although

439
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,190
you only called me that once,

440
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,280
I really like it when you call me that.

441
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,630
When you read this letter,

442
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,679
I will go to study abroad.

443
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,440
I don't know when I'll be back.

444
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,560
You mustn't miss me too much.

445
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,200
If you really miss me,

446
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,560
just call me.

447
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:02,240
Call me when you feel like crying.

448
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,760
And remember to call me

449
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,960
when someone bullies you.

450
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,080
Well.

451
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,040
Actually,

452
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,600
I hate to leave you.

453
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,360
Before I go,

454
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,720
I want to tell you a secret.

455
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,800
A secret that only a silly girl like you

456
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,400
can't find out.

457
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,080
I've

458
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,360
always had a crush on you.

459
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,800
When did you have someone you like?

460
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,220
If you dare not to do it,

461
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
you could tell me.

462
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,300
I can help you.

463
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,820
That’s a secret crush,

464
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,170
do you understand that?

465
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,300
It’s a nice way

466
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,700
to describe a coward.

467
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,420
I’m afraid that if I told her,

468
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,540
we wouldn’t be friends anymore.

469
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,740
[Yuan Shuai]

470
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:54,900
What are you doing

471
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,020
out here in the cold?

472
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,670
I am looking for you.

473
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,940
I'm sorry.

474
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,540
I was late.

475
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:09,900
I…

476
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,820
I…

477
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,420
Jiang Jun,

478
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,230
I don't want to wait any longer.

479
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,860
Yuan Shuai, I want to cry.

480
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,420
I love you.

481
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,520
In fact,

482
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,380
the two of us could be

483
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,060
in any kind of relationship.

484
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,940
But not this one.

485
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,020
I have someone I like.

486
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,620
Love Is Sweet
