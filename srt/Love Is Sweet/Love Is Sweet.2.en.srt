You’ve received the files I sent you, right?

194
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,090
It can only be rented to one person.

195
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Yuan Shuai.

196
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,060
Your clothes. Washed.

197
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,240
They're clean.

198
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,800
To be prudent is a basic requirement

199
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,840
in our industry.

200
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,240
What’s wrong with your face?

201
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,600
You know it.

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:38,840
Wait.

203
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,680
We need to talk.

204
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,820
[Shimao Technology terminated the acquisition
of Yangsheng Power]

205
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,560
You see this?

206
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,240
The acquisition was terminated.

207
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,080
I was the only one who got the answer that day.

208
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,280
Why did you reject me?

209
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,880
I knew you’d talk with me about it.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,530
What do you mean?

211
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
You did answer it correctly,

212
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,890
but that’s only temporary.

213
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
The termination of the acquisition

214
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,060
made people think Ma Yuke did that

215
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,800
to buy on margin and boost share price.

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,840
But,

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,200
actually not.

218
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,760
He did that

219
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,680
just to get one more seat on the board,

220
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,320
plus the right to express
leadership’s decisions.

221
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
Got it?

222
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,090
You must keep this in your mind.

223
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,000
You don’t have to trust yourself,

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,240
but you must trust me.

225
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,280
You

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,360
don’t fit MH.

227
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,250
Impossible.

228
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,680
You’re so confident?

229
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,280
Alright.

230
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
I’ll give you another test.

231
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,280
If you can pass it,

232
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,880
you’ll get into MH.

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,280
OK.

234
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Try but never buy. Are you a demon?

235
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,440
What kind of damned assessment is this!

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Excuse me.

237
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I try this on?

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Thanks.

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Indeed, you failed the test.

240
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,440
Why did you quit halfway?

241
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
You tried on seven dresses in a row

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
yet didn’t mean to buy them at all.

243
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,240
The seller got angry with you

244
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
for sure.

245
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,760
But you,

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,570
you were embarrassed as if you’d been shot

247
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,520
and ran away.

248
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
What kind of test is that?

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,080
You’re fooling me.

250
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
From this test, we can see

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,200
you’re

252
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
extremely sensitive

253
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,920
and psychologically weak.

254
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
I’ve told you that

255
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
the investment banking is like a battlefield.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,680
You.

257
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,200
You can’t.

258
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Jiang Jun.

259
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
You’re not smart,

260
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,800
but you’re kind of meticulous.

261
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,880
I think

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,930
consulting will be better for you.

263
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Actually,

264
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,280
I’ve got it done.

265
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,320
Wise Consulting,

266
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,840
one of the top three consulting firms
nationwide.

267
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,520
The position is director assistant,

268
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,160
with annual salary at least 300 grand,

269
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,220
and high possibility for promotion.

270
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,540
You don't have to thank me.

271
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,320
I won’t give up.

272
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
I will definitely get into MH.

273
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,360
I’ve said

274
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,000
you couldn’t.

275
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
When girls are sad,

276
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,480
they may cry and be fine afterwards.

277
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,360
But you,

278
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
you can’t even shed tears.

279
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,000
I hope you’ll show respect to others.

280
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,000
I hope you’ll not be so weak.

281
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,680
There’s no way can I forgive you.

282
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,360
From now on, we won’t have any contact with one another

283
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,560
and never meet again.

284
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,240
Jiang Jun.

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,360
In your heart,

286
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,200
am I always a bully?

287
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

288
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,330
I finally see your true colors.

289
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Alright.

290
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,220
Don’t be so kind in the future.

291
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
If someone bullies you,

292
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,490
just fight back.

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,940
If someone sets you up,

294
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,930
you’ll pay back double.

295
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,800
Learn to protect yourself.

296
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,680
Understand?

297
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,349
Save it.

298
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,920
I’m not as mean as you.

299
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,520
You’re not like other girls.

300
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,589
They can cry to get things done,

301
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
but you,

302
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,960
you’re even allergic to tears.

303
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,760
You're the one who makes me cry.

304
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
I don’t want to see you again.

305
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Jiang Jun. Finally, you're back.

306
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,840
I’ve got a special situation to tell you.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
My son just called me

308
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,420
and said

309
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,720
he’d get married soon.

310
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,340
Really?

311
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:17,760
Yes.

312
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
He asked me to get him an apartment.

313
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,400
You know.

314
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
I’ve expected this day

315
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,560
for so many years.

316
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
So, Jiang Jun,

317
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
I’m so sorry.

318
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,880
I’ll return you all the rent and deposit

319
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
of this apartment.

320
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,080
You won’t have to pay the utility bill this month.

321
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:38,940
What do you say?

322
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,760
But...

323
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,400
Is it so urgent?

324
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,760
Isn’t your son abroad?

325
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
He is abroad,

326
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,320
but

327
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,200
he’ll be back tomorrow.

328
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,360
You know,

329
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,520
he’ll be back with his fiancee.

330
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,880
It’s not convenient for them to live with me,

331
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,200
is it?

332
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,040
Well, Ms. Zhang,

333
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,440
do you want to raise the rent?

334
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,320
If that's the case, we can talk.

335
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,720
What are you talking about?

336
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,880
Do I look like

337
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,440
a snobby woman?

338
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,480
You don’t.

339
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,400
Alright.

340
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,800
Jiang Jun.

341
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Take an extra month’s rent

342
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,060
as the penalty.

343
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,720
Alright?

344
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
And you’ll just

345
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,840
pack up and move out

346
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,880
very soon.

347
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,520
We’ll still be good friends.

348
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Alright?

349
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,400
But, Ms. Zhang,

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,480
I have so much stuff here.

351
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,400
I don’t have enough time...

352
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,480
You can try to pack up as soon as possible.

353
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,080
That’s it.

354
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,960
-Hurry and pack up.
-But...

355
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,360
Just move out. Alright?

356
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,160
That’s it.

357
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,200
You’re beautiful.

358
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
I like you. Bye.

359
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,420
Eat it quickly.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,200
My roommate is on a diet.

361
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,660
If she hears it, she’ll...

362
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,330
You know what I mean.

363
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,400
How is it?

364
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,760
You're eating instant noodles so late.

365
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,080
I’m on a diet!

366
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Is it good?

367
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,320
It’s good.

368
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I just tried to go against the tide,

369
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,300
yet got damned right away.

370
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,400
Even my base was taken.

371
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,560
How can I fight against the enemy?

372
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Just keep fighting. Why not?

373
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,640
Jiang Jun.

374
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,840
I’m sorry that

375
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,920
you didn't see Lin Taimo.

376
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,520
So,

377
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,800
to make up for it,

378
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,240
I’ll ask my entire sisterhood

379
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,560
of 800 models for help

380
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,840
to get Lin Taimo

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,400
in front of you.

382
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,840
Thank your sisterhood then.

383
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
You'll be well rewarded.

384
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,370
Yes, my lady.

385
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,580
What are you doing?

386
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,100
Looking for an apartment.

387
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,240
Isn’t it for me?

388
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
Friends should share everything.

389
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Leave some for me.

390
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
Mr. Yuan. It’s rare that you don’t work
on weekends.

391
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
It’s almost done.

392
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,740
Are you satisfied?

393
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,600
All these are bought as you required,

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
sofa, plants

395
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,540
and the wrought-iron bed in the bedroom.

396
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,240
Is this apartment posted on Internet?

397
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,960
Yes, it is.

398
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,320
Since it’s posted on the Internet,

399
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
My cellphone hasn’t stopped ringing.

400
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,320
Certainly.

401
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,400
Take your time.

402
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,440
I gotta go to my company.

403
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,240
Mr. Yuan. Bye.

404
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:57,800
OK.

405
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,880
Thanks.

406
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,880
Let’s see if you’ll rent it.

407
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,720
Jiang Jun.

408
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,180
Tell me the requirements.

409
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,460
Five thousand.

410
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,040
Simple furniture style,

411
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,290
nothing grandiose.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
Wrought-iron bed is preferred.

413
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,680
It will be better if there is

414
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,410
a big balcony to see the view of Shanghai at night.

415
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,600
Jiang Jun.

416
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,160
That’s not much at all.

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,560
What about the location?

418
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,810
If there’s a subway,

419
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,960
it doesn’t matter if it’s a little far.

420
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
[Refined decoration,
Room No.702, Longting No.79]

421
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,000
Wrought-iron bed.

422
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
Big balcony.

423
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
Shanghai night view.

424
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
It all fits!

425
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,250
Really? Where is it?

426
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,080
Longting Community.

427
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,320
Forget it. I can’t afford it.

428
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,920
That community is nicknamed

429
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,560
Shanghai Investment Banking Backyard.

430
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,040
Most investment banking elites live there.

431
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,960
It‘ll be at least double the price .

432
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,690
Did you forget to sort by price?

433
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,280
So cheap?

434
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,280
Is it false advertising?

435
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,200
True or not,

436
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,400
let’s ask them.

437
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,360
Hello. Can I help you?

438
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,280
Hello. I’d like to ask you,

439
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,010
do you have an apartment to rent

440
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,610
in Longting Community?

441
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,560
Yes.

442
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,800
I’d like to ask,

443
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,440
is it really 7,000 yuan a month?

444
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,480
Exactly.

445
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,360
Well, can we see the apartment tomorrow morning?

446
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,240
May I have your name?

447
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,410
My surname is Xu.

448
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Miss Xu. I’m sorry but

449
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,600
the apartment is already rented out.

450
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,240
My surname is Xu,

451
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,200
but I’m inquiring about it for my friend.

452
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,080
Her surname is Jiang.

453
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:54,480
Jiang?

454
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,370
Did you say someone has rented the apartment?

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,760
No, not yet.

456
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,800
That apartment is still available.

457
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,440
Does your friend’s phone number end with 3097?

458
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,040
Yes, yes.

459
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,320
It’s exactly this number.

460
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,680
Shall we go to see the apartment

461
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,600
at 1 pm?

462
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,920
OK. Let's go this afternoon.

463
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,240
Thank you so much.

464
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,880
Be quiet!

465
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,760
Boss. A little bird said

466
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,920
Jiang Jun adopted a stray dog

467
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,880
at the playground.

468
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,480
She goes to feed it every day.

469
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Once she has affections

470
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
with these kitties and doggies

471
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,200
and they’re gone someday,

472
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,680
she’ll cry her eyes out.

473
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,680
No.

474
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,300
I have to do something.

475
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Wealth.

476
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,480
Wealth.

477
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,600
I... I’m getting you out.

478
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,520
Wealth. Don't be afraid.

479
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,840
Wealth.

480
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,640
Wealth.

481
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,880
Jiang Jun.

482
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,420
What are you doing?

483
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,000
What’s wrong?

484
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
It seems stuck in there.

485
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,100
Don’t move. Let me.

486
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,260
Come on.

487
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,480
Wealth.

488
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,320
Here.

489
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,060
Slowly.

490
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,040
Fine.

491
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,120
Come out.

492
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,440
Go.

493
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,120
Here.

494
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,360
It’s fine.

495
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,780
-Wealth.
-Wealth.

496
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,920
It's fine now.

497
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,060
Poor little thing.

498
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:43,920
Wealth.

499
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,410
Your hand...

500
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
You’re so clumsy.

501
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,640
How come you are here?

502
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,280
I heard you adopted a dog,

503
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,800
so I brought you a kennel.

504
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,410
You’re ridiculous.

505
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,640
People are everywhere here.

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,100
And there’s always a pool.

507
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,240
Why didn’t you

508
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,090
get a good place to keep the dog?

509
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,200
Here.

510
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,900
Be careful in the future. You hear me?

511
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
I know.

512
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Come, baby.

513
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Wealth. Come.

514
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,560
You're naughty.

515
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,120
Are you happy?

516
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,280
Are you?

517
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,520
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

518
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
The tenant you designated

519
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,120
has contacted me.

520
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,560
We’re gonna

521
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,960
see the apartment at 1 pm.

522
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
Look, Wealth.

523
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,560
It’s odd.

524
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,120
It’s already 1 pm. Why hasn’t she come?

525
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,480
This apartment is particularly well-lit.

526
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,080
The geomantic layout is excellent as well.

527
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,600
If you rent this apartment,

528
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
your business will surely be great.

529
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Who is that?

530
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,720
Are you satisfied with this apartment?

531
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Jiang Jun. Obviously,

532
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,360
the layout is exactly what you want.

533
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,760
And the sofa,

534
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,560
it’s exactly the style you love.

535
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,040
It’s the first time that this apartment
is rented,

536
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
so all the furniture is brand new.

537
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,290
The lighting is superb as well.

538
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,120
Honestly,

539
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,200
this apartment is beyond my expectation.

540
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
And its rent is two or three thousand cheaper

541
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,240
than the surrounding ones.

542
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,840
Is there any special reason?

543
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,200
Is it haunted or something?

544
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,120
Haunted?

545
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,840
No way.

546
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,880
Let me tell you.

547
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,000
Since this apartment is posted on Internet,

548
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,720
clients have been inquiring about it.

549
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
The landlord doesn’t care about money.

550
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,160
The hygiene is his concern.

551
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,000
You perfectly match

552
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,320
his requirements.

553
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,880
So I brought you here to see the apartment.

554
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,460
What do you say?

555
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,480
Rent it.

556
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,160
Didn’t you say it’s Investment Banking Backyard?

557
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,020
Think about it.

558
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,480
In case that you could join MH

559
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,320
as you move in.

560
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,400
Ms. Jiang. If you sincerely want to rent it,

561
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,880
you can sign the contract today

562
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,200
and move in.

563
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,200
Well, I’d rather...

564
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,640
Jiang Jun. I’ve found out that

565
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
Lin Taimo has been recuperating.

566
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,880
But

567
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,500
he goes to Huiwang Library

568
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,920
once a month.

569
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,040
And it is exactly today.

570
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,080
Seriously?

571
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,040
I’m going there now.

572
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,960

I passed the interview

628
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,040
but still got rejected.

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,400
For me, MH is a company

Take this bookstore for example.

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,840
Should we invest in it?

the owner of this bookstore is

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,280
tried to harass my model.

765
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,100
I gallantly poured two cups of coffee on him,

766
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,120
and then

767
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,500
got honorably complained by him.

768
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,520
That’s more like you.

769
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,280
It's fine.

770
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,160
From tomorrow on,

771
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,490
I’ll help you find a job.

772
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
No need.

773
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,440
I

774
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,120
have figured it out

775
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,340
by eating a packet of cookies.

776
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,160
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

777
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,320
I'm not like you.

778
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,160
Over these two years,

779
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,760
being an office lady has been driving me crazy.

780
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,680
You know.

781
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,880
My dream is to write novels,

782
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,160
depicting the perfect hero

783
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,840
in my mind.

784
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,800
He must have a high IQ above 250,

785
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,560
with fair skin,

786
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,480
big eyes,

787
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,240
long bangs,

788
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,240
better with dimples.

789
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,480
No. I’m shocked.

790
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,800
I’m in a mess.

791
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,920
I’ve found my dream guy.

792
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,120
I’ve sent you the door code.

793
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,160
I gotta go. Bye.

794
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,080
Excuse me, Miss.

795
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,400
Does that boy

796
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,720
come here often?

797
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:32,480
Yeah.

798
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,660
He often comes here for the Internet.

799
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,560
Thanks.

800
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,380
[Three clerks wanted in the store ]

801
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,960
Amazing.

802
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,120
What a lucky day.

803
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,650
Without that big devil,

804
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,060
everything goes well.

805
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,120
You... You... How do you know that I’m here?

806
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,800
Miss Jiang. You think too much.

807
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,320
I heard that I got a new neighbor

808
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,680
and came to say hello.

809
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,640
How come it’s you?

810
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,290
What a coincidence.

811
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,800
I wondered

812
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,360
why the rent of this apartment was so cheap.

813
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,850
Turned out there’s an evil neighbor here.

814
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,400
You’re lucky you failed the interview.

815
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,520
Or you’d have to

816
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,120
live here with me every day.

817
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,360
I’m afraid you’ll fall for me.

818
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,320
You're really paranoid.

819
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,560
Not hitting you

820
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,240
is already a mercy.

821
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,200
What?

822
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,220
Aren’t you going to invite your new neighbor in?

823
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:30,880
It’s late.

824
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,520
You better go home and go to sleep.

825
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,120
Or else, you’ll get old fast.

826
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,000
Your taste

827
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,380
will get worse as well.

828
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,220
Good night.

829
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,680
Excuse me.

830
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,080
Can I move out now?

831
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,120
Never mind.

832
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,540
There’s a long time ahead.

833
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,920
Let’s go home.

834
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,160
Do it! Do it!

835
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:49,600
Jiang Jun.

836
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,130
Close your eyes. Take deep breath.

837
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,040
Inhale.

838
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,000
Exhale.

839
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,400
Don't cry.

840
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,440
Don’t cry.

841
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,240
Inhale.

842
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,040
Exhale.

843
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,160
Inhale.

844
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:00,960
Exhale.

845
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,480
Jiang Jun told me that

846
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,400
you asked others to bully her

847
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,000
to make money from me. Right?

848
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,520
Sir. Do you know philosophy?

849
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,610
Philosophy?

850
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,080
A thing or two.

851
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,760
What?

852
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:18,480
The fundamental cause of a thing
is not external but internal.

853
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,000
Right?

854
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:21,120
Yes.

855
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,720
To prevent her from crying,

856
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,280
the fundamental way

857
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,570
is to strengthen her mental capacity.

858
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:28,960
When she gets tough,

859
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,920
she won’t cry anymore.

860
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,120
I did ask others to bully her.

861
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,400
The purpose is not

862
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,120
to make her cry,

863
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,200
but to strengthen her mental capacity.

864
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,800
I’m making things hard for her

865
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,080
so as to make her stronger.

866
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,680
I’m doing so

867
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,640
to make

868
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,400
every penny you paid me

869
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,960
worth it.

870
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,730
What you’re doing is right.

871
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,040
I misunderstood you.

872
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:02,920
Uncle

873
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,040
You haven’t paid me

874
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,400
last month’s salary.

875
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,160
You rascal.

876
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Thank you, uncle.

877
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:49,020
Love is Sweet
