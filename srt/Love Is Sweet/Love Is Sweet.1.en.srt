00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,960
Give me your spare button.

7
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,240
What do you want this for?

8
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
The Maya people have a saying

9
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,130
that if you wanna go back to a place,

10
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,320
bury a button there.

11
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,480
Does it work?

12
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,560
Of course.

13
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,210
The Maya people will bless you. Good Luck.

14
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,720
Thank you.

15
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,159
The button thing you told him,

16
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,000
was it true?

17
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,520
I lied

18
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
to encourage him.

19
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,480
Hello.

20
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,320
I’m Shen Xin.
I was after you in the last interview.

21
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm Jiang Jun.

22
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,720
In the recruitment season every year,

23
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,120
MH will get tens of thousands of resumes.

24
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,100
You’ve entered the fourth round,

25
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,060
which means you’ve surpassed

26
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,520
ninety-nine percent of your competitors.

27
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,880
But

28
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
this isn’t the end.

29
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,360
I have a question for you.

30
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
If you join MH in the future,

31
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,090
what kind of person will you be?

32
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,170
Soros once said that

33
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,840
the financial world was volatile and chaotic.

34
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,200
If we regard the financial market

35
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,560
as part

36
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
of a mathematical formula,

37
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
it won’t work.

38
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
Thus,

39
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,320
math cannot control the financial market.

40
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Psychology is

41
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,240
the key to market control.

42
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,080
Time's up. Next.

43
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,400
Well... Sorry.

44
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
I... I haven’t finished.

45
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,480
MH is the top investment banking department

46
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
among Shanghai securities dealers,

47
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,640
managing assets valuing tens of billions of Yuan.

48
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,920
Our time is too valuable for you

49
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,120
to waste.

50
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Fifteen seconds for each person. Next.

51
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,960
The financial world is like a forest.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I wanna be a breeder-like investor,

53
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,250
whipping the strong

54
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,560
and taming the weak.

55
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
Success is defined as defeating your opponents.

56
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,480
To succeed,

57
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,920
you should find others’ loopholes.

58
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,720
Find the loopholes and attack them,

59
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,180
like Sherlock Holmes did.

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
That’s why I want to

61
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,840
be an investor like Sherlock Holmes.

62
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,000
The workplace should be filled
with peace and respect,

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,260
but not slaughtering.

64
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,240
I wanna be the Mo-tse of MH.

65
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Love without wars. Respect talents and seniors.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,330
For the interest of all.

67
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
To be MH’s Mo-tse?

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,920
What a great mind.

69
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,920
Investment banking is a playground
for aspirants,

70
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,680
for Su Qin and Zhang Yi, not Mo-tse.

71
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,320
Be careful.

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
I

73
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,410
don't like guys without ambition.

74
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,360
You don’t look like an elite.

75
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,320
But

76
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,640
you're the first one to benefit

77
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,970
from MH’s diverse recruitment policies.

78
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,580
Congratulations.

79
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,140
You can attend the interview at 2 p.m.

80
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,000
By the way,

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,170
don't be happy too early

82
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,600
The interviewer in the afternoon will be

83
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,680
the invincible God of War of MH.

84
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,120
He

85
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,360
will be much stricter than me.

86
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,480
Currently,

87
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,320
600 million yuan of the 800 million yuan

88
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,600

through bond issuance

89
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,120
has been spent.

90
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,810
If they buy 2% more of stake,

91
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,400
they’ll have

92
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,280
absolute control over VTV.

93
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
It’s time to act, isn’t it?

94
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
Be quiet. Just wait.

95
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,960
Hey, boss. Still waiting?

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
You are noisy.

97

Mr. Du, with two more points,

98
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,440
we’ll be able to help Hualun Culture hold VTV

99
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,120
and complete the acquisition.

100
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,280

Mr. Du. Bad news.

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
VTV suddenly suspended trading

112
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,440
and announced follow-on offering.

113

114
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,920
are diluted.

115
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,360
How could it be?

00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,720
VTV’s CEO just resigned.

117

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,040

There must be another way out.

Don't bother.

122
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,760

Not only GE was led by the nose,

but also the whole industry was cheated by you.

134

Using strategies is the best.

Using social connections is mediocre.

Attacking the opponent

178
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,010
to draw his attention for sure.

179
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520

I’m sure you’ll get his attention.

What a wild trick.

244
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,160

Yangsheng Power’s stock price is

246
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
35 Hong Kong dollars now.

After the merger,

252

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,600

Ma Yuke is crafty.

He won’t be optimistic about Yangsheng Power.

264
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
If he isn’t optimistic about Yangsheng Power,

265
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,440
why would he acquire it for Shimao Technology?

266

270

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,680
You have my word.

380
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,240
Thank you, sir.

381
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,320
But, will you pay me 10 yuan

382
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,160
every month in the future?

383
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
Of course.

384
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
Rest assured, sir.

385
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,000
You can count on me.

386
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,840
Every penny you pay me

387
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,920
will be worthy.

388
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,680
Deal.

389
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,200
Deal.

390
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
What did you say?

391
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,460
The interviewer today was the boy

392
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,440
who lived opposite your home

393
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,200
and was bribed by your father to protect you?

394
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
I can recognize him even if he turns into ashes.

395
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,000
Seriously?

396
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,410
How could your childhood guardian

397
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,200
reject you?

398
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,000
He wasn’t my guardian.

399
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,160
He’s a thug.

400
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,840
My dad paid him for nothing.

401
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,920
To earn pocket money from my dad,

402
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,680
he asked others to bully me in the dark.

403
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
I was too timid

404
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,720
to fight back.

405
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,320
From elementary school to high school,

406
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
he’d been a nightmare to me.

407
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,130
What happened then?

408
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,000
Then he did something

409
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,880
that made me hate him forever.

410
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,160
My father transferred me to another school then.

411
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,720
If that’s the case,

412
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,720
he’s supposed to feel guilty to you.

413
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
Why did he drive you out of MH?

414
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,080
Babe.

415
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Will a hungry wolf feel sorry

416
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,330
for a sheep in his belly?

417
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,600
It’s OK if I’m rejected for incompetence.

418
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,480
I swear there was no problem with my interview.

419
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,800
I could absolutely pass it.

420
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,930
He did it on purpose.

421
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,000
I won’t let it go.

422
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,680
Who is it?

423
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,880
No idea.

424
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,820
[Hello I’m YS]

You are?

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,660
Yuan Shuai.

429
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,840
I am Yuan Shuai.

430
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
Is he nuts? He added me on WeChat!

431
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,850
Today I rejected you for your own good.

432
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
A smart guy

433
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,580
should do things properly in a proper position.

434
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,800
You’re lucky.

435
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
A company needs a director assistant,

436
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,880
with annual salary at least 300,000 yuan,

437
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,240
and huge chance for promotion.

438
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,720
I can recommend you there.

[You’re not her friend yet.

440

Revenge is a dish best served cold.

441
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,600
I will get into MH in an upright way.

442
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,680
I’ll let him know

443
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,740
he can never determine others’ fate.

444
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,680
Exactly.

445
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,800
Where there's oppression, there's resistance.

446
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,200
Jiang Jun. I support you.

447
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
Cheers.

448
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
But we’re nobody.

449
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
How should we resist?

450
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,040
My connection is no joke.

451
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,600
I asked our top model’s

452
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,280
sister’s pursuer’s fellow’s

453
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,080
classmate’s brother’s neighbor for help.

454
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,640
The Mr. Wang got us the tickets to BUI.

455
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,280
I also heard that

456
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,520
the one who has been recuperating,

457
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,400
namely Vice President of MH,

458
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,880
manager of the Investment Banking Department,

459
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Lin Taimo,

460
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,050
would also be there.

461
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,880
He’d be there, too!

462
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,920
You admire him most, don't you?

463
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,220
Think about it.

464
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,360
In case that you meet him

465
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,240
and tell him about the internal unfair business,

466
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,960
then...

467
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,080
Then what?

468
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,400
Make a scene

469
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,990
and complain that I was bullied by Yuan Shuai?

470
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,480
Uh-huh.

471
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,560
No way.

472
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,480
Many people are rejected every year.

473
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,800
Even if I meet Lin Taimo,

474
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
he cannot remember me. What to say?

475
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,280
Trust me.

476
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,560
Just

477
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,440
get dressed up for the party.

Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

484

You lost to Mr. Yuan of MH again.

485
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,820
Do you have any story to share with us?

486
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,320
Sorry, everyone.

487
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,480
We’re just here for the party.

488
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,050
Follow GE’s official media for more news,

489
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,480
as well as press conference.

490
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,560
Ms. Ling. You had worked for MH

491
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,240
before you joined GE.

492
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,120
Does this loss mean

493
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,400
there’s still disparity between the strength

494
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
of two companies?

495
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,880
Investment banking is a battlefield.

496
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
It’s common to win some or lose some.

497
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,480
We’ve been keeping a friendly partnership

498
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,800
with MH.

499
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,480
We’re rivals but also friends.

500
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,960
A business case won’t affect

501
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,820
the goal of win-win cooperation.

502
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,320
Mr. Du. Because of you,

503
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,160
Hualun Culture lost nearly one billion yuan.

504
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,280
Shouldn’t you be responsible

505
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,640
for such a failure?

506
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,320
One billion?

507
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,640
Do you have any basis to say that?

508
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,280
We didn’t get the controlling interest,

509
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,360
but we still hold VTV’s stocks.

510
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,120
Excuse me.

511
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,050
Ms. Ling, could you say something?

512
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,600
Sorry.

513
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,840
Never mind.

514
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,640
Mr. Fan.

515
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,880
MH beat the rival GE again.

516
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,640
Do you have anything to say?

517
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,200
MH never meant to beat anyone.

518
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,330
Our principle is

519
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,080
to benefit our clients the most,

520
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,840
preventing the market and companies

521
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,640
suffering from unscrupulous capitals.

522
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,360
Mr. Yuan.

523
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,560
This morning VTV abruptly suspended trading
for follow-on offering,

524
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,120
-defeating Hualun’s malicious acquisition.
-The big devil.

525
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
It’s said that you were behind all this.

526
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,560
Do you have anything to say about that?

527
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,440
Keep going

528
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,570
in a low profile.

529
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,540
I heard that it’s Director Du Lei of GE

530
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,800
who helped Hualun with the acquisition.

531
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,520
He's been your old rival.

532
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
This time you defeated him again.

533
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,120
Do you have anything to say to him?

534
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,120
He may work harder.

535
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,160
Sure.

536
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,720
Mr. Fan. What's the new plan for MH this year?

537
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,320
Could you tell us something about it?

538
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,080
-We have a huge acquisition plan.
-I won.

539
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,410
It’s still in progress.

540
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,800
If there’s any news,

541
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,240
we’ll tell you as soon as possible.

542
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Alright?

543
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,840
Just ignore him.

544
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,880
You’ll win back.

545
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,520
Got it.

546
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,880
The business goes well this year.

547
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
The company is also doing very well.

548
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,240
So I hope we can keep up the good work

549
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,080
and do better.

550
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,200
Buddy.

551
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,240
Is that Yuan Shuai?

552
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,250
Compared with this year...

553
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,880
Excuse me.

554
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,760
Sure.

555
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,280
Yeah. What are you gonna do?

556
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,640
Thanks.

557
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,060
Yuan Shuai. Why didn’t you reply my message?

558
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,250
Is she crazy?

559
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,000
Who are you?

560
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,260
You don’t love me anymore, do you?

561
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,840
Hey.

562
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,640
Do I know you?

563
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,920
What the hell are you talking about?

564
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,040
You said you didn’t know me?

565
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Did you hear that?

566
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,140
He’s pretending that he doesn't know me.

567
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,480
You're pretending you don't know me.

568
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,960
Back then you called me your sweetheart,

569
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,080
your baby.

570
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,840
Now you say you don't know me?

571
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,080
Is it true?

572
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,440
I've never heard

573
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,460
that Yuan Shuai had a girlfriend.

574
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
You bastard.

575
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,730
You scumbag abandoning your wife and kid!

576
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,120

577
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,000
You mean I’m your boyfriend, right?

578
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,080
OK.

579
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,520
Let me ask you.

580
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,670
Where do I live?

581
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,800
When is my birthday?

582
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,480
What's my phone number?

583
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,670
Do you know?

584
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,360
Alright.

585
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,120
Since we’re talking about girlfriend,

586
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:25,920
my girlfriend

587
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,230
happens to be here today.

00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,080
Here?

589

Who's his girlfriend?

00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,190
-Who?
-Who?

591
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,800

-Who?
-Who?

593
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,639
My girlfriend is right here.

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,200
His girlfriend?

595
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,760

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,850
Don’t run! Stop!

597
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,560
What a bad day!

598
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,560
Why did you fool me over and over?

599
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,000
I didn’t meet Lin Taimo,

600
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,080
yet left in such a disgrace.

601
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,520
Is this man a demon?

602
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,530
Are you talking about me, Crying Girl?

603
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,570
How did you know I would be here?

604
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,160
You used to go to high places

605
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,840
whenever you were upset.

606
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,610
It’s been so many years.

607
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,380
You’re still so predictable.

608
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,400
Yeah.

609
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,840
You can see through the mind.

610
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,160
Take a guess then.

611
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,620
What do I want to do now?

612
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,240
You got a terrible actress,

613
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,800
yet she’s your friend.

614
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,840
I humiliated her in public.

615
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,480
Now you must want to yell at me,

616
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,000
but you don’t know how to put it.

617
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,080
It’s OK.

618
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,980
Just yell at me if you want.

619
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,920
Congratulations, but you’re wrong.

620
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,980
You’re not worthy of my anger.

621
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:43,840
Say it.

622
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,200
Why did you drive me out of MH?

623
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,040
Watch your language.

624
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,440
You’ve never been inside MH.

625
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,040
My interview result was definitely

626
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,880
good enough to get me hired.

627
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:57,800
And as I know,

in the last five years,

629
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,600
MH hasn’t rejected any interviewee

630
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,960
in the final interview.

631
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,900
Congratulations, Ms. Jiang.

632
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,000
You set a precedent.

633
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,080
Isn’t it an honor?

634
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,960
Look closely,

635
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,680
you’re such a bastard.

636
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,240
Look more closely then.

637
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,530
Could a bastard be so handsome?

638
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,480
I’ll definitely get into MH.

639
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,200
You will definitely not.

640
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,320
Yuan Shuai. Even a sheep will bite.

641
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,640
Bite me then.

642
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,640
Do it.

643
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,600
Bite me.

644
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,800
Bite here.

645
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,440
I didn’t let you into MH

646
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,960
for your own good.

647
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,800
Take it as a lesson.

648
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,300
It’s not a loss.

649
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,600
For my own good? A lesson?

650
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,960
So far, the most terrible lesson in my life

651
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,680
is to trust you.

652
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,360
My father asked you to protect me.

653
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,160
But you,

654
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,490
you tried all means to bully me.

655
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,640
If not for you,

656
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,400
I wouldn’t have transferred to another school.

Yeah. Get down if you can’t.

to stay at Qingcheng High School.

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,480
these weak and cute animals.

757
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,600
I suggest that

758
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,640
you can start with your hobby

759
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,840
and draw some aggressive animals

760
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,170
to improve yourself

761
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
Jiang Jun. You hear me?

762
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,360
A wolf?

763
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,900
Love Is Sweet
