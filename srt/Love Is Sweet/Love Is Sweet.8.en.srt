00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

3
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 8

5
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,680
When you were little, you were even

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,640
confused about the speech topic.

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,360
How dare you bring it up again?

8
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,720
I am sorry.

9
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,080
I forgot to knock on the door.

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,480
Mr. Yuan.

11
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,080
Ms. Qiao, I'll go first.

12
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,320
Hello.

13
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,520
Happy birthday!

14
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,079
Thank you.

15
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,240
Happy birthday, Mr. Du!

16
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Thank you.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Du, a toast to our cooperation.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
Thank you.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,880
Here, to Mr. Du!

20
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,880
Dad.

21
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
I wish you good health

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,320
and happy birthday!

23
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,520
All right, thank you.

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,960
Dad,

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,130
happy birthday!

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
I thought you were not coming.

27
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,780
It seems your sister was thoughtful.

28
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,760
No, dad.

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
He is very busy lately.

30
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
Did I ask you?

31
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Don’t come over if you’re busy.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,770
Why did you force yourself,

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,370
if you don’t really mean it?

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,400
Hypocrite.

35
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
But since you are here,

36
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,840
remember, it’s my birthday dinner.

37
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,240
You may leave now,

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,440
if you put on that poker face.

39
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Got it.

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,240
Please take care.

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,040
I am sorry.

42
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,120
No problem.

43
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Mr. Du.

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,760
Is that your daughter?

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
What a beautiful girl!

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,920
Why don’t you introduce her to us?

47
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,760
Linda.

48
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,720
Come here.

49
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,080
Come on.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,660
Let me introduce you to

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,200
Mr. and Mrs. Zhai.

52
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,840
Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,800
This is their son.

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,360
Nice to meet you.

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,820
This is my daughter Linda.

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,269
Linda is so beautiful.

57
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,000
She looks the same age as my son

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,680
Linda.

59
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:21,440
Linda.

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,520
Linda!

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,680
Mrs. Zhai is talking with you.

62
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,260
I thought you had left.

63
00:04:46,159 --> 00:04:47,760
If I had left like this today,

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,360
would you spare me the next time?

65
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,520
Next year,

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,130
it will not be just a birthday gift.

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,290
I may need to give a talent show before I leave.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,120
You are making a joke.

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,560
So it means it’s not too bad.

70
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
I know you didn’t want to come at all.

71
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,480
But dad treats you like his own son.

72
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,330
Please be more understanding.

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
His own son?

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,320
Is that so?

75
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
I’m just a substitute.

76
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,930
I’ve never treated you like a substitute.

77
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
In my heart,

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,820
you are who you are.

79
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,080
Really?

80
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
25 minutes.

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,120
A new record!

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,080
Congratulations, Mr. Wan!

83
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,320
Thank you.

84
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,520
In the future, I may need some help of you two,

85
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,120
all right?

86
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,480
Let’s scratch each other’s back.

87
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,520
Sure.

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,080
Mr. Wan.

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,760
Congratulations, your dream has come true!

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,040
The new CEO of Wanxing!

91
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,960
Excuse me,

92
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,159
let’s catch up next time.

93
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,640
OK.

94
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,720
I’d like to introduce myself.

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
I am Du Lei, Executive Director of

96
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,930
Investment Banking Department at GE.

97
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,780
Like father, like son.

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,920
Thank you.

99
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
I just took the office at a critical time

100
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,840
thanks to the trust of the company.

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,360
I’m just doing my job,

102
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,640
so it’s not my dream has come true.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,400
I picked the wrong words.

104
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,200
After the talent show, Wanxing’s

105
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,540
estimated assets are at the peak now.

106
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,240
And your taking the office

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,440
is a very good news for

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,880
the IPO.

109
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,120
Mr. Du is such a veteran banker.

110
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,730
You’re very sensitive.

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,440
But unfortunately,

112
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,160
when the late Chairman was alive,

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,360
MH has been our trusted partner.

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,760
So….

115
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,330
I think you misunderstood…

116
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,940
I’m not here for business.

117
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
I just want to remind you that

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,400
I know Yuan Shuai well.

119
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
He can’t be fooled easily.

120
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
You are not talking about cooperation,

121
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,440
but giving me some tips.

122
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,960
Then I have to say,

123
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,090
thanks, but no need.

124
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,640
Mr. Wan,

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,440
I believe you will come to me soon.

126
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,420
[FamilyMart]

127
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,400
Li,

128
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,760
give me a cup of coffee.

129
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,570
Skip the coffee.

130
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,760
Take this, here.

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
How do you like my new slippers?

132
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
A gift from my Prince Charming.

133
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,800
Nice.

134
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,760
Good for work, leisure,

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,320
beach and shower.

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Jiang Jun,

137
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,800
what’s wrong?

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,440
Is it karma when it comes to Yuan Shuai?

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,720
Did I owe him in my last life?

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,240
Again!

141
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,920
Did he bully you again?

142
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,740
Let me help you out!

143
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

144
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,240
It’s just some misunderstanding

145
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,800
in the office today.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We were studying on a case

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,600
when Ms. Qiao broke in.

148
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,280
At that time,

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,360
our postures were

150
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,360
a little awkward.

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,080
Jiang Jun.

152
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,160
What?

153
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,120
You may have triggered a love triangle.

154
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,940
The typical plot in chick-lit

155
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,280
urban office fiction.

156
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,640
What’s that?

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is she stunning

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,320
and bossy?

159
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,300
Does she often go to Yuan Shuai’s office,

160
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,380
and never knock on the door

161
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,520
when she enters?

162
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,770
So, what’s the conclusion?

163
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,850
There is only one truth.

164
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
You are doomed.

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,410
You may have become a thorn in her side.

166
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,040
So out-dated?

167
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,760
So,

168
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,240
what will be the next?

169
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Give me some clues to get out of this.

170
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,560
Next, she’s going to pull her rank on you,

171
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
and

172
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,960
keep an eye on you

173
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,880
until she gets a hold over you.

174
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,840
Then strike out at you

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,360
with full force.

176
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,120
Good morning.

177
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,650
Morning.

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,810
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

179
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,680
The difference between a soldier and a bandit

180
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,640
is a sense of ritual.

181
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,080
It means a sense of ritual is important.

182
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,800
It is necessary for working here, too.

183
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,640
Stop showing up in the office in these

184
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,060
tacky IT girl clothes.

185
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,560
IT girl…

186
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,560
Next, she’s going to pull her rank on you

187
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
and

188
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,200
keep an eye on you

189
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
until she gets a hold over you.

190
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,560
Then

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,140
strike out at you with full force.

192
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,480
It can’t be so dramatic.

193
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,450
I’ve read your reports.

194

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,240
Tomorrow it could be

384
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,480
sent to Mr. Fan.

385
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,840
How do you explain it

386
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,560
to his face

387
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,800
by then?

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
None of my business.

393
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
You may leave now.

394
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,410
Why aren’t you leaving?

395
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,010
I’ve got something for you.

396
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,120
What else to upset me?

You’re laughing, Yuan Shuai.

Stop being mad at me.

I know you care about me,

401
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
but why can’t you be nicer?

402
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,520
Why so serious?

403
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,360
Seriously.

404
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,960
So now you intend to call your boss

405
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,720
by his name in the office?

406
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,290
I’m sorry, Mr. Yuan.

407
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,360
Get out now.

408
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,200
All right.

409
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,400

I think there was a fit of laughter

416
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,320
just now.

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,890
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

Shen Xin,

419
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
Mr. Yuan asked you to go in.

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Ms. Qiao,

421
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,520
we’re leaving now.

422
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,640
Ms. Qiao, I’m leaving, too.

Why does Wan Shan have

424
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,480
a resting room in the office.

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,120
Why did a girl come out of it at midnight?

426
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,880
The bullied girl was also acting weird.

427
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,520
She was bullied at such a big company.

428
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,280
It’s not like shooting a movie.

429
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,920
How could she live with it?

430
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,370
She did not go to the police either.

431
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
It’s like she wants to keep it quiet.

432
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,820
There must be something going on.

433
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,120

I came here to look for it.

455

I’m fine.

Honestly,

519
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,200
since I helped you out last time,

520
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,940
I’ve felt there’s obviously something odd.

521
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,200
Why was everyone

522
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,330
quiet about the bully against you?

523
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,480
Then I found

524
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,360
someone with a senior position

525
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,690
is working against you.

526
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,260
And considering your status quo,

527
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,760
I guess this senior officer

528
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,140
is Wan Shan, right?

529
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,800

530
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,960
stop holding it back.

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,360
If you keep silent now,

532
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,280
then I can’t help you with anything.

533
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,340
But what’s the use of speaking it out.

534
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
I can’t take him down.

535

How do you know if you haven’t tried?

536
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,160
If you keep it quiet,

537
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,000
it may happen to you again.

other people, too.

540
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,920
What I can assure you is

541
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,320
if it’s proved his wrongdoing

542
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,360
may affect Wanxing’s IPO,

543
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,760
other shareholders will surely

544
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
force him to step down.

545

Not long ago,

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,360
I attended the contest of “Come on, sisters”,

547
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,360
I was eliminated.

548
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,440
But right before the repechage,

549
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,400
Wan Shan came to me.

550
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I watched your performance.

551
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,810
It’s a good show,

552
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,690
but lacks popularity among the audience.

553
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,360
So the company decided

554
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,250
to give you another chance.

555
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,400

As long as you sign on this contract,

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,640
you have my word.

561
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,160
I will ask the program crew

562
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,240
to bring you back in the repechage.

563
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,800
Then you can be part of the idol group

00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,980
My little Tang Xin,

572
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,760
do you get it?

573
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,800
But first,

574
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,320
we need to sign this contract tomorrow.

575
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,880
Besides,

576
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,720
it’s up to you if…

577
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,440
You want to be my sweetheart.

578
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
Mr. Wan!

579
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,890
-Why don’t you get it?
-Mr. Wan!

580
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,320
Tang Xin...

581
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,200
What’s wrong?

582
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,960
Water... Water...

583
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,090
Water... What’s wrong with the water?

584
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
Are you all right?

585
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,600
Tang Xin...

586
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,720
What’s wrong with the water?

587
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
Tang Xin...

588
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Tang Xin...

589
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,500
My little sweetheart!

590
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,200
When I woke up,

591
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,600
I found myself disheveled

592
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,400
at a strange place.

593
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,560
The monster Wan Shan was lying next to me.

594
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,880
I ran out when he was sleeping.

595
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,200
I found it’s a secret resting room

596
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,680
in his office.

597
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,370
The monster came to me few times later.

598
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,210
This is my evidence.

599
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,560
Tang Xin,

600
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,120
if you listened to me,

601
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,780
how could you end up like this?

602
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,600
But it’s not too late.

603
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,280
Be my sweetheart and make me happy,

604
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,840
I can still make you a pop star.

605
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,120
How could he?!

606
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,520
I thought he was just

607
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,840
taking advantage of his position

608
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,170
to take bribes from you.

609
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,670
I didn’t expect him to be

610
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,760
such a monster.

611
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,560
Miss Tang,

612
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:18,320
these are out of my expectation.

613
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,480
But if you would like to believe me,

614
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,570
can you give me a copy of your evidence?

615
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,630
I’ll find a way.

616
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,190
Miss Jiang.

617
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,280
I’m desperate now.

618
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,560
You are my last hope.

619
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,710
I understand.

620
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,580
[Mr. Du]

621
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,100
Miss Jiang.

622
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,440
Mr. Du.

623
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,760
Is anyone running after you?

624
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,540
I feel like being stalked.

625
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,130
Perhaps I’m too sensitive.

626
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,720
It’s too late now.

627
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,400
Why are you wandering alone?

628
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,200
I came for work nearby.

629
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,160
My car is parked not far away.

630
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,620
How about I give you a ride?

631
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,080
OK.

632
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,040
Thank you, Mr. Du.

633
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,880
Sorry to trouble you so many times.

634
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,200
In fact, you can keep calling me teacher.

635
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,880
I can’t share your burden

636
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,600
at work.

637
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,360
But I am older

638
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,560
and I’ve experienced much more

639
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,840
than you have.

640
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,080
Talking about age, I just realized,

641
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,040
you keep in such a good shape.

642
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,570
I didn’t notice before.

643
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,320
You are much older than me.

644
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,680
I’m just used to you calling me teacher.

645
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,480
All right,

646
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,280
I’ll call you teacher.

647
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,360
By the way, teacher,

648
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,920
what are you doing here?

649
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,360
I came to visit a friend on my father’s behalf.

650
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,560
A newly-elected CEO.

651
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,360
A newly-elected CEO.

652
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,400
Wanxing Entertainment?

653
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,080
Yes.

654
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,170
Do you know Wan Shan too?

655
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,240
Not really.

656
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,800
I’m just impressed.

657
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,840
He is so good at making pop stars.

658
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,650
How long have you known each other?

659
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,850
From childhood.

660
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,740
He visited my home sometimes.

661
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,060
Can I ask something about him?

662
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,720
I just thought he is awesome.

663
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,840
And I saw him on a lot of

664
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,240
TV shows now.

665
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,360
Among all the judges,

666
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
he is the harshest one.

667
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,480
But he has the sharpest eyes.

668
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,760
Every time, the ones he picked became popular.

669
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,240
Is there any secret?

670
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Why?

671
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,840
Do you want to be a paparazzi?

672
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,040
Just curious.

673
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Which girl isn’t curious about the gossip in

674
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,040
the entertainment industry?

675
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,640
Well, the variety shows,

676
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,920
they are just for fun.

677
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,200
Don’t take them seriously.

678
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,260
The stories behind are complicated.

679
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,600
It seems like you’re really interested

680
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,920
in Wan Shan.

681
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,520
He is my father’s friend,

682
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,120
but I need to warn you.

683
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
For pretty girls,

684
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,500
it’s better to stay away from him.

685
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,600
OK.

686
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,900
No more questions.

687
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,640
Thank you, teacher.

688
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,320
See you.

689
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,400
OK.

690
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,780
One more thing,

691
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,720
don’t wander around

692
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,040
at night.

693
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,960
Call me if you need anything.

694
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,840
I’d like to be your driver.

695
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:50,720
OK.

696
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,620
Good night.

697
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,720
Good night.

698
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,400
What’s this about?

699
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,720
I’ve told you.

700
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,360
Stay away from her.

701
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,480
Then you just came to my building?

702
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,960
If you really care about her,

703
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,800
you’d better watch out.

704
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,220
[FamilyMart]

705
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,760
Why hasn’t he arrived?

706
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,720
Xiaochuan, a seat is kept for you.

707
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,800
When do you plan to come over?

708
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,120
You.

709
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,160
Not planning to collect the money?

710
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,480
I’m sorry.

711
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,680
7 yuan.

712
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,000
How about adding me on WeChat?

713
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
I can tip you, all right?

714
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,740
[No tipping, no flirting!]

715
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,450
Mr. Wan, Miss Jiang is here.

716
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,080
Miss Jiang.

717
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,420
Please have a seat.

718
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,720
Mr. Wan, what is it for

719
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,250
to invite me here today?

720
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,960
The reason I invited you here is

721
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,360
a few days ago,

722
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
I heard that a little girl, Tang Xin

723
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,520
of our company

724
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,880
talked nonsense to you.

725
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
You know,

726
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,920
some times when kids are under pressure,

727
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,000
they imagine things and talk nonsense.

728
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,760
Miss Jiang, I believe a smart person like you,

729
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,520
will not believe the nonsense of a kid.

730
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,160
Mr. Wan, I am flattered to hear that.

731
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,490
But I can’t take the money by any means.

732
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,000
Miss Jiang, this is...

733
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,840
Trust me,

734
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,440
I know what to do.

735
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,440
Need to go now.

736
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,840
It is filmed.

737
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,240
Go destroy Jiang Jun’s phone,

738
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,600
and give her a lesson.

739
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,440
Give me your phone!

740
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,780
Love Is Sweet
