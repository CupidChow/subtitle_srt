00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 13

5
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,480
Hello, Xu Li.

6
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,000
How come I’m in 702?

7
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Li!

8
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,530
Jun! You woke up!

9
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
I made congee for you.

10
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Have some!

11
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,490
Do you still feel dizzy?

12
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,240
Better.

13
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,390
Check your fridge

14
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,680
and see what else you wanna eat.

15
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,340
I see you bought a lot of stuff.

16
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,000
I didn’t buy those things.

17
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,980
You didn’t?

18
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
So Yuan Shuai

19
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
rented this apartment to you

20
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
and gave you a nanny for free?

21
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,720
The fridge is filled with food.

22
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,320
Your clothes are nicely folded.

23
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
Even the bed is your favorite color.

24
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,240
What he did is so touching!

25
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
No wonder I felt weird when I

26
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,170
came to check it out.

27
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,320
The decoration is your style.

28
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,520
So is the furniture.

29
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,040
I think Yuan Shuai

30
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
has been waiting for you to come back!

31
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,880
By the way,

32
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,560
do you know

33
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
how worried he was

34
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,040
when he called me yesterday?

35
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,020
You had a problem with him before, right?

36
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
You know,

37
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,320
in the world of novels,

38
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,360
the main character always appears
to be capricious.

39
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
A moment ago, he could be an evil villain.

40
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,960
A moment later,

41
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
he could become a handsome and capable person

42
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,280
with a tough life that breaks your heart.

43
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
I think

44
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,720
he wants you to stay for only two possibilities.

45
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,360
He either

46
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,360
plans to murder you in secret

47
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
or

48
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,580
He’s head over heels in love with you.

49
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,760
That’s all. I’ll go get some congee.

50
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,900
I want you to go back to GE with me tomorrow

51
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,090
and meet the client of the new project.

52
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
I’ll let go of the things that happened

53
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,810
when you were out of the office.

54
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,520
But tomorrow’s client

55
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,760
is our father’s friend,

56
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,020
who personally asked for your presence.

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
If you don’t come,

58
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,400
our father will know.

59
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,420
Will you stop messing around?

60
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,050
I will find time and go back in a few days

61
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,600
to take care of some unfinished business.

62
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,760
But that’s all I can do.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,280
Du,

64
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,660
please don’t be like this!

65
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,360
I’ll say yes

66
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,780
to whatever you ask for

67
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,970
as long as you don’t leave GE

68
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,440
and me.

69
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,200
I’ve told you,

70
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
it’s a battlefield, not an examination site.

71
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,720
There are no rules

72
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,200
and invigilators.

73
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,240
When dealing with someone like Ma Xiuran,

74
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,170
you can’t let him walk all over you!

75
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,720
I know.

76
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
This place is dominated
by the law of the jungle.

77
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,420
Tolerance will only make a bully
push me harder.

78
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,970
It’s good that you know.

79
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,960
Wait.

80
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,970
Take a deep breath.

81
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,040
Go on.

82
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,800
Come in.

83
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,040
How brazen!

84
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,920
You came to see me first.

85
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,250
I asked you to have dinner with Mr. Qin.

86
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,120
But you

87
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,680
called Yuan Shuai over to make trouble.

88
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,420
You’ve got to apologize to Mr. Qin in person.

89
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Mr. Ma.

90
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,920
Given what happened yesterday,

91
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,650
I have a formal request to make.

92
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,880
Please stop assigning me

93
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,600
unfair and unreasonable tasks.

94
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,200
Otherwise, I’ll complain to Mr. Fan about you.

95
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,400
Are you threatening me?

96
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,660
I’m just negotiating.

97
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,080
According to the company’s policy,

98
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,400
being a drinking companion
of a client isn’t my job.

99
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,000
Look.

100
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,200
You can’t challenge me

101
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,120
even if someone’s got your back.

102
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,640
Everything that your supervisor

103
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,040
asks you to do is your job!

104
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Got it?

105
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:06,760
Get out!

106
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,160
When dealing with someone like Ma Xiuran,

107
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,090
you can’t let him walk all over you!

108
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,080
As my supervisor,

109
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,840
you have every rights to assign me tasks.

110
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
But as an employee of
the Investment Bank Department,

111
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,250
I also have the right to reject
unreasonable work assignments!

112
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,720
If you are not happy

113
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,040
about my behavior,

114
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,900
you can complain to the company about me!

115
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,840
Challenging my authority?

116
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,280
How dare you?!

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Ma, you look so mad!

118
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,250
Where are you going?

119
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,970
It’s none of your business!

120
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,600
It’s your idea to ask a female employee

121
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,080
to drink with Mr. Qin,

122
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,760
isn’t it?

123
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,520
You are talking about Jiang Jun, right?

124
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,170
Mr. Yuan, you are so protective of her.

125
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Are the two of you…

126
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,560
Did you get your perfume from a brine plant?

127
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,160
What a foul odor!

128
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,480
Shut your mouth if you don’t know.

129
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,340
This is a new fragrance from the famous
Milan fashion designer Armar.

130
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,320
Armar?

131
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Armar is surely a famous designer.

132
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,890
So it’s not the perfume’s problem.

133
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,460
Then what do you think the problem is?

134
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,640
Yuan Shuai,don’t go too far!

135
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,810
Last Friday,

136
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,640
Ganzheng Pharmaceuticals was delisted from
Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

137
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,770
After going through

138
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,720
two years of regulatory period,

139
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,760
several times of trading resumptions
and administrative reviews,

140
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
this cheating stock still couldn’t be saved.

141
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,420
Do you know what I mean?

142
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Yuan Shuai, are you threatening me?

143
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,520
Let me tell you.

144
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,640
It’s all Ganzheng’s Chairman’s idea.

145
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,840
I had nothing to do with it!

146
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
But you assisted him with his wrongdoings!

147
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,280
So what?

148
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,490
There’s nothing you can do anyway!

149
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,760
How beautiful!

150
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,850
Where did you get this picture?

151
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,040
Where did I get it?

152
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,160
As a man who loves to hold a grudge,

153
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,680
how could I get where I am in MH

154
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,520
if I didn’t have any special means?

155
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,730
It’s just a way to let you

156
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,200
taste your own medicine.

157
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,040
Ma Xiuran,

158
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,900
let me warn you!

159
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,120
If you use such dirty tricks

160
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
to ruin MH’s reputation again,

161
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,920
I won’t guarantee

162
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,560
this picture won’t be

163
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,890
suddenly released one day!

164
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,480
You’d better behave yourself, beauty!

165
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,330
What are you doing here?

166
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,290
Waiting for you.

167
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,780
Waiting for me?

168
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
Do you think

169
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,720
the true words will sound more sincere

170
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,800
when said outside of the office?

171
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,000
How would I know?

172
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,280
I’ll tell you after you say it.

173
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,960
It’s not something important, actually.

174
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,420
It’s about the apartment.

175
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,940
I think you were right.

176
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,480
I lied to you.

177
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,200
It’s my fault.

178
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,480
So,

179
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,560
you need to be smarter in the future.

180
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,760
Most importantly,

181
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,700
don’t trust a person like me anymore.

182
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,920
That’s all.

183
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,080
Thank you!

184
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,760
Though you lied to me,

185
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,320
on the account that you saved me,

186
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,760
I’ll forgive you.

187
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,760
But don’t lie to me again.

188
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
That’s all.

189
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,480
Got it!

190
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,640
Hello, Mr. Du.

191
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,850
Do you have time?

192
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,320
I have something for you.

193
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,560
What is it?

194
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,400
You’ll know when you come.

195
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,640
I’ll wait for you
in the fragrance blending room.

196
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,120
Okay.

197
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,280
Mr. Du.

198
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,690
You are here.

199
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,520
You sounded so mysterious on the phone.

200
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,320
What’s up?

201
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,410
Smell it.

202
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,960
It smells so nice. You blended it?

203
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
You did that the last time when you were here.

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,920
The new blend should

205
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,280
sit on the shelf for several weeks.

206
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,140
Now it’s ready.

207
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,120
I blended it? Am I that good?

208
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,060
Take a seat.

209
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,760
Juno!

210
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,210
This is my English name!

211
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,160
Really?

212
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,890
What a coincidence!

213
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,280
By the way,

214
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,620
you sent me the address last time.

215
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,520
I did go there,

216
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,800
but I was

217
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,360
late.

218
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,760
It’s okay.

219
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,720
Last time…

220
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Never mind. As long as you were safe.

221
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,600
If the same thing happens again,

222
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,200
you’ve got to tell me right away.

223
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,640
Okay?

224
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,600
It won’t happen again.

225
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
I was such a pushover before,

226
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
so that kinda thing would happen to me.

227
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,050
I won’t let it happen again.

228
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
Looks like my disciple

229
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,460
is fully-fledged now.

230
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,120
So that I can share your burden!

231
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,829
By the way, Teacher Du.

232
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,690
how have you been doing recently?

233
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,240
I’ve been

234
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,180
doing well.

235
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,300
I’m a lecturer now,

236
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:13,640
and I’m going to

237
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
do some investment.

238
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,520
If you come across a good project,

239
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,720
please do let me know.

240
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,490
No problem!

241
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,520
Thank you for the perfume!

242
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,160
You are very welcome!

243
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,410
Mr. Du, please turn right here.

244
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,320
Sorry, I almost forgot.

245
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,720
I’m going this way today.

246
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,340
You aren’t going home?

247
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,460
Actually, this is my home now.

248
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,240
You moved?

249
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,360
Good.

250
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,520
What's good?

251
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,160
By the way,

252
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,600
how did you get home last night?

253
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,480
A business dinner like that

254
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,940
wouldn’t finish so early.

255
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
Last night…

256
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,280
My boss picked me up last night.

257
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:08,780
Yuan Shuai?

258
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,680
Why did he send you to the dinner?

259
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,540
He didn’t! He was there to help me!

260
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,520
Forget it.

261
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,040
It’s a long story.

262
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,440
Anyway,

263
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,760
newbies always meet obstacles
created deliberately by others.

264
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,880
Feels like you and Yuan Shuai

265
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
have an interesting relationship.

266
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,920
Not really.

267
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
He’s actually my childhood friend.

268
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,140
We were neighbors and we’ve known
each other since kindergarten.

269
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,440
I see.

270
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,280
So you guys must be quite close.

271
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Not really.

272
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,680
He always bullied me when we were kids.

273
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,760
Years later, when we met again,

274
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
he kicked me out of MH

275
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,200
and said I was not an investment bank material.

276
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Since I entered the company,
he’s been very hard on me!

277
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,380
How would I be close to him?

278
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,600
I’m back!

279
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,840
Brother.

280
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,850
You are back!

281
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,210
Where’s Wealth?

282
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,920
I don’t see her anywhere.

283
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,580
Over there.

284
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,120
Li Xiaochuan!

285
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,850
-You…
-What?

286
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,000
Good girl!

287
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:26,800
It’s okay.

288
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
It’s okay, Wealth!

289
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,640
Daddy’s home! It’s okay!

290
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,920
Li Xiaochuan!

291
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,690
This is how you take care of Wealth?

292
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,680
I’ve set the time.

293
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Once she consumes the pre-set calories,

294
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,880
the machine will stop.

295
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,000
Don’t you think you also need to work out?

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,080
Don’t you think you should run a little?

297
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,080
I’ll set the time for you!

298
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,250
Get on it!

299
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,610
Are you kidding?

300
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,170
Get on it!

301
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,840
Why should I run? I…

302
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,400
Are you getting on it or not?

303
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,920
Okay.

304
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,640
I guess you forgot what’s

305
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,040
in my phone, right?

306
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,520
-When you were in the college, you confessed…
-Alright!

307
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,160
I’ll run!

308
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,280
Faster!

309
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,060
That’s enough!

310
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,360
You!

311
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
Look.

312
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,960
If I see Wealth’s feces

313
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,240
in this house,

314
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,280
I’ll let you know what the real pain is!

315
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,610
Don’t worry about that.

316
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,040
Xu Li told me

317
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,720
that dogs take care of business outside.

318
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
So I take some time

319
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,960
and walk her every day.

320
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,730
And you know what? While you were gone,

321
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,840
she even put on some weight.

322
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,400
About 150 g.

323
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Keep running!

324
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
Is this the new project you’ve been working on?

325
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,960
It’s a secret for now.

326
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,880
I wanna give you a surprise.

327
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,320
So mysterious!

328
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,680
It just hit me that I have something to do.

329
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,340
I’ll leave Wealth to you! Bye!

330
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,640
Weird!

331
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Jun, you are back?

332
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,080
What are you doing?

333
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,740
Don’t move.

334
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,410
Where have you been? You smell so good!

335
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,160
Mr. Du’s fragrance blending room.

336
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,220
Mr. Du has a fragrance blending room?

337
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,480
Awesome!

338
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,120
Is Mr. Du

339
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,320
the man who’s been

340
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,360
helping you secretly?

341
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,920
What are you talking about?

342
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,450
He’s my respected teacher,

343
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,960
a veteran in the investment bank.

344
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,040
Get that dirty mind out of your head!

345
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,000
What are you doing?

346
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,040
My Jun said I had a dirty mind!

347
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,600
I’ll teach you a lesson!

348
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:43,890
Tickles!

349
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,480
It tickles! Tickles!

350
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,760
I…

351
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,840
I can’t take it anymore!

352
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,370
Tickles!

353
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,680
Be quiet!

354
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,320
Your roommate looks so scary!

355
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,320
I’ve trained myself to be cool about it.

356
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,020
You just need to get used to it.

357
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,800
Perhaps my immune system isn’t strong enough.

358
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,780
I think I should move back.

359
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,720
It’s not right to stay here and disturb you.

360
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,560
You can’t!

361
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
You’ve moved out.

362
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
How can you give in so easily?

363
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,560
You’ve got to protect your dignity!

364
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,080
I…

365
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,040
Be! Quiet!

366
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,560
Don’t laugh!

367
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,560
Of two evils choose the lesser.

368
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,680
Compared with Yuan Shuai,

369
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,560
it’s harder for me to face

370
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,090
such pair of piercing eyes.

371
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,170
Alright.

372
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,720
Heroine, since you’ve made up your mind,

373
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,000
I won’t hold you back.

374
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,760
But,

375
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,740
could you please cook me some noodles
before you go?

376
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,400
Then let me think again.

377
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,560
But I’m really hungry.

378
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,200
Heroine!

379
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,400
I’m hungry, too.

380
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,530
Can the heroine’s best friend
cook some noodles for her?

381
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,380
But the heroine’s best friend is also tired!

382
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,090
Rock, scissors, paper!

383
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,360
Two out of three!

384
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,690
Rock, scissors, paper!

385
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,640
Another round!

386
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,970
Rock, scissors, paper!

387
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,540
Look at your dark circles!
Did you stay up all night?

388
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,930
I didn’t sleep well.

389
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,000
Do you have to work that hard?

390
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,440
Leave us some opportunities, okay?

391
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,200
What the heck?

392
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,800
When did I start struggling
to sleep in a strange bed?

393
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
I’ve never had a sound sleep

394
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,040
since I moved to Li’s.

395
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,760
In this huge Shanghai,

396
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,520
I can’t even find a place

397
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,000
where I can sleep well?

398
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,600
If it goes on like this, I’d have a sudden death

399
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,930
before my work kills me!

400
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
One neighbor is like a devil,

401
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,080
but the other is like a devil.

402
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,640
But apparently, the demon’s place

403
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
is nicer and comfier.

404
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,960
And the rent is reasonable.

405
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
A great man knows when to yield and when not.

406
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:26,960
Jiang Jun,

407
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,280
do not give up such a nice apartment

408
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,440
just for your ego.

409
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,810
Mr. Yuan!

410
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,720
What’s up?

411
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,240
Well…

412
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
I’m just wondering

413
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,440
if 702 is still…

414
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Still what?

415
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,400
Still…

416
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,560
It’s the latest evaluation report
of Chenxin Technology.

417
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,420
Doctor Zhu asked you to review it.

418
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Okay.

419
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,840
Are you here to work

420
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,280
or to play a zombie?

421
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,440
You look so pale.

422
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,400
And your dark circles
are even bigger than your eyes!

423
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,520
It’s fine that you scare us,

424
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,450
but what if you scared the clients?

425
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,320
Besides, look at your top.

426
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Did you buy it from Taobao?

427
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,450
It wrinkles and has such poor texture.

428
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,360
Jiang Jun,

429
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,920
aren’t you still working

430
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,160
on a prospectus?

431
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,080
Don’t just stand here!

432
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,280
Go finish it!

433
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,680
I’ll read it in my office.

434
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,810
I need to talk to you.

435
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,580
Then let’s go to my office.

436
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
The new people

437
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,880
were all so nervous during probation.

438
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,320
Now that they signed the contracts,

439
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,180
they’ve become so undisciplined

440
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,280
Ms. Qiao, you should pay more attention

441
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,700
on yourself instead of those new people.

442
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,480
Me?

443
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,640
Why?

444
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,560
Your makeup is smudged.

445
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,360
It may scare our clients.

446
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,560
It’s not!

447
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
You lied!

448
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,140
Now, here’s the thing.

449
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,400
Based on reliable information,

450
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
several big companies are interested

451
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,840
in Chenxin Technology’s system patent.

452
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,520
It’s so difficult for a tech startup

453
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,960
like Chenxin to survive in a competitive market.

454
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,200
What will you do next?

455
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
MH

456
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,120
doesn’t have to offend those big companies

457
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,720
for a small client like this.

458
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,280
There’s always a solution to a problem.

459
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,340
Since I’ve had my eye on this company,

460
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,040
I will certainly make it develop vigorously.

461
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,640
So, do you have any plan for tonight?

462
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
What will you eat?

463
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,600
Sorry.

464
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,240
I have some personal things to take care of.

465
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,640
Personal things?

466
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,160
Need any help?

467
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,520
Alright.

468
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,080
I’m leaving.

469
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:13,720
So,

470
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,340
do you wanna go eat with me?

471
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,120
No, I’m on a diet.

472
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,720
Hey, you’ve

473
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,720
posed like this for a whole day.

474
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
Aren’t you tired?

475
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
I am.

476
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,040
I think

477
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,240
you should just go in there if you wanna

478
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,040
report something.

479
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,570
it’s fine

480
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,800
I have nothing to report.

481
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,880
Please go eat.

482
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,880
Okay.

483
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I’m leaving. Bye.

484
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,920
I’m off work!

485
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,420
Are you looking for me?

486
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,560
What’s wrong?

487
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,400
-Don’t touch me! Don’t touch me!
-What is it?

488
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,200
What seems to be the problem?

489
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,060
Don’t touch me!

490
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,340
-You’ve got a cramp!
-Yes, that’s right!

491
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,090
Then why didn’t you just say it?

492
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,280
Cramp!

493
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,250
Now it’s better.

494
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,960
Better?

495
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,260
You changed your perfume?

496
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,970
Smells nice?

497
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,480
Jiang Jun,

498
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,520
you look quite strange today,

499
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,280
from top to toe!

500
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,680
What’s going on with you?

501
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,360
Hey,

502
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,920
I can hear you.

503
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,200
You don’t need to get this close to me.

504
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,560
If you have something to ask,

505
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,520
just tell me.

506
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,360
Maybe I’ll say yes.

507
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
Nothing! I’ll just work overtime today.

508
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,040
I have nothing to ask.

509
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,370
Are you sure?

510
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,920
It’s okay.

511
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,120
I feel hungry anyway.

512
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,760
I’ll go eat by myself now.

513
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,160
Mr. Yuan!

514
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,400
Good timing.

515
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,260
My stomach says it’s hungry, too.

516
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,440
I just finished my work.

517
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Why don’t we eat together? My treat!

518
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,020
Your treat?

519
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,210
Let’s go!

520
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,520
Come on!

521
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,020
The cramp is gone, huh?

522
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,600
Mr. Yuan, your rice noodles.

523
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,220
Let me help you to put the ingredients in.

524
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,520
It’s been a while since the last time I came here.
They’ve decorated.

525
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,850
I don’t know if the noodles taste the same.

526
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,840
Mr. Yuan, you like vinegar, right?

527
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,440
Have some.

528
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,760
Do you want chili?

529
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,200
Just spill it.

530
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
What did you wanna say when you
came to me this morning?

531
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,960
Nothing!

532
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,970
Weren’t you waiting for me after work?

533
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,000
No!

534
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,680
So I guess I misunderstood.

535
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,420
Then let’s eat.

536
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,160
Yum!

537
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,120
I have something to tell you.

538
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,320
The apartment in Longting Community

539
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,520
has been vacant for a long time.

540
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,960
If you don’t wanna rent it anymore,

541
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,220
I’ll find a new tenant.

542
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,520
What vacant?

543
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,800
The fridge is full of stuff!

544
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,680
What?

545
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,200
I mean

546
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,560
it’s an off season.

547
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,540
It’s not easy to find a new tenant.

548
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,440
Since you helped me,

549
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,200
and I’m not a narrow-minded person,

550
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,600
I think I can help you to solve this problem.

551
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,960
How can I

552
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,000
bother you for such an unimportant thing?

553
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,780
I can handle it myself.

554
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,740
[Su Chang] [Call me]

555
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,320
Think about it.

556
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,720
With its nice location,

557
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:34,800
and the low

558
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,840
price,

559
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,740
it’s actually in high demand.

560
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,280
Hello, Miss Liu.

561
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,170
You wanna check out the apartment?

562
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,010
I’m busy tomorrow morning.

563
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,780
Can you drop by in the evening?

564
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,880
What?

565
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,260
You wanna transfer me the rent right now?

566
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,360
Great!

567
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,400
I’ll send my bank account number to you.

568
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,240
The apartment is not available anymore!

569
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,370
It’s already taken!

570
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,500
What are you doing?

571
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,160
You are interrupting my business!

572
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,690
Sit down!

573
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,440
But, I…

574
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,120
I’ve thought about it.

575
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,280
Your apartment is quite cost-efficient.

576
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,480
So,

577
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,320
I wanna rent it again.

578
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,800
What?

579
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,640
I wanna rent it again.

580
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
Rent it again?

581
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,880
Look,

582
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,160
I don’t think it’s appropriate.

583
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,560
I’m afraid that living in that apartment

584
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,760
will affect your current happy life.

585
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,320
No! Not at all!

586
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,600
I don’t have a happy life!

587
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,440
Okay!

588
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,020
Since you are so determined to rent my house,

589
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,920
I’ll make an exception for you.

590
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,560
But…

591
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,760
What?

592
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,160
Are you going to ask for more rent?

593
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,810
It’s a business. I’m not ashamed of it.

594
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,920
It is shameful!

595
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,480
Very, super, extremely shameful!

596
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,280
You are a wealthy ED.

597
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,560
Don’t take advantage of a poor employee like me.

598
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,120
Okay!

599
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
Whatever you say.

600
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,520
How about this then?

601
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,050
I’ll rent it to you at the same price as before.

602
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,640
No.

603
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Jiang Jun.

604
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,720
You won’t allow me to raise the price.

605
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,800
And you are going

606
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,600
to take advantage of my kindness?

607
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,200
No.

608
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,480
I think

609
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,640
I should pay you according to the market price.

610
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,480
You are being nice to me,

611
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,280
and I can’t let you lose too much.

612
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
Okay! No problem.

613
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,040
As long as you are willing to move back.

614
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,720
I said, it gives me headache
thinking about you’ll move back!

615
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,840
Just shut up and eat!

616
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,880
Eat it!

617
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,320
Watch it!

618
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
If you get the sauce on my coat,

619
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,690
you can say goodbye to your salary!

620
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,640
So, when

621
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,180
will you move back?

622
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,850
In these couple of days.

623
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,080
Looks like I have to call Miss Liu again!

624
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,840
Where are you going?

625
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,639
Go pack up my stuff and move back!

626
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Yes!

627
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,080
I did it!

628
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,150
Again?

629
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,630
My God!

630
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,600
Xiaochuan.

631
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
How many more phases are there

632
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,240
for the App to be done?

633
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
When you get to the next phase,

634
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,440
can you give me a hint

635
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,200
so that

636
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,000
I can get ready for it?

637
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,880
What phase?

638
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,600
I mean…

639
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,760
I mean…

640
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,140
I mean the phase that’ll make you do this.

641
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,680
I’m sorry.

642
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Because my App is pretty much

643
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,400
done by now.

644
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,280
I did that

645
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,600
because I just launched the beta test version.

646
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,560
That’s why I was so excited.

647
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,000
Beta test?

648
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,690
So you mean I can download it now

649
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
and I’ll be your first user?

650
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,200
It’s too late

651
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,840
The first user is me.

652
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,680
Then I’ll share it to my model group

653
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,160
and let my friends introduce more users to you.

654
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,920
We can recommend it to our fans,

655
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,610
and ask them to recommend it to their friends.

656
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,240
In that case, the App will get popular soon!

657
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,720
No.

658
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,360
My server is too small

659
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,840
to store that much data.

660
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,960
So I can’t

661
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,060
serve a great number of users for now.

662
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,530
I need to tell my brother first.

663
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,480
I told him I’d surprise him!

664
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,880
Then I’ll go call Jun.

665
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Hi, my babies!

666
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,640
Did the demon water you guys on time?

667
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:37,760
Let me see.

668
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,320
Not bad!

669
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,880
No place is better than home!

670
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,400
Wealth!

671
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,640
Wealth!

672
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,580
Wealth! How come you are here?

673
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,560
What are you doing here?

674
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,000
Gosh! You put on weight again!

675
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,360
Hello, Li.

676
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,160
What’s up?

677
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,090
You are back!

678
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,120
Who’s with you?

679
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,920
No… Nobody.

680
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,920
What?

681
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,080
I can’t even speak?

682
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,060
Who is calling?

683
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,760
Is it Yuan Shuai?

684
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,640
You really moved back?

685
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,080
Jiang Jun, you are so weak!

686
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,080
I demand you to come

687
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,160
to my convenience store right now!

688
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,680
Wait!

689
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,920
What are you doing here?

690
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
I’m here to welcome you!

691
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
Welcome back!

692
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,640
Thank you!

693
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,980
[Li Xiaochuan]

694
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:51,770
Brother,

695
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,680
the surprise I told you last time is done.

696
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,080
I hope you can be the first one to see it

697
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,240
and help me to assess

698
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,360
its investment value.

699
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,210
Where are you going?

700
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,170
The convenience store.

701
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,010
The convenience store?

702
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:54,500
Love Is Sweet
