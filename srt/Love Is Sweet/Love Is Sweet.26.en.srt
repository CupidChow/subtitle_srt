193
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,080
I will find out who it is.

194
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,480
I’ve said all I needed to say.

195
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,220
If you insist on

196
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,920
going down this road,

197
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,050
we’ll be enemies in the future.

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,460
is Jiang Yaoming’s daughter.

former Manager

204
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,040
of Jiangnan Flavor Food Factory.

205
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,080
Five years ago, when Jiang Yaoming’s company

206
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,520
was taken over by C Group,

207
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,440
he didn’t choose to join C Group.

208
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
Instead, he opened a store himself.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,960
His daughter once suffered from lymphoma.

210
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,840
She recovered after surgery.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,800
But it came back again one year ago.

212
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,460
She’s currently in hospital.

213
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,680
Sorry, sir.

214
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,200
I’m fine. Are you okay?

215
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,320
Sir,

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
you are so handsome.

217
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,200
It’s like you walked right out of the TV.

218
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,440
That’s so sweet.

219
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
I’m so sorry.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,440
I’ve told you many times.

221
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,600
Don’t walk around alone.

222
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,200
I just went to get you some water,

223
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
Mr. Yin?

226
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,440
You are…

227
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,250
It’s not important who I am.

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,720
But I believe

229
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,330
that you must know the people in this picture.

230
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,920
How long will she live?

231
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,640
The doctor said it’d be less than one year.

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,160
So you took the bribe from Cao Heng

233
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,100
for her surgery fee back then?

234
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,480
Although

235
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,200
it’s been years,

236
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,840
I know I can never escape from those things.

237
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,680
What do you wanna know?

238
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Just ask away.

239
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,480
As Mr. Jiang’s partner,

240
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,160
do you know any details

241
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,940
about Jiangnan Flavor’s acquisition deal?

242
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,640
10 years ago,

243
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,320
Jiang used his family’s secret rice noodle recipe

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,930
to create the brand “Yixianqian”.

245
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Due to its good taste and rich ingredients,

246
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
it became very popular.

247
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,320
We all made money

248
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
and felt so happy.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,200
So we suggested Jiang

250
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,660
open new factories

251
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,740
and online stores.

252
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,080
But we needed money to expand the business.

253
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,800
So Jiang turned to

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,240
the investment bank for financing.

255
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,160
Everything was going well, until one day

256
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,160
a man and a woman came to our factory.

257
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,640
They said they were in charge of the project.

258
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,840
Mr. Jiang,

259
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
why are you so stubborn?

260
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,040
Just a small change

261
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
to the production mode of the rice noodle

262
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,800
will reduce the production cost by 50%

263
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,900
[Lin Taimo, GM of Investment Banking
Dept. of MH Securities]

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,040
or even more.

265
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,360
With the current reputation of “Yixianqian”,

266
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,600
Jiangnan Flavor's value will definitely be

267
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,440
doubled.

268
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,640
I’ve said it.

269
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,840
I won’t change the production mode
before the other

270
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,620
preservation methods are proved to be safe.

271
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,520
Then think of it this way.

272
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,480
“Yixianqian” is of high cost for now,

273
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,040
and it has a shelf life of only 15 days.

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,880
The instant rice noodles
have the similar taste,

275
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,560
but the shelf life can be at least tripled.

276
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,850
In that case,

277
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,720
wouldn’t it be more convenient
for the customers to carry and enjoy?

278
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,360
While there are no similar competitors,

279
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
I believe that “Yixianqian”

280
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
will quickly take over the market.

281
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,640
But in that way, the freshness and nutrition

282
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,160
of the ingredients will have to suffer.

283
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,880
Most importantly, the taste won’t be
as good as before.

284
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,680
I’m sorry.

285
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,240
I don’t want my family secret recipe

286
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,760
to become another junk food.

287
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,300
Don’t try to convince me anymore.

288
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
I won’t agree it.

If you are always this headstrong,

293
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,960
you will pay for your mistake

sooner or later.

295
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,040
After that,

296
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,920
Cao Heng, President of C Group, found me.

297
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,880
He promised to give me a big amount of money.

298
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,560
But I had to use his batch

299
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,050
of beef of poor quality.

300
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,490
I needed money for my daughter’s surgery,

301
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,360
so I agreed.

302
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,080
Then how did Mr. Jiang die later?

303
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,040
What?

304
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,000
You think there was more to Jiang’s death?

305
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,970
I’m still investigating that.

306
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,480
Do you still remember the name

307
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,560

315
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,640
is quite like her father’s.

Really?

317
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,280

Since you are in GE and can’t help me,

322
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,080

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,720
No worry.

of President Wang’s Shanghai trip

instead of working on it individually.

353
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,960
So, you need a team leader

354

Mr. Lin,

369

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,800
Okay. I see.

371

By the way,

372
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,680
when Ms. Qiao briefed you guys

373
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,320
on Hengsheng Group’s case,

374
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,620
you seemed to have a problem
with the team leader arrangement.

375
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,420
Why didn’t you say something?

376
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,180
I have no problem, Mr. Lin.

00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,120
you are always defeated by him.

569
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,400
Even so, you could still work with him.

570
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,400
You are such a broad-minded person.

571
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,320
Mr. Lin, you don’t have to mock me.

572
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,040
I approached him

573
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,080
so that I could know him better.

574
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,800
And now it’s the perfect timing

575
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
to take him down.

576
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I don’t trust you.

577
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,480
As one who always acts alone,

578
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
why do you suddenly need my help?

579
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,050
It’s not convincing at all.

580
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,660
I’ll tell you Yuan Shuai’s weakness.

581
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,140
And I need you to give me Jiang Jun.

582
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,960
So it’s all for a girl!

583
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,640
I’m surprised that you have a romantic soul.

584
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,920
But,

585
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,340
she’s Jiang Yaoming’s daughter.

586
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
I can’t let her live.

587
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,170
Don’t worry.

588
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,880
Jiang Jun knows nothing so far.

589
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,880
I can promise you that.

590
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,520
When things are done, I’ll help you watch her.

591
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,520
Our common enemy for now

592
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,440
is only Yuan Shuai!

593
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,040
You are awake.

594
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,240
I thought I’d never see you again.

595
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,840
Thank you for finding me.

596
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,720
Don’t be silly.

597
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,680
We are finally together.

598
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,280
I won’t let you leave me again.

599
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,240
Even God

600
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,560
cannot take you away from me.

601
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,240
Dare to steal a girl from God.

602
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,860
That’s quite impressive.

603
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,880
Lie down.

604
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,320
Here.

605
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,440
Just

606
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,360
take a good rest today.

607
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,530
I’ve helped you to ask for a day off.

608
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,770
Lie down with me for a while.

609
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,160
Jiang Jun.

610
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,800
I’ve checked the surveillance tape.

611
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,280
It wasn’t

612
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,520
an accident.

613
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,000
Shen Xin did it to you.

614
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,960
She removed the repair sign on purpose.

615
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,970
Shen Xin?

616
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,320
How do you want to deal with this?

617
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,720
I’ll listen to you.

618
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,960
About this matter,

619
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,880
you don’t have to get involved.

620
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,800
I’ll solve it myself.

621
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
No way!

622
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,680
She almost killed you.

623
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,840
As the saying goes,

624
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,780
“Sweep before your own door”.

625
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,670
I’m sure I also have my own problem.

626
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,710
I’m too insensitive to the office culture, making

627
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,920
my workplace relationships such a mess.

628
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,590
This incident is actually a reminder to me.

629
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,710
So I wanna try to solve it by myself first.

630
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,150
Okay?

631
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,810
Alright.

632
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
I’m sure you’ll do a good job.

633
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,040
So sleepy.

634
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,190
I’ll sleep for a while,
and go to work in the afternoon.

635
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,440
Why are you going to work?

636
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,960
You need more rest.

637
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
Got it?

638
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,400
No.

639
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,600
I want to be an independent woman.

640
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,930
I can’t just rely on my husband…

641
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,480
Your what?

642
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,800
Say it again.

643
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,520
Jiang Jun?

644
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,960
Jiang Jun!

645
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,250
I heard you had an accident last night.

646
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,320
Are…

647
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,040
Are you alright?

648
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,200
Did you get hurt?

649
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,840
I’m curious.

650
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,240
When you did this,

651
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,260
have you considered my feelings?

652
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,610
What are you talking about?

653
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,330
I don’t understand.

654
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
You don’t?

655
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,440
You removed

656
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
the sign on purpose.

657
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,060
Are you too afraid to admit it?

658
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,400
That’s a lie!

659
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
Do… Do you have evidence?

660
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,280
You two,

661
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,920
come to my office.

662
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,220
You want evidence, right?

663
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,460
Take a look at this.

664
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,640
Doesn’t the bracelet in the picture

665
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,600
look quite familiar to you?

666
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,080
Ms. Qiao!

667
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,880
Ms. Qiao! Sorry! I was wrong!

668
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,360
Enough!

669
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,620
I don’t wanna hear your nonsense.

670
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,520
You will be dismissed by MH because of this,

671
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,880
and you won’t be accepted

672
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,040
by any other investment bank in the future.

673
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,320
Moreover, what you did is a crime.

674
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,130
If you wanna cry,

675
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,170
save your tears for the police.

676
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
Jiang Jun!

677
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,680
Jiang Jun, I’m sorry!

678
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,840
I just wanted you to be late
for your appointment.

679
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,200
I didn’t expect things would end up like that.

680
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,040
Please forgive me, Jiang Jun!

681
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,720
I’m begging you!

682
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,280
I don’t wanna leave here!

683
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,960
Jiang Jun, please!

684
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,720
Please forgive me! I shouldn’t have done that!

685
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:45,960
Ms. Qiao.

686
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,680
I know you are angry.

687
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,920
So am I.

688
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,290
But I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

689
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,520
I want a moment with her.

690
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,600
I’ll get back to you later,

691
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,240
okay?

692
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,690
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

693
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,800
Jiang Jun!

694
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,440
Jiang Jun! Please forgive me!

695
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
If I left a paper trail,

696
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,860
my whole life would be ruined.

697
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,960
I thought you  were just jealous,

698
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,040
but I was so wrong.

699
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,440
Turns out you were jealous

700
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
and stupid.

701
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,800
I just wanted to fight for an opportunity.

702
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,820
That’s why I said you were stupid!

703
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
If you want to surpass the others,

704
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
you should strive for it.

705
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,000
Why play all the tricks?

706
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Have you thought

707
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,600
that if anything really
happened to me yesterday,

708
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,460
how could you escape from the law?

709
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
What about your parents?

710
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,730
And what about your future?

711
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,880
I know

712
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,120
even if I apologize to you,

713
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
it’s already pointless.

714
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,200
I can leave MH,

715
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,080
even the investment bank field.

716
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
But could you please not to turn me in?

717
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,840
I don’t want to go to prison.

718
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,920
Jiang Jun!

719
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,560
I’m begging you!

720
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,000
Cry!

721
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,240
How would that help?

722
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,840
Should you be the one crying?

723
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,320
Plus,

724
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,620
when did I say that I’d turn you in?

725
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,640
You…

726
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,320
You won’t hold me accountable?

727
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,160
I didn’t get hurt.

728
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,320
What would I hold you accountable for?

729
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,920
And

730
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,760
how would it be beneficial to me
if I asked Ms. Qiao to fire you?

731
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I’d better keep someone

732
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,920
whom I got the goods on around.

733
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,650
Maybe one day

734
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,440
I can use you as a scapegoat.

735
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,040
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

736
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,680
Stop it. You are making me uncomfortable.

737
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,210
I’ll talk to Ms. Qiao later.

738
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,900
[MH Securities Co., Ltd.]

739
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,210
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

740
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
Who are you?

741
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,520
We are from the Compliance Dept of MH.

742
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,760
Someone reported that you took a bribe.

743
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,260
We need you to cooperate with us
for the investigation.

744
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,340
Love Is Sweet
