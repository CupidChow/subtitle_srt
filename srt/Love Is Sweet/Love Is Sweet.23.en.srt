what Yuan Shuai likes about you.

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,880
I think you should

67
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,080
ask Mr. Yuan this question.

68
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,520
Don’t pretend in front of me.

69
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
So, what are you getting at, Ms. Qiao?

70
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,520
I found out about you two by accident.

71
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,520
Hadn’t Yuan Shuai stopped me,

72
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,360
I would’ve already reported your relationship

73

that office romance is forbidden,

77
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,200
you should know

78
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,280
that once your relationship is exposed,

79
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,640
you will be the one in trouble.

80
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
Yes. I know that.

00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
I’m in a white coat

00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,680
and I have a black suitcase.

[West World Activity “Forget-me-not”
Is Officially Launched.]

194
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,960
The activity is launched already?!

195
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,120
Xiaochuan is still working on New Year Eve.

196
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,760
Poor guy!

197
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,520
Should I leave him alone?

199
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,920
I need to stop thinking!

200
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I don’t want to hear your explanation!

201
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,800

202
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,440
Please let me explain!

Mingming!

205
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,960
-Mingming!
-What happened to him?

206
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,120
Was he ever like this before?

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,880
Are you a doctor?

208
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,040
Could you help him?

209
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,280
I’m not a doctor. I don’t know how to help him.

210
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,000
Hold on. Let me call an ambulance for him!

211
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
Help!

212
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,800

-Someone passed out on Anshun Road!
-Mingming! Wake up!

We need an ambulance, now!

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,280
I accept your proposal!

217
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Don’t shake him!

218
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,640
The shaking may cause more danger!

219
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,840
What did you say?

220
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,520
You accepted my proposal?

221
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,560
-I thought you were dead!
-It’s okay! It’s okay!

222
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
It’s okay. Don’t cry!

223
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,440
You scared me to death!

224
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,280
I just

225
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,320
worked too much and fell asleep.

226
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Don’t worry.

227
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,840
Don’t leave me anymore!

228
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,080
I was so scared!

229
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,880
Okay. Everything’s fine.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Xu Li,

231
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,240
what would you do if something like this

232
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,120
happened to you?

233
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,160
It’d be too late to regret

234
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,520
that you didn’t

235
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,560
confess your love earlier

236
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,520
if such an accident happened.

237
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,520
No!

238
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
I can’t wait any longer!

239

The New Year is right in the corner.

241
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,280

I have a first-class seat.

Would you like to exchange your seat with me?

260

Are you kidding?

No.

270
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,200
There are no problems with

271
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
the West World's matching system..

272
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,800
What about the one-percent match?

273
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,520
Easy.

274
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,440
One percent means

275
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,040
it’s completely impossible

276
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
because they're totally inappropriate
for each other.

277
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,960

278
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,600
I got the time wrong.

I can’t go back now.

281
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,300

282
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,740
of applying your mask,

283
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,420
so I’m here to keep you company for a while.

284
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,380
Have you eaten?

285
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,620
I ordered a lot.

286
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,940

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,940

I don’t know.

292
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,420
I remember you once said

293
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,420
there should be a sense of ritual in life.

294
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,340
So I ordered again

295
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,580
the dishes that represent

296
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,300
a sense of ritual.

297
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,060

So, what’s up?

301
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,620
She wants to know

302
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,780
if you told anybody about what happened before.

303
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,980
That’s why you are here?

304
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,140
I’ve hidden in Suzhou

306
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,340
She still doesn’t trust me?

307
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,420
It’s not that she doesn’t trust you.

308
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
It’s just that somebody

309
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,740
has been investigating that thing.

310
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,820
So,

311
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,420
she sent me here to meet you

312
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,620
and ask you

313
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
if you left any trace

314
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,580
or clue about

315
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,180
that incident.

316
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:36,860
Let me tell you.

317
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,380
I deleted the chatting history

318
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,220
right in front of her!

319
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,300
What more does she want from me?

320
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,860
What chatting history?

321
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,020
Just some regular chatting history.

322
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,220
You don’t know about that?

323
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,260
Of course, I do.

324
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,260
You deleted it in front of her.

325
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,220
But…

326
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,820
Linda didn’t send you here, did she?

327
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,340
Tell me,

00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,500
what are you really here for?

329
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,340
Just stop

332
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,840
There was no chatting history at all.

00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,740
I liked you very, very much.

382
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,740
I…

383
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,420
I…

384
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,540
Although I know

385
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,620
I may not be your 100% girl,

386
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,900
and I may just be the 1%,

387
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,860
I’m willing to change for you.

388
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,940
And I’ll

389
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,300
do my best

390
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,140
to be your 100% girl.

391
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,580
Xiaochuan.

392
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,300
I like you!

393
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,780
But…

394
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,700
Why do you like me?

395
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
Why…

396
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Why wouldn’t I like you?

397
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,660
You just said it yourself.

398
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,780
We have only 1% match.

399
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,540
It’s impossible for us to be together.

400
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,300
But how do you know without trying?

401
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Look at me.

402
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,700
Take a close look at me.

403
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,900
Is there any possibility?

404
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,940
Even just a little bit!

405
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,780
I don’t want to have any regret.

406
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,260
I…

407
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,940
I really don’t know!

408
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,900
Hello?

409
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,220
Hello? This is Cao Heng.

410
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,460
I thought I told you not to call me again.

411
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,820
Let me ask you.

412
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,700
Did you send your brother to see me?

413
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,500
Du?

414
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,540
I didn’t.

415
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,860
Just as I thought!

416
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,140
Your brother came to meet me in your name

417
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,500
and tried to get me to talk.

418
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:04,620
I see.

419
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,420
I’ll take care of it.

420
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,540
That’s all for now.

421
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,740
Okay.

422
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:26,500
Hello? It’s me.

But,

426
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,740
sir, I booked your car!

427
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,020
The flight was only delayed

428
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:38,780
for 20 minutes.

429
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,460
How could you just cancel my appointment?

430
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,180
I had no choice.

431
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,860
My wife asked me to go home.

432
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:44,940
Miss,

433
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,380
I suggest you find a hotel nearby.

434
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,060
I can even return you 50 yuan more.

435
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,020
Or else,

436
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,980
you just need to figure out something yourself.

437
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,260
How am I supposed to…

438
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:59,020
If I didn’t come along with you,

439
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,220
you’d just sit in

440
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,140
a stranger’s car and go home?

441
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,500
It’s a legitimate transportation platform.

442
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,740
I would be safe.

443
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,700
Safe?

444
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,140
And now you are stood up

446
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,180
Were you out of your mind?

447
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,740
Don’t you watch the news?

448
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
Why are you yelling at me?

449
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,220
I’m concerned about you!

450
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,460
But I got a ticket for the latest flight

451
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,460
only because I wanted to wait for you to return!

452
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,100
Alright. I’ll take care of this.

453
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,500

454
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,860
The flight was delayed.

455
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,140
I might not be able to go back tonight.

456
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,860
Don’t wait up. Just go to bed.

457
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,460
I’ll be back as soon as possible.

458
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,100
Hello? Zhu,

I’m in Jiangcheng City right now.

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,740
Could you please send a car to pick me up?

461
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,420
Don’t worry.

462
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,460
I’m with my colleague.

463
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,060
I’ll be fine.

464
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,900
Okay. Thanks.

Excuse me, sir. What are you looking at?

Thank you.

Actually, on my way back,

483
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,699
I really thought about the worst case scenario.

I guess no matter how hard I try,

I’ll still be a 1% girl for him.

488

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,140
Did you say you were with a colleague

570
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,020
when you called?

571
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,100
Colleague?

572
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,900
Mrs. Jiang,

573
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,620
I am the colleague.

574
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:37,620
Here’s the thing.

575
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,020
One day,

576
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,780
Jiang Jun came to my company for an interview.

577
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,580
That’s how

578
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,500
we became co-workers.

579
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,180
Yes.

580
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,980
He’s actually my boss.

581
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,980
I thought you didn’t know that!

582
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,180
Really?

583
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,460
Yuanyuan, you are already a boss
at such a young age!

584
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
How outstanding!

585
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,980
You are young and capable!

586
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,860
You know what?

587
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,300
When you were little,

588
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,220
I always said to Jun’s father

589
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,740
that Yuanyuan would have

590
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:05,300
a promising future.

591
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,140
See?

592
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,420
I was right!

593
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,820
Yuanyuan, thank you.

594
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,820
I feel so relieved

595
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,620
that Jun has you in Shanghai.

596
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,380
It’s just that Jun’s father…

597
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,460
Mom! Mom.

598
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,620
Would you please cook something for us?

599
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,420
We haven’t eaten anything since last night.

600
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,100
We are starving!

601
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,660
Sure! Sure!

602
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,060
It’s New Year’s Day today,

603
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,140
and Yuanyuan is here.

604
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,300
I’ll cook a few more dishes.

605
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,020
You two take a rest first.

606
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,980
I’ll go to the grocery store.

607
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,900
I’ll be back soon.

608
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,380
Mrs. Jiang,

609
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,140
let me go with you.

610
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,220
No need.

611
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,660
Just take a rest at home.

612
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,740
I’ll be right back.

613
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,780
It’s okay! Let’s go!

614
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,740
Alright.

615
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,820
Then…

616
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,580
Go ahead, you guys. Be safe!

617
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,420
[Li Xiaochuan Sorry, I left.]

618
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,140
[Bye.]

619
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,660
[From: Li]

620
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,180
[West World]

621
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:14,620
[Love Be with You]

622
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,900
Mrs. Jiang,

623
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,660
we got so many ingredients.

624
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,660
I’ll cook

625
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,780
tonight. You can try my cooking.

626
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,980
You don’t have to. You are my guest!

627
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,620
Wanjun! Happy New Year!

628
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,660
-Cuiping, Shujuan.
-Happy New Year!

629
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,820
Who’s this young man?

630
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,500
How handsome!

631
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,660
He is!

632
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,100
He’s like a super star!

633
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,380
Isn’t he Jun’s boyfriend?

634
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,900
No.

635
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,100
Good! That’s good!

636
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,100
Good to know!

637
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,180
Cuiping, Shujuan.

638
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,420
Let me introduce.

639
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,020
He’s the son of one of my old neighbors.

640
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:14,980
His name is Yuanyuan.

641
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,060
Yuanyuan!

642
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,180
They are Cuiping and Shujuan.

643
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,620
We play mahjong together.

644
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,340
Nice to meet you. Happy New Year!

645
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,900
-Nice to meet you, too.
-Happy New Year!

646
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,140
Aunt Shujuan.

647
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,340
The coat you are wearing is really pretty.

648
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,700
You look quite elegant in it.

649
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,620
And it makes your skin look very fair!

650
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,820
Aunt Cuiping,

651
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,580
your hairstyle

652
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,340
is very popular this year.

653
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,740
It goes very well with your light makeup.

654
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,900
You look so great

655
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:43,900
and

656
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,780
young!

657
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,460
It’s the New Year.

658
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,100
Fresh look for a new year!

659
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,460
He’s such a sweet boy!

660
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,300
Tell me about it!

661
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,020
Your name is Yuanyuan, right?

662
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,380
I’d like to invite you to my home
when you are free.

663
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,220
Sure.

664
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,300
My daughter…

665
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,260
I also have a daughter!

666
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,100
Shujuan, Cuiping,

667
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,820
we need to go home and cook.

668
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,740
Let’s chat another time.

669
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,860
Let’s play mahjong then.

670
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,620
Yuanyuan, let’s go.

671
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,500
Okay! Okay!

672
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,420
Let’s play mahjong!

673
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,180
Let’s! It’s a deal!

674
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:05,740
Remember to visit me!

675
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,540
I have to go now.

676
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,380
Bye!

677
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,420
Bye! Bye!

678
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,260
Yuanyuan.

679
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,580
You and Jun are not…

680
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,020
What’s wrong, Mrs. Jiang?

681
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,060
Nothing!

682
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,340
Let’s go.

683
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,340
Okay.

684
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:05,740
Love Is Sweet
