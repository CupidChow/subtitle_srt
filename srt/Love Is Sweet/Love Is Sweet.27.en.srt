[MH Securities Co., Ltd.]

6
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,009
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,560
Who are you?

8
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,479
We are from the Compliance Dept of MH.

9
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,610
Someone reported that you took bribe.

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,140
We need you to cooperate with us
for the investigation.

11
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,440
Taking bribes?

12
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,520
Yes.

13
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,750
Me?

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
Are you kidding?

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,610
Please be cooperative.

16
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,280
If the facts don't exist,

17
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
we'll clear your name.

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,160
Alright. I'll go with you.

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
This way, please.

20
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,010
What's going on?

21
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know.

22
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
What's going on here?

23
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,660
What's the matter?

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,000
Those guys look like

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,800
they're from the Compliance Depts.

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
They said that Mr. Yuan took bribes.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,040
How is that possible?

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,900
Yeah, how could that be possible?

29
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,040
It is wrong of you to do so.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,600
Even if you're from the headquarters,

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
you can't just go through other people's stuff.

32
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,250
Sorry, please don't disturb our work.

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
Put it down.

34
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,740
What are you doing?

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,200
The colleague who was transferred to the headquarters
called and said that

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
Mr. Yuan had been reported
for serious disciplinary violations,

37
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,260
but he did not know the specific reasons.

38
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,540
Serious disciplinary violations?

39
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,740
How is that possible?

40
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,340
I don't believe it either,

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,180
but he hasn't found out the specific reasons,

42
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,220
and I'm still asking someone to help me.

43
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,500
Does Ms. Qiao know?

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,260
I asked.

45
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
She doesn’t know.

46
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
What about Mr. Ma?

47
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,740
Didn't he get transferred to the headquarters?

48
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,700
Mr. Ma?

49
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,940
He wished that something would  happen to Yuan Shuai.

50
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,020
Why would he care?

51
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,660
Since the head office is in such a hurry
to send someone here,

52
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,860
it should be no small matter.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,790
Yuan Shuai is in trouble this time.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,220
But don't worry.

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,860
We have to trust him.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,740
And we still have Mr. Fan,

57
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,420
so Yuan Shuai will be fine.

58
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,820
Let's be patient and wait.

59
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,660
Ok.

60
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,140
Let me know as soon as you hear anything.

61
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,980
Ok.

62
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,740
I’m impressed.

63
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,460
Yuan Shuai,

64
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,220
you are now being accused

65
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,460
of taking bribes from Zhu Youyi
of Chenxin Technology.

66
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,780
Do you admit it?

67
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,020
No.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,460
But we found in your account that

69
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,659
you received a large sum of money

70
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,380
from Zhu Youyi last month.

71
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,510
How do you explain that?

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,159
Zhu Youyi is both my client

73
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,700
and my friend.

74
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,780
I lent him

75
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,700
the money.

76
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,860
Do you have an IOU or a loan agreement?

77
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,340
As I said,

78
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,140
we are good friends.

79
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,740
So I don't need a contract with him.

80
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,400
I can confront With Mr. Zhu

81
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,940
about this matter.

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,220
Then let's invite Dr. Zhu in.

83
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,860
Dr. Zhu, I'd like to ask

84
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,659
if you have ever

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,820
bribed our executive director.

86
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,620
Yes.

87
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,660
Did he take bribes from you?

88
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,460
He did take money from me.

89
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,140
Zhu Youyi,

90
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,140
what are you talking about?

91
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,670
I've spent this year

92
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,360
fighting for the future of Chenxin Technology.

93
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,900
Why do you want to wrong me?

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,260
Yuan Shuai, stop acting.

95
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,740
Is acting helpful?

96
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,940
If there were no profit for you,

97
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,300
how could you help me twice

98
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,500
when I was in trouble?

99
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,260
I lent you the money

100
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,300
only because I thought you were
a real friend to me.

101
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,540
Lent me the money?

102
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,820
Who bought you?

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,640
How much did he spend?

104
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Yuan Shuai,

105
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,760
watch your attitude.

106
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,200
I think there must be some misunderstanding

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,740
in this matter.

108
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,740
Yuan Shuai was cultivated by me.

109
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,030
I know his character very well.

110
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,300
Mr. Fan, they say you may know a person’s face
but never his heart.

111
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,380
I know Yuan Shuai is your beloved subordinate,

112
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,100
but don’t be so sure yet.

113
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,980
Whether it's a loan or a bribe,

114
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,660
Dr. Zhu,

115
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,560
what exactly is your relationship
with Yuan Shuai?

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,220
Here's the thing.

117
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,460
More than a year ago,

118
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,380
Yuan Shuai was the project leader

119
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,220
for financing and asset restructuring
of Chenxin.

120
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,340
I wasted a lot of money

121
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,900
because of research and development mistakes,

122
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
and the company was about to go out of business.

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,140
Yuan Shuai saw my project

124
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,020
and thought it was promising,

125
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,580
so he encouraged me to issue bonds.

126
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,310
At the same time, he hinted that

127
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:57,900
I would give him a kickback
after I got the financing.

128
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,380
I agreed

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,950
and gave him some money.

130
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,870
Not long ago, the creditors called for debts,

131
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,980
and he actively helped me inject new funds,

132
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,240
and I gave him five million yuan as usual.

133
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,620
Mr. Yuan,

134
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,700
is what Dr. Zhu said true?

135
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,700
If I say no,

136
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,600
I'm afraid no one will believe me.

137
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,500
Dr. Zhu,

138
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,539
do you have any proof?

139
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,419
This

140
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,420
is the remittance certificate.

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,020
At the first time, because we were inexperienced,

142
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,820
and he was afraid of being found out
by other shareholders,

143
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,020
so I gave him cash,

144
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,460
and there was no receipt.

145
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,660
But this time,

146
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,800
I transferred the money to his private account.

147
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,460
I don't really care about the money.

148
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,630
All I need is the money
for research and development.

149
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,660
But he made even more extravagant demands.

150
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,240
He said he wanted to be a sponsor agent

151
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
and hold an initial offerings of Chenxin

152
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,100
after it goes public.

153
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,140
He wanted to make a fortune.

154
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,420
I didn't want to be threatened by him,

155
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,340
but he was so influential

156
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,800
in the investment banking

157
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,380
that I had to report him to MH.

158
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,180
Zhu Youyi,

159
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,500
well said.

160
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,830
Why didn't I realize

161
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,420
you are such a person?

162
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,540
Yuan Shuai,

163
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,700
you are suspected of taking bribes

164
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,140
and corruption in the private equity investment,

165
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,420
which is a serious breach
of MH’s labor disciplines.

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,020
We will thoroughly investigate all your projects

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,350
in accordance with company regulations.

168
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Ok.

169
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,540
Investigate if you like.

170
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,210
Wait.

171
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,640
Words do not prove things.

172
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,460
Yuan Shuai has always done his duty to MH,

173
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,140
so we cannot convict him

174
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,420
on one side of the story,

175
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,660
or just on some remittance records.

176
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,180
Mr. Fan, don't worry about it.

177
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,860
As things stand,

178
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,820
it's not that serious.

179
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,450
I will personally intercede

180
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,180
with the headquarters and the chairman

181
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,500
to let Yuan Shuai's case be handled internally

182
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,340
and not make things look so ugly.

183
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,320
The worst thing that could happen is to
disqualify him as a sponsor agent

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,020
and

185
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,940
ban him from the market.

186
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,290
It's not that serious.

187
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,580
It seems that

188
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,500
whether I did it or not

189
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,900
doesn’t matter now.

190
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,780
The truth doesn't matter.

191
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,380
What matters is that
someone puts me on this path.

192
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Whether I take this path sooner or later,

193
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,900
the result is the same.

194
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,780
Mr. Yuan,

195
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,940
it is for the sake of MH's reputation.

196
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,340
Well, then,

197
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,700
I should thank you

198
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,380
for your leniency.

199
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,220
Mr. Lin is so amazing.

200
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,940
You gave me such a big surprise

201
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,820
as soon as you got back.

202
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,380
Blame it on your own carelessness

203
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,760
and poor staffing.

204
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,060
Really?

205
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,740
There are only the two of us here.

206
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,620
Come on,

207
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,540
what do you really want to do?

208
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,460
Yuan Shuai,

209
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,820
if you want to investigate me, do it.

210
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,590
Why do you want to investigate C Group?

211
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,340
So it's because of this.

212
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,220
Ok.

213
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,790
I don't have to hide it from you.

214
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,620
Let me tell you

215
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,420
what I've found.

216
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,820
In 2010,

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,220
when you became the General Manager of
MH's Investment Banking Department,

218
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,820
you used the inside information

219
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
and bought shares

220
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,160
of three unlisted companies in advance.

221
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,220
You collected more than 19.47 million yuan

222
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,340
from clients

223
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,200
and made a profit of more than
8.68 million yuan.

224
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
In 2013,

225
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,460
Wuji Technology, founded by your wife,

226
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,540
became the fourth largest shareholder
of Fengshang Technology,

227
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,860
receiving 650,000 shares for 700,000 yuan,

228
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,900
accounting for 1.723 percent.

229
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,220
In 2015,

230
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,660
Fengshang Technology was officially listed.

231
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,020
By the end of the lockdown period,

232
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,420
Wuji Technology's stake

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,900
in Fengshang Technology

234
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,100
was worth about 10 million yuan,

235
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,280
an increase of 14.2 times.

236
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
Ok.

237
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
Don't recite it any more.

238
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,700
You don't have any proof.

239
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,540
What can you do with me?

240
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,350
Let me ask you again,

241
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,140
why are you looking into C Group?

242
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,180
Mr. Lin, why are you so nervous

243
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
when I mention C Group?

244
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,140
Are you trying to tell me that

245
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,140
I can take you down

246
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,620
if I have information on C Group?

247
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,900
Let's change the subject.

248
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,220
I’m told you're on good terms

249
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,860
with your analysts.

250
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,760
Do you know Jiang Jun well?

251
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,100
Jiang Jun?

252
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,380
Isn't she the girl

253
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,220
I threw out of MH?

254
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,900
You asked her to come back.

255
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,460
So you were the one who sent her away.

256
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,300
She is incompetent and only moderately educated.

257
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,460
I did not want her.

258
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,470
Do you think there's a problem?

259
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,940
But Mr. Lin,

260
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,020
why do you always mention
some irrelevant people?

261
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,260
Nothing.

262
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Yuan Shuai,

263
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,020
this time I only punished you a little.

264
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,110
Don't blame me for not warning you.

265
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,540
If you go on against me,

266
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,780
it won't be easy for you next time.

267
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,220
Including your parents.

268
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't they also run companies abroad?

269
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
It's not difficult for me

270
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,140
to let a company go bankrupt by itself.

271
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,060
Lin Taimo,

272
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,180
I’m warning you.

273
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,220
Leave my parents alone.

274
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,700
Ok.

275
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,540
As long as

276
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,900
you leave MH at once,

277
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,520
go abroad immediately

278
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,340
and never come back.

279
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,740
And,

280
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,380
please shut up.

as of today.

284
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,339

285
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,270

One last thing.

293

of the project,

what happened to Yuan Shuai.

309
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:49,820
I'm afraid

310
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,300
he can't stay in MH this time.

311

How is that possible?

have praised Yuan Shuai's ability.

315

If there are any problems,

316
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,140
I can solve them through public relations.

317
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,110
I'm afraid it won't work this time.

318
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,900
By asking him to resign,

319
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,060
the company has given him an extrajudicial grace.

320
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Mr. Fan, don't you like Yuan Shuai the most?

321
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:13,980

The most important thing now

324
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:21,000
is to handle work that Yuan Shuai
has left behind

325
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,820

00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,620
and don't ask me anything,

377
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,080
and don't come to me.

378
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,480
No!

379
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,400
I won't give up until I see you.

380
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,240
Where are you? I'll come to you.

381
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,120
Alright.

382
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,730
Come and see me then.

383
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,200
Ok.

384
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,080
You worried me to death.

385
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,140
Don't come closer!

386
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,180
Do you really want to know?

387
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
Of course.

388
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,360
I love you.

389
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,130
No matter how bad the situation is,

390
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,520
I am willing to go with you.

391
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,440
Go with me?

392
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,760
If I tell you

393
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,040
I am a corrupt person

394
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,890
who’d abuse power for personal gains,

395
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,800
will you go on with me?

396
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,440
Today,

397
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,440
Zhu Youyi was there to expose me.

398
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,200
Do you think I really believed in his project

399
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,640
and wanted to help him?

400
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,080
I did it for his money,

401
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
five million yuan.

402
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,240
Stop.

403
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,780
I don't believe it.

404
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,480
Believe it or not,

405
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,130
the company should make an announcement
in a couple of days.

406
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,080
I have been delisted from MH

407
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,440
and banned from the market.

408
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,720
Will you stop joking?

409
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,880
Can you tell me the truth?

410
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,400
Jiang Jun,

411
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,920
since ancient times,

412
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,140
there have been few people

413
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,880
who could resist the temptation
of money and power.

414
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,320
Especially, after so many years

415
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,280
in our investment banking world,

416
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,800
everyone changes.

417
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,960
I'm no exception.

418
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,400
Because

419
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,160
we all have desires.

420
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,120
I lied to you again.

422
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm not the one

423
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,240
who can give you hope and light.

424
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,240
Still,

425
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,240
consider it as your last lesson.

426
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,320
What do you mean?

427
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,540
I booked a flight to go abroad this evening.

428
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
I…

429
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
I probably won't come back any more.

430
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,660
Let's

431
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,260
just say goodbye.

432
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,460
Are you trying to

433
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,140
break up with me?

434
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,740
You can think of it that way.

435
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Ok.

436
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,300
Then look me in the eye and say it again.

437
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,340
Yuan Shuai,

438
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,980
look at me!

439
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Is this enough?

440
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,400
I won't be able to catch the plane.

441
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,420
What?

442
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,620
Still not giving up?

443
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,820
Do you really want a goodbye kiss to

444
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,500
commemorate

445
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,140
our short-lived and ridiculous love?

446
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Ok.

447
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,740
Sorry.

448
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,080
The principle of today’s interview,

449
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,300
wolves can stay

450
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,860
and lambs will leave.

451
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,660
You and I

452
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,060
are like an ant and a wheel.

453
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,780
You crawl slowly

454
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,660
while I roll ahead.

455
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,670
Some people are shortsighted.

456
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,760
They only see the immediate interests,

457
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,100
so they earn fast and die fast, too.

458
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,500
I'm not like them.

459
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,730
I take the long view.

460
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm more interested in long-term benefits.

461
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,820
I am a corrupt person

462
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,110
who’d abuse power for personal gains.

463
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,380
Let's

464
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,620
just say goodbye.

465
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,900
Liar.

466
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,700
Liar.

467
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,660
Don't you say that

468
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,820
if I am wronged

469
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,780
or sad,

470
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,840
you will embrace me behind me?

471
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm going to cry now.

472
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,680
Where are you?

473
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,760
Jiang Jun,

474
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,160
I will be there for you,

475
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,440
always.

476
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,260
[Flight Information]

477
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,800
Mr. Lin,

478
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,580
Yuan Shuai has left China.

479
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,640
Are you sure?

480
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,720
I’m sure.

481
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,880
Ok.

482
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,720
Ten hours later,

483
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,530
keep track of his cell phone

484
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
and computer Internet Protocol addresses.

485
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,000
I see.

486
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,160
Li.

487
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,520
Li!

488
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,640
You finally woke up.

489
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,920
Why are you crying again?

490
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,320
Is it because of Yuan Shuai again?

491
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,380
How could he not be here at this moment?

492
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,340
I'll find him.

493
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,620
He left

494
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,980
and went abroad.

495
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,780
Why did he go abroad again?

496
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,180
We broke up.

497
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,180
He may never come back.

498
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,700
What?

499
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,180
Did he dump you?

500
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,100
No way.

501
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,810
Then who brought you here last night?

502
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,700
I came by myself.

503
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,360
Yourself?

504
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,140
There’s something wrong.

505
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,820
Didn't he say he had to get to the airport
right away?

506
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,350
What are you talking about?

507
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,380
Where's my phone?

508
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,300
Hello, Xiaochuan.

509
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,960
Has Yuan Shuai contacted you?

510
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,130
No,

511
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,810
he didn't contact me.

512
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:15,820
Ok.

513
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,300
Then once he gets in touch with you,

514
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,500
you must tell me.

515
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:27,380
Jun, what's going on with you two?

516
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,480
Li, I'm leaving the hospital.

517
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,810
I'm going to the office.

518
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,360
Why hasn't Jiang Jun come to work today?

519
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,800
Has anything happened to her?

520
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,630
What's wrong with you today?

521
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,610
Don't you like her the least?

522
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,000
Why do you suddenly care about her?

523
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,260
None of your business.

524
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,710
Xiang Ding,

525
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,710
don't you and Jiang Jun get along the best?

526
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,560
Why don't you call her

527
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,230
and find out what's wrong with her?

528
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,030
I just sent her a WeChat message,

529
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,850
but she hasn't responded yet.

530
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Here you are, Jiang Jun.

531
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,680
Are you ill?

532
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,040
Are you feeling better?

533
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,840
Much better.

534
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
Jiang Jun, you are finally here.

535
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,120
Finally someone is here to help us
share the pain.

536
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,160
Look at this.

537
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,680
This is what happened

538
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
on the first day

539
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,160
after Mr. Yuan left.

540
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,960
To tell you the truth,

541
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,720
I did

542
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,880
find Mr. Yuan

543
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,560
unpredictable

544
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,880
and a little cold in his speech.

545
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,760
But

546
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
now that he's gone,

547
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
it's like our anchor has gone.

548
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,960
All the departments are coming to make trouble.

549
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,890
Everyone makes trouble every day.

550
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,920
I just heard the news that

551
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,720
a new executive director

552
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,820
may come to our company today.

553
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,820
He was appointed by Mr. Lin himself.

554
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,620
Someone is coming so soon?

555
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,720
Everybody puts your work on hold.

556
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,510
I have an announcement to make.

557
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,140
I know everyone is busy with work,

558
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,070
so let me get straight to the point.

559
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,140
Here is the new executive director I engaged

560
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,460
for the Investment Banking Department.

561
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,520
Let's welcome him!

562
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,940
Mr. Du is an influential figure

563
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,860
in the investment banking world.

564
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,220
I believe you all

565
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,550
know a little about him.

566
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,860
From now on,

567
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,020
he will have complete control

568
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,820
of the Investment Banking Department.

569
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,780
I hope you can be cooperative.

570
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,980
Mr. Du, say something.

571
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,860
Ok.

572
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,900
Hello, I'm Du Lei.

573
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
It is a great pleasure

574
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,500
to be in MH with all of you.

575
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,900
In the days ahead,

576
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,460
your kind cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

577
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,380
Thank you.

578
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,940
Secretary Bai,

579
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,420
show Mr. Du to his new office.

580
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,940
Jiang Jun, come here.

581
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,220
Sit down.

582
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,620
Thank you.

583
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,020
I've heard something from my colleagues

584
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,220
at the headquarters.

585
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,820
Do you know

586
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,260
who gave Yuan Shuai's tip-off?

587
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,140
Who?

588
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,740
MH's newly appointed

589
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,860
executive director.

590
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,340
Du Lei?

591
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,140
Don't you think it's such a coincidence?

592
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:38,460
[Informant: Du Lei]

593
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,860
He arrived only one day after Yuan Shuai left.

594
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,720
And, it is said,

595
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,820
he is chosen by Lin Taimo himself.

596
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,820
Yuan Shuai's trouble this time,

597
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,030
I think, is probably

598
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,920
the result of their cooperation.

599
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,500
What does this have to do with Mr. Lin?

600
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,660
You've been in the company a long time.

601
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,380
Can't you see it?

602
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,340
Mr. Lin and Mr. Fan in our
Investment Banking Department don't get along.

603
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,700
Mr. Lin was promoted to the headquarters

604
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,380
but suddenly came back to
the Investment Banking Department.

605
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,510
That means he is going to do something.

606
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,060
On the first day when he came back,

607
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,260
he sent Ma Xiuran away.

608
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,860
That was a demonstration against Mr. Fan.

609
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,700
Yuan Shuai,

610
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,360
Mr. Fan's right-hand man,

611
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,780
was forced to leave.

612
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,180
Do you still think

613
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,020
all this is normal?

614
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:32,700
Yuan Shuai.

615
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:36,820
First of all, let's welcome the return
of Mr. Lin!

616
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,100
You'd better

617
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,380
pick your words wisely.

618
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,860
I'll be back after all.

619
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,100
Hello, I'm Du Lei.

620
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
It is a great pleasure

621
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,780
to be in MH with all of you.

622
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,260
In the days ahead, your kind cooperation
will be greatly appreciated.

623
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,860
Thank you.

624
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:06,620
[Du Lei]

625
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,460
Come in.

626
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,660
What?

627
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,420
Are you here to celebrate my entry into MH?

628
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,700
Why do you come to MH?

629
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,940
Why didn't you tell me ahead of time?

630
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,700
I wanted to surprise you.

631
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,160
I think I've adjusted well enough

632
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,950
to get back into the workplace.

633
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,860
Besides, MH is one of the top companies
in the country.

634
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,100
When it gives me an offer,

635
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,660
I don't think I'd refuse.

636
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,980
Well, congratulations, Mr. Du.

637
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,340
Would you like to have dinner together?

638
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:06,180
What's wrong with your face?

639
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,100
Nothing. I'm a little allergic.

640
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,020
Mr. Du,

641
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,940
I already know that

642
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,940
you turned him in.

643
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,740
Since you are my friend,

644
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,500
I don't want you to put the trumpeted accusation

645
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,620
on Yuan Shuai

646
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,540
and be used by others.

647
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,200
Are you sure you don't want to have a try?
It tastes good.

648
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,980
I know what he's like.

649
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,540
He would never do such a thing.

650
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,700
And my trust in him will last a lifetime.

651
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,460
If you're going to go on against him,

652
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,060
I'll have to take his side.

653
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,260
I have all the evidence.

654
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,500
Why do you believe him but not me?

655
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,380
A lifetime

656
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,900
is a long time.

657
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:03,980
As for Yuan Shuai,

658
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,510
I will try my best to find out the truth
for him.

659
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,840
And as a friend,

660
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,150
my final piece of advice to you is that,

661
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,420
I hope when the gun turns around,

662
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,940
you won't hurt yourself.

663
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,100
Bye.

664
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,300
Love Is Sweet
