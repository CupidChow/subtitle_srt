Love Is Sweet

[Letter of Resignation]

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,039
You have no idea

7
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,800
how helpless I was

8
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,720
at that moment.

9
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,120
Luckily, my Prince Charming

10
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,880
suddenly appeared in front of me.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,920
I’m really happy.

12
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,160
Just thinking about it makes me excited.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello, mom.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,080
Jiang Jun.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
How is your work?

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,600
Is everything going well?

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,440
Everything goes well. Everyone is friendly.

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,440
I’m fine.

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,680
That’s good.

20
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:21,720
Jiang Jun.

21
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
Listen.

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,880
Don’t ever cry if you get wronged.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
You can tell me about it. Got it?

24
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,840
Maybe you can get a boyfriend.

25
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,040
He can take care of you.

26
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,320
Then I will feel relieved.

27
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Alright, mom.

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,320
No hurry. Just let it be.

29
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
Alright.

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
I won’t urge you again. Okay?

31
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,520
Jiang Jun.

32
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,120
Look,

33
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,400
you are in Shanghai alone

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,560
without anybody accompanying you.

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,840
So be careful all the time,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
you know?

37
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,280
Please take care, mom.

38
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,400
I will return when I get a holiday.

39
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,400
Bye-bye.

40
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,440
Your mom?

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,040
Jiang Jun.

42
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,760
How about changing to another job?

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I’ll support you if you can’t get a proper job.

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
I’ll support you even if I
have to sell instant noodles.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,720
Well.

46
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,079
You don’t like the big devil, right?

47
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Leaving him

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,240
is a good thing from another angle.

49
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,000
Don’t you think so?

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,200
Stop thinking of the resignation letter.

51
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,000
You need to eat first

52
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,600
and then fight with the others.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,960
Hold on, I’ll cook the instant noodles for you.

54
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,920
Taking MH as an online game,

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,480
which level are you at?

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,840
I’m being kicked out of the newbie area.

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,840
It seems you need a teacher.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,079
I’m not

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,760
the top one but kind of experienced

60
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,520
in the investment industry.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,680
Am I that lucky

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
to be your teacher?

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,720
I have no idea about it right now.

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Maybe I can have a try

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,320
even if there is a slim chance.

66
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,560
Teacher, please accept me as your student.

67
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,390
Seriously? You take me as your teacher online?

68
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,160
I didn’t have a meal today.

69
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Would you mind treating me to a meal?

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,560
Delicious noodles for you.

71
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,840
Li, enjoy it yourself.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,680
I have to go out now.

73
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,240
No need to wait.

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,120
Eat some before leaving.

75
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,040
Where will she go alone so late?

76
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,800
You young girl,

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,920
why are you going out so late alone?

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,560
It seems I’m caring about her too much.

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
You are out alone so late.

80
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
Are you trying to murder Deng Ke?

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,120
It’s really a good idea.

82
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,440
But seems the price is too high.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,680
Don’t worry.

84
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,920
Nobody else, but you.

85
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,320
You are the first target

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,760
for me to assassinate.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,040
Then take care and come back alive early.

88
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,440
I’d wait for dying together with you.

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,680
Bah!

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,440
Excuse me.

91
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,240
Thank you.

92
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:04,770
Thank you.

93
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,360
Mr. Du,

94
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,480
maybe we can change another place.

95
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
I don’t think this place

96
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,200
fits your identity very well.

97
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,000
Both steak and fried chicken

98
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,120
make people feel full

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,280
while let people enjoy the delicious food.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,920
They both give people satiety.

101
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,200
Why do we have to care about
the lowliness or nobleness.

102
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,440
It tastes great.

103
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,440
Alright.

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,240
No matter if I can learn

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,480
the essence from you,

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,680
I’d appreciate you

107
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
helping me at the critical moment.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,720
I’d show my respect.

109
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
Alcohol will affect your judgment.

110
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,600
Moreover,

111
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,280
it’s not about drunken boxing.

112
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,000
How have you been recently?

113
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,920
There is no room for change.

114
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
Is it about Kelang Pharmacy?

115
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,560
You know it?

116
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,960
They have done many things recently.

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,640
M&A.

118
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,480
Joint board of directors.

119
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,560
I heard of it.

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,160
My mistake. I was sure of success.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,920
But we got a weak teammate.

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,280
What do you mean by that?

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Simply speaking,

124
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,640
we doubted that

125
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,360
one senior leader of Kelang was stained.

126
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,080
Unexpectedly, our witness

127
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,560
went wrong at the critical moment.

128
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,600
We were then defeated at last.

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,480
He went wrong at the critical moment.

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
You think he had important evidence?

131
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,040
Do you mean he did that on purpose?

132
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,120
Deng Ke is a person

133
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,680
good at making psychological attacks.

134
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,480
A boss like him

135
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,560
wouldn't have foolish staff.

136
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,000
What does that mean?

137
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Remember,

138
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
no matter what kind of company,

139
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,080
it will cover its shortcomings

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
and pretend everything is going well

141
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,520
at the first moment

142
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,480
when it faces huge interests.

143
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
You need to find out the truth,

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,120
but not just seeing documents they offered.

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,000
Documents can be feigned and deceive people.

146
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,360
While backstage and data

147
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,880
are always traceable.

148
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,800
You are right.

149
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,800
The thing shouldn’t be that simple.

150
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,280
Excuse me, Miss.

151
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
We are on the anniversary.

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
Every lady can have this as a gift.

153
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,120
Please accept it.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,400
Thank you.

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,440
Also please show my appreciation to your boss.

156
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,120
OK.

157
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,030
I didn’t expect this bonus.

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,520
See?

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,240
You are getting luckier.

160
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,800
She will probably be fired,

161
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,280
but she even feels like dating a man.

162
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,720
Remember your good luck.

163
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,400
Thank you.

164
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,520
She even received a flower.

165
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,920
Drive safely.

166
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,960
Fine, Jiang Jun.

167
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,360
You asked me to rediscover you.

168
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Is that what you want me to rediscover?

169
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,600
Well.

170
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,920
Wait and see.

171
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
I will show you how.

172
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Comparisons are odious.

173
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,800
People are always different.

174
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
Both work in investment industry,

175
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,840
but why do they have such a big gap?

176
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,460
[Total assets: 501,430 Yuan]

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,640
I heard you went to work in an accounting firm

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
after leaving my company.

179
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,000
You are just working there

180
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,800
for muddling along

181
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,760
without earning too much, right?

182
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,280
Mr. Deng.

183
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
Are you asking me here

184
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,800
specially to shame me?

185
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,520
Shame you?

186
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,440
Shame you.

187
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,400
Do you deserve it?

188
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,240
You must be hard up now, right?

189
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,720
500,000 yuan.

190
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,400
I will pay you 500,000.

191
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,040
Do one thing for me.

192
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,560
Who is that?

193
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,800
Why is it you?

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,280
What are you doing?

195
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,840
Did I allow you to come in?

196
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,960
You are drinking.

197
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,000
So in a good mood, huh?

198
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
You must have been bribed by Deng Ke.

199
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Nonsense.

200
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,200
He’s the biggest enemy of me.

201
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,920
How is it possible?

202
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,200
You even betrayed your wife.

203
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,640
Of course you can be bribed by your enemy.

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:51,960
Listen.

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,040
This is my house.

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,760
Just leave. You are not welcome.

207
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
I’m calling the police if you don’t leave.

208
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,840
Understand?

209
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,820
[Office Advanced for Management]

210
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,520
You haven’t read the books for a long time.

211
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,800
Your faith must be rusty.

212
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,160
All your passions have gone.

213
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,280
I checked your account.

214
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,360
An unknown amount

215
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
of 500,000 was transferred

216
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,080
to you.

217
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,800
Are you going to tell me

218
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,320
Deng Ke was feeling sorry

219
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,840
and gave it to you as a compensation?

220
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:35,920
Li Xiang.

221
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,480
You even could be bribed by your enemy.

222
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,000
How cheap you are!

223
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,840
I am

224
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,040
out of money.

225
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,360
Out of money?

226
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,440
Look, you’d better speak out

227
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,000
what you and Deng Ke did.

228
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,960
Otherwise,

229
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,040
you will have a new stain.

230
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
Also I’d ensure you

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
that you will

232
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
forfeit your career from this day.

233
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,880
You are killing me in that way.

234
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:21,920
No way.

235
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,040
Definitely not.

236
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,720
Deng Ke has something on me.

237
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,080
I can’t help you.

238
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,080
Do you think I have nothing on you?

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,040
You have three seconds.

240
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,120
Three.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Two.

242
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,960
One.

243
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,440
Hold on please.

244
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,720
Besides me,

245
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,040
there was another person.

246
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,480
Jiang Jun, are you crazy?

247
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,320
Jiang Jun?

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Jiang Jun?

249
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,320
Jiang Jun.

250
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,840
You’ve been awake the whole night?

251
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,640
You must be crazy.

252
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,040
So,

253
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Was it worth working all night?

254
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
And this is a dismissed guy.

255
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,240
Will you give up your life for work?

256
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
Staying up late will cause sudden death

257
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,640
to many people, you know?

258
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,000
You can check it on Weibo.

259
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,160
There are many…

260
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,440
That’s him.

261
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,080
That’s it. I finally got it.

262
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,080
Love you, baby.

263
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,840
I gotta go to work.

264
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,920
Jiang Jun.

265
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
I’m sorry.

266
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,320
We thought you were leaving the office.

267
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,600
We worked up late because of you.

268
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,200
Kelang arranged people yesterday to ask for

269
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,480
signing the Intention Agreement this afternoon.

270
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,800
Or else they will contact GE.

271
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,160
Ms. Qiao arranged us

272
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,120
to collate the data of Kelang.

273
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,280
Now that you are here,

274
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,000
please help us handle the stuff

275
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,840
on the desk.

276
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,760
What did you just say?

277
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,320
I said

278
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,840
now that you are here, please…

279
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
No, the one before that.

280
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,160
Kelang will sign the Intention Agreement
this afternoon.

281
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,520
This afternoon?

282
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,560
The cooperation is settled today

283
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
just after the board of directors yesterday.

284
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,800
Does Mr. Yuan know it?

285
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,720
I have no idea whether he knows it or not.

286
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,920
I just know it’s Ms. Qiao’s order.

287
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,800
Jiang Jun.

288
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,480
Strictly speaking,

289
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,280
we three were requested to do things

290
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,840
that you originally should have done

291
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,440
because you messed up Kelang’s meeting.

292
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,480
My supervisor in Stanford once said

293
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,200
people should be brave to face every challenge

294
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,880
without making any excuses.

295
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,320
That’s right.

296
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,800
Anybody who expresses his dissatisfaction

297
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,320
by complaining the colleagues

298
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,160
due to additional tasks

299
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,440
is unqualified

300
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,160
to stay in MH.

301
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,080
Mr. Yuan.

302
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,240
I’ll finish the new challenge
with quality assured.

303
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,240
Yuan Shuai.

304
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Is what they said true?

305
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,920
The agreement will be signed this afternoon?

306
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,680
Yes.

307
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,000
But I’ve found out

308
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,920
the real insider last night.

309
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,400
Li Xiang was a liar.

310
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
He’s Deng Ke’s finished bait.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,760
Deng Ke did something to the personnel files.

312
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,880
The insider was listed as the in-service staff.

313
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,360
Actually, he quit a long time ago

314
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,520
and is now working in an accounting firm.

315
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,460
[Staff File of Kelang Pharmacy]

316
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,880
You are not ridiculously stupid.

317
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I thought you are just one

318
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,680
who may have fun outside with flowers at night.

319
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
Now you can even find it’s a shell game.

320
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,760
You knew it?

321
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,560
Deng Ke will cometo sign the agreement at 2:30 p.m.

322
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,360
You need to

323
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,240
stop him before I come back.

324
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,560
How?

325
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,200
That’s what you need to think about.

326
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

327
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,560
Why hasn’t he come back?

328
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,120
Men from Kelang will come soon.

329
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,520
Print the agreement.

330
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,240
Mr. Deng. This way please.

331
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,560
Print it and send it to the meeting room.

332
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
Deng Ke came in advance. How is it going?

333
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,040
How much time do you need?

334
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:00,800
Lin He.

335
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I’ve told you

336
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
I don’t want to get involved anymore.

337
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,280
You don’t need to come for me.

338
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,240
Brake for the race. Hot melt tyre.

339
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,600
A man chasing extreme speed

340
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,240
shouldn't just leave like this, right?

341
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,680
After leaving Kelang,

342
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,400
you got a new job.

343
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,400
But the salary is much less.

344
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,680
Let’s race.

345
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,840
Be the witness

346
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,600
if you lose.

347
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,640
Let me help you

348
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,400
return Kelang aboveboard if you win.

349
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,480
Look, you are

350
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,120
interesting.

351
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,520
shall we?

352
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,840
To betting to bear.

353
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Let’s go.

354
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,000
Forget about it.

355
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,400
Mr. Deng.

356
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,800
Hello.

357
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
Nice to meet you.

358
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,520
Nice to meet you.

359
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,240
After signing the contract,

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,440
we may play golf sometime.

361
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,320
You have the final say.

362
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,400
Please sit.

363
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:20,880
Great.

364
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,880
Why hasn’t she taken the agreement?

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,840
I will go check it.

366
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Why is it her?

367
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Mr. Yuan

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
gave her the chance.

369
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,520
Mr. Fan.

370
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,640
MH is so tolerant.

371
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,800
You gave a chance to the person

372
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,000
who made such a big mistake.

373
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
I believe Mr. Deng

374
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,320
is also an easy person.

375
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here today.

376
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,440
Yeah.

377
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
Arranging her to take the contract

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,720
is letting her know better about

379
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,680
her mistake.

380
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,480
Su Chang.

381
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,080
I, I will get a new one.

382
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,040
Not necessary.

383
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
I’m used to having two strings to my bow.

384
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,340
[Deng Ke]

385
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,800
Lin He.

386
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,720
former employee of Kelang.

387
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,960
The real insider.

388
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,000
He has the evidence Mr. Deng transferring

389
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,960
corporate assets to his private bank account.

390
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,840
Seems Miss Jiang still hasn’t realized

391
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,920
her mistake.

392
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,840
You got an unregistered accountant last time.

393
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,840
Today it’s simpler.

394
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,000
You want to slander me with the resume

395
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,160
of someone who quit.

396
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,120
Mr. Fan.

397
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,560
I can just let go

398
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
of the last event.

399
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,040
But your employee

400
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,320
has kept slandering me.

401
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,440
Can you explain it?

402
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Mr. Deng.

403
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
I’m sorry.

404
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,880
It’s my dereliction.

405
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,160
Su Chang.

406
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,280
Take her out.

407
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,040
Process the dismissal procedure.

408
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,720
The company reserves the right to claim.

409
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,400
I will call the security

410
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,160
if you don’t get out.

411
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
You are not the one to leave.

412
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,360
Mr. Deng.

413
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,480
MH and Kelang should cooperate

414
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,160
based on mutual trust.

415
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,000
Am I right?

416
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,160
But you made us confused on purpose

417
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,160
and cheated

418
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,040
by mixing the former employee

419
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,800
in the list of in-service staff

420
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,080
to hide the evidence of transferring assets.

421
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,960
What?

422
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,920
You didn’t think I could find out the evidence?

423
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,480
Sorry, Mr. Deng.

424
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,800
I’ve sent the evidence and documents

425
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,960
to Kelang’s board of directors.

426
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,840
Everything you’ve done

427
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,880
will be known by all.

428
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,120
I’m afraid

429
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,440
we have to cancel the contract today.

430
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,760
If

431
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,840
MH will continue the cooperation

432
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
with Kelang

433
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,120
is up to whether

434
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,200
you are still the president

435
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,960
of Kelang or not.

436
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,040
I’m the former worker of Kelang.

437
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,200
Lin He.

438
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,080
To say thank you.

439
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,480
You are putting me off?

440
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,480
Of course not.

441
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,040
You liked it the most in your childhood, right?

442
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,960
Uh.

443
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,760
Thank you.

444
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,520
I thought I would be kicked out this time.

445
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,720
How do you think?

446
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,760
Is it beautiful?

447
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,480
You came to MH just for sightseeing, right?

448
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Of course I should

449
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,520
take you to see around.

450
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,160
In this case, you won’t have any regret

451
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,840
when you leave.

452
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,520
So you took me as a visitor?

453
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,720
Then why did you help me?

454
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,960
You think I was helping you?

455
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,400
In the investment circle,

456
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,240
I’ve never lost.

457
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
I can’t ruin my fame

458
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,120
just because of Deng Ke.

459
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,440
What are you looking at?

460
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,680
Anyway,

461
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,520
thank you for teaching me that.

462
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,600
Also, after I see the sight,

463
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,920
I will surely stay.

464
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Seems you are

465
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
not as cold-blooded as I imagined.

466
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,440
Seems you are

467
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,120
stronger than I imagined.

468
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,600
I don’t like to owe anyone favors.
I’ll treat you to dinner tonight.

469
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,640
Any place you like.

470
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,520
What would you like?

471
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,960
I just sent it to you.

472
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,220
[Linglong Restaurant 1,988 Yuan/Customer]

473
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,040
1,988 yuan?

474
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,800
Yuan Shuai!

475
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,560
A Michelin one-starred restaurant

476
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,000
with a parking valet.

477
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,200
Users who are thinking of group buying

478
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,440
will never become their target population.

479
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:52,560
You, as an example.

480
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,560
Seems the restaurant is just like you

481
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,440
who always aims at exploiting

482
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,160
the ordinary people’s hard-earned money.

483
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,960
Yeah.

484
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,320
Don’t you know it?

485
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,640
I always exploit you to make myself happy.

486
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,160
I’m not like your husband.

487
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,480
He’s really shabby.

488
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,360
He only gave you one flower for the date.

489
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,080
Who do you mean?

490
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,080
The one driving you home last night.

491
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,160
I saw it.

492
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,960
Congrats.

493
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,280
Nobody is shabbier than you.

494
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,600
Have I ever been shabby?

495
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,480
Yes.

496
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,720
The first semester at grade three.

497
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,360
You proposed to Cui Lele

498
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,560
in front of the whole class.

499
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,280
Did you forget it?

500
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,800
Cui Lele?

501
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,280
Who is she?

502
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,880
The plump girl of our class.

503
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,160
Her dad had a barbecue pork shop.

504
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,200
You made a proposal

505
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,640
in the presence of all

506
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,040
just for the half pig trotter.

507
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
What?

508
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
Did I take it at last?

509
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,080
Yeah.

510
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,280
She accepted your proposal.

511
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,680
And you had the pig trotter together.

512
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,600
Mouthful.

513
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,680
Your mouth was full of oil.

514
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,080
It’s really funny.

515
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,600
You remember it clearly.

516
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
I remember every detail.

517
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,480
Why don’t I remember it?

518
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,200
You are defaming me.

519
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,680
I’d sue you for slandering.

520
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,280
You were defamed long time ago.

521
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,960
I was just scolding you in the company

522
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,200
but not learning your personal information.

523
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Giving birth to a second child?

524
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,640
Bah. I’m single now.

525
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,880
Don’t talk nonsense.

526
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,640
Does your ex-wife live an extremely good life?

527
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,920
Her new husband

528
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,520
is much better than you, right?

529
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,800
Sorry to tell.

530
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,800
I’m single

531
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,840
as you are.

532
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,840
Got it.

533
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
A nobody becomes rich suddenly

534
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,520
and has too many choices.

535
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,040
You are exactly right.

536
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,320
There are too many beauties in a big city

537
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,320
like Shanghai.

538
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,200
Everyone is very charming.

539
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,840
I really don’t know which one to pick.

540
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,640
Then take it easy.

541
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,120
Parking apron? Michelin?

542
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,360
Sorry.

543
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,840
So careless?

544
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,480
Come on.

545
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:37,960
Here you are?

546
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,120
What would you like?

547
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,160
The most expensive one for two.

548
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,520
She will pay the bill.

549
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
116 yuan.

550
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,200
You are a regular customer. 110 yuan is okay.

551
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,680
Turn it over and pay by scanning it.

552
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,520
It’s OK.

553
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,000
Well.

554
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,080
Please hold on.

555
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,640
Do we have another part?

556
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,320
Still thinking of the parking valet?

557
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,360
Let’s go.

558
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,240
We still have time.

559
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,040
No. No. No.

560
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,400
This is OK.

561
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,200
This is good.

562
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,120
A good moral.

563
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,920
Wealth.

564
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,800
Let me clean it.

565
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,920
Your rice noodles of wealth are ready.

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,520
Please enjoy.

567
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:20,640
Thank you.

568
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,760
Please enjoy it.

569
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,000
Have a try.

570
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,200
How is it?

571
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,400
I learned to make it

572
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
because I wanted to have Chinese food abroad.

573
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,440
After a while, I could almost make it well.

574
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,640
But I still remember

575
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,920
the rice noodles your dad made.

576
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,720
I tried replicate his recipe many times,

577
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,840
but failed.

578
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,240
After I returned,

579
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,360
I accidentally found this restaurant.

580
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
It tastes nice.

581
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,000
Of course it’s not as good as your dad’s,

582
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,040
but it’s not easy to reach this level.

583
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,120
So I brought you here to try it.

584
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,920
My dad invited you to have meals

585
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,320
so that you would take care of me.

586
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,960
You were pleased with the meals.

587
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,360
But you spared no effort in bullying me.

588
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,960
You only intended to let me see the light

589
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,760
by helping me in the matter of Kelang?

590
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,480
You want to hear the truth or lie?

591
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,960
The truth of course.

592
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,480
I intended to apologize.

593
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,440
I owe you an apology

594
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,480

595
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,280
How dare you mention that?

596
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,670
I was almost killed.

597
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,920
How can you say that lightly?

598
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,200
I know the matter of the speech

599
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,160

600
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,920
But I didn’t mean it.

I didn’t expect you would

606
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,240
put it together with the speech.

It’s not about what you want.
