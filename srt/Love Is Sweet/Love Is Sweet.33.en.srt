00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 33

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
Xiang Ding already left.

6
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,979
He was fired on the day the story came out.

7
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,840
Well, for me...

8
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,479
I have to stay for a few more days

9
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:49,479
because the handover has to be done.

10
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,680
Why did you resign directly

11
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
without waiting for me to come back?

12
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
Xiang Ding and I failed to

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
handle the SKL case.

14
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,660
Someone has to take the responsibility.

15
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,840
But it hasn’t been proved that

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,520
you are the ones who leaked the information.

17
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,380
We can still have another choice.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,800
Mr. Du, do you want to see me?

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,840
The price leak

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,320
hasn’t been found out until now.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,960
You got nothing to explain to me?

22
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,240
Mr. Du, Xiang Ding and I

23
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
are to blame for the price leak.

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,360
But it was definitely not leaked by us.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
You have my word.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
Of course I believe you.

27
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,600
But it had already happened.

28
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,660
Someone has to take the responsibility.

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,040
Sure.

30
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,760
Jiang Jun is in charge of this case.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,079
But she’s on leave

32
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,140
when the information got leaked.

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
So, you’re the people

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,480
who are most likely to leak it.

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,200
But we didn’t do it.

36
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,520
And there is no evidence to prove

37
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
it was leaked by us now.

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,450
Shen Xin, how long have you been
in this industry?

39
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,210
For three years.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,200
Three years?

41
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
A nobody always takes the blame.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,130
You must have been familiar with such things.

43
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,900
How about this?

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,820
When Jiang Jun comes back,

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,720
let’s make her the scapegoat.

46
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,760
No!

47
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,000
It has nothing to do with her.

48
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,440
Okay.

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,690
If you leave now,

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,200
I can announce to the public

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,320
that you left for personal reasons.

52
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,840
If you don’t do it now,

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,250
later, I may not be able to help you.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,880
I see.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,579
Something went wrong.

56
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,300
And someone has to take responsibility.

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,040
I still want to thank you

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,520
before I leave MH.

59
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,560
If you hadn’t forgiven me,

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,090
I wouldn’t have been able to stay  at MH.

61
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,400
I guess,

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
I just don’t belong here.

63
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,560
So,

64
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,580
I have to find another job now.

65
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,730
The job market is bleak.

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
It’s too risky for you

67
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,880
to resign now

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,560
since you haven’t landed another job.

69
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,480
I’ll find one anyway.

70
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,700
No worries.

71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
I will definitely find a better job.

72
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,840
Hello?

73
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Okay, I’ll be right back.

74
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,880
I still have a few things to deal with
in the Administration Department.

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,960
I’ll go back now.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,880
What about the annual revenue data report?

77
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,440
Mr. Du,

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,880
this is our performance
for the second half of the year.

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,920
There’s an increase of 20%

80
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,520
compared to the first half of the year.

81
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,160
Our achievement rate and net profit

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,120
have far exceeded the second-ranked GE

83
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,760
under your leadership.

84
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,600
Great. Keep working.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,440
I look forward to a more dazzling performance

86
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,800
in overseas markets next year.

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Okay, Mr. Du.

88
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
You can leave now.

89
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,980
[Jiang Jun]

90
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,880
You came back before you got rested

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,280
Yuan Shuai will blame me for enslaving you.

92
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,280
Mr. Du, I know you’re busy

93
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,320
and don’t have time to answer my calls.

94
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
But I believe Shen Xin and Xiang Ding
have nothing to do

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,810
with the price leak of SKL’s acquisition.

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,560
I hope you can give them another chance

97
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,890
to figure out the truth.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,040
When you were on the leave,

99
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,080
I already handed this case

100
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,000
over to Qiao Na.

101
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,660
So, it’s not your problem.

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,320
You should know

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,720
how much the company has lost because of this.

104
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,760
Also,

105
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,400
in this industry,

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,680
not everyone gets a second chance.

107
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,780
They should be responsible for it

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,040
either directly or indirectly.

109
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,440
Am I right?

110
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,780
Do you have anything else?

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,880
Fine, I’ll leave now.

112
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,320
Xiang Ding and I failed to

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,120
handle the SKL case.

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,200
Someone has to take the responsibility.

115
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,120
When you were on the leave,

116
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,159
I already handed this case

117
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,159
over to Qiao Na.

118
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,740
So, it’s not your problem.

119
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,960
You should know

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,520
how much the company has lost because of this.

121
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,360
Also,

122
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,080
in this industry,

123
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
not everyone has a second chance.

124
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,800
There is more than one way of life.

125
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,000
Maybe what I have always insisted

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
is not the only choice.

127
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,100
[Yuan Shuai]

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,040
Hello?

129
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,060
Why didn’t you answer my call?

130
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,100
I didn’t see it because I’m on my way home.

131
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,640
What happened?

132
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
Nothing happened.

133
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,520
You

134
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,960
still like to be brave,

135
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,280
minding everyone’s business.

136
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
If there’s no way out,

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,520
you will keep it to yourself.

138
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,280
Have you forgotten that

139
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,680
you have a powerful boyfriend

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,000
as your backup force?

141
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,810
You’re not single anymore.

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you a fortune teller?

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,360
Why do you know me so well?

144
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,880
Tell me what’s going on.

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
When I was on the leave,

146
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,440
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding’s case went wrong.

147
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,300
They took the blame and resigned.

148
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
I thought

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,760
there’s another choice.

150
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Is that all?

151
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I thought it was something serious.

152
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,280
My silly girl.

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
How did you know I was here?

154
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,420
No matter where you go,

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
I’ll be there to protect you.

156
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,080
After all,

157
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,440
you can’t even remember to eat

158
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,280
when I’m not around.

159
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Let’s go home.

160
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,450
Are you still thinking about that?

161
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,880
I’m partially responsible

162
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,530
for their resignation.

163
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,380
If it hadn’t been for me...

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,560
Enough.

165
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,860
Stop thinking about that.

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Take a good rest and forget about it.

167
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,320
Look at you. You have a headache now?

168
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,560
Come.

169
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,560
I’ve learned a method

170
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,040
to massage the temple

171
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,520
online recently.

172
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,160
It can relieve your fatigue.

173
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,720
How’s it? Feel good?

174
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Much better.

175
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,760
All you need

176
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,720
is rest.

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,480
Jiang Jun,

178
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,640
I won’t ask you to

179
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,220
work less hard on your job.

180
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,000
And I’m also happy for you

181
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,080
if you have a good performance.

182
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,920
But if you ruin your health

183
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,080
because of work,

184
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,760
it will hurt my heart.

185
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,080
Got it.

186
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,570
It’s so good to have you.

187
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Wealth, what’re you doing?

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,880
What’s wrong?

189
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
Are you angry
because I didn’t buy you food?

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,380
I knew you would forget it.

191
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
So I bought it.

192
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,480
Come down.

193
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,640
Go.

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,660
Yuan Shuai.

195
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,560
You’ve been doing the cleaning?

196
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
What do you think?

197
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,400
It took you so long to find this.

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,120
How about

199
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,280
hiring a cleaner?

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,040
No.

201
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
I don’t want a strange person

202
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,040
to step in our private world.

203
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,720
I love to do this for you,
no matter in work or family.

204
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
I won’t feel tired

205
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,730
as long as you’re happy.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,060
You’re so cunning.

207
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,000
You made me look like

208
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
a heartless lazy woman.

209
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,760
Lazy?

210
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
I told you before.

211
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,240
You’re my queen.

212
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,920
You will be my queen forever.

213
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,520
My queen,

214
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,800
go to sleep

215
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,770
I wish someone can say that in real life

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,840
Okay.

217
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,800
Go.

218
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,440
Yuan Shuai,

219
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,440
I will resign

220
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
and be your wife

221
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,040
after I finish this.

222
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,880
Why is the data on the two documents different?

223
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,460
[Acquisition Background]

224
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,620
[Plan A]

225
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,560
You didn’t listen to

226
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,210
even one word I said, right?

227
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,560
Am I the only one

228
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,890
who cares about your health in this world?

229
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,120
No.

230
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,700
But I have so many cases on my hand now.

231
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,720
They can’t do anything if I don’t finish them.

232
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,450
And I should be responsible for

233
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,860
Xiang Ding and Shen Xin’s resignations.

234
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,800
I don’t think it’s a fair result.

235
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,000
I can’t wait any more.

236
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,840
MH has its own investigating system

237
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,920
to justify if it’s fair or not.

238
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you think the world wouldn’t work without you?

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,060
Jiang Jun, you’re being so arrogant.

240
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,960
Arrogant?

241
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,280
If it were you,

242
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
would you leave them alone?

243
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,560
Listen.

244
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,810
I’ve made up my mind.

245
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,960
When I finish them,

246
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,540
I’ll...

247
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,800
You’ll resign?

248
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,160
Jiang Jun,

249
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,320
I’ll not allow you

250
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,080
to risk your life for work.

251
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Go resign.

252
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,340
And we can get married after that.

253
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,720
I’m capable of taking care of you
for the rest of your life.

254
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,440
Why should I need you to take care of me
for the rest of my life?

255
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,600
I’m educated and capable.

256
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,960
I can feed myself.

257
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,540
And I’ve been doing that for all these years!

258
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,500
That’s not what I mean.

259
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,800
I just want to protect you.

260
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,170
Here we go again.

261
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,760
You’ve always used the excuse of protecting me

262
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
to do what you want

263
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,280
since childhood.

264
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,040
But I’ve already grown up.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I can negotiate with you,

266
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,640
no matter it’s for the resignation
or the marriage.

267
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,970
But I cannot be ordered.

268
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,820
Yuan Shuai,

269
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,080
I have my own life.

270
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,370
I have my responsibilities and plans.

271
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,480
I hope you can respect me.

272
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Now I need to work.

273
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,570
Respect you?

274
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,400
Good.

275
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,500
From now on,

276
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,050
you can do whatever you want

277
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,600
and I’ll leave you alone.

278
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,060
Now you rather sleep outside.

279
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,440
How can you work if you get ill?

280
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,160
A double-faced man!

281
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,160
[Chen Yicheng]

282
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,320
Mr. Du has a meeting this morning.

283
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,050
It will be over around 12:00 pm.

284
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,600
♫ When the sun rises up ♫

285
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,360
♫ Rub your eyes ♫

286
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
♫ The unpredictable one ♫

287
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,520
♫ Is ourselves ♫

288
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,000
♫ Although I’m sad ♫

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,360
♫ I have to believe myself ♫

290
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
♫ Think about the ones ♫

291
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,840
♫ Who love you ♫

292
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,880
♫ You’re not alone ♫

293
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,800
♫ The past ♫

294
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,920
♫ Is still in my heart ♫

295
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,840
♫ Every moment ♫

296
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,080
♫ Is the evidence of my growth ♫

297
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,160
♫ I realized it later ♫

298
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,800
♫ What I’ve been pursuing is freedom ♫

299
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,160
♫ Yes, I know ♫

300
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,960
The show’s over.

301
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,520
Go back to work!

302
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,280
Qiao,

303
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,080
look at these.

304
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,160
I picked them on the farm myself.

305
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,000
Each flower represents

306
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,880
“I think about you”.

307
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,720
Do you like it?

308
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,480
It seems that this “I think about you” has a short life.

309
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,360
You turn my house into a flower shop,

310
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,320
and now you’re turning my company
into a flower shop.

311
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,280
Don’t you think it’s annoying?

312
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,400
No, I don’t!

313
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,440
But I do.

314
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,360
Security!

315
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,740
What’re you doing?

316
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,960
Please.

317
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,820
What’re you doing?

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,920
I won’t give up on you!

319
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,380
I’ll keep waiting for you!

320
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,520
You can only be my woman!

321
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,680
I will wait till the end

322
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,280
with my love for you!

323
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,920
You can only be my girl!

324
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,120
It’s the first time

325
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,570
seeing Ms. Qiao blush for all these years.

326
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,400
It seems you’ve fully recovered.

327
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560
You look good.

328
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,840
Don’t fake it. I already knew.

329
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,880
Well,

330
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,770
perhaps you should say yes.

331
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,610
You’ve been alone for too long.

332
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,920
A woman will wither

333
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,240
without love.

334
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,600
Hey,

335
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,320
don’t be spoiled by Yuan Shuai,

336
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,280
or you’ll become a fatty woman.

337
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,400
By the way,

338
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,800
I’ve checked the SKL case.

339
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,440
Their raw data are only known to a few people

340
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,320
above the vice president level.

341
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,520
So, Xiang Ding and Shen Xin
must’ve been wronged.

342
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,520
But...

343
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,000
I know what you mean.

344
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,640
I’m going to see him.

345
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,440
I heard a few days ago that

346
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
Manager Shen and Manager Xiang

347
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
had a hard time finding a job lately.

348
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,920
Leaking in the industry is a taboo after all.

349
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,560
Although they worked in
the top investment bank,

350
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,800
they can hardly shake off the taint.

351
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,200
No one dares to hire them.

352
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,280
They seem...

353
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Don’t you have any work to do?

354
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,290
-Ms. Jiang.
-Ms. Jiang.

355
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,380
I don’t want to hear conversations
like this again.

356
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,320
Okay, I gotta go.

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,520
Come in.

358
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:53,840
Mr. Du.

359
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,040
Didn’t I tell you to take a rest at home?

360
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,300
Why are you here again?

361
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,160
I want to talk about Shen Xin
and Xiang Ding with you again.

362
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,620
I compared the leaked data

363
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
last night.

364
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I found they didn’t leak them at all.

365
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,810
They have no motives to do that.

366
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,100
Have a seat.

367
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,880
Since you want to know it so much,

368
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,210
I won’t hide it from you.

369
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,080
Actually,

370
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,920
the chairman of SKL is

371
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
the classmate of our senior manager in college.

372
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,330
And they are very close.

373
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,080
So, the senior manager is very angry

374
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,320
when it happened,

375
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
blaming us for cold-shouldering SKL’s people.

376
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,640
I’d been pressured a lot

377
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,920
and was told to find the people

378
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,680
to take the blame.

379
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,400
I had no other choice.

380
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,200
But I’m the one who’s in charge of it.

381
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I should be held accountable.

382
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
How can they be the scapegoat for me?

383
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:53,880
Jiang Jun,

384
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
there’s one thing I hope you can understand,

385
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,800
which is that losses should be stopped in time.

386
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,530
What’s more,

387
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,600
you were on a leave
when the information’s leaked.

388
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,200
They’re far from being the scapegoats for you.

389
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,760
What about them?

390
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,320
The rumor of the gross negligence

391
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,580
will have a huge impact

392
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,760
on their job-hunting in the future.

393
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,880
And we don’t even know about the truth.

394
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,480
If the source of the leak cannot be found,

395
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,880
this kind of thing will happen again

396
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,800
or even a third…

397
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,980
What’s wrong with you?

398
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,680
To get them to accept the new price,

399
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,530
I drank too much yesterday.

400
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,320
Did they accept it?

401
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,260
Although the process is a bit difficult,

402
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,400
they accepted in the end.

403
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,840
Jiang Jun,

404
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,720
I know you’re not satisfied with

405
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
the way I dealt with it this time.

406
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,600
If no one had come out in time

407
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,800
to take the responsibility,

408
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,520
it would have been impossible for customers
to give up on us.

409
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,560
And I’ve tried to extend the time
to investigate the truth,

410
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,080
but there are too many possibilities.

411
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,480
There is no way to confirm it in a short time.

412
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
If I hadn’t done anything but gained time,

413
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
the situation would’ve been worse.

414
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,040
At that time,

415
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Shen Xin would have faced a graver charge

416
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,640
and been expelled from investment banking.

417
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,960
Do you want to see that?

418
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,240
I was trying to protect her

419
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,800
and you as well.

420
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,400
Can we get over it and move on?

421
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,200
Are you feeling so bad?

422
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
Do you have any medicine? Let me get it for you.

423
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,460
It’s in the drawer, thank you.

424
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,240
In the stories where women woo men,

425
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,040
men just want to taste the freshness at first.

426
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,160
The woman in the story is just a naive fool.

427
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,120
When they live together for a long time,

428
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,320
she will fail to give freshness to the man.

429
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,360
The man will fall in love with others easily.

430
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,320
I agree.

431
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,440
The perfect marriage from love at first sight?

432
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,080
The relationship of two people
with such a big difference

433
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,010
won’t last long.

434
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,610
They’ll get a divorce soon.

435
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,880
You will get a divorce!

436
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Your whole family will have a divorce.

437
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,440
They love each other so much.

438
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
If you don’t believe in love,

439
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,720
stop reading romantic novels.

440
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,160
See you in my blacklist. Goodbye.

441
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,000
And the day after tomorrow is
their wedding anniversary.

442
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,840
Just be jealous, you catty girls.

443
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,520
Goodbye!

444
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,610
It pisses  me off.

445
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:41,660
[West World]

446
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,240
What’s wrong?

447
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,480
Honey.

448
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,280
Come here.

449
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,520
What’s wrong?

450
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,160
I don’t think

451
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,600
you paid any attention to me.

452
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,320
I was there in front you for a while.

453
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,420
And you ignored me.

454
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,600
No.

455
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,840
You did.

456
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,220
I’m launching an online activity recently.

457
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,480
So, I’m pretty busy.

458
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,240
I will stay by your side after I’m done.

459
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:32,720
Okay?

460
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,360
What kind of activity?

461
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,480
You never told me.

462
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,680
I’m launching

463
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,120
a new activity named

464
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,720
“72 hours’ fresh love”.

465
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,840
Why do you use 72 hours?

466
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,840
Have you ever heard about Titanic Limit in Love?

467
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,820
But you must’ve watched the film, right?

468
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,600
There are two main roles in the film,

469
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
Jack and Rose.

470
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,200
The reason why their love story is so moving

471
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,600
is that they met, fell in love
with each other,

472
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,880
and experienced life and death

473
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,880
in just three days.

474
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,280
That’s the reason.

475
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,060
Think about it.

476
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,560
If both of them had got off the boat safely

477
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,540
and none of them had experienced the shipwreck,

478
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,480
they would have to accept the tests

479
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,280
of family, time

480
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,440
and class distinction.

481
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,400
Then that wouldn’t have been so moving.

482
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,360
So, I want to say

483
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,000
love can only

484
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,600
create a temporary chemical reaction

485
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,730
in a specific period

486
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
or specific space.

487
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,920
So, you mean,

488
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,720
our love has surpassed

489
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,100
the freshness period of 72 hours, right?

490
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,640
Actually,

491
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
you don’t love me that much anymore, right?

492
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,960
That’s not what I mean.

493
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,520
Among all the human relationships,

494
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,480
romantic relationship

495
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,920
has a lower level of stability.

496
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,480
What’s the point of obsessing
over the existence of love?

497
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,040
I just want to prove that

498
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
the matching rate

499
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,600
matters a lot

500
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
through this activity.

501
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,480
You see...

502
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,560
-... If two people want to be together...
-Stop it.

503
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,520
I got it.

504
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,920
I’m less attractive

505
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,000
to you now.

506
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,080
What’s wrong?

507
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,400
I’m leaving this house!

508
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,760
Don’t stop me!

509
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,400
That’s not what I mean.

510
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,520
I don’t want to hear it!

511
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,210
I’m almost done.

512
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,080
Wait for me.

513
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,000
Wait for a moment.

514
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,360

515
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,120
I’m really sad.

516
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,410
I’m really leaving?

517
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,050
I’m leaving?

518
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,320
I’m leaving!

519
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,840
I’ll leave this house!

520
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,480
But

521
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,720
it’s pretty cold outside.

522
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,680
Put on a coat if you want to go out.

523
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I’ll go out soon.

524
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,040
Remember to bring your keys.

525
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,120
Li Xiaochuan,

526
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,020
I’m telling you

527
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,440
I will leave for real!

528
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,800

Sir, where are you going?

537
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,020
I’m pretty quick, huh?

538

[MD Yuan Shuai]

539
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,160
Boss,

540
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,320
I just checked with my best drinking buddy.

541
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,600
SKL’s chairman was extremely angry about

542
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,800
the price leak.

543
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,800
But he said that the one in charge
would not be fired

544
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,600
as long as the problem is solved,

545
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,800
considering that he’s the classmate

546
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,760
of the senior manager of MH.

547
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,040
Are you sure?

548
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,960
Of course.

549
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,160
He is a trusted secretary.

550
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,200
It’s true

551
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,880
as long as it’s from his mouth.

552
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,480
So, no one had to be fired.

553
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
But why did Du Lei ask them to resign?

554
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,520
There are only two possibilities.

555
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,280
Either the information was leaked by him...

556
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,160
Or Shen Xin and Xiang Ding

557
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,840
had to be dismissed

558
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,690
for knowing his secret.

559
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,120
Anyway, this is not that simple.

560

I’ll think about it.

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
Go home early.

564
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,520
I have something to tell you.

565
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,280
Why do I have to

566
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,520
mind others’ business?

567
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,130
I’m the one who got the clue.

568
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,170
I won’t tell you if you don’t beg me!

569
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,680
[Yuan Shuai]

570
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,680
I’ve got some information about SKL.

571
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,040
Do you want to hear it?

572
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,380
Tell me!

573
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,640
Beg me!

574
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,600
Forget it!

575
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,240
I’m begging you. Please tell me!

576
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,160
Begging? Have some backbone!

577
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
Come to me now!

578
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,160
Hello.

579
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,140
May I use your phone to make a call?

580
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,290
Sorry, it’s not a good time.

581
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,160
Thank you.

582
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,440
Hello, lad.

583
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,120
May I have a moment?

584
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,570
For what?

585
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,760
May I use your phone to make a call?

586
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,440
Ma’am.

587
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,960
Are you hitting on me?

588
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,530
It’s out of date now.

589
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Ma’am?

590
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,480
I...

591
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,840
What?

592
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,520
Alright...

593
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,720
Kid, can you lend your phone

594
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,080
to Ma’am?

595
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,120
Fine.

596
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,200
Here it is.

597
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,760
Hello?

598
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,680
Hello, Jun.

599
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,640
It’s me.

600
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,200
Did you change your phone number?

601
00:33:59,200 --> 00:33:59,760
No.

602
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,240
I’m using the phone

603
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,450
of the boy beside me.

604
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,480
What’s wrong?

605
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,480
-I ran away from home.
-♫ I still want to act on impulse ♫

606
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,630
It’s so noisy over there.

607
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,070
I can’t hear you clearly.

608
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,190
I said I was about to run away from home.

609
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,400
I have to rely on you from now.

610
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,630
Li,

611
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,520
I’ve got something to do.

612
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,050
You can go to my house first.

613
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,790
I gotta go.

614
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,889
Go to your house?

615
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,179
That’s like exposing myself.

616
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,840
Here you are, buddy.

617
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Finished?

618
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,440
Thank you.

619
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,080
I didn’t expect you would

620
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,000
run away from home at this age.

621
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,600
Who said I ran away from home?

622
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,400
I...

623
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,320
I’m just here to see the flowers.

624
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,920
Then go on.

625
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,800
Can I ask you

626
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,900
why you’re always looking at the sky?

627
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,960
I’m looking at my love

628
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,620
instead of the sky.

629
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,520
I see.

630
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,900
It turned out to be a love that
you look up at ninety degrees.

631
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,800
Fine.

632
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
We’re similar.

633
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,640
Let’s get drunk.

634
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,560
It’s my treat.

635
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,640
How about it?

636
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,240
Good.

637
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,240
I didn’t expect you to be
such a determined person.

638
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,640
Your love story is so bumpy

639
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
unexpectedly.

640
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,120
Some people are born to have a shiny life.

641
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,040
But for us?

642
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,780
We’re bound to be the ones
who chase after the light.

643
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,640
It’s so tough.

644
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,360
But

645
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,010
at least you turned him into your husband.

646
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,960
Unlike me,

647
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,000
I’ve been after my goddess for two years.

648
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,520
She still ignores me.

649
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,240
You’re my role model.

650
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800
What role model?

651
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,890
The one who fell in love first is me.

652
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,690
The one who confessed is me.

653
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,570
The one who proposed is also me.

654
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,200
And I’m even the one who wants a baby!

655
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,120
I...

656
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,680
The day after tomorrow will
be our wedding anniversary.

657
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:53,840
He...

658
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
He even told me

659
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,770
our love has surpassed the freshness period.

660
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,720
Enough.

661
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,760
We’re on the same boat.

662
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,360
Cheers.

663
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,560
Cheers.

664
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,320
Screw the freshness period!

665
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,240
Yeah, screw her ignorance!

666
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,680
Cheers!

667
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,200
Cheers!

668
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,280
Do you want

669
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,600
to hear the song I wrote for my goddess?

670
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,400
Yeah.

671
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,680
What do you think?

672
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,440
So great!

673
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:28,360
But

674
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,840
I think you can modify your lyrics.

675
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,800
Your goddess will become tearful

676
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,080
if you change it.

677
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,900
You like it?

678
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,120
I

679
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,480
can teach you guitar.

680
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,160
And you

681
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,410
write lyrics for me.

682
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,040
Good.

683
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,320
Cheers!

684
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,300
Cheers!

685
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,420
Let’s get started, Teacher.

686
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,680
[West World]

687
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,280
Li.

688
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,480
I’m back.

689
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,840
Li.

690
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,960
Li!

691
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,240
Should I put my fingers here?

692
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,570
This string.

693
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,960
-And then pluck this string.
-This one?

694
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,690
This one.

695
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,880
No.

696
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,800
Look, it’s like this.

697
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,690
Let go of her!

698
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,760
It’s my husband’s voice.

699
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,760
Why is he here?

700
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,320
It’s over!

701
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,160
Hurry, hide this now!

702
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
Xiaochuan, listen to me!

703
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,360
It’s not like that.

704
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,020
Who are you?

705
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760
Why did you touch my wife?

706
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,520
He...

707
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,020
This...

708
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,760
He’s a fan of my books.

709
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,200
A fan?

710
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,760
Did you forget that I collected
the data for you?

711
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,360
Among the 108 fans of your books,

712
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,490
there are no male fans in any age group!

713
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,160
He... He’s not my fan.

714
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,040
He...

715
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
He’s my pursuer.

716
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,920
Yeah.

717
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,880
I’m pursuing Li crazily.

718
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,280
Listen.

719
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,120
I’m her husband.

720
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,560
She

721
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,400
is my wife.

722
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,280
Stay away from her.

723
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,740
Or I’ll beat you up whenever I see you.

724
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:03,880
Let’s go.

725
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,290
Be nicer to her then.

726
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,660
You heard that?

727
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,040
It’s time you told me.

728
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,900
What’s your attitude?

729
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,280
What’s wrong with my attitude?

730
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,000
What’s the attitude you should use
when asking for a favor?

731
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,060
I don’t need to teach you that, right?

732
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,000
Please tell me anything you found, okay?

733
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,200
Okay.

734
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,180
What I heard is that

735
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,960
SKL’s chairman did not demand that

736
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,880
MH should fire the one in charge.

737
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,720
So, your conclusion is...

738
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,040
My conclusion is that

739
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,600
Du Lei has a reason

740
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,040
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

741
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,080
when he knew

742
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,010
there’s a better solution.

743
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
I suspect that

744
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,880
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

745
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,960
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

746
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,160
So, they had to leave.

747
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,080
But Du Lei told me

748
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,280
SKL demanded to assign blame.

749
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,570
And what he did was to protect Shen Xin.

750
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,280
Besides,

751
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,360
he spent a lot of mind

752
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,380
to make them accept the new price.

753
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,170
What do you mean?

754
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,360
Are you saying that you trust Du Lei
instead of me?

755
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,960
That’s not what I mean.

756
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
It’s because he helped me a lot.

757
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,460
He helped you a lot?

758
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,420
Do you think why he helped you?

759
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,760
Because he likes you!

760
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,500
Love Is Sweet
