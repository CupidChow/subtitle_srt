Love Is Sweet

Love Is Sweet

Episode 6

5
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,880
You still haven’t answered my question.

6
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Why did you steal my love letter?

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,759
Surely because your dad

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,920
paid me for it.

9
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,320
There was no doubt

10
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
that the man wouldn’t

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,920
accept you.

12
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,039
We’d rather stop

13
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,400
your imagination

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,759
than seeing you cry your head off

15
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,040
after being rejected.

16
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,240
Well.

17
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Now

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,240
you’ve received my apology.

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
Then I won’t be softhearted

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
in work from now on.

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,000
I don’t need you to do so.

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,080
Now I

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
have a very great teacher

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,440
to be my backup.

25
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,000
I won’t be afraid of any of your tricks.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,880
Teacher?

27
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,079
A promising young man

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,020
of great ideas working in the investment industry.

29
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
Experts in the investment industry

30
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,480
won't help people like you.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,480
People who have enough time to help others

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,610
are all green hands.

33
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,880
Not everyone is so eager for quick success
and instant benefits like you.

34
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,240
He aims for the highest and means to keep normal.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,840
OK?

36
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,640
Have you finished?

37
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,240
Yeah.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,410
Hey. You.

39
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,760
What a shame to be so wasteful!

40
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
Wait for me.

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,120
Wait.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,440
Angry again. Baffling.

43
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,940
What’s the matter?

44
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,560
The cooker should be good for soup cooking.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,840
Buy one.

46
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
Why do we have to pay for it

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,420
while there is special offer?

48
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,340
[Nostalgic Photos Experiencing
Top 20 couples will gain an electric cooker for free.]

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,280
Will you take part in the offer for a cooker?

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Of course.

51
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,240
Don’t you think the white fits me very well?

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
Modest, luxury, educated,

53
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,640
and of high grade.

54
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
I don’t feel that.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,640
I can buy one for you

56
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
if you like it.

57
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,250
You just asked me

58
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,890
about the second part for thanking me, right?

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,340
Welcome to come again.

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,120
Hello. Welcome.

61
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,700
Are you here for the nostalgic activity?

62
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,520
Yes.

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,440
Look,

64
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,000
according to our activity rules,

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,800
I need to confirm whether you two

66
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
are lovers or not.

67
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,560
-No.
-Yes.

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,760
Yes.

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,720
That’ll be OK.

70
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
This way, please.

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,200
Your water. Please enjoy.

72
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,810
-OK. Thank you.
-Thank you.

73
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,360
The interface

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
is much more advanced than that before.

75
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,200
We didn’t have so many templates before.

76
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,320
Retro style and keeping up with the times
are not in conflict.

77
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,520
Understand it or not?

78
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,280
Pose.

79
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,400
Not trendy.

80
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,380
Let go of me.

81
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,800
You are so childish.

82
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
How can you pull my hair while taking a picture?

83
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Take another one.

84
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,640
It looks great.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,160
Your pose was really old-fashioned.

86
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,360
Are you dissatisfied with my help?

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,530
Looks great!

88
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,130
Hmm. It’s great!

89
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Excuse me!

90
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Finished?

91
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,040
Sir, I’m sorry.

92
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Your photos

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,220
don't meet the requirements.

94
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
Why?

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,640
Here is the thing.

96
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,360
It’s a couple theme.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,080
We hope you can show your relationship

98
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,480
in the photos.

99
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,760
But look at it.

100
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,120
It’s not close at all.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,040
The…

102
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,200
How about

103
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,610
taking another set?

104
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,200
Look. This one. This one.

105
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,050
And this one.

106
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
They are all OK.

107
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,570
Forget it. Let’s go.

108
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,800
Come back.

109
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,760
See it?

110
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
What is it?

111
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,880
Let’s take another set.

112
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
No, I won’t

113
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
It’s an order from your boss.

114
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,570
It’ll be counted in the KPI.

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Afraid?

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah.

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Let’s take it.

118
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
A heart.

119
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,840
So fashion.

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,020
You even know this.

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,860
It’s because you are old-fashioned.

122
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
No perfect cooperation.

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,760
One more time.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,600
Cooperate.

125
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,690
Did you do it on purpose?

126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
You did it on purpose.

127
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,320
Let’s stop taking it.

128
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,440
Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

129
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,040
It means the cooker doesn’t belong to you.

130
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,600
Let’s go.

131
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,760
Come back.

132
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,200
Sir.

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,880
Cost for maintenance and the machine

134
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,960
is 23,700 yuan.

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,130
This is the invoice.

136
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,320
OK.

137
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,920
Miss. Your photos.

138
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,280
Thank you.

139
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Don’t try to take my photos away.

140
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,040
I am the one wanted to join this,

141
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,480
so the photos should be mine.

142
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,080
It has nothing to do with you.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,930
This is your gift. Here you are.

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,320
Hers. Shine it on her.

145
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,000
No.

146
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,130
Give it to him. He wanted to join in on this.

147
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
The cooker is useful for you.

148
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Shine it down her.

149
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,120
I…

150
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,200
Thank…

151
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,480
Thank you.

152
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,200
Miss Jiang.

153
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,000
I’ve felt your sincere apology.

154
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Let’s go home now.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,840
-This…
-I knew it.

156
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,320
This way.

157
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,360
Way…

158
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,770
I can’t finish my words all the time today.

159
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,150
Wealth.

160
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,010
Go away.

161
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:38,980
Go away!

162
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,520
You…

163
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,659
You little monkey.

164
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,240
Look,

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
I will cut your claws

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
if you ruin the photos.

167
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,680
Am I clear?

168
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,340
Yuan Shuai, why did you bring me here?

169
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,200
Take photos.

170
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,400
I don’t want to.

171
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,210
I’m leaving.

172
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,000
Come back.

173
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,760
It’s just one place drop in test.

174
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,620
You don’t need to be so gloomy.

175
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,040
You may be blue

176
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,080
in the future

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,770
with such weak psychological endurance.

178
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Come on.

179
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,880
I will count down from 3 to 1.

180
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,810
Smile together.

181
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Let’s go.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Three, two, one.

183
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,640
Look,

184
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,290
you smiled halfheartedly.

185
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,290
Smile again.

186
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
-Come on.
-I don’t wanna take it.

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Come back.

188
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,840
Come back.

189
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
-What’s it?
-Come. One. Two. Three.

190
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,040
You…

191
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,560
Delete.

192
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:10,880
No.

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,440
Delete.

194
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,400
It looks great. Don’t delete it.

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:12,860
Delete.

196
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,680
No, don’t delete.

197
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,400
Delete.

198
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,260
What are you doing?

199
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Get out.

200
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,520
Boss, help me!

201
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,400
Mr. Su.

202
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,760
Mr. Su.

203
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,920
Come on. This cup of wine

204
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
is to thank you

205
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,040
for

206
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,330
your help last time.

207
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,410
I’d drain it.

208
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,360
I’d drain it.

209
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,200
Hey.

210
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,060
Mr. Su. Cheers.

211
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,720
Cheers.

212
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,680
A toast to you.

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,140
Cheers.

214
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,880
A toast to Mr. Su on behalf of our company?

215
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,900
Cheers.

216
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,560
Cheers.

217
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,440
Cheers.

218
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,080
Cheers.

219
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,240
To Mr. Su.

220
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,240
Seriously.

221
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,440
Mr. Yuan.

222
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,240
Mr. Yuan.

223
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,160
Mr. Yuan.

224
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,420
Mr. Yuan. Here you are.

225
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,800
Boss, I can’t drink more.

226
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,720
They drank a lot.

227
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Look, Mr. Yuan,

228
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,320
you are really late.

229
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,920
This is for you.

230
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,320
Don’t refuse this cup no matter how.

231
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.

232
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,640
Let’s talk about the old days.

233
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,800
One cup of it is not enough.

234
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
It’s not enough for our friendship.

235
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,400
Right?

236
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,960
Come on.

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,560
How about this?

238
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
I’ll drink one for being late.

239
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,000
OK?

240
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,000
OK.

241
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,000
OK. Cheers.

242
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,360
Count me in.

243
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,640
Cheers.

244
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,920
Please sit down.

245
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,380
Please sit down. Mr. Yuan.

246
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,840
Come on. Let’s drink.

247
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
Fill the cup.

248
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,960
Thank you.

249
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,720
It’s not enough for you.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,720
See you.

251
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Be careful.

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,240
Boss.

253
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,640
You really can drink a lot.

254
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,600
They are all badly drunk.

255
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,040
If you were not here,

256
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,700
I would be the one badly drunk.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Boss, anything bothering you?

258
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
No. I’m happy.

259
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Did you quarrel

260
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,520
with Jiang Jun?

261
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,800
So she is unfaithful now?

262
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,360
Doomsayer.

263
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,600
She has a teacher.

264
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,360
She told me today

265
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
that her teacher often gives her advice

266
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,720
about work.

267
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,440
Teacher?

268
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,880
Investment is not a large industry.

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,280
Did you find out who he is?

270
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,400
It must be some

271
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,440
swindler.

272
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,840
I’m not interested in that.

273
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Don’t you want me to find it out?

274
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Not necessary.

275
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,480
I’d see

276
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,880
how long he can deceive her.

277
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,920
You are having the wrong attitude.

278
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
You are living close.

279
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,000
Also, you are her boss.

280
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,760
But you declared

281
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,560
you would kick her out from MH.

282
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,960
In her mind,

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,660
you are now the natural enemy.

284
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,240
I want to kick her out because

285
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,080
I don’t think she’s suited to this industry.

286
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,040
But

287
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,760
this is my conclusion according to

288
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,650
my previous impression of her.

289
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,920
Seems you’ve changed your mind.

290
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,440
After staying with her for several times,

291
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,280
I believe

292
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,760
people and things are always changing.

293
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,000
It’s necessary for me to rediscover her.

294
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,440
My boss is admitting a fault.

295
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,160
Seems like, being jealous can make you wise.

296
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Great.

297
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,520
But don’t you think it’s late

298
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
to change now?

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,330
Her mysterious teacher

300
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,880
is trying to help her

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,240
every day.

302
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,240
But you are trying your best to kick her out.

303
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,560
Be cautious.

304
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,200
She may accept others instead.

305
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,720
You should take the strategy

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
of paying more attention

307
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,720
to her mind or thoughts.

308
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,880
Seems it’s hard to understand women’s mind.

309
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,280
Actually, it’s easy.

310
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,380
It just includes two aspects.

311
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,680
First is they can’t help loving cute things.

312
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,560
The other is it’s easy for them to be sympathetic.

313
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,480
They can’t help loving cute things.

314
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
Be sympathetic.

315
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,040
Wealth. Come here.

316
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,180
Come here. Wealth.

317
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,280
Training an army for a thousand days
to be used just an hour.

318
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,440
Now it’s your turn.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,730
Behave well.

320
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
Why are you here?

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Did you run out?

322
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
Come on. I’ll bring you back.

323
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,120
You are so heavy.

324
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,480
The door is open.

325
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,640
Go. You are too heavy.

326
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,300
What’s wrong with you?

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,320
I’m fine.

328
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,770
Maybe I caught cold last night.

329
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,220
Why didn’t you go to the hospital?

330
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,310
It’s so hot.

331
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,280
I will bring you to the hospital.

332
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,760
No, I don’t want to go.

333
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,349
I just need to take a break.

334
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,680
OK. Have a good rest.

335
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,400
I gotta go.

336
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,310
I feel so cold.

337
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,069
Hey.

338
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you sure you will not go to the hospital?

339
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
I want some water.

340
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Thank you.

341
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,930
I’m leaving.

342
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,480
What now?

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,720
I’m hungry.

344
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,890
What do you want?

345
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,600
Check the refrigerator.

346
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,600
Where is it?

347
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,560
You are usually so busy.

348
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,640
I don’t think there are too many things in it.

349
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,360
Over there.

350
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,090
What dishes do you want?

351
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
That’s simple.

352
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,120
Braised pork in brown sauce.

353
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,160
Sweet and sour fillet.

354
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,560
Braised beef with potato.

355
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
Three are enough

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
for meat dishes.

357
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,000
For vegetable dishes,

358
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,330
fried potato, green pepper and eggplant.

359
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,900
We got a cooker yesterday, right?

360
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,320
Make a pork stomach

361
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,680
and chicken.

362
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,740
That’s all.

363
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,360
You are not like a sick person

364
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,960
Since you have a good appetite,

365
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
how about…

366
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,640
I feel so ill.

367
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
I’m cold and hungry,

368
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,090
but nobody takes care of me.

369
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,680
How poor I am!

370
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,320
It’s 39 degrees.

371
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Is the food ready?

372
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,640
Soon.

373
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Hungry.

374
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,880
Have some.

375
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,200
What are you looking at?

376
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,130
A sick man can’t eat that oily food.

377
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,400
I cook the porridge the first time in my life.

378
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,160
Take it or not.

379
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
Order takeouts if not.

380
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,720
Come back.

381
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,120
The patient is limp and weak.

382
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,080
Feed me.

383
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,600
I…

384
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,600
I owed you.

385
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:20,960
Hot?

386
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,680
A bit light.

387
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
It’s good enough. Don’t be so fussy.

388
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Your sofa is comfortable to sit.

389
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,530
Is it heated?

390
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,480
Imported from Germany.

391
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,880
I just bought it last week.

392
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,940
Is it comfortable?

393
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Yes.

394
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,130
It’s nice to be rich.

[Du Lei]

396
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,800
Do you have some time today?

397
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,960
I’d teach you a unique way for pressure relief.

398
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
Not today.

399
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,610
How about tomorrow?

400
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
OK. See you tomorrow.

401
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,360
Can’t you keep your mind focused when taking care of a patient？

402
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,690
Concentrate your attention. Know or not?

403
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,360
OK?

404
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,800
Then please eat it quickly, OK?

405
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,330
I have something else to do.

406
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,520
The rest porridge is in the cooker
for heat preservation.

407
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,720
Eat at night.

408
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,880
Take it yourself.

409
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,540
I’ll get the medicine for you.

410
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,120
I want to read the book.

411
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,080
Get one for me.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,200
So fastidious.

413
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,280
Which one?

414
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,160
Second one on the left in the second row.

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,770
This one?

416
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,640
No.

417
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,900
The third one on the left in the third row.

418
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,280
This one?

419
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,010
Not that one.

420
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,960
It should be

421
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,280
on the left in the second row…

422
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,680
No.

423
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,640
The rightmost in the second row.

424
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,140
Why didn’t you just tell me the title?

425
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,090
This one?

426
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
Norwegian Wood?

427
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,280
That’s it.

428
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,840
I can’t imagine

429
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,040
you are also interested in reading

430
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,440
except the stock market.

431
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,800
The book is famous

432
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,720
because it’s extremely charming.

433
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,380
What a pity!

434
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,240
You can’t feel its charm.

435
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
Only the one with a Buddha in his mind
can see the Buddha.

436
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
You always call names without dirty words.

437
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,440
Yes.

438
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,760
Only profound people can understand its beauty.

439
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Read it diligently.

440
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,450
I’m leaving.

441
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,040
I can’t believe such a famous book

442
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
even makes you so shy.

443
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,560
Seems you still have deep-rooted bad habits

444
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,280
of shame-based culture.

445
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Be careful. Being stuffy may be bad for you.

446
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,200
Thank you for reminding.

447
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,130
I will try my best to be innovative.

448
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,680
Hey.

449
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,480
Why can’t you start it from today?

450
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,560
That’s why you can never be

451
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,040
one of the 20% population.

452
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,770
Understand?

453
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,000
Do you really think I haven’t read this book?

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,240
OK. Then tell me

455
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,120
if Naoko asked Watanabe

456
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,200
to stay with tears

457
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,850
on her twentieth birthday.

458
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,560
She was not asking him to stay.

459
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,040
She wanted to love Watanabe.

460
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,840
But she couldn’t let the past go.

461
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,440
So she was plunged into pain.

462
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,520
They actually

463
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,000
comforted each other.

464
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
It is undoubtedly

465
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
that she cried the whole night.

466
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,720
They didn’t comfort each other.

467
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,360
Watanabe comforted her all night.

468
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
Do you doubt my memory?

469
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,480
I supported Naoko’s body with my left hand,

470
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,280
touched her soft and straight hair with the right,

471
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,200
and waited for so long till she stopped crying.

472
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,120
But she just cried continually.

473
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,360
I slept with Naoko that night.

474
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,400
I didn’t know if it was right.

475
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,040
I still don’t know now, after 20 years.

476
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,120
Maybe I would never know.

477
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,480
I could only do so at that moment.

478
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,680
She was emotional and at a stand.

479
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,260
She wanted my comforting.

480
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,200
I closed…

481
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,250
What’s next?

482
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,400
It’s dawn.

483
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,560
-I touched…
-It’s not about dawn, right?

00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,680
The page you just turned.

485
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,410
It should have something else.

486
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,620
Are you sure you want to continue?

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
Of course.

488
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,280
Hey.

489
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,560
How can you stop the story in the middle?

490
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,240
What?

491
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,690
You don’t know the characters behind?

492
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,120
OK. I’m reading it. Listen carefully.

493
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,560
I turned off the lights,

494
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,200
pulled off her clothes slowly and gently,

495
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,040
also mine.

496
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,680
Then we hugged together.

497
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,280
That was a mild rainy night.

498
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,600
We were together, naked.

499
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,520
But we didn’t feel the chill.

500
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,320
Naoko and I fondled each other

501
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,120
in the dark.

502
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,880
I kissed her on the lips.

503
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,320
I helped her… In the dark.

504
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,680
Stop.

505
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,480
What a bad story!

506
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,440
I’m sick.

507
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,160
You may go back.

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,400
I’ll take a rest.

509
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,440
OK.

510
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,320
Have a good rest.

511
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,520
Take care of yourself. Don’t work too hard.

512
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,980
Take the medicine on time.

513
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,810
I’m leaving now.

514
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,520
See you, little cutie.

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,580

where we may never go to.

521
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,770
But it’s always been there.

522
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,360
All the time.

524

Those who have met will meet each other again.

He really looks good in all aspects.

531
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,640
Still that talented.

I’ve compensated you so many sanitary pads.

could you bring it to me?

I can’t.

00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,360
at just the right angle.

576
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,720
It’ll be too shiny if it has more.

577
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,520
It’ll be dark if it has less.

578
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,720
Excuse me.

579
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,120
Would you try some?

580
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
I’ve been working here for five hours.

581
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
You have offered milk tea three times,

582
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,600
and food twice.

583
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
I didn’t give attention to it.

584
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
But inevitably it reduced my work efficiency

585
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,720
a little.

586
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,920
Please don’t do it again.

587
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,320
The…

588
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,760
The…

589
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,160
The…

590
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,040
I meant to thank you for helping me

591
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,780
catch the thief a few days ago.

592
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,760
And I want to add you a friend on WeChat.

593
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,920
Will it be OK or not?

594
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,520
Moreover,

595
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,160
what do you do?

596
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,100
This is what I’m doing?

597
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,280
I see it.

598
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,370
This is an electronic photo album.

599
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,760
I’m designing a dating site.

600
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,320
My final aim

601
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,600
is to make a one-button blind dating site

602
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,840
with big data.

603
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,120
What you are seeing

604
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,840
is something initial.

605
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,130
Many things need to be adjusted later.

606
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,640
There are many single males and females now.

607
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,770
The market is promising for this idea.

608
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,010
You really think so?

609
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,440
OK.

610
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,600
I’d treat you a meal.

611
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,860
Would you do me a favor?

612
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,680
OK.

613
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,740
[Li Xiaochuan]

614
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,000
Li Xiaochuan.

615
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,760
What do you need me to do?

616
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,440
Let’s contact on WeChat.

617
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
OK.

618
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,000
I thought it’s the wrong place.

619
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,200
I can’t believe it’s really this place.

620
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,000
Thank you.

621
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,080
Will we eat here today?

622
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,440
The chef of this restaurant

623
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,680
is bewitching.

624
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,000
He’s very skillful.

625
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,240
Please enjoy.

626
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:30,960
Thank you.

627
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,360
I researched the recipe of this dessert.

628
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:34,880
Try it.

629
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,880
Really?

630
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,060
Light and not greasy. Delicious.

631
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
It’s great since you like it.

632
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
The cake tastes nice.

633
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Wanna know why?

634
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I’ll take you to a place after the meal.

635
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
So mysterious?

636
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,420
What is this place?

637
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,730
Fragrance chamber.

638
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,630
Scent helps people release their mood.

639
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,800
I thought you were under great pressure

640
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,760
some time ago,

641
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,570
so I took you here for relaxing.

642
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
So much wine.

643
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,560
For fragrance

644
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,710
Can the wine be used for fragrance?

645
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,190
Sure.

646
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,230
Alcohol

647
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,600
can remain the fragrance very well.

648
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,440
Mixing the essence from plants

649
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,880
and animals with the wine

650
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,210
can keep the fragrance.

651
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Give me your hand.

652
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
What a unique fragrance!

653
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,560
Perfume

654
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,400
can't be used just for expressing desire
and feelings.

655
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,520
This perfume I made

656
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,440
contains my favorite lily, bergamot,

657
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,770
and Hungary noble wine.

658
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,200
It feels like being clear,

659
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,800
pure and kind.

660
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,370
I made it according to my first impression on you.

661
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,610
It’s for you.

662
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,880
It’s the first time someone making perfume for me.

663
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,440
Take it as a gift to you at the first meeting.

664
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,330
Thank you, teacher.

665
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Is the case of Kelang solved?

666
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
Thanks to your help.

667
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,360
It’s all settled.

668
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,370
That’s good.

669
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,210
Sit down.

670
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,080
You can try to

671
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,120
make it.

672
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,960
Maybe

673
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,400
there will be a surprise.

674
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,040
Nice.

675
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,580
You are even dating other men.

676
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,370
Seems you are more capable now.

677
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,400
Come on. Let’s go.

678
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,440
Come.

679
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,100
What’s wrong, Wealth?

680
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,480
Tired?

681
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,900
Jiang Jun, how dare you

682
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
still not back at this late hour?

683
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,440
You are too bold now.

684
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:30,880
How is it?

685
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,480
Have an idea about the name for the perfume?

686
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,120
It’s like the lily fragrance.

687
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,720
Let’s call it lily perfume.

688
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,880
Lily perfume.

689
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,780
It’s well-suited.

690
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,440
Thank you so much for today’s help.

691
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,880
The perfume class is really great.

692
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,480
I finally got a chance to experience

693
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,080
the life for a delicate girl.

694
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:54,960
If you like it,

695
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,440
we can go more often.

696
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,080
Anyway, perfume

697
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,840
can help people to calm.

698
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,840
It really can relieve the pressure.

699
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,300
Teacher, you know well about being in peace.

700
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
About pressure relief,

701
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,900
racing is also a great choice.

702
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,840
Racing?

703
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,650
That doesn’t seem like your style.

704
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
You can’t just see one aspect of people.

705
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,560
I will take you to experience it

706
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,480
when we get a chance.

707
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
It’s a kind of pressure relieving way

708
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,680
by being out of constriction of time and space.

709
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,040
Personally, I like it very much.

710
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,640
I guess you will like it, too.

711
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,840
OK. Anytime is OK.

712
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,760
It’s a deal.

713
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,640
Thank you.

714
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,800
By the way, Mr. Du.

715
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,880
This is a gift for you.

716
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,200
Hope you will like it.

717
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,640
Seems I need to buy a new suit

718
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,680
for it.

719
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,720
Is this the mysterious teacher you mentioned?

720
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,400
Do you know each other?

721
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,240
-No.
-No.

722
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,560
Anyway,

723
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,960
I have to thank you

724
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,640
for teaching my staff.

725
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,080
A piece of cake.

726
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,840
Why are you thanking him?

727
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,210
Jiang Jun, thank you for your gift.

728
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,340
I like it very much.

729
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,680
When did the CEO of GE

730
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,360
learn such a dirty trick?

731
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:15,960
What do you mean?

732
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,520
I don’t understand.

733
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,280
You are thinking of some dirty tricks

734
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,440
to seduce the new member of the rival company

735
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,880
when all tricks have been exhausted in work.

736
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,610
Do you think you can win a round?

737
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,080
You're too naive.

738
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,090
Yuan Shuai, don’t speak like that.

739
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,080
It’s OK.

740
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,440
Mr. Yuan

741
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
may misunderstand me.

742
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,120
I warn you.

743
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,660
Don’t try to get any bad ideas.

744
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,600
Otherwise,

745
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,360
you will be defeated even worse.

746
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,360
OK.

747
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I’ll wait and see.

748
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,260
Love Is Sweet
