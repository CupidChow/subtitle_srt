Love Is Sweet

Episode 34

5
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,280
Why do you think why he helped you?

6
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,479
Because he likes you!

7
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,250
What are you talking about?

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,960
He’s my teacher.

9
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,680
Do you really think he treats you

10
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
as his student or friend?

11
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,440
He has always liked you!

12
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,760
He hasn’t told me that all these years.

13
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
And you didn’t tell me after you knew it.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,000
That’s because I had faith in you.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,840
But now I regret it.

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,960
I made a stupid mistake

17
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,000
that I kept you at MH.

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,960
It seems anything can come out from your mouth

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
to try to get me to resign.

20
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
I don’t want to explain anymore.

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,920
Jiang Jun,

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,000
what’s with the attitude?

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,960
That’s how I am!

24
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,900
I’m doing it for your own good.

25
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,260
[Jia Yuanji]

26
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,980
Qiao, did you get off work?

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,620
What do you want to eat?

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
I’ll buy anything for you.

29
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
Roast goose, steak, poached pork slices,

30
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,610
sweet and sour fish, ginseng chicken soup,
fried chicken or barbecue?

31
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,700
Qiao, you finished your work?

32
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,420
Why are you sleeping here?

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
You didn’t allow me to meet you in the company.

34
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,290
And you didn’t text me back.

35
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,930
I had no way but to wait here.

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,400
I fell asleep while waiting for you.

37
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,480
Are you a fool?

38
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,560
Can’t you call me?

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,160
What’s with the face?

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,530
Did you have a fight?

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Qiao Qiao,

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
are you caring about me?

43
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Actually,

44
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,320
I got this

45
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,010
from doing boldly what is righteous.

46
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
This is the witness of a man’s growth.

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,770
It hurts!

48
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,409
Can you blow on my wound?

49
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Do you want a

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
symmetrical wound?

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,000
And

52
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,880
don’t you need to work?

53
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
Are you idling around

54
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,159
because you’re the successor of GE?

55
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,760
Qiao,

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,520
you wronged me.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,480
I finished my work in advance.

58
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,960
My brother granted me a leave
to pursue my wife-to-be.

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
In order to keep up with you,

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,040
I’ve studied Chinese,

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,400
finance and jurisprudence

62
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,280
so hard in these two years.

63
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
I’m serious.

64
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
Well,

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,280
hang in there.

66
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Qiao, do you mean

67
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,610
I can pursue you now?

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,560
I

69
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,880
did not say that.

70
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,900
Oh, are you hungry?

71
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,040
Do you want to eat anything?

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
You didn’t tell me what you want to eat

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,080
when I asked you.

74
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,760
So, I bought different kinds of

75
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,720
food randomly for you.

76
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,320
I don’t know if you like them.

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,000
I never eat take-outs.

78
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,880
Let’s go.

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,940
I’ll take you out to midnight snacks.

80
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
It smells good.

81
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,400
Look at this.

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,320
Look at the colors.

83
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,580
Which dish should I eat first?

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,140
Let me try out the beef.

85
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,040
It’s so tasty.

86
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,000
My gosh!

87
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,440
Oh my!

88
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,360
I admire my cooking skills so much.

89
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,940
It smells so good, seriously.

90
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,160
Tastes great.

91
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,080
Delicious!

92
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,080
Why is my stomach aching so much?

93
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,690
My stomach aches! Ouch!

94
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
I thought Miss Jiang was going to

95
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
sleep on the sofa tonight.

96
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,380
So you do like to sleep on the bed, huh?

97
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,440
Why do I have to sleep on the sofa?

98
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,560
This is my bed.

99
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,680
And this is my quilt.

100
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,980
Move over a little bit!

101
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,539
What’re you doing?

102
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,960
This is the border between us now.

103
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,130
We will sleep like this from now on.

104
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,669
If you cross that line, you’re dead!

105
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,040
Jiang Jun,

106
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,180
I won’t cross it even if you tell me to.

107
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,690
What if you cross it?

108
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,240
I’ll sleep with Wealth if I cross the line.

109
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,160
Any one who crosses the line will be a pig.

110
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,480
A man of his word!

111
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,600
You’re being serious, Jiang Jun?

112
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
You use the quilt

113
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,960
while you just give me a blanket.

114
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,560
You

115
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,480
are so cruel.

116
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,440
I want the quilt, too.

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,780
What’re you doing?

118
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Give it back to me!

119
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,080
Give it back to me!

120
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,520
I have to use the quilt.

121
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I have to use the…

122
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,980
Let go of it!

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,560
I’m kicking you out!

124
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
Take my quilt?

125
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,240
Get out of the bed!

126
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,250
Don’t cross the border.

127
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,040
Jiang Jun.

128
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,360
You’ve gone too far!

129
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,720
Good.

130
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,120
Fine.

131
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
I won’t cross the border.

132
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,260
Whoever crosses the border will be a pig!

133
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,320
Why are you so happy?

134
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you doing?

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,730
Are you a super star? Why are you
wearing sunglasses in the morning?

136
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,560
I didn’t sleep yesterday.

137
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,520
What did you do?

138
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,220
I suspected that I was ill.

139
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,680
Again?

140
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
What’s wrong?

141
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,090
It’s not like what you thought.

142
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,740
Aren’t you afraid of dehydration and loose skin

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,200
drinking beauty-slimming tea in the morning?

144
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,160
I have no other choice.

145
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,320
I had some midnight snacks last night.

146
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,540
A remedy is needed.

147
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,500
Did you have midnight snacks?

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, so what?

149
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,570
Put on your sunglasses.

150
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,520
You look like a ghost.

151
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,520
No, so what?

152
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Boss,

153
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,400
you’re already in the office.

154
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,640
Why don’t you take off your glasses?

155
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
The cost of your quarrel is too great.

156
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,040
She

157
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,520
had this border

158
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,040
and put a long stick

159
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,920
on the bed,

160
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,720
leaving me a tiny space.

161
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,360
I can’t sleep turning neither right nor left side.

162
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,160
And it’s cold.

163
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,880
She always lies next to me.

164
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,960
I’ve been used to it, you know?

165
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,880
But I can’t...

166
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,450
So, I couldn’t fall asleep.

167
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,320
It’s over.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,800
You’re totally done for.

169
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,080
I think you should apologize to her

170
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,540
in order to save your life.

171
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
Apologize?

172
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
Why should I?

173
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
It’s her fault.

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I was trying to be nice. Why should

175
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,940
I apologize to her?

176
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,400
Fine.

177
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Listen.

178
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
According to my keen observation,

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
do you think she had a good rest?

180
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,200
She did not either!

181
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,840
I lost.

182
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,560
You two are a perfect match in all aspects.

183
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,800
But she’s just recovered.

184
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,440
Do you have the heart to see her
stay up with you?

185
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,140
I’ll tell you what.

186
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
She just can’t stay up late.

187
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
She will give in

188
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,600
tonight.

189
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
Listen, guys.

190
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
My status is so good today.

191
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,000
Yuan Shuai, whatever work you have,

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,120
just leave it to me.

193
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,240
I promise I will finish it perfectly.

194
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,160
Yuanji,

195
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
something good happened?

196
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,650
There is a bandage on your face.

197
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,320
It’s not something good.

198
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,640
Just a date.

199
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,540
Qiao Na said yes to you?

200
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,780
It’s not that easy to make her say yes.

201
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,760
We just had a midnight meal

202
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,800
and shared each other’s childhood memories.

203
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,700
So that’s what made you like this?

204
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,120
The childhood memories?

205
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,780
Yuan Shuai,

206
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,760
you have no idea.

207
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,160
This is bitter sweetness.

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,080
Enough, go back to work now.

209
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,120
Go.

210
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,440
Can’t you congratulate on me?

211
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:43,970

212
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,640

213
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,240

214
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,720
Love stories and congratulations

215
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
are forbidden for Yuan Shuai today.

216
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,520
Let’s talk about it another day.

217
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,160
Hello?

218
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,440
Mr. Yuan, hi.

219
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,360
The ring customized for you has arrived.

220
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,960
When will it be convenient for you to pick it up?

221
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
Okay, I’ll come now.

222
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,560
They have only left for a few days.

223
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,720
Why are their stuff being cleaned so quickly?

224
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,040
A new colleague is coming tomorrow.

225
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,880
So we have to clean up everything today.

226
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:26,680
This...

227
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,330
Give it to me.

228
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,640
The photo was printed by me.

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
This is the only copy.

230
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
They probably forgot it.

231
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,600
You should keep it.

232
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,480
You can keep it

233
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
as a keepsake.

234
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,050
Hello, Shen Xin.

235
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,400
Shen Xin,

236
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,170
I have to ask you something.

237
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,600
When I was on the leave at home,

238
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,400
did you see anything weird in the company

239
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,040
or hear anything strange?

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,730
Everything happened as usual.

241
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,840
The strangest thing is

242
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,000
the price leak.

243
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,240
What about Mr. Du?

244
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,680
I remember you reported a lot of work
directly to him

245
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
not long after I took the leave.

246
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Then it was transferred to Ms. Qiao.

247
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,280
Speaking of Mr. Du,

248
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
there is something weird about him.

249
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,240
I was anxious about getting a file signed
by him one day,

250
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,280
so I walked into his office after knocking
on his door.

251
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,080
Rest assured.

252
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,720
I have told the accountant

253
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,000
about the financial report of Huanyu Group.

254
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,880
We will do it in the same way as last year.

255
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,640
I’ll handle the CSRC.

256
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,120
Well,

257
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,720
since you are sincere,

258
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,920
it would be impolite for me to reject it.

259
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,960
He said on the phone that

260
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,620
Huanyu Group’s financial report

261
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,280
would be done like last year.

262
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,960
And he would handle the CSRC.

263
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,920
What’s wrong?

264
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,050
Anything happened?

265
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,640
No, just asking.

266
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,480
My conclusion is that

267
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,000
Du Lei has a reason

268
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,520
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

269
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
when he knew

270
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,650
there’s a better solution.

271
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,840
I suspect that

272
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,040
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

273
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,140
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

274
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,400
So, they had to leave.

275
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,120
By the way, what about your job interviews?

276
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,920
I’ve tried a few companies.

277
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,050
It doesn’t work out.

278
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,340
What about Xiang Ding?

279
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
Just like me.

280
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,120
What’s your next plan?

281
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,880
Do you still want to work in the investment bank?

282
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
I love this job.

283
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,280
And I’ve accumulated so much experience

284
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,360
and network all these years.

285
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,760
I don’t want to give it up.

286
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,640
Now that Chen Yicheng knew this,

287
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,320
he’s having a hard time, too.

288
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,560
So,

289
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,720
I want to take a shot at GE.

290
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,360
GE?

291
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,120
Yeah.

292
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,520
They’re recruiting people.

293
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,640
But it would be even harder there.

294
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,480
Actually I know

295
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,380
in an investment bank like GE,

296
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
I can hardly be hired

297
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,930
if there are no recommendations.

298
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,200
In addition, the SKL’s price leak

299
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,640
has been spread widely.

300
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,720
Even if my resignation says I left MH

301
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,980
for personal reasons,

302
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:22,760

Mr. Yuan is in GE, right?

309
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,080
I wonder if you can write
a recommendation letter to him for me

310
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,400

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160

Sing it.

380
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay.

381
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,520
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

382
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,400
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

383
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,920
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

384
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,400
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

385
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,560
Make a wish.

386
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,680
Okay.

387
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,620
What wish did you make?

388
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,480
It’s a secret.

389
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
I’ll get the wine.

390
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,600
What?

391
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,400
I forgot to fetch the delivery of Wealth’s food.

392
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,320
Fetch it for me when you come back.

393
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
I brought this wine from France.

394
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,810
Let’s drink it up today.

395
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,560
Jiang Jun,

396
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,320
are you with Du Lei?

397
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,320
I’ve still got something to do in the company.
Go fetch it yourself.

398
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,960
Jiang Jun.

399
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,130
I’m warning you.

400
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,570
You will be dead if you dare to drink today!

401
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,920
I...

402
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,760
Yuan Shuai is worrying about you again?

403
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,540
How come she is with Du Lei?

404
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,050
Where is she?

405
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,260
[GUANG HUA BUILDING]

406
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
Still in the company?

407
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,400
Well…

408
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,690
I know you can’t drink wine.

409
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,800
You can drink the juice.

410
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,240
Okay.

411
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,840
Then I will drink juice with you.

412
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,120
Here.

413
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,490
Happy birthday.

414
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,440
Thank you.

415
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,120
When I first met you,

416
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,900
you were just a girl new to this industry.

417
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Look at you now.

418
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
A vice president.

419
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,840
I have to thank my teacher, Mr. Du.

420
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,520
Thank you for your guidance and caring.

421
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,080
Or I wouldn’t be here today.

422
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,220
It’s been a long time since you referred me
as your teacher.

423
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Is it?

424
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,740
How about this?

425
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
I know you have poor physical condition.

426
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
I’ve thought about it.

427
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
From tomorrow on,

428
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,610
stop eating in the canteen.

429
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,320
I’ll find a professional nutritionist for you.

430
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:58,920
And

431
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,260
you’re not allowed to be here
if you haven’t slept for seven hours.

432
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,800
Mr. Du,

433
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,640
I’ve been thinking about something
for a long time.

434
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,720
Before I make a formal application,

435
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,040
I have to notify you first.

436
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
So formal?

437
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,760
Say it.

438
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,610
I want to resign.

439
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,200
Why do you want to resign all of a sudden?

440
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,360
Is it because the SKL’s case

441
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,080
has made you uncomfortable?

442
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,240
No.

443
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,260
It’s something personal.

444
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,040
And

445
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,980
I’ve been considering it for a long time.

446
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
If it’s because of your condition,

447
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,930
I can extend your leave.

448
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,240
You can take a two-month leave
if one month isn’t enough.

449
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
You can take a six-month leave
if that is still not enough.

450
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,520
Or I can make it a year.

451
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,100
Take a complete rest before you get well.

452
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,080
If I act like that,

453
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,240
my position in MH will be gone soon.

454
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,320
You don’t need to worry about that.

455
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,380
As long as I’m here,

456
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,940
no one can touch your seat.

457
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,340
Why do you think he helped you?

458
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,200
Because he likes you!

459
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,480
Do you really think he treats you

460
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,000
as his student or friend?

461
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,440
He always liked you!

462
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,880
Mr. Du.

463
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Thank you for your good will.

464
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,040
I know I would let you

465
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,920
and the company down.

466
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,640
But

467
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,440
I’ve decided.

468
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,620
I won’t approve it.

469
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,170
Is it because of Yuan Shuai?

470
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,730
Whatever he can give you

471
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
I can give you too.

472
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,640
No.

473
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,620
You misunderstood me.

474
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,200
I’ve been so tired these two years.

475
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,040
I didn’t even have time to stay
with my family.

476
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,640
Really?

477
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,320
It occurred to me that I still have something
urgent to do.

478
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,250
I’ll go back now.

479
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,840
I drank.

480
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You drive me home.

481
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,120
Mr. Du,

482
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,920
is there anything on my face?

483
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
Can you call me teacher?

484
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,320
Okay.

485
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,580
You haven’t worn the watch I sent you.

486
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,640
Actually I was angry at first.

487
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,000
Then I thought about it.

488
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,780
Maybe it’s because you don’t like it.

489
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,280
So,

490
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,040
I picked a necklace for you.

491
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,240
I hope you like it.

492
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,220
I will put it on for you.

493
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,400
Teacher,

494
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,000
I’m driving. This is dangerous.

495
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,930
Please sit back.

496
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,200
Teacher!

497
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,120
Teacher, I...

498
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,000
Sit back!

499
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,040
This is really dangerous!

500
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,640
Sit back!

501
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,370
Why are you rejecting me like this?

502
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,960
Why do you want to resign?

503
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,600
Did Yuan Shuai force you?

504
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,960
No.

505
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,120
I want to do it myself.

506
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,720
You want to do it?

507
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,040
What’re you going to do then?

508
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,680
Be a good wife and mother?

509
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,300
What about your dream?

510
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,200
How about the dream you had

511
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,260
when you first came to this industry?

512
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
You want to give up

513
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,970
just for him?

514
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,560
I want to resign for personal reasons.

515
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,940
I should have the right to resign, right?

516
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,800
Teacher,

517
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,580
I think you should find a designated driver.

518
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,600
Didn’t you ask what

519
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,160
my birthday wish is?

520
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,540
I will tell you now.

521
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,880
My birthday wish is

522
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
to be with you forever!

523
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,600
Stop it!

524
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,380
Do you remember this necktie?

525
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,620
You gave it to me two years ago.

526
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,730
I’ve been wearing it from the day I entered MH.

527
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,440
I don’t believe you are so blind that

528
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,700
you don't know my feelings for you at all.

529
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,520
Du Lei.

530
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,560
Calm down.

531
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,400
Calm down?

532
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,020
If you have no feelings for me,

533
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,620
why did you send me such a sensitive gift?

534
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,080
I didn’t mean that.

535
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,160
It’s just a gift for a teacher.

536
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,160
Sorry.

537
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,660
It was thoughtless of me
to make you misunderstand.

538
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,180
You guessed right. I want to get married.

539
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,720
So, you should realize

540
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
I will not respond to your feelings.

541
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,570
I know you are not drunk.

542
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,420
Please stop acting like this.

543
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,680
I want to

544
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,900
give back the tie That I owe you

545
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,520
Please give it back to me.

546
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,640
Jiang Jun.

547
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,960
Jiang Jun.

548
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,600
Jiang Jun, I love you very much.

549
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,680
I can’t leave you.

550
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,400
I hope you can stay by my side forever

551
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,480
so I can protect you.

552
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,400
Let go of me!

553
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,280
Du Lei, let go of me!

554
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,400
What’re you doing?

555
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,860
What’re you doing?

556
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,480
Let go of me!

557
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,220
What’re you doing?

558
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,040
Jiang Jun,

559
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,040
are you okay?

560
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,920
Were you hurt?

561
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,260
Yuan Shuai!

562
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,880
Stop, you two!

563
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,480
Stop it!

564
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,480
Stop!

565
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,280
Jiang Jun!

566
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,760
Get away!

567
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,280
Jiang Jun,

568
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,640
are you okay?

569
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Let’s go home.

570
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,400
Wealth.

571
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,520
Wealth, you are so nice to me.

572
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,180
You knew I was stimulated and came
to comfort me.

573
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,190
Wealth.

574
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,360
Do you know how frightened I was?

575
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,400
I almost cried.

576
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,120
But your dad came in time.

577
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,719
Wealth, look.

578
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,760
Does your dad look like a lighted incense?

579
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,670
There’s even smoke.

580
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,760
It’s so scary.

581
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:24,480
Tell me.

582
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,679
What is your true thought

583
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,630
on Du Lei now?

584
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,670
I think it’s a pity.

585
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,670
A pity?

586
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,480
So, I shouldn’t have gone there.

587
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,150
Did I bother you guys?

588
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,760
Didn’t you want to know my true thought?

589
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,920
I do think

590
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,520
it’s a pity

591
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,800
to lose a friend

592
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,120
whom I valued a lot.

593
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,560
If I could have been more perceptive,

594
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,800
and found it out,

595
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,420
things wouldn’t have ended up like this.

596
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
Now you know you’re not perceptive?

597
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,840
Yeah.

598
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
After all, you had no idea I liked you

599
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,440
for so many years.

600
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,410
You are truly the least perceptive

601
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,080
in this aspect.

602
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,660
I did not think about it at all.

603
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,680
You knew it.

604
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,840
You are the only person I dated.

605
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,200
Or things wouldn’t have been

606
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,560
so awkward now.

607
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,890
Do you think I’m mad about this?

608
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,660
So, what are you mad about?

609
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,880
A man and a woman

610
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,320
drink together

611
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,220
in the middle of night?

612
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,640
And you even drove him home after drinking.

613
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,800
Jiang Jun, you served him so well.

614
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,160
I swear I didn’t drink.

615
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
-Don’t...
-Stop!

00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:52,960
Sit.

617
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,320
What did you do to Du Lei?

618
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,050
Why did he show his feelings
to you all of a sudden?

619
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,080
I did tell him something.

620
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,930
But I can’t let you know.

621
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,280
Okay, then I won’t accept your apology.

622
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,120
I’m sorry. I was wrong.

623
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,240
You’re breaking the rules.

624
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
More than that,

625
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,920
I’m doing something even worse.

626
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,360
Stop being angry at me, okay?

627
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,320
It’s still hurting.

628
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Is it?

629
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:36,880
Let me see.

630
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,740
Still hurting?

631
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,610
A little bit.

632
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,420
What about now?

633
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,160
It’s good now.

634
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,080
You

635
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,120
should be more careful,

636
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,840
okay?

637
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,960
By the way,

638
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,880
I forgot something.

639
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,000
What is it? Can we talk about it tomorrow?

640
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,920
No, it’ll be too late.

641
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:10,640
Okay, go on.

642
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,520
Shen Xin is having an interview
in GE tomorrow afternoon.

643
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,240
You know her condition.

644
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,000
So,

645
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,520
I wrote a recommendation letter to you.

646
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Can you hand it over to the company?

647
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,040
Please.

648
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,440
Jiang Jun.

649
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,480
So you acted cute

650
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,800
because you wanted a favor from me?

651
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,120
No.

652
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,960
It occurred to me all of a sudden.

653
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,360
All of a sudden?

654
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,810
What a coincidence.

655
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,650
Just tell me if you will help me.

656
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,340
A recommendation letter?

657
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,240
Listen to my analysis.

658
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,320
You wrote a recommendation letter for Shen Xin,

659
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,450
which is good to her.

660
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,640
But it’s not good to you.

661
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,520
Shen Xin is your bosom friend.

662
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,720
You’re my girlfriend.

663
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,080
Everybody in this industry knows it.

664
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,200
You want to send the recommendation letter

665
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,660
for Shen Xin to my company.

666
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,680
If someone with an ulterior motive knows it,

667
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,540
they will make a big fuss about it.

668
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,320
Well,

00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,400
I’m just trying to be a referrer.

I do not break any rules in this industry.

671
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,200
And this might be her last chance.

672
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,680
Can you let off your guard

673
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,100
and help her this time?

674
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,480
I’ve told you the pros and cons.

675

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,560
just write it.

680
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,520
October 12th?

681
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,360
Isn’t it the day Shen Xin mentioned?

682
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,320
My conclusion is that

683
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,880
Du Lei has a reason

684
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,280
insisting to fire Xiang Ding and Shen Xin

685
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,400
when he knew

686
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,450
there’s a better solution.

687
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,040
I suspect that

688
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,080
Shen Xin and Xiang Ding have known

689
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,920
Du Lei’s secret which frightens him.

690
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,120
So, they had to leave.

I was anxious about getting a file signed
by him one day,

692
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,920
so I walked into his office after knocking
on his door.

693
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,680

Yes Yes!
