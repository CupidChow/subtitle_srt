Episode 15

5
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,860
Think about it carefully.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,120
It’s not your birthday.

7
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
Is it the birthday of Wealth?

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,810
Think again.

9
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,360
0905?

10
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,200
0905 is

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
the day when we met again.

12
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
Where is Jiang Jun?

13
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,300
She took some days off.

14
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,640
Some days off?

15
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,520
Are you taking some days off?

16
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,450
Are you alright?

[Zhu Youyi, Chenxin Technology]

18
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:28,880
Hello?

19
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,760
Yuan Shuai, something’s come up.

20
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,160
Defeng Capitals is purchasing my company.

21
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,560
Okay, I see.

22
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,490
I’m coming over.

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:39,730
Su Chang,

24
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,280
there’s a file folder named CX

25
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,040
on my desktop.

26
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,400
It includes several investors

27
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,520
who’re interested in Chenxin Technology.

28
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,560
Contact them immediately.

29
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Tell them to be here tomorrow noon
for a meeting

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,240
if they’re still interested in Chenxin Technology.

31
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,900
Okay, boss.

32
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,780
Thank you, sir.

33
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,850
Aren’t you buying me a meal?

34
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,920
Here?

35
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,200
Yeah.

36
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you going to sell me to someone

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,160
so you can collect money for Li Xiaochuan?

38
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,040
How would I?

39
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Even if I sold myself to someone,

40
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,800
I wouldn’t do it to you.

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
What’s with this place?

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,920
I don’t know either.

43
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Li Xiaochuan said he would take care of this.

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,560
So, I didn’t ask too much.

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,040
It is here.

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,730
He’s coming?

47
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:53,800
Morning!

48
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,780
I was afraid you wouldn’t find it.

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,600
Mr. Du?

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,650
Why are you here?

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,040
Mr. Du?

52
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,800
Is this the Mr. Du?

53
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,640
Hello, I’m Xu Li.

54
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,280
Hello.

55
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,640
Thank you for investing in

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,040
Xiaochuan’s West World.

57
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,440
Investing?

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,040
I thought Mr. Du was assessing
for the project.

59
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,500
Why is he the investor now?

60
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,280
After assessing his project

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,720
I thought it’s pretty promising.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,160
And I happened to have some spare money.

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,120
So, I did it.

64
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,640
Now that Mr. Du is helping you,

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,840
Xiaochuan will succeed definitely.

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,680
After all, he’s the man I chose.

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,850
I need some help.

68
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Okay.

69
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:44,720
Here.

70
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,530
These are for the girls.

71
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,320
Thank you.

72
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,920
Mr. Du.

73
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,040
Xiaochuan.

74
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,840
So, your appreciation dinner is?

75
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,120
There's a very nice recreation area
on the mountain,

76
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,480
which is very suitable for camping.

77
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,140
I brought a barbecue and food.

78
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,920
We can have a barbecue tonight,

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
and set up a bonfire.

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,960
On a cold day like this?

81
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,140
Are you sure we’re having a barbecue?

82
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,440
Yeah.

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,650
We do it all the time abroad.

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,600
It’s a lot fun.

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,540
Just follow me.

86
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Let’s go.

87
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,010
Camping?

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,240
Picnic?

89
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
BBQ?

90
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,600
Thank you.

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,090
You can wipe your sweat.

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Thank you.

93
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,840
We’re here!

94
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Finally.

95
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,520
Ah, my sore limbs...

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,900
I haven’t been tired like this for a year.

97
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,860
You two can take a rest.

98
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,250
I’ll go help Xiaochuan.

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,120
Don’t, Mr. Du!

100
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,360
You’re the guest today.

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
I’ll go help Xiaochuan.

102
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,280
Go take a rest with Jun.

103
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
I’m sorry, Mr. Du.

104
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,320
I felt bad involving you in this.

105
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,600
It’s not like that. I think this is great.

106
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
I have been at home for a long time.

107
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,640
It’s good that I can breathe some fresh air now.

108
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,549
Jun.

109
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,760
One, two, three.

110
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,840
Pretty.

111
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,900
Xiaochuan.

112
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,400
This is the sixth time that
you’ve overcooked something, right?

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,000
Do you really know how to do it?

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,920
Didn’t you join activities like this before?

115
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,400
I did.

116
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,260
But I was not in charge of cooking.

117
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,460
So, what were you in charge of?

118
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,880
I was pitching the tent.

119
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,660
And I was guiding them to climb the mountain.

120
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,420
Why’s the fire getting stronger?

121
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,010
Go do something else.
Leave this to me.

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,840
Okay.

123
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,520
Jun, Jun, Jun!

124
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,360
I think Mr. Du

125
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,920
is a good option.

126
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,920
Don’t you like Li Xiaochuan anymore?

127
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,200
What?

128
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
Xiaochuan

129
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,380
will be the protagonist in my heart forever.

130
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,760
I just think Mr. Du

131
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,340
is like those who exist only in the manga.

132
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,520
He’s soft, rich and considerate.

133
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,760
And what’s important is
that he knows how to barbecue.

134
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,120
Seriously, the woman who can marry him

135
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
is so blessed.

136
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,360
Right, Jun?

137
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,700
Eat your food.
Food can’t stop you from talking, right?

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,640
The firewood is not enough.

139
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,600
I’ll go pick some.

140
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,660
I’ll come with you.

141
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
Okay?

142
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,760
Xiaochuan.

143
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,400
I...

144
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
I...

145
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,120
Can I ask you a question?

146
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Sure.

147
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,400
Yuan Shuai said you hadn’t dated anyone.

148
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,760
Is that true?

149
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,440
I… I can tell you.

150
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,980
Because I believe you.

151
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,290
But you can’t tell anyone else.

152
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,200
I promise!

153
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,080
I swear I won’t tell anyone else.

154
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,000
One time?

155
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,760
One year?

156
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,000
Then what does that mean?

157
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,200
One instant.

158
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,450
One instant?

159
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,400
What the heck is that?

160
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,040
My gosh.

161
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,520
He seems to have been hurt so badly.

162
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,280
What kind of a girl

163
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,760
could hurt him like this?

164
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,640
I’m so jealous.

165
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,360
Xiaochuan, I’m sorry.

166
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,680
Did I remind you of your painful memory?

167
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,480
I...

168
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,810
I have some tissues.

169
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,640
You...

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,020
Xiaochuan.

171
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,880
It’s okay. You got me.

172
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,040
There’s something in my eye.

173
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,060
Yuan Shuai!

174
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,540
Doctor Zhu.

175
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,520
Yuan Shuai, I just got some information.

176
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Defeng Capitals has enforced
the debt-to-equity swap.

177
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,440
So, they have the

178
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,860
[Zhu Youyi, the founder of Chenxin Technology
and a PhD in Computer Science]

179
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,080
20% stake of Chenxin Technology.

180
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
Are we gonna lose?

181
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,480
Calm down.

182
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,600
It’s still unknown who will win.

183
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,330
One year ago,

184
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,000
you told me to issue new bonds to raise money.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,920
You even lent me some money in private

186
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,520
and encouraged me to hang on.

187
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,020
I have faith in you.

188
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,400
So, please

189
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
help me get through this.

190
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,160
Rest assured, Doctor Zhu.

191
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,200
Just focus on your new system right now.

192
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,920
Leave everything else to me.

193
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,960
Okay.

194
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,740
I’ll leave it entirely to you.

195
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:29,850
This way.please

196
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,560
Mr. Zhang.

197
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,160
Mr. Zhang!

198
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,900
[Zhang Ting, the Investment Director
of Defeng Capitals]

199
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,220
Take a seat.

200
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

201
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,680
Two cups of coffee, please.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,280
Thank you.

203
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,400
Why?

204
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,560
Has a small takeover for Chenxin

205
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
aroused the curiosity of Mr. Yuan?

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,160
It’s a small takeover for you.

207
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,800
But to Chenxin,

208
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,680
it’s life and death.

209
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,130
Of course I have to show up to save its life.

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,440
Mr. Yuan.

211
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,320
Have you read a lot of martial arts novels?

212
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,980
Are you trying to be a hero
in the capital market?

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,130
I have to remind you.

214
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,160
You’re just a listing agent.

215
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,320
Mr. Zhang,

216
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
whether I’m a listing agent or a selling agent,

217
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,920
we’re all working for others.

218
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,080
Right?

219
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,400
Chenxin’s debt is due.

220
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,600
If Chenxin can’t afford to recover its bonds,

221
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,480
it’s perfectly justified for us

222
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
to exchange the stock.

223
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,840
It’s the rule.

224
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,160
Whatever you say is of no use now.

225
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,080
The rule?

226
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:52,800
Mr. Zhang,

227
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,600
in our Agreement,

228
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,280
the loan extension is one year.

229
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,560
Now you denied it,

230
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
required Chenxin to pay back immediately,

231
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
enforced the debt-to-equity swap,

232
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,360
and even incited shareholders to sell equity
in private.

233
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,760
You’re attempting

234
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
to control Chenxin.

235
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,360
That’s right!

236
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,320
The shareholders are of different minds.

237
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,520
Technicians are being suppressed.

238
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,280
Due to this, the publishment of

239
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,280
Iot assessment system has been postponed.

240
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,160
I see.

241
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,360
This is quite difficult.

242
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,120
Or I can give you some advice.

243
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,520
On behalf of Defeng Capitals,

244
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,850
I’d like to buy out your system patent with 100 million yuan.

245
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Are you kidding me?

246
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,160
If you agree to that,

247
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,890
we will withdraw the purchase.

248
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,720
I’m raising money!

249
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,080
I’m not selling my patent.

250
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,280
How can you do R&D if you don’t have any money?

251
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,560
Once similar systems appear in the market,

252
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,320
your system will be valueless.

253
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,960
After all, the financial strength
of the technology giants on the market

254
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,420
is much stronger than you.

255
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,040
That is making a feint to the east
but attacking in the west.

256
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,900
Their intention is not the stock.

257
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,000
Doctor Zhu,

258
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,050
did you see that?

259
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,020
Your system is of great value.

260
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,200
He offered 100 million yuan.

261
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,360
Have more faith in yourself.

262
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,540
[Su Chang]

263
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,120
Speak.

264
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,920
It’s done.

265
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,500
We have six investors now.

266
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,280
They will come to the company at
12 pm the day after tomorrow.

267
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:29,880
Okay.

268
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,120
Alright.

269
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,810
That’s all for the teatime.

270
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,050
What do you mean?

271
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,860
I don’t mean anything.

272
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Mr. Zhang,

273
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,000
enjoy three cups of coffee.

274
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,730
You don’t need to sleep after finishing them.

275
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,480
What?

276
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,800
Excuse me.

277
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,380
Yuan Shuai!

278
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,460
Yuan Shuai!

279
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,310
Why are you leaving?

280
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,440
Do you have a way out?

281
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Tell me honestly.

282
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,010
Did you know they wanted

283
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,099
to buy out your patent a long time ago?

284
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,200
Actually, they came to me before.

285
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,800
But I rejected.

286
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,569
You know it, too.

287
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
We have poor sales this year.

288
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,560
The shareholders don’t want to spend money
in supporting me with the R&D anymore.

289
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,760
So, I didn’t tell you.

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,680
Doctor Zhu.

291
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,960
Others are quietly making a fortune.

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,520
You’re quietly losing.

293
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,640
I’ve known you for a year.

294
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,320
When will you learn to act

295
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,000
as the owner of your company?

296
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,540
People are good at different things.

297
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,800
Again,

298
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,160
you refused my offer to be the manager.

299
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,490
Let’s go.

300
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Where are we going?

301
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,960
I’m going to train you in the company.

302
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,920
I’ll teach you how to be
an inspirational leader in one day.

303
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,240
Thank me for finding some investors for you.

304
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,240
No way.

305
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
I should make speeches again?

306
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,360
No.

307
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,960
Of course you should.

308
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,600
Let’s go.

309
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,690
You… You know me.

310
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,930
When I make a speech,

311
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,120
I can’t say anything.

312
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,040
Drink less coffee.

313
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,120
Thank you.

314
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
Actually, West World...

315
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,340
Actually, West World is pretty good.

316
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,480
It’s just that Xiaochuan’s idea

317
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,920
is somehow immature.

318
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,880
You decided to be his investor
even after knowing that?

319
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,960
I’m taking a chance.

320
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
At least, his skills are excellent.

321
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,410
There may be a surprise.

322
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,170
No worries. I will help him.

323
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,800
Okay.

324
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
A poor doggy!

325
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,320
My poor doggy,

326
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,640
why are you here?

327
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,720
Come here.

328
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,080
My poor doggy.

329
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,160
Mr. Du.

330
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,120
A little dog.

331
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,760
You dislike dogs?

332
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
I used to like them.

333
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,520
There you go.

334
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,120
Then what happened?

335
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,920
Let me tell you a secret.

336
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,280
When I was little,

337
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,360
I had a dog.

338
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,800
I had no friends

339
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,570
or family back then.

340
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,960
It was my dog who was always there with me

341
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,000
When I was 12,

342
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,520
Du’s took me in

343
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,540
because I was born on the same date

344
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
as their biological son.

345
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,920
I was happy at first.

346
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,760
So, I took my dog with me.

347
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,530
But they threw it out

348
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,010
because they thought it was dirty.

349
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,840
When I found it,

350
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,620
it had already froze to death.

351
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,760
It’s a pity.

352
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,960
I’m sorry

353
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,820
that I have reminded you of your painful memory.

354
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,380
It’s not like that.

355
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,960
I feel relieved after telling you.

356
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,000
Keep this secret for me.

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,200
Or I’ll kill you.

358
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,280
Got you.

359
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,880
I will zip my mouth.

360
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,600
But I do think

361
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,400
it’s better to

362
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,040
talk about your worries and regrets
with your friends.

363
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,480
It will help

364
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,760
release your stress.

365
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,680
So,

366
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,890
it seems like you have some worries
and regrets, too.

367
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,880
Everyone in this world

368
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,610
has their worries and regrets.

369
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,720
I shared

370
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
mine with you.

371
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,400
To be fair, shouldn’t you

372
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,210
share yours with me?

373
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,720
My biggest regret is that

374
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,440
I didn’t get to meet my dad

375
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,120
before he passed away.

376
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,400
Yixianqian Noodles, founded by my father,

377
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
suffered a hostile takeover.

378
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,000
He was busy with the company,

379
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,400
and hadn’t slept for days.

380
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,560
He passed away
when he had a recurrence of an old illness.

381
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,740
I was too late, I ran over from school.

382
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,320
What’s your father’s company’s name?

383
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,320
Jiangnan Flavor, what’s wrong?

384
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,000
Sorry.

385
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,200
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

386
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,720
Sorry.

387
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,210
The subscriber you dialed is powered off.

388
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,600
Sorry.

389
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,200
The subscriber...

390
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,320
What the heck?

391
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,560
I haven’t seen her all day.

392
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Li,

393
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,960
did you bring the power bank?

394
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,560
I forgot to charge my phone yesterday.

395
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,890
The phone battery died.

396
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,200
No?

397
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,760
Fine.

398
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
[Xu Li]

399
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
The first activity of
West World. Hooray!

400
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
Why is Du Lei there?

401
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,760
Li Xiaochuan!

402
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,800
Mr. Du, the bun smells great.

403
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,760
Why am I suddenly feeling bad?

404
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,280
Hello, Brother?

405
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,160
Li Xiaochuan.

406
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,290
Come to my place right away.

407
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,640
I will give you 30 minutes.

408
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,800
Or I will release the video

409
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,200
and let everyone see

410
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,160
how bad you’re

411
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,840
at building a relationship

412
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,490
and then still trying to develop a dating app.

413
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:53,960
Wait!

414
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,280
Well...

415
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
My brother wants me home now.

416
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,960
Right now?

417
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,960
You can tell him you’re working.

418
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,080
Although he’s your brother,

419
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,240
you can’t let him take control of you.

420
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,560
My brother wants me back now!

421
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,760
But we haven’t finished our food.

422
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,610
And the tent was already set up.

423
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,480
It’s okay.

424
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,720
We can go back since he’s needed.

425
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,640
We can come here next time
when we’re fully prepared.

426
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,370
We will have a chance to do this.

427
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:36,920
Let’s go.

428
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:39,450
Let’s go.

429
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,840
I’m so sorry…

430
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,920
Yuan Shuai is so annoying.

431
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,040
He didn’t even tell you why he wanted you back.

432
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,000
No matter what it is,

433
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,440
it’s right to come back.

434
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,960
Is there an emergency?

435
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,960
Probably not. I’ll walk you home first.

436
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,080
How can you

437
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:15,960
come into a girl’s room?

438
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,440
Just go!

439
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,080
Help.

440
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,010
Brother.

441
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
Why are you so angry?

442
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,760
What’s with the camping?

443
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,610
I haven’t told you about it.

444
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,480
I found an investor for West World.

445
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,440
So, this is probably the first

446
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
activity for our company.

447
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,160
Why’s Du Lei there?

448
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,520
Because he’s

449
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,680
the investor for West World.

450
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,690
Did Jiang Jun recommend him to you?

451
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,080
And,

452
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,760
I’ve been observing...

453
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,960
Did I allow you to sit?

454
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,200
I’ve been observing...

455
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,800
I found Jiang Jun and Mr. Du have

456
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,840
better assessing opinions than you.

457
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,480
I’ve got my first fund.

458
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,120
So, I will be pretty busy lately.

459
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,840
Don’t call me to come over

460
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,650
if there’s nothing important.

461
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,160
Li Xiaochuan.

462
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,240
Did you forget that

463
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,900
I still have something on you?

464
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,360
A video which can prove that

465
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,180
your West World is just a joke.

466
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,280
You liked a girl

467
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,200
and thought she was your perfect match

468
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,240
after you used your algorithm.

469
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,520
And it turns out what?

470
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,440
She got married with someone else.

471
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Your first love ended in failure.

472
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,880
You’d cried for three days at home.

473
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,240
I know. I know.

474
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
Get back on the horse that bucked you.

475
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
That was the old algorithm.

476
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,730
There won’t be a problem like that.

477
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,800
I’m pissed off.

478
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,880
You’re acting weird.

479
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,280
Why are you angry

480
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
about Mr. Du investing in me?

481
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,640
Are you really angry?

482
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,970
I’m afraid you’re tricked!

483
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,080
I’m not angry.

484
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,080
I know why you’re angry.

485
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Say nothing.

486
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,920
It’s because...

487
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,340
Don’t guess randomly.

488
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,600
You’re jealous because Mr. Du
and Jiang Jun...

489
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,440
I’m not.

490
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
They...

491
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,040
I’m warning you. Stop.

492
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,560
They have better insights than you

493
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,200
and they supported my project.

494
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,800
Right?

495
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,200
So what?

496
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,680
It’s too late.

497
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,000
I will show you

498
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,480
West World

499
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,200
is a terrific project.

500
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,080
You punk!

501
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,840
My biggest regret is that

502
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,600
I didn’t get to see my dad

503
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,200
before he passed away.

504
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,560
Yixianqian Noodles, founded by my father,

505
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
suffered a hostile takeover.

506
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,040
He was busy with the company,

507
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,500
and hadn’t slept for days.

508
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,760
He passed away
when he had a recurrence of an old illness..

509
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,520
What is your father’s company named?

510
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Jiangnan Flavor.

511
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,400
[Be fair and just in handling affairs
A noble spirit that will never perish]

512
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,980
[A man of integrity with a clear conscience]

513
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Not going in?

514
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,240
This world is a Colosseum.

515
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,640
Life and death,

516
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,880
winning and losing. It happens.

517
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,440
And the one who pushed him
to the dead end was himself and MH.

518
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,800
It’s not you.

519
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,570
You don’t have to blame yourself too much.

520
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,360
Dad, I’m home.

521
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

522
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,600
If it’s okay, I will go back to my room.

523
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,520
Wait.

524
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,240
I heard Du Lei resigned.

525
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,680
Is it true?

526
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,880
When did he resign?

527
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
To whom?

528
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,160
I had no idea about it.

529
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,600
If it hadn’t been a GE’s client

530
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,920
who complained to me,

531
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,120
when would you

532
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,720
tell me that, Linda?

533
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,610
I didn’t do this on purpose.

534
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,800
It was just

535
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,380
an impulse.

536
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,840
An impulse?

537
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,520
He wants to piss me off!

538
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,970
It’s not like that, dad.

539
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,240
Don’t be angry.

540
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,360
He was shocked

541
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,520
about the last case

542
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,680
and thought he lost his face.

543
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,240
So,

544
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,480
he hasn’t fully recovered from...

545
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,280
So, he resigned?

546
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,460
Linda, you are quite skilled.

547
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,180
You have all kinds of reasons for him.

548
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,290
Are you playing intimate sister and brother?

549
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,120
But did he care about you

550
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,800
when he left all the mess to you?

551
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,120
Can you solve it?

552
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,920
Has he ever thought about you?

553
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,010
Now you’re still covering for him.

554
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,060
He didn’t leave all the mess to me.

555
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,320
Resignation is nothing more

556
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,200
than a normal personnel change.

557
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,760
Dad, don’t be angry.

558
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,920
I will try to persuade him into coming back.

559
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,800
No need!

560
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,440
Are you the little brother

561
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,640
my dad mentioned?

562
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,960
I’m Du Ling.

563
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,890
I’ll be your sister from now on.

564
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,320
They took away my dog.

565
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,200
Will they kill it?

566
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Is he going to die?

567
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,560
I couldn’t protect him.

568
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,560
Law of the jungle. Survival of the fittest.

569
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,400
This is what my dad told me.

570
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,720
If you don’t want to be bullied,

571
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,050
grow up as fast as you can

572
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,480
and become stronger.

573
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,170
So, you will be able to protect others.

574
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,960
Stand up.

575
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,920
You still don’t understand this.

576
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,800
I will teach you in the future.

577
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,460
And I will be with you forever.

578
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,120
Really?

579
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:46,440
Yeah.

580
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,179
[Du Lei]

581
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,900
[Du, how have you been?]

582
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,190
Hello, Mr. Yuan.

583
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,600
Okay.

584
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,120
Mr. Yuan, this...

585
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,190
Is... Is he ignoring me?

586
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,160
Is he really angry

587
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,920
at what happened yesterday?

588
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,360
Mr. Yuan, you wanted Xiaochuan back so urgently.

589
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,680
Did he piss you off?

590
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,920
I heard you set up a new company.

591
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,960
How is it?

592
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,560
Were you happy with the first activity?

593
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,450
So, he is jealous about Mr. Du’s
investing in Xiaochuan.

594
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,720
Why are you laughing?

595
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,640
Nothing.

596
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Here.

597
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,160
A special cup of coffee to calm you down.

598
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,840
I don’t know coffee is capable of doing that.

599
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,500
I refuse it!

600
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,600
Mr. Yuan, is this new?

601
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,960
Your outfit is stunning.

602
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,840
It’s so integrated into your noble identity.

603
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,320
Cut the crap.

604
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,040
This is not crap.

605
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,480
I’m telling the truth.

606
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,160
Do you have a lot of free time?

607
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,520
No work to do, yeah?

608
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,320
Okay.

609
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,280
Put all the materials

610
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,560
of Chenxin Technology

611
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,640
on my desk in five minutes.

612
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,860
Four minutes and fifty seconds left.

613
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,600
It’s already done.

614
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,120
And,

615
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,160
I’ve been visiting the Reference Office.

616
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,520
I read about so many cases you did before.

617
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,880
I found your insights are way better than others.

618
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,840
No wonder they have

619
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
been defeated by you.

620
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,050
You really are invincible.

621
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,720
Enough.

622
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,000
I think you deserve a better job elsewhere.

623
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,280
Should I go find

624
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,060
a comedy institution for you?

625
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,640
That’s right.

626
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,400
Don’t be angry. You look better when you smile.

627
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:56,800
Really?

628
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,040
Hello.

629
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,890
Mr. Yuan.

630
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,720
The project group is having a dinner tonight.

631
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,850
Ms. Qiao asked me to remind you of that.

632
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,920
Okay, got it.

633
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,360
What’re you laughing for?

634
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,820
What are you laughing for?

635
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,560
I heard someone said I look better when I smile.

636
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,520
Do you believe every word I said?

637
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,600
I do.

638
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,400
Sit.

639
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,720
Chen Yicheng,

640
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,600
how much fragrance did you put on?

641
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,440
The scent is so strong.

642
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,240
I can’t stand it. Sit over there.

643
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,400
Okay.

644
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,580
Let’s exchange our seats.

645
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,210
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

646
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,600
Mr. Yuan, do you still remember this restaurant?

647
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,560
Two years ago,

648
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,240
we were here for a merger case.

649
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,200
Four negotiation representatives were drunk

650
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,800
while we were not.

651
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,920
Thank you for being my back-up.

652
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,560
I remember Mr. Ma was also here.

653
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,280
You drank too much yourself.

654
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,280
And I sent you back home.

655
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:00,760
Well...

656
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,520
Can we start eating now, Mr. Yuan?

657
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,040
Yeah, sure.

658
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,040
Dig in.

659
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,120
Back-up?

660
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,120
Send her home?

661
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
She doesn’t have any friends?

662
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,280
You’re so good to

663
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,160
all the girls.

664
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,600
Are you a heating pad,

665
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,040
heating yourself to every girl?

666
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,500
Hope you have a bellyache.

667
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,240
Dear Juno,

668
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,920
I’m here to remind you
to improve your relationship

669
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,320
with your perfect match.

670
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,840
Are you asleep, the master of the secret crush?

671
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,600
Not yet.

672
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,570
Something’s wrong?

673
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,360
I have a question for you.

674
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,480
Go ahead

675
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,200
Why? Are you troubled by someone?

676
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,160
A man

677
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,000
is so good to you out of the blue,

678
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,460
and you’re so moved by him.

679
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
But you found he’s good to other women, too.

680
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,760
What does he mean?

681
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,000
Women are the same.

682
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,800
She can say sweet words to a man
at this moment

683
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,760
but be entangled with another man at the next.

684
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,400
Did you have similar experience?

685
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,650
These people are so difficult to understand.

686
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,040
It’s too much.

687
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah.

688
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,820
And they have nothing to fear.

689
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,320
Probably it’s because they know

690
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,960
we like them.

691
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,360
Like them?

692
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,360
Who likes him?

693
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,560
I don’t like him!

694
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,460
Is this...?

695
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:52,960
a painting?

696
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,980
Brother Yuanyuan,

697
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,920
did you solve it?

698
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Are you okay?

699
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,160
Did you have a nightmare?

700
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,360
Of course no.

701
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,080
A good message for you.

702
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,920
I’ve found the owner of the magic cube.

703
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,560
Really?

704
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,080
Who?

705
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,650
It’s me definitely.

706
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,460
I was the person who solved it.

707
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,520
Yeah.

708
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Can you speak to it?

709
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,800
What did it say to you?

710
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,960
It said I will be the owner
of this magic cube forever.

711
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,440
What about me?

712
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,280
It’s okay.

713
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,080
You can come to me when you miss it.

714
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,900
Love Is Sweet
