00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

4
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 28

5
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:43,979
What's up?

6
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,350
Why can't you say it over the phone?

7
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,380
Du Lei came to see me.

8
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
He came to see you?

9
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,380
Why?

10
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,710
It seems you really don't know.

11
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,810
I've been really busy lately.

12
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,780
And I haven't been in touch

13
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,180
with Du Lei in a while.

14
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,100
He came to me to make a deal,

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,620
saying that we should fight against
Yuan Shuai together.

16
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,100
But I can't help thinking

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,990
there's something wrong with him.

18
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,140
What can he have problems with?

19
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,020
He had always regarded Yuan Shuai
as his arch-rival.

20
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,380
In order to win over Yuan Shuai,

21
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,300
whatever he did is normal.

22
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,660
So what were you surprised about?

23
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,900
I was just surprised that

24
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,180
he wanted to work with you.

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,660
Who told him about C Group?

26
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm to blame.

27
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,420
When I resigned from MH to work in GE,

28
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,220
in order not to make Jiang Yaoming suspicious,

29
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,620
I handed the case of Jiangnan Flavor

30
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,580
to Du Lei.

31
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,540
It just didn't occur to me that

32
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,300
he always thought I was taking advantage of him,

33
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,340
so I had to tell him something.

34
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,100
But don't worry.

35
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,540
I didn't say a word I shouldn't have.

36
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,420
That's good.

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,930
Linda, you have to understand that

38
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,420
Jiang Yaoming's death

39
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,720
is not like anything else.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,360
It will be hard for both of us

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,300
if you don't take a firm stand.

42
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,500
What are you doing?

43
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Pills, pills!

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,520
Pills!

45
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,200
Pills, pills!

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,760
Call an ambulance.

47
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,240
And

48
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
if you don't keep an eye on your brother,

49
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,440
I'll keep an eye on him.

50
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,620
He is so clever.

51
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,150
I don't trust him.

52
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
Have some tea.

53
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Answer the phone!

54
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,620
Du Lei,

55
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,220
what the hell do you want?

56
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,400
Why did you betray my parents?

57
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,300
Why are you so serious?

58
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,390
Isn't that to make your play

59
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,620
look more real?

60
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,640
What happened?

61
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,680
Jiang Jun was locked in the elevator.

62
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,230
Luckily I got there in time,

63
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,060
and she didn't have any serious problems.

64
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,020
Who did it?

65
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,680
I checked the monitor.

66
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,060
It was an analyst in MH.

67
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,020
But I saw no reason

68
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,220
or need for her

69
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,820
to do such a thing to Jiang Jun.

70
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,740
It was Lin Taimo.

71
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,830
He may have thought that

72
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,900
the reason Jiang Jun tried to join MH

73
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,960
is to investigate her father's case,

74
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,460
so he tried to kill her.

75
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,860
In that case,

76
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,140
Mr. Jiang's death must not have been
an accident.

77
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,020
What's on your mind?

78
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,980
I've been investigating Lin Taimo for years.

79
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,340
But this guy is so cunning.

80
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,540
I can hardly find anything negative about him.

81
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,140
I wanted to get hard evidence

82
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,740
and then reveal all the evidence of his guilt.

83
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,940
But I am afraid that he will do harm
to Jiang Jun again,

84
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,020
so I have to make war on him at once.

85
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,020
Lin Taimo is a man with many enemies,

86
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,820
so he must have his own men

87
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,740
in MH and CSRC.

88
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,700
If you want to expose him

89
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,460
on the basis of the information you have,

90
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,940
you may be turned back

91
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,580
before it reaches the chairman's desk.

92
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,820
Of course I know.

93
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,140
That's why I haven't done anything.

94
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,500
But

95
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,940
it's not so easy to

96
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,740
get hard evidence.

97
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,030
He trusts Linda so much.

98
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,580
Can we start with her?

99
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,260
I have fallen out with her,

100
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,670
so she won't help me for the time being.

101
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,860
How about this?

102
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,500
We've been fighting for years in this circle,

103
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,760
and everyone knows it.

104
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,420
Why don't I surrender to Lin Taimo?

105
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,140
The enemy of your enemy can be your friend.

106
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,470
Who says I can't be friends with Lin Taimo?

107
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,940
You?

108
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,760
You think too little of Lin Taimo.

109
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,630
What will make him believe you?

110
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,060
So at this point,

111
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,720
we need someone unexpected

112
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,000
to cooperate.

113
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,159
Dr. Zhu of Chenxin Technology?

114
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,789
Isn't he a client of Yuan Shuai's?

115
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:36,500
How do you know

116
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,960
they traded power and money with each other?

117
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,450
I fought Yuan Shuai for three years.

118
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:44,340
Arguably, no one in the investment banking world

119
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,860
knows him better than I do,

120
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,060
except himself.

121
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,500
As for Dr. Zhu,

122
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,270
as long as we can give him

123
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,620
what Yuan Shuai can't,

124
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,540
he will certainly be of use to us.

125
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,320
Are you sure?

126
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,550
Of course.

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Let him in.

128
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,580
Now that you've arrived,

129
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,380
I'm sure you know

130
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,660
why Du Lei asked you to come.

131
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,820
Yes.

132
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,560
To destroy Yuan Shuai.

133
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,620
You keep saying you want to destroy Yuan Shuai.

134
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,960
But where is the evidence?

135
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,150
I have the evidence.

136
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,980
I once borrowed some money from him.

137
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,740
That was a large amount of money.

138
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,060
I paid the money back this time
through a private account.

139
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,190
There is no documentary evidence
for this transaction.

140
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,140
That’s interesting.

141
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,180
Lin Taimo

142
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,900
may not have trusted me completely,

143
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,660
so he asked me to join MH.

144
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,180
I guess he's trying to keep an eye on me.

145
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,380
Secretary Bai was watching my flight.

146
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,980
But in order to avoid unnecessary mistakes,

147
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,440
we should start our plan as soon as possible.

148
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,470
Here's the information you asked for.

149
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Jia Yuanji,

150
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,040
the only son of GE's Chairman.

151
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,260
He had been studying abroad before

152
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,060
[Personal Profile of Jia Yuanji]

153
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,900
and recently returned home.

154
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,460
He likes listening to music.

155
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,420
I’m told that he's been singing
in the Bar Street lately.

156
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,300
And with his personality,

157
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,820
he's not particularly easy to get along with.

158
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,260
There's no one in the world

159
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,660
I can't deal with yet.

160
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,300
Yuan Shuai,

161
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,220
I may never get used to

162
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,140
your inexplicable confidence.

163
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,380
But I’ll warn you about one thing.

164
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,660
In this period of time,

165
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,420
Jiang Jun should not be allowed to

166
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,550
fall into the slightest bit of danger.

167
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,620
Also,

168
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
don't do anything inappropriate to her.

169
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,180
Otherwise,

170
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,920
I will not leave you alone.

171
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,260
Don't worry.

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,260
I am

173
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,260
not a man to take advantage of others.

174
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,720
Besides, about Jiang Jun,

175
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,220
I still have confidence.

176
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,300
But

177
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,140
she's already suspicious of me

178
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,670
because she doesn't believe you're corrupt.

179
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,780
So, Zhu Youyi…

180
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,780
It seems that our little sheep
has become smarter.

181
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,640
Hello, Dr. Zhu.

182
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,700
What's the matter, Yuan Shuai?

183
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,140
Just say it this time.

184
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,070
This time, it's easier.

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,220
You only have to deal with one person.

186
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,020
She should be coming to you soon.

187
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,860
Rest assured.

188
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,340
My acting skills have become better and better

189
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,860
since last time.

190
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I don’t even have to try.

191
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,260
You don't have to act this time.

192
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,320
There is only one thing you need to do.

193
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,040
That is, you know nothing.

194
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,620
All right, all right.

195
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,740
I'm not gonna say anything.

196
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,940
Hope Zhu Youyi

197
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,400
can withstand the pressure of Jiang Jun.

198
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,260
[Chenxin Technology Co., LTD.]

199
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,020
Dr. Zhu,

200
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,260
someone from MH has come

201
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,160
to show you the follow-up information
on the financing plan.

202
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,060
Just say I'm not here

203
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,920
and give it to the finance office.

204
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,740
Dr. Zhu, are you going to appear from nowhere,

205
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,340
or just disappear from here?

206
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,660
Ms. Jiang,

207
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,990
what are you doing here?

208
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,660
You're in a good mood.

209
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,740
Playing games?

210
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,580
I know why you're here,

211
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,740
but I'm afraid I can't answer

212
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,740
any of your questions.

213
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,780
You misunderstood.

214
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,020
I'm here to present you the newly proposed

215
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,620
supervision plan of Chenxin after financing.

216
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,900
I see.

217
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,100
Thank you very much.

218
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,820
What kind of game are you playing?

219
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,860
I've just developed an motion sensing game

220
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,260
for the next step of the Internet of Things.

221
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,060
I'm trying out its sensitivity.

222
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,160
It looks interesting.

223
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,540
May I have the honor to experience it?

224
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,820
Really?

225
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,030
You want to play?

226
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,020
Ok, ok.

227
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,420
Just so you can help me with the test.

228
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,700
It’s good, Dr. Zhu.

229
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,180
You're good at the game.

230
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,340
Just so so.

231
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,740
Chenxin has also been on the rise recently.

232
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,220
I heard you won a prize a few days ago.

233
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,280
Congratulations!

234
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,710
Thank you very much!

235
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,060
But I really didn't expect

236
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,140
Yuan Shuai to be

237
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,620
so cynical and mercenary.

238
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,400
No. It’s not like that.

239
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,060
Obviously, he sees that your company
is developing well

240
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,900
and wants to get a piece of the pie.

241
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,500
He's the scum of the investment banking world.

242
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,940
He isn’t. Don’t say that.

243
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,260
Really?

244
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,540
Could it be

245
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,540
you two acting together
for someone else to watch?

246
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,060
No. It’s not like that, either.

247
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,500
Well… I…

248
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,580
I know nothing.

249
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,580
Ms. Jiang, don't ask anymore.

250
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,550
They won't let me say anything.

251
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,420
They?

252
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,500
Who are they?

253
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,190
I’m busy.

254
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,700
See yourself out.

255
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,630
Well… Anyone

256
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,380
can hand me the information?

257
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,500
And my design… is…

258
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,740
Since Dr. Zhu won't say anything,

259
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,500
I won't ask.

260
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,620
I'm leaving.

261
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,420
But,

262
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,000
thank you all the same.

263
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,540
What did I just say?

264
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,280
I didn't say anything.

265
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,740
She asked two questions.

266
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,670
But I didn't answer either of them.

267
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,220
Li,

268
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,460
are you at the West World? I’ll see you there.

269
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,180
No, I’m not. Why?

270
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,900
I have an emergency.
I need to speak to Xiaochuan.

271
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,380
That’s ok.

272
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,500
I'll find him myself without you.

273
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,580
No, don’t!

274
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,580
Li Xiaochuan

275
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,820
is a little difficult for ordinary people
to communicate with.

276
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,420
It's not like you don't know.

277
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,380
Well, I’ll go there with you.

278
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,110
Ok.

279
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Jun has an important business,

280
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,820
so of course I will go with her.

281
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,460
But I don't want to see that man.

282
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,660
Not at all!

283
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,620
That’s it.

284
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Xu Li,

285
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,990
why are you here?

286
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,900
It's okay. You don't have to panic.

287
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,780
I'm not looking for you.

288
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,460
Jun wants to see you.

289
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,000
Xiaochuan,

290
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,450
can you check for me

291
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,860
where Yuan Shuai is now?

292
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,060
Ok.

293
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,400
Xiaochuan,

294
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,980
tomorrow afternoon at 14:00 Beijing time,

295
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,780
help me

296
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,060
make the Internet Protocol addresses

297
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,300
of both my mobile phone and computer

298
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,060
in Tanzania.

299
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,460
Ok.

300
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,620
If Jiang Jun comes to you,

301
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,260
just say you don't know where I am.

302
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,060
If you have

303
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,540
your virtual Internet Protocol addresses ready,

304
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,100
show them to her.

305
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,220
But why?

306
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,990
Aren't you lying to her?

307
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,380
I can't tell you yet.

308
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,830
I'll explain to you when the time is right.

309
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,740
[Yuan Shuai, Dodoma of Africa]

310
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,579
Here.

311
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,670
It turns out he went to Africa.

312
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,210
It’s a long distance.

313
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,819
It turns out?

314
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,670
You knew he would go abroad?

315
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,580
He said he was going abroad,

316
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,700
but he didn't tell me where.

317
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,420
That's why

318
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,460
I said that.

319
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,460
But when I asked you this morning,

320
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,660
you clearly said he had not contacted you.

321
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,460
Yes.

322
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,060
You…

323
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,260
He didn't contact me when you asked,

324
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,700
but he did after you asked.

325
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,140
So…

326
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,900
Your statements are inconsistent.

327
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,630
There must be something wrong.

328
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,780
Are you going to tell me or not?

329
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,240
Africa.

330
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,700
So you are not going to tell me?

331
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,460
Li, let’s go!

332
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,980
Wait!

333
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,100
Xu Li,

334
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,300
I want to talk to you.

335
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,470
But I have nothing to say to you.

336
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,220
-Xu Li...
-Well…

337
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Well…

338
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,060
Before…

339
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,700
Before you ask me,

340
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,580
let me ask you a question.

341
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,700
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

342
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,740
If you don't tell me, I'll go.

343
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,980
Shanghai!

344
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:04,860
But…

345
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,680
Yuan Shuai is in Shanghai now!

346
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,910
You just betrayed your brother like that?

347
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,790
He just asked me not to tell you or anyone else.

348
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,300
Xu Li is no one else.

349
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,150
Where is Yuan Shuai now?

350
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,020
Li,

351
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,620
if he doesn't want to tell me,
there must be a reason.

352
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,380
I’m leaving.

353
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,750
I think Xiaochuan has something to say
to you in private.

354
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,940
What are you trying to say? Say it.

355
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,060
I'd like to apologize

356
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,470
for what i said to you last time.

357
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,540
Well, don't apologize.

358
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,580
It's not your problem that you don't like me.

359
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,030
It’s not your fault.

360
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,460
No.

361
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,820
Then do you like me?

362
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,000
I thought about it for a long time.

363
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,940
You

364
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,780
have low IQ

365
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,030
and average education.

366
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,180
We grew up in a different environment.

367
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,820
Our background, personality,
and hobbies are also different.

368
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,060
Honestly,

369
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,500
sometimes I really don't understand
what you're thinking.

370
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,740
And that's probably why

371
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,220
we're only a one-percent match.

372
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,820
But, I…

373
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,840
Is that what you're trying to say?

374
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,980
One percent.

375
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,300
One percent.

376
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,020
I know.

377
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,580
I

378
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,260
may not be

379
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,980
perfect enough

380
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,660
for you.

381
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,300
But,

382
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,940
would you mind

383
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,500
not stressing it over and over again?

384
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,820
I…

385
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,340
But…

386
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,060
Stop talking.

387
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,300
Mr. Li, I'm sorry to have bothered you.

388
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,160
I'll never come and see you again.

389
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,180
I…

390
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,620
But

391
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,820
I can't seem to stop myself

392
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,660
from liking you.

393
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,100
Can you wait for me?

394
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,940
I want us to be

395
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,860
a one hundred percent match.

396
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,100
[Zhendan]

397
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,300
Hello, everyone.

398
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,380
I'm the lead singer and lead guitarist,
Jia Yuanji.

399
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,940
We are

400
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,660
the Jixiangruyi Band.

401
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,420
Today we are going to present to you

402
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
a new song of ours,

403
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,220
Smash the Blue BMW.

404
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,020
♫ Want to act impulsively ♫

405
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,500
♫ And smash the blue BMW♫

406
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,900
♫ Don't blame me for being pompous♫

407
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,020
♫ Smash the blue BMW♫

408
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,620
What?

409
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,260
Mr. Ji,

410
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,630
I am begging you.

411
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,430
Please stop.

412
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,590
You see, I haven't got any guests here.

413
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,020
I won't allow it.

414
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,630
This is our band's tour.

415
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,540
Yes.

416
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,500
You…

417
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,860
Isn't there someone?

418
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,580
It’s not that.

419
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,040
How can I do business with only one customer?

420
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,940
I think his music sounds good.

421
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,620
You… You like it?

422
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,140
Yes.

423
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,100
Jixiangruyi Band, right?

424
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,470
I think your music is

425
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,420
very expressive.

426
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,060
It is full of cries of injustice to the world,

427
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,740
especially the condemnation and indictment

428
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,940
of the owner of the blue BMW.

429
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,420
It's very pretentious, naked,

430
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,540
and very real.

431
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,740
You get me, Sir!

432
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,020
Wait!

433
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,380
Do you know anything about music?

434
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,460
I've been running bars for so many years.

435
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,620
I've never heard such bad music.

436
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,620
How come it is expressive?

437
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,900
You’re terrific!

438
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Sir.

439
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,460
Although I don't know much about music,

440
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,660
I think music is

441
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,420
an artistic tool to express one’s inner feelings

442
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,780
and his view of the world.

443
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,900
Jixiangruyi Band

444
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,740
is young, vigorous

445
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,540
and full of vitality.

446
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,100
We should encourage such bands.

447
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:09,900
Am I right?

448
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,420
Well said!

449
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,420
You really are my soul mate.

450
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,260
I finally found you.

451
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,020
Sir.

452
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,620
If anything happens to you in the future,

453
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,780
just let me know.

454
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,260
I’ll protect you.

455
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,400
You protect me?

456
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,100
Yes. I really like you.

457
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,820
Ok, then.

458
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:28,780
How about this?

459
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,460
You come home with me tonight,

460
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,560
and we can have a good discussion.

461
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,660
Ok.

462
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,060
Ms. Wang,

463
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,110
anything to eat? I’m starving.

464
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,150
The Chairman is on a video conference.

465
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,300
Sir,

466
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,500
if there's anything you want to eat,
just tell Ms. Wang.

467
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
She is a good cook.

468
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,500
Anything will do. Thanks, Ms. Wang.

469
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,140
Ok.

470
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:54,820
Let’s go.

471
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,660
Are we going in now?

472
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,950
Go to my room and listen to my songs.

473
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,220
Ms. Wang.

474
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,420
Well,

475
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,940
no pepper for my midnight snack,

476
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,060
and no…

477
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,620
Keep your voice down.

478
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,260
-If my father hears us, we’re done.
-I enjoy…

479
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,620
I enjoy a light meal.

480
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,960
You know you should get your ass back?

481
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,620
Dad.

482
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,300
You are so perceptive.

483
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,500
You heard me.

484
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,060
By the way, this is my friend.

485
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,040
His name is…

486
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,840
Yuan Shuai.

487
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,340
The executive director in the investment banking department
of the rival firm.

488
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,100
What are you doing at my house at this hour?

489
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,300
Mr. Jia,

490
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,820
I want to tell you something

491
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,940
about the future

492
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,340
and reputation of GE.

493
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,470
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

494
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,500
Go back to sleep.

495
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,300
Dad, this is…

496
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,060
How can you…

497
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,990
I'll stop your credit cards
if you don't go to bed now.

498
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,390
Meet me in my room later.

499
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,440
Please have a seat.

500
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,160
I've got everything you said.

501
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,980
If Linda is really involved in the insider trading

502
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,340
and investment corruption,

503
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,940
cleaning house

504
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,870
and maintaining GE's brand

505
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,020
are the right thing to do.

506
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,060
But you asked me to investigate Lin Taimo.

507
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,140
What good would it do to GE?

508
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,860
I know what you mean, Mr. Jia.

509
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,460
But now two senior executives of MH and GE

510
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
are committing crimes
and making huge profits together.

511
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,740
Once they are caught,

512
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,060
it will be a matter of honor

513
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,460
or disgrace for all of us.

514
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,110
Now it is already difficult

515
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,340
for the industry to regulate corruption

516
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,860
in the private equity investments.

517
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,140
So, it can only rely on the moral consciousness

518
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,220
and strict self-examination
of our securities practitioners.

519
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,900
So, Mr. Jia,

520
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,500
please…

521
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,100
Don't worry, young man.

522
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,380
I agree with everything you said.

523
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,540
That's why I admire you

524
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,340
and am willing to sit down and listen to you.

525
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,660
But I'm a businessman.

526
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,620
I can do good and uphold justice,

527
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,700
but I have to make an equivalent trade-off.

528
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,920
I understand that.

529
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Mr. Jia,

530
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,660
what can I do for you?

531
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,620
You have discharged yourself from MH.

532
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,100
So how about coming to GE

533
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,600
after this non-competition period?

534
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,260
Jiang Jun, your express.

535
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,340
I got it for you.

536
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,900
Thank you very much.

537
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,830
You’re welcome.

538
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,900
What did you buy?

539
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,100
Voice recorder? What do you need it for?

540
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,220
I'm afraid there will be times

541
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,380
when I can't remember
what was said at the meeting.

542
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,460
It'll be easier for me if I record it.

543
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,540
How considerate.

544
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,700
Come in.

545
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,340
Mr. Du, there is a document
that needs your signature.

546
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,540
Ok, let me have a look.

547
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,260
I'm sorry.

548
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,580
Done.

549
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,440
Mr… Mr. Lin.

550
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,190
Are you reporting for work?

551
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,180
I’m leaving.

552
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,700
[Du Lei]

553
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,020
[West World]

554
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,780
Hello.

555
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,060
I like you.

556
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,220
I really like you.

557
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,220
I really like you.

558
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,980
Who’s that?

559
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,060
How can I hear someone saying he likes me?

560
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,460
I'm hearing voices?

561
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,680
Or is he still haunting me?

562
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,940
Li, I’m here. You can go.

563
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,020
You are here.

564
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,500
Thank you.

565
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,950
I am just going to check on my niece.

566
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,140
Her father disappeared.

567
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,560
Her mother is exhausted because of this.

568
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,740
She's probably still working overtime
at this hour.

569
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,900
Poor child.

570
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,980
Yes.

571
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,160
The child has a good appetite.

572
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,820
She’s probably still at home

573
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,900
with an empty stomach at the moment.

574
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,140
She is so pathetic.

575
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
How can there be

576
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,500
such a poor child now?

577
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,470
You’d better go.

578
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,940
Don't let the child suffer any more.

579
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,870
Okay, I'm going.

580
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,100
Thank you.

581
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,980
You are a left-behind child now.

582
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,640
Do you know? Behave yourself.

583
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,660
Your parents are breaking up.

584
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
I don’t know where they are now.

585
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,580
It's lucky for you

586
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,620
to have a kind aunt like me.

587
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,420
You should cherish me, you know?

588
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,500
Come and rest for a while.

589
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,300
Wealth.

590
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,260
Wealth,

591
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,820
do you think men are all changeable?

592
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:19,340
Or is it that Jun and I
happen to have met the bad men?

593
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,500
Keep your eyes open for boyfriends
in the future.

594
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,540
You know that?

595
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,550
I’m such a good girl.

596
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,540
But he doesn't cherish me.

597
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,870
He's bound to regret it!

598
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,180
Wealth,

599
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,260
let’s go home for dinner.

600
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,270
There's nothing

601
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,630
that can't be solved with one meal, right?

602
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:40,710
Let’s go.

603
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,580
You are still here, Jiang Jun?

604
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,980
So are you.

605
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
I had to work late,

606
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,510
so I went down to buy coffee.

607
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,910
I’m going. Go back to your work.

608
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,310
Wait, Jiang Jun.

609
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,030
I'd like to have a word with you.

610
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,700
Go ahead.

611
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,140
Mr. Du replaced Mr. Yuan.

612
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,620
I know you might think there's something wrong
with that.

613
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,060
But I think it is quite necessary for me

614
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,590
to remind you of something.

615
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,580
After all, Mr. Du is on Mr. Lin's side.

616
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,380
If you do anything to him now,

617
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,220
it will be to your disadvantage.

618
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Mr. Lin seems

619
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,940
kind as usual.

620
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,780
In fact, it was him

621
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,640
who instigated me to trap you
in the elevator last time.

622
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,310
You mean Mr Lin, Lin Taimo?

623
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,639
I always thought it was weird.

624
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,280
He’s the one who hired you.

625
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,380
But why would he treat you like that?

626
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,659
I think you should think about it yourself

627
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,530
and see if you've offended him

628
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,860
recently.

629
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,860
Okay, I get it.

630
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,820
Thank you.

631
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,020
Bye.

632
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,130
Ok.

633
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,330
Jun,

634
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,200
I know you've been working overtime lately,

635
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,550
so I helped you clean your room

636
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,610
and walked Wealth.

637
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,910
Take good care of yourself.

638
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,190
Eat regularly.

639
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,030
P.S.

640
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,070
Most importantly,

641
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,070
take care of yourself no matter
how busy you are.

642
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,350
You like MIHOO masks.

643
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,710
I have prepared them for you.

644
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,630
Remember to use them.

645
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,360
Always be the best of yourself.

646
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,250
Sincerely, Li.

647
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,690
Hello, Jun.

648
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:23,440
Hello, Li.

649
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,040
I saw the note you wrote to me.

650
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,660
You even got me face masks.

651
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,790
That's so sweet.

652
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,760
Sure enough, you love me the most.

653
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,460
But how do you know

654
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,590
I like yogurt of this brand these days?

655
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,980
I know you're busy these days.

656
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,660
Take care of yourself.

657
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,260
Wait.

658
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,460
What yogurt were you talking about?

659
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,100
The yogurt in the fridge.

660
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,180
Fridge?

661
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,740
I didn't tidy your fridge.

662
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,660
Didn't you buy me all this fruit and bread

663
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,700
and ice cream in my fridge?

664
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,940
No.

665
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,540
Jun, I have to go.

666
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,400
I’m going to the supermarket.

667
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,460
I'll talk to you some other time.

668
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,060
There's something I want to tell you.

669
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,580
Ok.

670
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,060
Bye.

671
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,540
Didn't you disappear?

672
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,240
Trying to fool me.

673
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,460
[MIHOO]

674
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,470
It seems that you do have a conscience.

675
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,380
Mr. Du, how is everything going?

676
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,060
Are you used to working in MH?

677
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,700
This is the work assigned by Mr. Lin.

678
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,430
Naturally, I will be taken care of
in all aspects.

679
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,780
How do you like the room

680
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,320
I've arranged for you?

681
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:20,260
You decorated it yourself. Of course I like it.

682
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,600
I’m flattered.

683
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,900
I’m glad to do this for you.

684
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,160
It satisfies both sides. Of course I’m glad.

685
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,620
It’s considerate of you.

686
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,460
However,

687
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,700
it seems that you are not

688
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,180
getting along well with her.

689
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,510
Some things can't be hurried.
We need to take it slow.

690
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,900
Is there any news about Yuan Shuai?

691
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,020
He hasn't taken action lately.

692
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,550
He is behaving himself.

693
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,580
You know,

694
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,940
I've let the whole industry

695
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,100
know about him.

696
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
It's too hard for him

697
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,510
to build a new image.

698
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,380
If he did not have to get involved

699
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,110
in the case of Jiangnan Flavor,

700
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,400
I would not have embarrassed him.

701
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,860
Jiangnan Flavor?

702
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,900
Is there any news about Yuan Shuai?

703
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,780
He hasn't taken action lately.

704
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,110
He is behaving himself.

705
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,060
You know,

706
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,620
I've let the whole industry

707
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,580
know about him.

708
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,900
It's too hard for him

709
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,030
to build a new image.

710
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,580
If he did not have to get involved

711
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,310
in the case of Jiangnan Flavor,

712
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,880
I would not have embarrassed him.

713
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,370
So, you are saying that

714
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,330
Lin Taimo didn’t come back

715
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,500
for the gang rivalry,

716
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,460
but for the case of Jiangnan Flavor.

717
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,340
Yes, that was my father's company.

718
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,140
I'm sorry.

719
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,180
I didn't know much about you.

720
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,580
So they were trying to get at you.

721
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,340
The reason they're targeting Yuan Shuai

722
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,780
is that Yuan Shuai is helping you

723
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,180
with your father's case.

724
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,140
I had always thought

725
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,620
there was something wrong with this case,

726
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,400
but I didn't expect that
it would turn out this way.

727
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
But I think,

728
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,440
since Yuan Shuai doesn't want you to know,

729
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,040
that means he knows it's dangerous

730
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,160
to pursue this case.

731
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,490
He is worried about you.

732
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
He does everything for reasons.

733
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,880
He has set the stage.

734
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,520
I suggest we wait and see what happens.

735
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,280
But I learned from Zhu Youyi that

736
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,720
Yuan Shuai was trying to retreat
in order to advance.

737
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,080
And it looks like someone else

738
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,280
is helping him.

739
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,640
Could it be Su Chang?

740
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,250
I don't think it's Su Chang.

741
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,200
Su Chang followed him and left, too.

742
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,880
This person should be someone

743
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,580
who can work with him in MH.

744
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Then it must be Mr. Fan, Fan Qichang.

745
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,620
Yuan Shuai was Mr. Fan's favorite disciple.

746
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,000
Although he was suppressed by Mr. Lin,

747
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,440
he still has some influence in MH.

748
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,040
It’s not Mr. Fan.

749
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,920
If Mr. Fan takes any action,

750
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,040
the cunning Lin Taimo

751
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,200
must be aware of that.

752
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
It's less likely to be Secretary Bai.

753
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
Secretary Bai was carefully cultivated
by Lin Taimo.

754
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,770
It is impossible for him to defect.

755
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,240
It would be too dangerous

756
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,520
for Yuan Shuai to play tricks on him.

757
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,160
Could it be…?

758
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,440
Yes.

759
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,880
I think it’s him.

760
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,360
From the beginning of the tip-off,
they are setting the stage.

761
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,160
He pretends to surrender and
then secretly works with Yuan Shuai.

762
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,200
They should be still looking for

763
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,730
the most crucial evidence against Lin Taimo.

764
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,280
Come in.

765
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,160
Mr. Lin, here's a document.

766
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,420
I'll have to ask you to stamp it yourself.

767
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,760
Ok. Wait.

768
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,720
Done.

769
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,680
Ok.

770
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,280
Thanks. I’ll leave you alone.

771
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,880
Ok.

772
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:17,800
Yuan Shuai.

773
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,880
According to the clues you provided,

774
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,640
I have investigated the information
of all the shareholders of C Group,

775
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,500
among which, Huixing Industrial

776
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,120
which accounts for 5.36 percent of the shares,
is very suspicious.

777
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,980
Five years ago,

778
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,440
it was a subsidiary of the Du Group.

779
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,840
But it was the small company that cashed

780
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,800
1.02 percent of C Group’s shares,

781
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,080
about 320 million yuan,

782
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,440
at the top of its listing price.

783
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,880
The company later went its own way,

784
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,600
but it still held shares of C Group.

785
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,000
Who is their legal representative?

786
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,860
This is the most suspicious part.

787
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,400
Its legal representative

788
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,640
is an ordinary former secretary

789
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,680
of the Du Group.

790
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,800
And it has nothing to do with Lin Taimo?

791
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,730
Temporarily no.

792
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,840
Are you sure the person behind Linda

793
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,960
is Lin Taimo?

794
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,160
I’m sure.

795
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,520
If the 5.36 percent of the shares
was all cashed,

796
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,480
the amount would exceed 1 billion.

797
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,320
Lin Taimo will not give it up.

798
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,480
Clever as he is,

799
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,920
he must have found someone
to hold the stock for him.

800
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,640
Linda is not related to him,

801
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,200
so he won't trust her so much.

802
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,920
They must have an agreement.

803
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,880
Mr. Jia, please help me
make an appointment with Linda

804
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,420
in your name tomorrow.

805
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:33,880
Ok.

806
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,480
Linda,

807
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,410
you are here.

808
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,540
Mr. Jia, why are you in such a good mood today,

809
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,000
inviting me to your home?

810
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,360
I asked you out today

811
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,640
because I have a friend who wants to meet you.

812
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,080
Yuan.

813
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,350
Yuan Shuai.

814
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,020
Love Is Sweet
