Love Is Sweet

Episode 4

5
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
So weak.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
I told you that MH is not for you.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,930
You just didn’t believe me.

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
You should have left.

9
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,400
Boss, where are you?

10
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,079
We have come out.

11
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
No need to worry about us.

12
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,220
You can go home now.

13
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,170
I have been through so many difficulties.

14
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,450
This time it’s just a pack of sanitary napkins

15
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,200
Just a small case.

16
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,400
Hello, welcome.

17
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,640
Goodness!

18
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,760
No way!

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,130
This monster even tracks me down here?

20
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,530
Even sanitary pads have so many kinds.

21
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,079
What Mr. Ma said was right.

22
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,000
You get the market

23
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,050
if you can catch the women’s taste.

24
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,800
No! Crap!

25
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,480
I can’t let him recognize me.

26
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
The suit he wore that day

27
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,000
looked really expensive.

28
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,360
It will kill me

29
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,720
if I have to pay.

30
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,200
No. I haven’t finished my task.

31
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,280
I even have come up with the name for

32
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,680
the child of me and my boy.

33
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,320
I can’t be knocked down here.

34
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Other’s boyfriend

35
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,460
will never be disappointing.

36
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,200
Yes. He is so sweet.

37
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,880
Excuse me!

38
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,520
Hello, welcome.

39
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,000
You…

40
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
What’s wrong?

41
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,320
What can I help you?

42
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,620
Is there a thermos cup?

43
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,040
Of course. Please wait.

44
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,740
Sir, the thermos cup you want.

45
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,340
Fill it with hot water.

46
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
OK. Please wait.

47
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,000
It’s my pleasure to help you.

48
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,160
Hold it.

49
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,280
OK.

50
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
I wonder

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
how it will feel if this bottle

52
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,460
of hot ginger tea with brown sugar

53
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,640
is splashed on your face.

54
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,480
My dear girlfriend?

55
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,760
Gosh.

56
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,680
You…

57
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,600
Are you the handsome guy my twin sister

58
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,680
accidentally spilled on

59
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
at the party last time?

60
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,320
My goodness.

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,840
You don’t know that.

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,600
After what happened last time,

63
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,720
my sister came home full of remorse.

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,810
In spite of our dissuasion,

65
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,010
she resolutely became a nun

66
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,480
in the nunnery at the south of the city

67
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,280
and shaved her head bald.

68
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,640
Please forgive her

69
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,080
for being so sincere, OK?

70
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,460
It’s easy then.

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,720
I will call the police.

72
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Then I will know if you are twins.

73
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,320
Wait! I’ll pay for your suit!

74
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,159
What’s the number of the police?

75
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,720
11…

76
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,280
Sir!

77
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,360
I’m sorry.

78
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,800
I’m really sorry.

79
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,680
What do you want?

80
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,400
Take whatever you like.

81
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,330
The bill is on me.

82
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Bodhisattva.

83
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Thank you.

84
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,560
Don’t say that.

85
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,600
Goodbye.

86
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Welcome next time.

87
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,400
Goodness!

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,120
I didn’t wait for him to come,

89
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,080
but a devil came!

90
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,960
You’re awake?

91
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,920
You…

92
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
You could have woken me up.

93
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,880
I still have some work to do.

94
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,520
I’m not waiting for you especially.

95
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,919
Don't flatter yourself.

96
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,770
They are over there.

97
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,240
That’s too much.

98
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
They are on discount.

99
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,040
What?

100
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
Ginger tea with brown sugar.

101
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,040
Thank you.

102
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Take it easy.

103
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,410
Be cautious of the heat.

104
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,920
How is it?

105
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,880
It’s warm.

106
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,730
Jiang Jun, you’re back?

107
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,720
What did you buy? So much.

108
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,560
Snacks?

109
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,560
Why are they all pads?

110
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,060
Are you doing evaluation?

111
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,610
It’s not me who bought them.

112
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,200
This…

113
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,210
Aren’t they the things
Yuan Shuai bought in my store?

114
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,920
And this thermos cup.

115
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
Is it brown sugar tea inside?

116
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,360
And this coat…

117
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,730
Is this from Yuan Shuai?

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:51,800
My god.

119
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,520
What happened between you?

120
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,760
What?

121
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,920
Nothing.

122
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,560
It’s just…

123
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,690
You know,

124
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,520
I really should go to the temple to worship.

125
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,840
Every time I met Yuan Shuai,

126
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,370
no good thing would happen.

127
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,140
Can you believe it?

128
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,800
In that whole tall building,

129
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,640
only our floor had a blackout.

130
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,600
Then

131
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,960
just Yuan Shuai and I

132
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
were locked in the meeting room.

133
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,000
And my period

134
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,960
came in advance just at the time!

135
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,400
So,

136
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,840
when you were in trouble,

137
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,900
Yuan Shuai not only lent you his coat,

138
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,850
but also bought you so many pads

139
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
and brown sugar tea.

140
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,920
Well…

141
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,240
He still has a conscience,

142
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,840
so he helped me out this time.

143
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,120
Gosh,

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,120
what a story of domineering CEO!

145
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,760
The hero and heroine are locked in the elevator.

146
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,360
And the heroine’s claustrophobia breaks out…

147
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,720
Enough.

148
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,040
Stop your imagination.

149
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
Even if he is the domineering CEO,

150
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,250
I’m not the pure and silly girl.

151
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,520
So boring.

152
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,600
Why are you in my home?

153
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:52,840
Right,

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,080
I was about to tell you this.

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,000
My roommate said

156
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,080
there would be a meditation

157
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,360
for three days.

158
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,840
So I have to take refuge

159
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
in your place for three days.

160
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
Welcome.

161
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,120
Finally I get a charmingly naive girl
to accompany.

162
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,760
Why am I “charmingly naive”?

163
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,720
The weather is being dry lately.

164
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,600
I’m using a facial mask,
called “Charmingly Naive”.

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
I think that name suits you.

166
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,280
You are also charmingly naive.

167
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
Hey!

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,920
By the way,

169
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,860
I remember I got one more box of it.

170
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,000
You can use it.

171
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,520
One mask per day,

172
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,080
to moisturize your skin.

173
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
Love you.

174
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Let me have a look.

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,400
Li,

176
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,220
you’re making dinner?

177
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
It smells so good!

178
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,120
Oh, no! My soup!

179
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,380
I almost forgot it!

180
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,400
No. No. It can’t be.

[Future of Chinese Economy]

182
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,770
Boss, this is

183
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,500
the schedule next week to treat our clients.

184
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,600
Sign it if there is no problem

185
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,400
and I will book the tickets and hotel.

186
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:37,880
OK.

187
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,080
Boss, I need to answer a call.

188
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,520
Go.

189
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,040
Have you checked the list of staff departures

190
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,170
I asked you to check?

191
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,960
I have contacted them.

192
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,520
And I will have visits this afternoon.

193
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,600
Seize the day.

194
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,240
Here.

195
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
It’s not my pen.

196
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,640
Mr. Li, I’m here to ask you

197
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,480
some questions about Kelang Pharmacy

198
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,800
on behalf of MH.

199
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,140
[Li Xiang Former Accountant of Kelang Pharmacy]

200
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,360
MH?

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,240
I have quit my job.

202
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,480
So, you shouldn’t ask me anything

203
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,640
about Kelang.

204
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,400
I know that

205
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,960
you didn’t have a pleasant leaving.

206
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,040
I heard that they fired you.

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,640
I think it all has passed.

208
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,160
There is no need to bring it up again.

209
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,760
Although it has passed,

210
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,040
I believe the impact on you

211
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,760
has not been finished yet.

212
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,760
According to what I got from Kelang,

213
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,160
they said you had a stain on your work.

214
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,200
Is that true?

215
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,560
I was the one who spotted

216
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,320
the stain on their work!

217
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,800
How come it's me again?

218
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,200
You found other people’s mistake,

219
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,930
but you were the one to be fired?

220
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,240
Anyway, forget it.

221
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,850
I don’t want to be in any trouble again.

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,800
Please leave.

223
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,380
If you were afraid of trouble,

224
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,160
you wouldn’t have been fired back then.

225
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,680
I was fired

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,000
because I wanted to stick to right things.

227
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,560
But, is that meaningful?

228
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,000
Is that fair for me to get this result?

229
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,320
Mr. Li,

230
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,120
there is always a price worth paying.

231
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,640
Worth?

232
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,960
OK. Now look at me.

233
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,280
Now I can only idle the days

234
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,960
in a bookkeeping company every day.

235
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,200
I manage several companies,

236
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,340
which declare no tax every month.

237
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,920
My life now has

238
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
no future,

239
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,800
no hope,

240
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,880
and no promise!

241
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
I’m just living to be alive.

242
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,480
Then, you tell me,

243
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
is this the price

244
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,040
worth paying?

245
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
Sorry, Mr. Li.

246
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,650
I really…

247
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,600
Stop talking. Stop.

248
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,200
-Just go. Leave.
-Wait…

249
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,880
I don’t want to hear anything now.

250
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,480
Please let me say that…

251
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,140
I don’t want to hear it. Leave!

252
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,370
Just one last thing!

253
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,890
Go ahead.

254
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,960
If you decide

255
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,000
to be silent today,

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,320
more people will become the next victim

257
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,720
because of your silence.

258
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,720
I came here today because I believe

259
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,440
there may be something wrong with this.

260
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,320
This is your best

261
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,720
and only chance

262
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,040
to prove yourself now.

263
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:50,720
Done?

264
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
He even came earlier than me!

265
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,680
Such a punctual man must be

266
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,700
a good man with strong sense of responsibility.

267
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,600
Even his profile is so perfect!

268
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,840
And he is so devoted to work!

269
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
He is even able to work

270
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,240
so hard without supervision.

271
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,640
I have to get his WeChat contact

272
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,770
or his number today.

273
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,680
But he dislikes me to give him things.

274
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,920
Are you OK?

275
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,040
I… I’m fine.

276
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,760
But, your phone…

277
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
Let me take it to repair.

278
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,200
It seems difficult to pour it

279
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,480
right on his phone.

280
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,560
But if I pour it on his laptop,

281
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,560
the price is too high…

282
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,760
Excuse me. Is there any Red Bull?

283
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,360
Please wait! Let me get some.

284
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,440
Hello. The Red Bull you want…

285
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Where is he?

286
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,040
Please wait.

287
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,560
Hi. Here.

288
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,130
Mobile payment?

289
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,080
OK.

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,600
Thank you.

291
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,690
I can change money with him.

292
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,480
If he doesn’t have enough money,

293
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,920
I can get his contact perfectly.

294
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,500
Where is the money?

295
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,440
Why is the money gone?

296
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
No one there?

297
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,280
Sorry.

298
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,240
Did you see anyone

299
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,300
who stole my money?

300
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,720
No.

301
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,520
But…

302
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,120
You have left

303
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,680
the counter three times since the morning,

304
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,640
two of which were walking around me

305
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,210
trying to get my attention.

306
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,280
And the last time you went to get Red Bull.

307
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,610
If nothing happened during the first two,

308
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
then the thief must act

309
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,680
while you were

310
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,760
getting the Red Bull.

311
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,020
Then it’s not too late.

312
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,500
Let me call the police.

313
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,330
You want to call the police?

314
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,280
Then you need evidence.

315
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,500
There are four cameras in this store.

316
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,560
Do you know how to get the video out?

317
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,080
I know.

318
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,000
There is a camera shooting the counter.

319
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,730
But the property company
never came to repair it.

320
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,880
Let me have a look.

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Surveillance…

322
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,560
You didn’t spend more than three minutes

323
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,600
to fetch the Red Bull, did you?

324
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,960
There's only one person who meets the criteria

325
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,160
that we just talked about.

326
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:15,880
Him.

327
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,200
Yes,

328
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,280
it’s him!

329
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,040
He was the one who asked me away.

330
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,500
I will call the police now.

331
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,400
If you want to get the money,

332
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
then come with me.

333
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:42,340
[Fan Qichang Managing Director
of Securities Investment Department in MH]

334
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,360
You mean

335
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,720
Zhou of Kelang wants us to help him

336
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,440
to change the present chairman Deng Ke?

337
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,040
Three years ago,

338
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Deng Ke embezzled the company’s asset.

339
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,840
This kind of stain

340
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,960
will turn into a bomb sooner or later.

341
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,160
This old fox is the

342
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
second largest shareholder of Kelang.

343
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
He is forcing us to stand on his side.

344
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,440
After all, we also hold the shares of Kelang.

345
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
If Deng Ke’s stain is revealed,

346
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,960
it’s also a loss to us.

347
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,010
Is there any evidence for that?

348
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,010
We got a witness.

349
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,320
The evidence is still being verified.

350
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,120
Business is like a battlefield.

351
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,160
The battlefield is like a chess game.

352
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,520
You have to play first.

353
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,440
Now you know how to

354
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
deal with Kelang, right?

355
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,480
You mean

356
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400
to force Deng Ke to step down

357
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,860
at the joint board meeting

358
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,210
in Kelang tomorrow?

359
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,240
It is a good chance.

360
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,840
But isn’t the time left too short?

361
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,370
The chance is there,

362
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,660
and the readiness is sufficient.

363
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,080
It’s up to you

364
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,060
how to deal with it specifically.

365
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,560
I know how to do it now.

366
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,680
How is it going?

367
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,360
I will talk to him later.

368
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,810
He was a little defensive this afternoon.

369
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,160
Seems that your way is not effective.

370
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,840
We are going to have a meeting in Kelang.

371
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
At this point there are still

372
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,610
problems with the witness.

373
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,440
Then, congratulations.

374
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,920
You had two chances before.

375
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,800
Now there is only one.

376
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,340
[Li Xiang: I have thought about it. You were right.
I will attend the meeting tomorrow in time.]

377
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
Wait.

378
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,280
Mr. Yuan,

379
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,240
Li Xiang will attend the meeting
tomorrow in time.

380
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,440
That’s all my report.

381
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,080
See you.

382
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,760
That’s him.

383
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,340
Give my money back.

384
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,250
Are you insane? I didn’t steal your money.

385
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,600
Stop pretending.

386
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,440
I will give you three seconds.

387
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,280
If you don’t give my money back,

388
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,640
I will call the police right now.

389
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
If you say that again, I…

390
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,040
The camera in the store

391
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,840
is connected to the police.

392
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,200
Before we came out of there,

393
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
we called the police.

394
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,920
There is face recognition system now.

395
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,180
You’ll be recognized within 15 seconds.

396
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,080
Besides,

397
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,280
the clothes you wore when you stole the money

398
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,340
are right under your coat now, right?

399
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
So, if you want to run away,

400
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,200
then, hurry up.

401
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,360
How did you know that

402
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,780
he is the dustman here?

403
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,120
I met him a few times.

404
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,120
Every Tuesday night before your store closes,

405
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,380
he comes for discounted sushi and bread.

406
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,440
The guard here is actually quite strict.

407
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,680
If not the resident,

408
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
unregistered visitors

409
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,360
are not able to come in casually.

410
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,160
So I guess

411
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,400
he must be a worker here.

412
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,720
So,

413
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,760
you are a resident here?

414
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,320
It's much easier to get an access card

415
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,160
than to buy a house here.

416
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,440
Goodness.

417
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,960
Handsome, smart

418
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,800
and so warm-hearted.

419
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,760
He is totally a perfect boyfriend.

420
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,520
On behalf of MH,
I would like to add a new topic.

421
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,650
To make sure the merger goes smoothly,

422
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,680
I propose

423
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,960
the removal of Mr. Deng Ke from the post of chairman

424
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,320
The merger is at this crucial time.

425
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
You want to remove me?

426
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
That's a bit too much of a joke.

427
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,920
Mr. Deng,

428
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,520
you set up a bunker account three years ago

429
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,640
to transfer company assets.

430
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,540
To avoid the unpredictable risks in the future,

431
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,360
you must leave.

432
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,600
That’s totally nonsense.

433
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,360
How could it be?

434
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Don't talk nonsense without proof.

435
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,120
We found a witness.

436
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,720
Witness?

437
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,680
Where?

438
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,560
Him?

439
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,280
How can he be a witness?

440
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,320
Of course you don't want me to be the witness.

441
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,180
Because I know too much about you.

442
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me introduce myself.

443
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,400
I’m Li Xiang,

444
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,000
used to be an employee in the

445
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,200
Financial Department of Kelang Pharmacy.

446
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,800
Then I got fired

447
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,320
because I found some stains

448
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,600
of Deng Ke.

449
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,320
Stains?

450
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,360
My stains?

451
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,920
Yes.

452
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,920
There are some people

453
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,760
with stains in my company.

454
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,800
But, who are they?

455
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,000
I can tell everyone here that

456
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,440
in these people,

457
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,600
there are him

458
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,960
and his wife.

459
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,820
Why do you mention my wife?

460
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,240
I came here today

461
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,160
just to talk about you!

462
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,600
OK.

463
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,080
Then let’s talk about it.

464
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,000
He and his wife

465
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,080
used to work in our company

466
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,980
in the Financial Department.

467
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,160
But during the tenure,

468
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,880
they deliberately concealed their relationship,

469
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,080
cheated together and destroyed notes.

470
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,680
That’s why I fired them.

471
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,920
You came here today

472
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,780
just to take revenge on me, right?

473
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,800
You can ask him.

474
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,240
His wife is still in jail now.

475
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Am I right?

476
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,160
She made the mistake!

477
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Not me!

478
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,560
It’s none of my business.

479
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,360
Really?

480
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,410
You two even slept together every day.

481
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,960
How could you know nothing?

482
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,200
Or…

483
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,880
She counted your blemish

484
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
on herself

485
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,520
and went to jail for you?

486
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,840
You do have a good wife.

487
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,200
Let me tell you again!

488
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,160
She made the mistake!

489
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,520
It’s not my business!

490
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,120
So, to get rid of this,

491
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,960
you divorced her.

492
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,080
You are just a jerk.

493
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,260
And you even believe what a jerk said?

494
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,920
Then I really doubt

495
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,560
MH’s ability now.

496
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,600
I will tell what happened

497
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,480
to your Mr. Fan

498
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,080
in details.

499
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,800
I hope you

500
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,290
can give me a reasonable explanation.

501
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,520
The ball has been kicked off.

502
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,480
No player can leave the field.

503
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,560
Right?

504
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,730
How is Jiang Jun now?

505
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
She has been in there for half an hour.

506
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,920
I guess

507
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,570
she will be fired this time.

508
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
She hasn’t been here for more than one week.

509
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,220
She made an unprecedented

510
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,560
record in MH.

511
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,960
And maybe also no latecomers.

512
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,960
I think this record

513
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,400
is hard to break.

514
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,240
Kelang’s chairman still holds the grudges.

515
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,960
He thinks that someone at MH

516
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,480
should be held responsible for this farce.

517
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,320
We got the evidence

518
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,760
that he transferred the assets,

519
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,640
which is being verified.

520
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,280
This is

521
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,130
the evidence you verified?

522
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,480
You failed to remove Deng Ke.

523
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,560
And now they want us

524
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
to give them an explanation.

525
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,600
You tell me

526
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,560
what we should do now?

527
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,360
I will be responsible for this.

528
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,480
You will be responsible?

529
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,720
How?

530
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,930
Give me some time

531
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,880
and I will prove

532
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,940
that Deng Ke did transfer the assets.

533
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,760
If I give you time,

534
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,880
who will give me time?

535
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,000
Your best way to be responsible

536
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,860
is to put your resignation letter

537
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,200
on my desk.

538
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,490
I have been your teacher for years.

539
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,240
You never let me down.

540
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
Today,

541
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,530
it’s the first time.

542
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,820
The battle is not over yet.

543
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,160
It’s too early to decide

544
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,680
the winner now.

545
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,920
I heard that this trouble is caused

546
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,560
by a new comer called Jiang Jun.

547
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,080
Seems that she was

548
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
introduced by Lin Taimo.

549
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,200
I know her clearly.

550
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,600
She can’t be Lin Taimo’s helper.

551
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,040
Lin Taimo

552
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,640
is good at snowballing.

553
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,400
He can turn an unimpressive one

554
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,240
into a thorn,

555
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,080
and turn a trivial opportunity

556
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,600
into a

557
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,240
manageable achievement.

558
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,760
There are so many lessons of that.

559
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,560
I will give you five days

560
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,760
to find out Deng Ke’s stains.

561
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,440
That’s enough for you, right?

562
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,800
Two days.

563
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I will give you

564
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,280
a satisfying answer in two days.

565
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,180
The principle of today’s interview,

566
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,140
wolves can stay

567
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
and sheep will leave.

568
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,240
I heard that Yuan Shuai had a big loss

569
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,600
on the case of Deng Ke.

570
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,920
Deng Ke is shrewd.

571
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,570
But he is not capable enough

572
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,210
to cause loss to Yuan Shuai.

573
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,560
I heard it had something to do

574
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,770
with a new comer under his management.

575
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,800
The witness this intern found

576
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,240
bit them back

577
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,720
at the crucial time.

578
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Intern?

579
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,400
How could an intern be assigned

580
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,780
to deal with this case?

581
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,560
This surprised me as well.

582
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
This rule was made

583
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,800
by me, Lin Taimo and Fan Qichang

584
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,920
when I was still in MH

585
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,410
to train the new comers.

586
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,320
I didn’t expect that after all this time,

587
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,600
they are still using

588
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,200
this risky rule.

589
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,440
Looks like this intern

590
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,440
must have an unusual relationship with Yuan Shuai.

591
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
Or how could Yuan Shuai’s judgment

592
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,840
be affected?

593
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,720
I heard it’s the girl called Jiang Jun.

594
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,480
Oh, right.

595
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
It occurs to me that

596
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,960
I left a document in the company.

597
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,560
I won’t drive you home later.

598
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,480
OK.

599
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,280
But,

600
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,980
remember to go home early.

601
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,190
You must know that

602
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
in the field of investment banking,

603
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,980
the proportion of women is less than 20 percent.

604
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
The job requires abilities,

605
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,920
stamina, and stress tolerance that

606
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,630
many men can’t match,

607
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,840
let alone you,

608
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,150
who can’t even shed a tear.

609
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,600
It’s not decided by you.

610
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,250
I will become one of the 20 percent!

611
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,159
Is there money in the sky?

612
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,190
Get on.

613
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,840
It’s also a mistake if you
don’t listen to your boss.

614
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,100
You can leave if you make three mistakes.

615
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,960
When I was in Japan,

616
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,360
I visited a psychologist master,

617
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Sanaka Koji.

618
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
I asked him

619
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,880
when someone wanted to cry,

620
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,960
if there was any way

621
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,520
to stop the tears soon.

622
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,880
He told me

623
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,720
that if you wanted to cry,

624
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,920
just imagine yourself as a donkey.

625
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,020
Then your tears would be stopped right away.

626
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,360
Why?

627
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,810
Donkey doesn’t like to cry the most

628
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,120
because its face is too long.

629
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
It’s not funny at all.

630
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,040
Tell me if you want to cry,

631
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,210
I can call an ambulance for you.

632
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,200
You must be happy now.

633
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,050
The only person who knows your history

634
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,560
is leaving MH now.

635
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,840
Investment banking is like a battlefield.

636
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,010
Now you understand?

637
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,240
Little ants will carry the huge blame

638
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,520
is the latent rule of all the investment banks.

639
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,840
I just didn’t expect it

640
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,850
to be so fast.

641
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,810
You’re not qualified to be the little ant.

642
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,440
The ant will keep climbing ahead

643
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,400
and never give up.

644
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,400
A wheel with no feelings

645
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,060
can’t understand the little ant’s sadness.

646
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:46,880
Jiang Jun,

647
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,000
I want you to leave MH,

648
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,040
but not in a way

649
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,800
to carry the blame for me.

650
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,120
Remember,

651
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,040
under me,

652
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,280
I won’t make anyone carry the blame.

653
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,680
You… You got new clues?

654
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,480
A temporary retreat is not a defeat.

655
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,280
Ms. Ant,

656
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,240
please keep running.

657
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,560
The war is still far from the end.

658
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,090
Don’t worry.

659
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,360
I won’t give up

660
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,920
till the last moment.

661
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,360
Let me ask you.

662
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,400
Why do you want to stay in MH?

663
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,540
Yuan Shuai,

664
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,120
you think you know me well, right?

665
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,160
Of course I know you.

666
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,530
But that was before.

667
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,120
In my life,

668
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,040
you were absent for a while.

669
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,400
So you don’t know

670
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,960
what kind of a person I met,

671
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,480
what happened to me during the time

672
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,560
and why I want to

673
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
enter MH.

674
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
And you don’t know

675
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,810
what kind of a person I have become.

676
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,440
Just like now,

677
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,640
you think I will cry because of

678
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,760
being treated unfairly.

679
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,720
But I won’t.

680
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,200
I will feel upset

681
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,400
and angry.

682
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,330
But I won’t retreat.

683
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
You’re still in the past.

684
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,360
Maybe,

685
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,210
you should get to know me one more time.

686
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,400
Jiang Jun.

687
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,160
Jiang Jun.

688
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,040
Jiang Jun.

689
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,920
Don’t cry.

690
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,320
Both of us should not cry.

691
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,460
In all your father’s life,

692
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,240
he just wants you to stay strong.

693
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,480
Dad.

694
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,080
You… You…

695
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,760
You…

696
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,160
Why are you lying here?

697
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,680
Dad,

698
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,240
did you see?

699
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,680
Finally I entered MH

700
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,200
and became one of them.

701
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,800
Don’t worry, I’m strong now.

702
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,180
No matter how cruel this industry is,

703
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,060
I will try my best to hang in there.

704
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,120
I love you, dad.

705
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,780
Love Is Sweet
