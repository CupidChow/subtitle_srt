you loved the rice noodles my husband cooked?

To have more people try his rice noodles,

he found a few friends

21

Right at the time when we were short of cash,

In the end, for the livelihood
of all his employees,

49
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,200
he had no choice but sign the contract.

50

that the food safety issue

57
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,800
might not be an accident?

58

No way.

59

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
He wasn’t that type of person.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,920
He had high requirements for food quality.

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,980
He wouldn’t use inferior materials.

63

And the cause of his death

64
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,520
was also quite suspicious to me.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,520
He did have hypertension.

66
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,480
But he took medicine regularly
and it was always under control.

Hadn’t he been shocked somehow,

68

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,280
or what happens between you two in the future,

193
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,320
you should always treat her nicely

194

and not be the one who makes her cry.

195
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,160
Jiang Jun,

196
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,560
if something makes you

197
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,600
feel really, really sad,

198
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,960
just cry out loud.

199

Mr. Yuan owns both 701 and 702.

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Take good care of yourself.

379
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,440
Wait for me. I’ll be back soon.

380
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,280
Morning!

381
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,000
-Happy New Year!
-Happy New Year!

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,860
Happy New Year!

383
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,480
Hi, everybody!

384
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,520
Hi, Happy New Year!

385
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,160
Happy New Year!

386
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,880
Happy New Year!

387
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,760
Happy New Year!

388
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,330
Your bracelet is so pretty!

389
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,160
Of course.

390
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,380
It’s the latest design of this brand.

391
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I waited for a long time for my order.

392
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,480
By the way,

393
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,440
you know what?

394
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
Our Investment Banking Dept.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,640
outperformed ourselves again last year.

396
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,840
The shareholders are very happy.

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,560
I guess

398
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,340
Mr. Fan will try his best today

399
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,680
to encourage us and draw us a pie in the sky.

400
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,940
That’s not a bad thing.

401
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,220
Drawing a pie means we are competent.

402
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Otherwise, no matter how big the pie is,

403
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,800
no one can take it.

404
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,000
Moreover,

405
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,520
you see,

406
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,200
he provides us with such a good platform

407
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,560
to show our talents.

408
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,360
So, we may just show ourselves as well.

409
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,400
It’s a win-win situation.

410
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,800
I admire that you have such a good platform

411
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
to show your talent.

412
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Why don’t you give your salary and bonus to me?

413
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,800
I don’t think you need them that much.

414
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Salary and bonus

415
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,620
are my reward for making money

416
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
for the company with my

417
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,960
strength and talent.

418
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,440
Why do you sound like

419
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,210
a street artist living on tips?

420
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,040
Vulgar!

421
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,760
You are vulgar!

422
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,120
Mr. Fan.

423
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,640
Mr. Fan, morning.

424
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,000
Morning.

425
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,860
Mr. Lin is here.

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
He’s waiting for you in your office.

427
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,640
Mr. Lin?

428
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,120
Yes.

429
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,200
Which Mr. Lin?

430
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,400
Okay. I see.

431
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

432
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,160
Hi, everybody! Happy New Year!

433
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

434
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,560
Happy New Year!

435
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,000
Happy New Year!

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,130
Morning, Jiang Jun.

437
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:30,680
I heard

438
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,680
the receptionist said

439
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
that someone named Lin

440
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
came to see Mr. Fan this morning.

441
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,200
It’s the first working day of a new year.

442
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,360
Who is so active?

443
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,000
You don’t know him?

444
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,610
How are you supposed to survive in MH then?

445
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
He’s our Vice President of Securities,

446
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,440
Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

447
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,640
So he’s the Mr. Lin that people talked about.

448
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,480
Jiang Jun,

449
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,980
you know Mr. Lin very well, don’t you?

450
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,640
I…

451
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,200
Mr. Fan.

452
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,090
Long time no see.

453
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,200
Mr. Lin, welcome to the Investment Banking Dept.

454
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,700
It’s such a big honor to have you here.

455
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,050
Mr. Lin, do you feel better?

456
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,820
Thank you for asking, Mr. Fan.

457
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,180
I feel much better now.

458
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,640
During my recuperation,

459
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,360
you had to take care

460
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,840
of all the matters of the company.

461
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,960
I really feel sorry for that.

462
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,520
So, I think it’s time

463
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,520
to unload the burden

464
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,280
from you.

465
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,380
Thank you for your trust, Mr. Lin.

466
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,800
I’m sure after you are back,

467
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,050
you’ll lead the Investment Banking Dept.

468
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
to a higher level.

469
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Here. Have some coffee to refresh yourself.

470
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,980
Thank you for your years of hard work.

471
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,120
Thanks.

472
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,760
Mr. Lin.

473
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
After all, you were just recovered.

474
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,280
Working too hard will harm

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
your hard-won health

476
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,400
again!

477
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,640
Fellows.

478
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,000
Excuse me for a moment.

479
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,520
Mr. Fan.

480
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,000
Mr. Fan.

481
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
First of all, let’s welcome the return
of Mr. Lin, Lin Taimo!

482
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,800
Welcome! Welcome!

483
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,440
Now, we’ll invite Mr. Lin,

484
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,080
Vice President of Securities of MH,

485
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,000
to give us a speech.

486
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,220
Welcome! Welcome!

487
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,040
Dear fellows of the Investment Banking Dept.,

488
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
Happy New Year!

489
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,280
I’m Lin Taimo.

490
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,680
Thank you for your hard work last year.

491
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,240
You made a great contribution
to our company’s performance.

492
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,000
This year, the global economic situation

493
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,400
will continue to recover.

494
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Investment banks are crucial

495
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,240
for the market economy, influencing the broad

496
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,480
financial resources by matching

497
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,880
sellers and investors.

498
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,680
Hope you can keep up the good work

499
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,840
and bring our company to a new level!

500
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,200
Thank you for your speech, Mr. Lin.

501
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,260
I’m sure under Mr. Lin’s leadership,

502
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,600
our company will have a brighter future.

503
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,560
Last but not the least,

504
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,840
I wish all of you a big success

505
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,080
in your work!

506
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,280
-Thank you, Mr. Fan!
-Thanks, Mr. Fan!

507
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,340
Thank you! Thanks!

508
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,720
Mr. Lin, this way.

509
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,180
Please.

510
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,440
Looks like somebody’s backer is back!

511
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,400
Yep.

512
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
In front of all the people,

513
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,520
he only greeted her.

514
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,160
How flattering that was!

515
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:29,840
Mr. Lin!

516
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,760
Mr. Lin!

517
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,920
Mr. Lin!

518
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
I’ve heard so much about you!

519
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,320
I’m Ma Xiuran, Vice President
of the Investment Banking Dept.

520
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,360
I learned so much

521
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,800
from your speech!

522
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,480
So I’m here to introduce myself.

523
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,440
Mr. Ma.

524
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,480
I know you.

525
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,880
You are a rare talent

526
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,520
of our company.

527
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,040
You know me?!

528
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,640
I’m so flattered!

529
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,480
I really appreciate your coffee.

530
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,280
It’s been my

531
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,520
favorite brand.

532
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
Their coffee beans

533
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
-are selected…
-Mr. Ma.

534
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,920
May I go to your office for a chat?

535
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,800
I’d be honored!

536
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,480
Please! Please!

537
00:27:59,480 --> 00:27:59,840
Okay.

538
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,520
This way!

539
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:15,640
Miss.

540
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,440
Are you the one in this picture?

541
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,960
Who are you?

542
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,920
I’m Cao Heng’s friend.

543
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Could you please tell me

544
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,720
where he is?

545
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,040
Don’t ask me! I’m also looking for him!

546
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
He escaped from the debts

547
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
and left me here alone!

548
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,680
What kind of man is he?

549
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,500
Don’t get me wrong.

550
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,440
I’m not here to collect debts.

551
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,440
I’m here

552
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,000
to pay my debts.

553
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,980
Pay your debts?

554
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
You owe him money?

555
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,400
How much?

556
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,880
Is it enough to pay off his gambling debts?

557
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,440
Pretty much, I think.

558
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,720
Excuse me.

559
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,280
I’m here to see someone.

560
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,160
Sorry, sir.

561
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,280
It’s not our business hour yet.

562
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,540
I want to see your boss.

563
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,480
Our boss?

564
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,130
Brother Hua is not here yet.

565
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,930
Brother Hua?

566
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,120
Isn’t your boss named Cao?

567
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,880
Cao Heng?

568
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,200
Are you here to collect debts?

569
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,680
I’m actually here to give him money.

570
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,000
I met him five years ago.

571
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,880
I wouldn’t have been with him

572
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,480
if he hadn’t had money.

573
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,320
But he said he wanted to start a business,

574
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,040
and he borrowed money from everybody he knew.

575
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,200
I even lent him a lot.

576
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,080
But turns out

577
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,480
he used the money to gamble.

578
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,120
Hadn’t I had the key to his home

579
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,560
and taken some money to pay his debts,

580
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,520
he would’ve already been beaten to death
by the creditors!

581
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,080
Besides,

582
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,160
he always gambles every penny he has.

583
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,360
I saw some money in his home again today.

584
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,840
Who knows where he got it?

585
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,800
If I didn’t take it away,

586
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,570
he’d use it to gamble again.

587
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,100
It’s not all his fault.

588
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,840
That’s how gambling works.

589
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,840
Once you are involved,

590
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,900
it’s quite easy to fall off the wagon.

591
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,220
How about this?

592
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
I’ll give you the money I owe him.

593
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
Please give it to him for me.

594
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,840
I actually am quite curious.

595
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,320
Where does he go to gamble?

596
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,080
How come he’d lose so much money?

597
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,160
I’m not sure about that.

598
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,400
But I heard

599
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,000
it was near a bar he once owned.

600
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,780
It could be an illegal casino,

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,640
which doesn’t allow outsiders to go in.

602
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,020
So where does he usually hang out?

603
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,840
I don’t think I can tell you that.

604
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,680
The casino is in the alley

605
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,810
10 meters
to the right from the KTV.

606
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,240
Then you’ll see a steel stairway.

607
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,440
The casino is right on the second floor.

608
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,480
Take this.

609
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,680
Show it to the gatekeepers.

610
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,440
Tell them that you are Brother Hua’s friend,

611
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,880
and they’ll let you in.

612
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,920
Thank you.

613
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,280
Mr. Du?!

614
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,400
You are just everywhere, aren’t you?

615
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,730
You’d never disappear.

616
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
No wonder my eyelid has been twitching

617
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,800
since I left home.

618
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,890
I thought I’d see something dirty.

619
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,600
Turns out it’s you, Mr. Yuan.

620
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,650
What are you doing here?

621
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,080
I’m looking for Cao Heng.

622
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,880
Why?

623
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,680
Help Jiang Jun to find out the truth
of her father’s death.

624
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,640
Aren’t you here for the same reason?

625
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,040
I think you are here to tie up the loose ends.

626
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,400
I’ve told you.

627
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,260
I’m here to find out the truth.

628
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,280
Then go on.

629
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,720
We’ll both continue.

630
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,050
Why don’t we work together?

631
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,520
Since we are both looking for Cao Heng,

632
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,480
let’s find him together.

633
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,640
I’m just one step away from the truth.

634
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,700
I just don’t know where the casino is.

635
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Work together?

636
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,810
Are you kidding, Mr. Du?

637
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,980
You aren’t capable enough

638
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,240
to find it.

639
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,000
Why should I lower myself to work with you?

640
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,480
Because I know more secrets than you do.

641
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,240
How so?

642
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,160
I once dealt with this case

643
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,120
when I was in GE.

644
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,760
I know a lot of things the others don’t.

645
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,400
More importantly, I do want to help Jiang Jun.

646
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,210
That’s very kind of you.

647
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,260
But why should I trust you?

648
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,160
It doesn’t matter whether you trust me or not.

649
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
But I’m telling you,

650
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,160
if we wait for him

651
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
in the casino today,

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,100
he’ll definitely show up.

653
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,600
Wanna bet?

654
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,880
Why not?

655
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,240
Are you sure the illegal casino is here?

656
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,490
Don’t come along if you don’t trust me.

657
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,940
I’m Brother Hua’s friend.

658
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,600
Secretary Du,

659
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,800
is this Brother Hua’s casino you told me about?

660
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,720
It’s so small

661
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,600
and shabby.

662
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,800
How am I supposed to gamble here?

663
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,330
I know, Mr. Yuan.

664
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,400
We are only here for business anyway.

665
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,460
Let’s just kill some time here and have some fun.

666
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,040
Alright.

667
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,690
Did you bring that one million yuan

668
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,640
in cash?

669
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,820
I’ve sent someone to fetch it.

670
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,010
This gentleman is quite responsible.

671
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,680
Give him some tips.

672
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,489
Share with him.

673
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,670
Thank you, Mr. Yuan!

674
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,920
Please, go in!

675
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,760
Let’s go, Secretary Du.

676
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,880
This way, please.

677
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,480
There was 3,000 yuan in cash,
and the wallet is worth 5,000 yuan.

678
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,080
Remember to pay it back to me.

679
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,400
You are so petty, Secretary Du.

680
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
Because it’s you.

681
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,620
Show some sincerity if you wanna work together.

682
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,280
What’s going on?

683
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,020
[Lin Taimo Vice President]

684
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,600
How come Mr. Ma’s office

685
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,840
is Mr. Lin’s now?

686
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,640
Haven’t you heard?

687
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Ma Xiuran is transferred to the headquaters.

688
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
It’s said he’ll work there as the Manager

689
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
of the Admin Office for three years.

690
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,600
Admin Office?

691
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes.

692
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,560
Isn’t it to manage the secretaries

693
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,080
and day-to-day activities of the company?

694
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:29,380
It appears to be a promotion,
but actually it’s a demotion.

695
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,600
[According to the requirements of the company’s
business development and strategic plan,]

696
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,260
[upon deliberation, the Board of Directors
decided from today on,]

697
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,500
[1. Lin Taimo, VP of Securities of MH,
will serve as GM of Investment Banking Dept.]

698
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,720
It’s going to be a big change!

699
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,660
[2. Ma Xiuran, former VP of Investment Banking Dept.,
will serve as GM of Admin Office of the Headquarters.]

700
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,360
Once Mr. Lin is here,

701
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,400
Mr. Fan will become a figurehead.

702
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,520
It’s a sign of an impending storm.

703
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,480
You know what?

704
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,040
I think Mr. Lin is trying to threaten

705
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,720
Mr. Fan by transferring Mr. Ma.

706
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,690
Makes sense.

707
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,480
However,

708
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,120
someone will be happy

709
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
about Mr. Lin’s return.

710
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,740
Come on! Let’s go back to work!

711
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,400

712
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
you are…

713
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,960
Hold back your sympathy.

714
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,170
I just lent my office

715
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,080
to Mr. Lin.

716
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
I’m transferred to the headquarters.

717
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,160
I can take the time to alleviate the pressure of work

718
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,620
and relax myself a little.

719
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,770
Oh, I see.

720
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,040
Then, congratulations, Mr. Ma!

722
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,240
Okay.

You’d better

724
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,040
pick your words wisely.

725
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,000
I’ll be back after all.

00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,760
Then I wish you

How do you like my new office?

737
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,920
It’s a little small,

738

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,680
You even signed the job contract
earlier than the others.

750
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,320
Well done!

751
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,020
You didn’t let me down.

752
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,320
I didn’t want to let you down,

753
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,520
so I told myself to work harder.

754
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
If your dad

755
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,280
knew you are doing

756
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,800
such a good job,

757
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,920
he’d definitely be proud of you.

758
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
You knew my dad?

759
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,240
Your dad was Jiang Yaoming, the founder

760
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,240
of Jiangnan Flavor, right?

761
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,760
Yes.

762
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
We were friends for years.

763
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,920
He was a positive person.

764
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,480
We always enjoyed our conversations.

765
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,320
Unfortunately, he died so young.

766
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,780
I didn’t expect

767
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,120
that you knew my dad.

768
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,900
But I was in college back then.

769
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,380
I didn’t get to see him
before he passed away.

770
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,480
He was also a client of our MH.

771
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,320
For the brand “Yixianqian”,

772
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
we all put a lot of efforts in it.

773
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,440
I know it wasn’t easy for my dad
to start the business.

774
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,700
He and my mom tended not to share bad news.

775
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:39,880
So, even to the very end,

776
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,080
I didn’t get to help them with anything.

777
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,200
Mr. Lin,

778
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
what exactly happened back then?

779
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,480
Could you please tell me?

780
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,880
Back then, your dad’s company

781
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,720
was lacking money.

782
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,840
I tried my very best to help him.

783
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,320
In the end, we found C Group.

784
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,360
Actually, they were very generous with their terms.

785
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,730
After our serious consideration,

786
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,760
we decided to sign the acquisition contract.

787
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
But not long after,

788
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,840
I heard that your dad

789
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,560
suddenly died of a heart attack.

790
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,440
I think he must have been very sad

791
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,170
about giving his company away.

792
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,640
If I had known something like that would happen,

793
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,530
I wouldn’t have…

794
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,280
Mr. Lin,

795
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,290
it’s not your fault.

796
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,600
You just finished an acquisition case

797
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,200
according to the protocols.

798
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,440
Jiang Jun,

799
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,680
if you need any help

800
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,320
at work in the future,

801
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,060
just come to me at any time.

802
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,720
In fact, considering the friendship
between your dad and me,

803
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,040
you could even

804
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,200
call me uncle.

805
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,520
I’m already quite thankful

806
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,920
that you approved me to enter MH.

807
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,050
I won’t ask for more.

808
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,680
Okay.

809
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,680
Anyway, let me know if you need any help.

810
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,520
You can go back to work now.

811
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,980
Then I’m leaving, Mr. Lin.

812
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,760
Brother Hua!

813
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,360
I’m here.

814
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:46,360
Get him!

815
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,240
Get him!

816
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,720
Sir!

817
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,920
I’m sorry!

818
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:16,600
Run?

819
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:17,680
It’s…

820
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,200
Run!

821
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,460
Love Is Sweet
