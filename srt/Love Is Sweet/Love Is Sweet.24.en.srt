Episode 24

5
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:39,720
Smells so good!

6
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,920
Right?

7
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,940
Don't touch it.

8
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,610
I haven't washed it yet.

9
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,759
Then wash it for me. I want to eat it.

10
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,440
Trying to act cute?

11
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
You don’t like it?

12
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,120
I like it so much.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,840
Yuanyuan.

14
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,640
-How come you’re cooking?
-Mrs. Jiang.

15
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,480
You’re our guest!

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Go to the living room and rest!

17
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

18
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,030
It’s fine.

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,920
You should rest in the living room.

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
Just let me do the cooking.

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,160
Yuanyuan,

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,840
it’s not easy for you to visit us.

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,960
I can’t let you work.

24
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,320
Hurry! Go to the living room and rest!

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,440
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

26
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Now I’m in a relationship with Jun.

27
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,140
It’s natural that I...

28
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,360
In a relationship?

29
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,380
I… I mean a working relationship.

30
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,960
Right.

31
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,040
So I’ll always come to disturb you,

32
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,079
and scrounge free meals off.

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,800
I hope you won’t mind it.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,320
What are you talking about?

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,240
I’ll be very happy

36
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,760
if you can visit me every day.

37
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,240
Mom, just let him do it.

38
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,760
He’s really good at cooking.

39
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
You can take a rest.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Go take a rest.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,450
-Look at you. You're so lazy!
-Mrs. Jiang.

42
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,480
-Go take a rest.
-Thank you.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
It’s fine. It’s fine.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,480
Wait for me!

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Mrs. Jiang, just take the dishes to the table,

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,080
and get some rest.

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,600
Ok.

48
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Just leave it to me.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,160
Ok. Ok.

50
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,080
You’re so lazy.

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,800
Yuan is still busy cooking for us.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,400
Mom,

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,480
how do you know I like this dish?

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
Put it down. Put it down.

55
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,840
Go help Yuan.

56
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,760
Eat it later.

57
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,000
Why do you come here?

58
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,160
Anything I can help with?

59
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,880
Is it delicious?

60
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,480
So delicious.

61
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,540
Delicious, right?

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,040
Don't just eat. Crack the eggs.

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,760
It tastes good.

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,210
Good, right?

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,520
Right?

66
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,960
Coming!

67
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,800
The soup is also ready!

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,480
Here.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,920
Looks great!

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,579
Be careful.

71
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,880
It smells great!

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,060
Right, Mrs. Jiang?

73
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,360
Smells great!

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Yuanyuan, come here.

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,080
Coming.

76
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,480
Here.

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,600
Let me help you.

78
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
So many dishes!

79
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,920
Here.

80
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Mrs. Jiang,

81
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,500
happy New Year!

82
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,540
Happy New Year!

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,720
-Happy New Year!
-Here, Jun!

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,680
I wish my Jun and Yuanyuan

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,280
a happy New Year!

86
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:22,880
Happy New Year!

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,480
-Happy New Year!
-Good luck!

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,440
It tastes great!

89
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Mrs. Jiang, let’s dig in.

90
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,440
Try the food I cooked.

91
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
See if you like it.

92
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,280
Yuanyuan,

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,940
how did you make this dish?

94
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,820
Seems Jun also likes it very much.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,040
This one...

96
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,820
It's very easy to cook.

97
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,320
At home, I always…

98
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,159
Mr. Yuan always cooked for us

99
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,040
during our team activities.

100
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,640
He can cook a lot of dishes,

101
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,800
and all sorts of cuisines.

102
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,280
Like sweet and sour pork, and pork ribs, etc.

103
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,940
Is it right?

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,760
Is it right?

105
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,960
Right. Right.

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
Mrs. Jiang,

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,880
if you like these dishes, I can always come

108
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,200
to cook them for you.

109
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,740
I can also write down the recipes,

110
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,130
so you can refer to them.

111
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,650
That’d be great.

112
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,440
Thank you.

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,370
My pleasure.

114
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Here, Mrs. Jiang.

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,130
Try this.

116
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

117
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,250
You’re welcome.

118
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Here.

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,120
I just tried it. It’s delicious.

120
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,200
Eat more.

121
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,440
You should eat.

122
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,640
Yuanyuan,

123
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,240
I hope you can come often

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,600
when you have time.

125
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,360
I like you.

126
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,980
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

127
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,130
I still remember

128
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,400
you often came to eat with us when you were little.

129
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,240
I know

130
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,100
you and Jun were good friends.

131
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,280
If Jun’s speech notes hadn’t been stolen,

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,960
Jun wouldn’t have gone to the hospital.

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,440
If she hadn’t gone to the hospital,

134
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,280
she wouldn’t have transferred to another school.

135
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,810
If she hadn’t transferred to another school,

136
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,260
you would’ve met each other before you went abroad.

137
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,680
It was really a pity.

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,840
The one who stole Jun's speech notes

139
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,920
is the one to blame.

140
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,040
He's the most hateful person.

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,240
Mrs. Jiang,

142
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,760
speaking of this,

143
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,920
I think that

144
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,340
he didn't mean to steal the speech notes.

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
Can you please not hate him?

146
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,159
It just came in my mind,

147
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
so I complained it to you.

148
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,380
Every time when I thought of this,

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,100
I thought he was very hateful.

150
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Yuanyuan,

151
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,760
what are you doing?

152
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Get up!

153
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,460
Mrs. Jiang,

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,840
I want to confess one thing to you.

155
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,120
The one

156
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,050
who took away Jiang Jun’s speech notes

157
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
was me.

158
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,720
I...

159
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,160
Mom! Mom! Mom!

160
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
It really wasn’t on purpose.

161
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,780
He took it away by mistake.

162
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,840
He really...

163
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,800
He really regrets doing that a lot, right?

164
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,600
-I...
-Right?

165
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,280
I regret it very much, Mrs. Jiang!

166
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,600
It really wasn’t on purpose!

167
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
You...

168
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
I regret it very much!

169
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,760
I won’t get up

170
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
if you don’t forgive me today!

171
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,680
Please forgive me!

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,040
I beg you.

173
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,400
I...

174
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,040
I beg you.

175
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Yuan,

176
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,320
come.

177
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,480
Get up. I forgive you.

178
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,840
Hurry. Get up.

179
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,200
Sit down. Sit down.

180
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Thank you, Auntie

181
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Mrs. Jiang,

182
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,360
you really have forgiven me?

183
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
I’ll drink a toast to you.

184
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,000
I promise

185
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,560
I’ll do my best

186
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,040
to protect Jiang Jun from now on.

187
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
I’ll finish it.

188
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,040
Put it down first.

189
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
You think I am

190
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,700
such a narrow-minded person?

191
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,320
It’s been so many years.

192
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,440
I won’t hold a grudge against you.

193
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,120
Mom! Mom! Don’t...

194
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,549
Here.

195
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,480
Yuan, let me drink a toast to you.

196
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,120
I'll finish it first.

197
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,650
Don't you want to drink?

198
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
I will.

199
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,450
I will drink it, Mrs. Jiang.

200
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I’ve finished it.

201
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,560
Here’s a second

202
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,960
glass of wine.

203
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Because you’re Jun’s leader.

204
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,880
Now you’re a grown-up.

205
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,600
I believe

206
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
you won’t harm Jun anymore.

207
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Here.

208
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,760
I’ll finish it first.

209
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,400
Mom!

210
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,780
Don't you want to drink, Yuan?

211
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,320
I will.

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,640
I’ll drink it.

213
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,700
I’ve finished it, Mrs. Jiang.

214
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,440
And the third

215
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,480
glass of wine

216
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,280
is to the New Year.

217
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,360
Mom!

218
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,880
New Year, new look.

219
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,560
Mom!

220
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
After today,

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,920
the old story will be written off,

222
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,440
and we’ll turn the page.

223
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,600
Yuan.

224
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
Happy New Year!

225
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,490
Don't you want to drink?

226
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,600
I will.

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,480
I will drink it.

228
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,280
I will drink it up!

229
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I’ve finished it.

230
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,720
Jun, dig in.

231
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
Are you alright?

232
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,460
I need to use the bathroom.

233
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,040
Sorry, Mrs. Jiang.

234
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Let me go with you.

235
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,160
Sit down.

236
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
But... Mom, he...

237
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Sit down.

238
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,360
But...

239
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,130
Mom, he's...

240
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,280
He’s going to throw up!

241
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,040
Sit down!

242
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,960
Li,

243
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,640
why did you come here?

244
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Aren’t you on holiday?

245
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
I had nothing to do.

246
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,080
So I came to see

247
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,120
if there’s anything I can help with.

248
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,040
Anything you can help with?

249
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,970
How about watching the shop for me?

250
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,540
Of course. You can go back.

251
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,520
I was kidding.

252
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,360
I’m serious.

253
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,900
Go enjoy the festival.

254
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,520
Perhaps later.

255
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,520
But I need to get some sleep first.

256
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,440
You know what?

257
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,320
A young man

258
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,440
came here to drink around midnight yesterday,

259
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,640
but half a bottle got him drunk.

260
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,900
We went to great lengths to send him back.

261
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,800
I think he must be heartbroken.

262
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,250
We had to comfort him for quite a while.

263
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,450
He’s really spoony.

264
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,320
Li,

265
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,920
what’re you mumbling?

266
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,880
Nothing.

267
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,760
I mean he’s a poor guy.

268
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,200
Right.

269
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,240
What an unpleasant New Year Eve.

270
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Then please watch the shop for me.

271
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,600
I’ll get some sleep and come back soon.

272
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,080
Just go.

273
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,920
Thank you.

274
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,520
Happy New Year!

275
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,400
Happy New Year!

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Happy New Year!

277
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,890
Xu Li, don't cry.

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,880
You’re working.

279
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,520
Don’t cry! Don’t cry! Don’t cry!

280
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,360
Don’t cry!

281
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,370
Eat something and you’ll feel better.

282
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,530
Just eat something.

283
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,720
I’m very happy.

284
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,480
I’ll eat something and start working.

285
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,480
I’ll work hard.

286
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,840
Don't cry.

287
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,160
Yuanyuan.

288
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,080
Mrs. Jiang.

289
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,680
Thank you.

290
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,400
My pleasure.

291
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,280
You’re my guest, but you’re washing the plates.

292
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,340
It doesn’t matter.

293
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,940
Don’t mind what I did just now.

294
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,880
Here.

295
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,500
Have some slices of apple.

296
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,860
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

297
00:15:59,280 --> 00:15:59,940
Is it sweet?

298
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,920
So sweet.

299
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,280
The apple is sweet.

300
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,000
Have you ever thought

301
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
about having a sweet relationship?

302
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,080
Mrs. Jiang,

303
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,240
actually,

304
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,320
I’m already in a very sweet relationship.

305
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,280
What?

306
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,000
You have a girlfriend?

307
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,640
Mrs. Jiang,

308
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,320
actually, I...

309
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,440
Stop eating!

310
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,860
Wash these plates as well!

311
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,000
What did I do to deserve this?

312
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,200
I’m just in a relationship with your daughter.

313
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,680
I went to buy vegetables.

314
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
I did the cooking.

315
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,240
I wash the plates

316
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,440
and I even drank wine

317
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,040
I'm such a wonderful son-in-law!

318
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,970
Mothers-in-law are always right.

319
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,940
Mothers-in-law are the best.

320
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,480
Mothers-in-law can’t be wrong.

321
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,589
This is my job without doubt!

322
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:27,920
Jun,

323
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
have some slices of apple.

324
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
Thank you, Mom.

325
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
Jun,

326
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,400
our neighbor Mrs. Li’s son is coming back.

327
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,120
Do you want to meet him?

328
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,040
Mom,

329
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,800
don’t always try to arrange blind dates for me.

330
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,600
Look how old you are now!

331
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,890
I hope you can find a boyfriend.

332
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,250
I’ll feel at ease if he can take care of you.

333
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,240
I could take very good care of myself

334
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,000
even when I was alone in college.

335
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,460
Just don't worry about it.

336
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,680
Stop checking the phone! This is important!

337
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,680
Jun,

338
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,720
Yuan already has a girlfriend.

339
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,360
Do you know that?

340
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:10,760
Ah?

341
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,160
Surprised?

342
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,220
Why did you take him back then?

343
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,360
Drive him off immediately!

344
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,680
Honey,

345
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
what should I do?

346
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,440
It seems that

347
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,840
Jun fell in love with a man

348
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,540
who already has a girlfriend.

349
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,040
And that man is the son of the Yuan family.

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,360
Seems they’re very close to each other.

351
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,040
But Yuan told me

352
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,840
he already has a girlfriend.

353
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,420
Bah!

354
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,460
He's such a scumbag!

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,600
Honey,

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,360
can you come tonight

357
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
and take him away?

358
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,680
Have some warm water.

359
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,600
What did my mom say to you just now?

360
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,060
She was so angry and told me to drive you away.

361
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,680
Mrs. Jiang brought a plate of apple slices to me

362
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,480
and asked me to eat.

363
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,640
She asked me if it was sweet.

364
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,560
I said

365
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,800
it’s as sweet as my girlfriend.

366
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,800
Right.

367
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,800
Then she got irritated.

368
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,320
I wasn’t able to finish my words. I…

369
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Mrs. Jiang.

370
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,080
Yuan,

371
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,360
you have to sleep in the living room tonight.

372
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,800
Would you mind?

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,800
No need, Mom.

374
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,260
He can sleep in my room.

375
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
I can sleep with you.

376
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,080
You’re a girl.

377
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,880
How can he sleep in your room?

378
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,200
Right!

379
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,040
How can a guy

380
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,360
sleep in a girl’s room?

381
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,600
Mrs. Jiang,

382
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,760
the living room is very cozy.

383
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,320
The sofa is very comfortable.

384
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,640
I’ll sleep here.

385
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,920
Mom.

386
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,620
This is a quilt for summer.

387
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,720
He’ll catch a cold.

388
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,440
I won’t!

389
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
I’m very fit, Mrs. Jiang.

390
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
I... I’ll be fine.

391
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,280
This quilt is very thick.

392
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,200
I’m ok with it.

393
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,000
Thick? You’ll…

394
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Jiang Jun,

395
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,440
Yuan is ok

396
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,920
Don't worry about him.

397
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,520
Get up.

398
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,600
Go sleep in your room.

399
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,280
But, Mom, the quilt is too thin.

400
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,360
Get up!

401
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,520
Mrs. Jiang, you should go to sleep, too.

402
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,240
I... I...

403
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,960
Yuan,

404
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,160
good night.

405
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,960
Good night, Mrs. Jiang.

406
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,650
Mothers-in-law are always right.

407
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,560
You scared me a lot!

408
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,760
Why did you come?

409
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,520
I was afraid you may catch a cold,

410
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,850
so I brought you a quilt.

411
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,320
I’m leaving.

412
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,160
No!

413
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,360
Warm the quilt for me.

414
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,520
I’m cold.

415
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,520
My mom will come out!

416
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,040
I missed you.

417
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,480
So annoying.

418
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,640
Here.

419
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,680
Is it warm?

420
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,500
Good night.

421
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,560
Good night.

422
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,360
It’s 4 am!

423
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Why did you set an alarm at 4 am?

424
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,600
My mom will get up soon.

425
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,660
We’ll be done for it if she sees us.

426
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,440
One more kiss.

427
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,330
I’m leaving.

428
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,560
Come here.

429
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,920
Mrs. Jiang,

430
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
I... I can explain this to you.

431
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,100
Move aside!

432
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,930
It’s not your turn to speak!

433
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,160
Jun,

434
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
why didn’t you listen to me?

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,120
Why were you so stubborn?

436
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,720
What did I do, Mom?

437
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
How come I was stubborn?

438
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
You’re really driving me crazy?

439
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,280
Don’t you know he already has a girlfriend?

440
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,360
I can tell you like him.

441
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,200
But do you know he doesn't intend

442
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,040
to break up with his girlfriend?

443
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,880
Jun,

444
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,200
you should change your mind now.

445
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,040
Don't let him ruin you!

446
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,760
Mrs. Jiang,

447
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,960
Jun is my girlfriend.

448
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,420
We’re in a relationship, Mom.

449
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,120
Where am I?

450
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,240
Where am I?

451
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,280
Mom!

452
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,200
I can’t see anything.

453
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,000
Mom!

454
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,220
Am I sleepwalking?

455
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,000
Mom!

456
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:24,760
One sheep.

457
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,560
Two sheep.

458
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
Three sheep.

459
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,480
Your mom sleepwalks?

460
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,160
I've never seen this before.

461
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,290
Are you also sleepwalking?

462
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
Who knows?

463
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Honey,

464
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,840
I had it all wrong!

465
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,580
Yuanyuan is not a scumbag.

466
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,120
He’s Jun’s boyfriend.

467
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,080
Honey,

468
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
don’t come to take him away then.

469
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,440
Morning, Mrs. Jiang.

470
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,560
Yuanyuan.

471
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,880
Come here! Come here!

472
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,720
Come here!

473
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,580
Have breakfast! Come!

474
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,120
Mrs. Jiang, what a feast this is!

475
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,080
Mom, this is too much.

476
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,760
Not at all. Not at all.

477
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,360
Just a simple breakfast.

478
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
-Simple?
-Yuanyuan,

479
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,960
you haven’t eaten with us for a long time.

480
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
I don't know what you like to eat.

481
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,960
So I cooked a little more.

482
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,800
See,

483
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,880
the Japanese style, Chinese style,

484
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,140
and the Western style.

485
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,460
Eat whatever you want.

486
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,000
Tell you what,

487
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,200
young man

488
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,240
must eat many eggs.

489
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,280
They’re very nutritious, you know?

490
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,040
So,

491
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,560
I’ve cooked some eggs for you.

492
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,200
See,

493
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,680
the quail eggs, soy eggs, boiled eggs,

494
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,080
preserved eggs, fried eggs, poached eggs,

495
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,050
and the most important one,

496
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,080
very nutritious raw eggs.

497
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,290
Here, Yuanyuan,

498
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,640
drink it up.

499
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,520
I...

500
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,090
Don't you want to drink?

501
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,160
Mom,

502
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
let him eat something first.

503
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,200
Ok. Ok.

504
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
Eat something first. Drink that later.

505
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,280
Ok.

506
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,320
You must drink it. It’s very nutritious.

507
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,520
Come, Yuanyuan.

508
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,160
Hurry.

509
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Here.

510
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Mrs. Jiang,

511
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,960
thank you so much.

512
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,520
But, to be honest,

513
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,960
I’d be very content

514
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,680
if I can eat some

515
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,450
rice noodles that you cook.

516
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,760
Yuanyuan,

517
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,680
how could I possibly forget this?

518
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Wait! Wait!

519
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,090
There are really rice noodles!

520
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,360
My mom is crazy.

521
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,610
Maybe you’re her own child.

522
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
I’m going nuts!

523
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,730
What is that?

524
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,760
Drink it.

525
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Very nutritious rice noodles!

526
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,080
Mom,

527
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
what did you put in the rice noodles?

528
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,520
Nothing really.

529
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,850
Just a few ingredients.

530
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,520
Chinese Angelica, cartialgenous, sea cucumbers,

531
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,930
Ganoderma lucidum,

532
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,000
and most importantly, the turtle and lamb kidneys.

533
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,120
Here.

534
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,200
Have a taste.

535
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,200
My mom has put her most treasured ingredients

536
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,360
in the rice noodles.

537
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
You should eat them all.

538
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,720
Here, Yuanyuan.

539
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,320
Eat up.

540
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,210
Eat them all.

541
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,800
Ok.

542
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,920
Come.

543
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Which should I start to eat first?

544
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,360
Eat the ginseng first.

545
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,560
It’s very nutritious.

546
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
I better eat the rice noodles first.

547
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,720
Tell you what, the soup is very nutritious.

548
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
You should drink it all.

549
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,560
It's delicious, Mrs. Jiang!

550
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,480
Delicious, right?

551
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,360
Come.

552
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,480
Eat some eggs.

553
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,280
Come.

554
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
Eat more, Yuanyuan.

555
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,200
You have to eat more.

556
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Don’t touch them!

557
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
He can't eat so many eggs!

558
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,560
Am I your daughter?

559
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,200
Girls shouldn’t eat so much.

560
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,800
You can eat some vegetables.

561
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,960
Eat the vegetable and the salad.

562
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,130
Come, Yuanyuan.

563
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Eat more.

564
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,880
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

565
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,680
Mrs. Jiang, come.

566
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,440
Eat with me.

567
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Eat a steamed bun.

568
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Mrs. Jiang,

569
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,200
the rice noodles are very delicious.

570
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,930
The taste is the same as before.

571
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,560
Yuanyuan,

572
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,840
in the future,

573
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,490
I’ll cook

574
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
all kinds of dishes for you.

575
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,160
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

576
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,690
I’ll cook for you next time.

577
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,240
I’m very good at cooking.

578
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,400
Wait a sec. I have a phone call.

579
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:34,840
Hello?

580
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
Is it delicious?

581
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,480
Do you have time? Come play mahjong with us.

582
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,720
I can’t today.

583
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,040
I have a guest.

584
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,160
Yuanyuan, right?

585
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,360
Let him join us. We need one more player.

586
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,760
We can catch up by the way.

587
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,520
Ok, Cuiping.

588
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,440
Ok.

589
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,720
See you in the afternoon.

590
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
Ok.

591
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,920
Yuanyuan,

592
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
after the meal,

593
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,840
I hope you can complete a glorious mission.

594
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,840
Me?

595
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,840
What is it?

596
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,280
You’ll know after the meal.

597
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
Dig in. Dig in.

598
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,000
Ok.

599
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,100
Delicious, right?

600
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,260
I forgot the most important dish!

601
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,880
The “Buddha’s Temptation”.

602
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,200
I’ll go get it for you.

603
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Wait.

604
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
The “Buddha’s Temptation”.

605
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,820
What’re you doing?

606
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,280
Your mom is going to play mahjong with her friends.

607
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,810
I need to show off my skills.

608
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,360
It’s just a mahjong game, alright?

609
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,530
My mom already likes you very much.

610
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,380
You don’t understand.

611
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,360
It’s true that

612
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,090
sons-in-law know their mothers-in-law better.

613
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,920
Who’s the son-in-law here?

614
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,050
You’re so shameless

615
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,080
Listen,

616
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,840
don't show up in the afternoon.

617
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,240
Otherwise you’ll disrupt our plan.

618
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
What the hell is going on?

619
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,360
Am I a member of the Jiang family?

620
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,050
I’ll weep this out to my dad!

621
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,840
Be good.

622
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,010
This is more like it.

623
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,200
Yuanyuan,

624
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,800
your watch looks very expensive.

625
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:32,780
Not really.

626
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,640
Green Dragon.

627
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,440
This is just a

628
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,000
mid-priced watch.

629
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,880
Yuanyuan,

630
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,400
I wonder if you have

631
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,130
bought a house in Shanghai.

632
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,760
What I’m trying to say is that

633
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
you’re young,

634
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,480
and you’re working in a different city.

635
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,540
You need a house to live a steady life.

636
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,360
Right?

637
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,000
Right. Right.

638
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,160
You're right, Auntie.

639
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,160
I’ve bought two houses in Shanghai.

640
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,960
But

641
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,320
just two ordinary

642
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,640
commodity houses.

643
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,960
Right. Right.

644
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,410
Yuanyuan's two houses are very small.

645
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
Yuanyuan,

646
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
you’re so young,

647
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,840
but you’ve bought two houses in Shanghai!

648
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,720
Two houses.

649
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,920
Did your parents buy them for you?

650
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,160
No, Auntie.

651
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,200
My parents are living abroad.

652
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,840
-They don’t plan to move back for now.
-Abroad.

653
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,200
The two houses

654
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,680
are for my work.

655
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,080
I bought them myself.

656
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,040
Then you must be

657
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,250
really well-paid in your company!

658
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,840
It depends on the projects.

659
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,370
If they’re small projects,

660
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,900
I won’t get paid very well.

661
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,080
Right. Right.

662
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,400
If they’re large projects,

663
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,280
he’ll earn a bit more.

664
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,010
Not much really.

665
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,960
Nine Dots!

666
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,240
I also have!

667
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,640
Yuanyuan,

668
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,340
you can’t play tricks.

669
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,160
Two Dots!

670
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,040
Wanjun,

671
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,760
let's switch seats later.

672
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,880
You can’t sit next to Yuanyuan.

673
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,840
Mrs. Jiang is just lucky.

674
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,860
Three Characters!

675
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,080
One Dot!

676
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,480
One Dot?

677
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,130
Two Bamboos!

678
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,800
Two Bamboos! I won! I won!

679
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,360
I won!

680
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,160
So great!

681
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
You are playing high!

682
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,160
Yuanyuan, it’s right what I needed!

683
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,640
I was too careless.

684
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,840
You're so lucky.

685
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,960
Here's the money!

686
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,560
Shujuan,

687
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,220
you’re so narrow-minded.

688
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Yuanyuan was so busy with work.

689
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,080
He didn’t have time to practice playing mahjong.

690
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,120
How could he know how to play tricks?

691
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,820
Auntie, you’re right.

692
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,280
I was too busy.

693
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,440
I didn't have time to play mahjong.

694
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,000
So I came today

695
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,600
to learn from you.

696
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,160
Please don't loathe me.

697
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,680
-Not at all!
-Not at all!

698
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,000
That’s great. That’s great.

699
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Let’s start then.

700
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Come. Come.

701
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,300
Eight Characters!

702
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,840
I won!

703
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
-It's a Flush!
-You played high!

704
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,240
You are playing high!

705
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,280
Give me the money!

706
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,400
Aunties, you're so lucky!

707
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,560
Seven!

708
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
I won!

709
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,920
Wanjun, I won again!

710
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,560
So great!

711
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,920
You’re so lucky! Here’s the money!

712
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,040
Nine Bamboos!

713
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,200
I won again!

714
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,200
Give me money!

715
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,770
Okay. Let’s give her money.

716
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,920
Seems I won this time?

717
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,520
Aunties, please help me take a look.

718
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,560
Did I win?

719
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,290
Yes, you did.

720
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,240
You won! You won!

721
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
He really won! He won!

722
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,120
You won! You won! You won!

723
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,880
I won?

724
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,000
I finally won!

725
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,560
Take the money.

726
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,480
Keep the change.

727
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,320
I’ve won

728
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,840
a lot of money from you today.

729
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,440
I actually start to feel embarrassed.

730
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,960
You’re too kind, Auntie.

731
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,160
I was too busy normally.

732
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,720
I don’t really know how to play mahjong.

733
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,640
It’s my honor

734
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,650
to play mahjong with you today.

735
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,400
I knew it.

736
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,450
Yuanyuan’s of good character.

737
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,200
He lost so much money,

738
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,060
but he didn’t pull a long face,

739
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,260
or become anxious.

740
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,960
I’m sure

741
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,280
he’ll be a very good husband!

742
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,960
Yuanyuan,

743
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,360
I’m a straight shooter.

744
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,600
I’ll just be straightforward with you.

745
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Tell you what,

746
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,400
-my daughter also works in Shanghai.
-Wait! Wait!

747
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,680
Quiet! Quiet!

748
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,280
I gathered us together today,

749
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:06,960
right?

750
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,610
Of course I should go first.

751
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Yuanyuan.

752
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,320
-My daughter...
-Cuiping.

753
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,440
Cuiping.

754
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Sorry to interrupt.

755
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:16,670
I know

756
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,150
what questions you want to ask.

757
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,560
Yuanyuan

758
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,360
is indeed a bit more outstanding

759
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,120
than some young men.

760
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,560
But,

761
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,760
he’s in a relationship with my Jun.

762
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
They’re with each other now.

763
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,150
Really?

764
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,520
You said yesterday that

765
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,489
Yuanyuan is not Jun’s boyfriend.

766
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,230
Shujuan,

767
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,840
I was too shy to say it yesterday.

768
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,830
I already have a girlfriend.

769
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,120
That’s good. That’s good.

770
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,560
I need to go back to cook.

771
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,200
Auntie, why are you leaving?

772
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Let's continue.

773
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
We’re leaving. We’re leaving.

774
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,250
Have a good time.

775
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,280
See you, Aunties.

776
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,810
Let's play again next time!

777
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,040
Let's play again next time, Aunties.

778
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,880
Come again.

779
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
How was it, Mrs. Jiang?

780
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,500
Did I perform well enough?

781
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,840
Very successful!

782
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,860
Actually, I knew she wanted Four Dots

783
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,480
when I threw it away.

784
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,900
Mrs. Jiang, wait a minute.

785
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,680
Hello.

786
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,160
How much is it? I’ll buy two bags.

787
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,080
20 yuan per bag.

788
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,280
40 yuan for two bags.

789
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:27,920
Ok.

790
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,920
Here you are.

791
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,640
Thank you.

792
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,120
Yuanyuan,

793
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,120
can you eat so many?

794
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,440
Jun loves to eat roasted chestnuts.

795
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,520
I think probably you love to eat them, too.

796
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,560
So I bought more.

797
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,560
When Jun was a kid,

798
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,930
her dad always bought roasted chestnuts for her.

799
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,520
Right.

800
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,740
Brother Yuanyuan,

801
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,120
you're awesome!

802
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,480
Do you want me to teach you?

803
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,400
But,

804
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
you’ll have to call me

805
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,940
Brother Yuanyuan three times first.

806
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,000
Jun.

807
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,040
Dad.

808
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,920
Guess what I bought for you.

809
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,040
Chestnuts!

810
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,360
Thank you, Dad.

811
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,480
Eat the chestnuts with Yuanyuan.

812
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,340
I’ll go cook rice noodles for you.

813
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,760
Brother Yuanyuan, let’s eat chestnuts.

814
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,600
I won’t.

815
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,120
How does it taste?

816
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,960
Is it sweet?

817
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,240
A little.

818
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,960
Seems you don't really like chestnuts.

819
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,920
I like them very much.

820
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,160
Why don’t

821
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,520
you peel them for me?

822
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,580
I’ll be responsible for eating them.

823
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,280
Why would I peel them for you?

824
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,320
Because my hands are small and weak.

825
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,400
My dad always peeled them for me.

826
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,660
But now he went to cook.

827
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,920
Then how did you

828
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,920
peel that one just now?

829
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,960
I bit it.

830
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,640
Alright.

831
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,520
Well,

832
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,000
call me Brother Yuanyuan three times

833
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,320
and I’ll peel them for you.

834
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,840
Brother Yuanyuan!
Brother Yuanyuan! Brother Yuanyuan!

835
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,760
Give them to me!

836
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,400
Here you are.

837
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,560
Is it sweet?

838
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,120
Yuanyuan,

839
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,700
[Roasted Chestnuts]

840
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,320
thank you.

841
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,160
Thank you for caring about Jun’s feelings.

842
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,120
After her father died,

843
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,920
seemed she grew up suddenly overnight.

844
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,840
She never cried again.

845
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,880
I don't know

846
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,800
if she really has become stronger,

847
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,360
or she was just pretending.

848
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,840
But I know that

849
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
she was afraid I may worry about her.

850
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,080
But that made me

851
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,440
worry about her even more.

852
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Now she has you.

853
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
I can feel at ease.

854
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,480
Mrs. Jiang, it’s my responsibility.

855
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,680
Yuanyuan,

856
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,320
can you promise me one thing?

857
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,560
Mrs. Jiang,

858
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,960
go ahead.

859
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,080
I hope that

860
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,400
no matter how

861
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,200
your relationship changes

862
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,680
or what happens between you two

863
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,960
in the future,

864
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,320
you should always treat her nicely

865
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,040
and not be the one who makes her cry.

866
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,240
Mrs. Jiang,

867
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,000
don’t worry.

868
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,080
I’ll take good care of her,

869
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
and won't let anyone bully her.

870
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
In this lifetime,

871
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,880
I’ll only make her laugh,

872
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
I won’t let her cry.

873
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,560
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

874
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,340
That street stall, right?

875
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
I haven’t eaten them for a long time.

876
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,160
Stop.

877
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,880
It’s my job to peel them.

878
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,560
You’re the best.

879
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,560
Come here.

880
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,800
Try it.

881
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,440
How does it taste?

882
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,240
So delicious.

883
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,000
Delicious, right?

884
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,640
Is it sweet?

885
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,240
Sweet.

886
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,840
Yuanyuan,

887
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,200
You’re spoiling her too much.

888
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,320
Mrs. Jiang,

889
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,280
this is how young people are in a relationship.

890
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,320
You won’t understand.

891
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,040
Mrs. Jiang,

892
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,130
girlfriends

893
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,850
are supposed to be spoiled.

894
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,900
Let me peel one for you as well.

895
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:46,760
Yuanyuan,

896
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,520
no need.

897
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,680
I can peel it myself.

898
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,880
It’s fine. It’s fine.

899
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Come. Try it.

900
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,560
See if it tastes good.

901
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,240
Thank you, Yuanyuan.

902
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,880
You’re welcome.

903
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,040
Here. Have some oranges.

904
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,680
Ok.

905
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,880
Get me some water. I’m choking.

906
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,920
Eat slowly.

907
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:02,930
Here you are.

908
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,480
Jun, be careful!

909
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,120
It’s fine, Mrs. Jiang.

910
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,080
It wasn’t on purpose.

911
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,960
You’re so careless!

912
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,360
Come, take it off. I’ll dry it for you.

913
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Thank you, Mrs. Jiang.

914
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,840
You’re so clumsy!

915
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,120
It’s fine.

916
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,600
This kid.

917
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,600
Are you alright?

918
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,000
Is there anything in your pocket?

919
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,600
Let me see.

920
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,360
I’m fine. Wipe your clothes.

921
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,360
Look what you did!

922
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:24,880
Are you alright?

923
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:25,410
I’m fine.

924
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,300
[Yuan Shuai]

925
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,160
You're so clumsy.

926
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,520
MH?

927
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,040
Yuan Shuai?

928
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,880
What's with this?

929
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,320
This... This...

930
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,440
Jiang Jun,

931
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,080
come with me.

932
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,380
This...

933
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,960
This... This...

934
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,600
Jun,

935
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,160
why didn’t you tell me the truth?

936
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,840
Mom, I was afraid you may get worried.

937
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,940
When you wanted to go to Shanghai,

938
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,640
I didn't agree with your decision.

939
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,160
Working in big cities is very stressful,

940
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,520
and there are all sorts of people.

941
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,440
But you said

942
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,340
you wanted to have a try there.

943
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,000
I didn’t stop you.

944
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,880
I didn’t want you to do a stressful job.

945
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,680
But you majored in a related subject at college.

946
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,200
So I approved it, right?

947
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,480
But why did you ignore

948
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,160
what I told you?

949
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,080
People in places like MH are very sinister.

950
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,080
I don’t want to hear this name in my entire life.

951
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,840
Can’t you listen to me for once?

952
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,840
Especially your dad...

953
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:48,920
Mom,

954
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,720
I used to think the investment banks were inhuman.

955
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,080
But after 6 months working there,

956
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,320
I found it’s not about the industry,

957
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,000
but the people in the industry.

958
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
And I really love this job very much.

959
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,440
Say no more!

960
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,160
Quit the job when you’re back.

961
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,560
I won’t compromise with you on this matter.

962
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,940
Love Is Sweet
