00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 7

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,680
I didn’t know he works for GE.

6
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,440
But my teacher is

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,900
not what you thought to be.

8
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,759
Your teacher?

9
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,520
Your teacher was defeated by me.

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,960
He approached you

11
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,200
to play against me.

12
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,080
He did it on purpose.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,800
Do you have too many haters?

14
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Is it why you are paranoid?

15
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,720
If he didn’t have other purposes,

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,800
why wasn’t he honest about who he is?

17
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,480
Who knows how many business secrets

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,079
has he gotten from you?

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,120
I am just giving you an alert.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,250
Don’t be taken advantage of
without even knowing it.

21
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,440
See you.

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,320
Come home.

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,840
Fine, I know.

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,800
You cheapskate.

25
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,160
Are you happy?

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,820
Happy, huh?

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,440
OK, let’s go sleep now. Let’s go.

28
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Mr. Du,

29
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,200
today I just got to know that

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,880
you’re GE’s Executive Director.

31
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,880
I asked for your mentorship before.

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,800
Mr. Du,

33
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,120
it’d be better if we meet less.

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,680
How shall I write this message?

35
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,640
You are drunk again.

36
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,840
Clients are the God.

37
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,840
What can I do?

38
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,820
Can I just not drink with them?

39
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,360
Is this the tie I bought for you?

40
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,080
I even bought a tie like this.

41
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
So ugly.

42
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Change it.

43
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,880
This one fits you better.

44
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,640
Do you remember when we were little?

45
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,360
You were afraid of darkness.

46
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,040
You always came to my bed for protection.

47
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,440
We could talk for the whole night.

48
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,010
You always did what you were told by me.

49
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,120
You shared everything with me.

50
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,320
But now,

51
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,800
more and more secrets between us.

52
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,400
Du,

53
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,920
I don’t like this.

54
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Sister,

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,720
you are doing drunk talk again.

56
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,370
Let me drive you home,

57
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,220
or dad will be worried about you.

58
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,980
[Jiang Jun]

59
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,680
Mr. Du,

60
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,000
thank you for your help lately.

61
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,480
I’m sorry about the misunderstanding

62
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,560
between you and my boss tonight.

63
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,220
I believe you can understand.

64
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,880
His concerns about you hiding your position

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,280
are out of discreetness.

66
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
I thought it over.

67
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,760
You did not intend to

68
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,960
intervene in my work.

69
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,680
But for the fairness in business,

70
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,440
I may not consider myself as your student anymore.

71
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,900
Thanks for your understanding, good night.

72
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,600
The day after tomorrow is dad’s birthday.

73
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
I am here to remind you.

74
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,260
You must prepare a gift that he likes,

75
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,840
and go to the dinner with me on time.

76
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,120
OK, got it.

77
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,840
Just go.

78
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,720
Yes, ma’am.

79
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
The one on two wheels gets up later

80
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,050
than the one on four wheels.

81
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,770
I bet you will be late today.

82
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,240
Can’t he get over with wheels?

83
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,440
Wait, wait.

84
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,780
I don’t mind giving you a ride.

85
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,360
I’ll take this

86
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,560
as the fare.

87
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,360
Thank you, Mr. Wheel.

88
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Your fast wheels will make me throw up.

89
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,280
You!

90
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,280
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

91
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,800
This is the so-called dinner.

92
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,480
What a fancy dinner!

93
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,560
Sure.

94
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,200
There are meat, broccoli,

95
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,200
and tomato.

96
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
A typical one.

97
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,340
Help yourself.

98
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,840
OK.

99
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,400
Since it’s a dinner,

100
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,060
we shall act like having a proper dinner.

101
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
This is for you.

102
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,600
Well, I.

103
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
The fork is mine.

104
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,360
Waitress.

105
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
May I have a yogurt?

106
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,560
Sure, wait a minute.

107
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,020
Yogurt?

108
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,500
You don’t know, right?

109
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:38,880
Thank you.

110
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,320
How’s it?

111
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
Pretty good.

112
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,720
We can do it again.

113
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Of course.

114
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,560
This is my idea.

115
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,680
For your sake,

116
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,400
you may take

117
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,960
half of my yogurt.

118
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,560
Thanks.

119
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,000
If I ask you invite me to dinner again,

120
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
would you do that?

121
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,080
No.

122
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,480
Why not?

123
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
Because I don’t think

124
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,160
what I ask you to do

125
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,460
deserves two dinners.

126
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,280
Well.

127
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,560
Well, what’s it for today?

128
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,840
This is the assessment of my App.

129
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,520
A questionnaire about relationships.

130
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,050
I need feedback from users.

131
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,240
So,

132
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,700
you invite me to dinner today,

133
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,160
just to let me fill out the questionnaire?

134
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,840
Let’s start.

135
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,020
Finally we are able to eat now.

136
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,640
This is tough work.

137
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,680
It reminds me of the days when

138
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,320
I wrote papers at Stanford.

139
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,920
You can relate anything to Stanford.

140
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,360
I am so impressed.

141
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,640
No.

142
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,280
You, you misunderstood me.

143
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,810
I’m really not showing off.

144
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,640
Say,

145
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,960
my tutor David Louis was nominated for

146
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,680
the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences.

147
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,010
Come on, keep bragging.

148
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,400
How do you have the nerve to

149
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,340
[Ma Xiuran, Investment Banking Department,
VP of MH]

150
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,020
submit a report like this?

151
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
You two are the worst new recruits

152
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,180
I have ever met.

153
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,480
How come I can’t see you?

154
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,280
Where are you?

155
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,090
Are you wearing invisibility cloaks?

156
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
I can’t feel your existence at all.

157
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
You are here to compete with others,

158
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
not to be undercovers, understand?

159
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,480
Go, go.

160
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,800
Look at the report you prepared.

161
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,330
How short-sighted you are!

162
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,160
From now on,

163
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,120
less talking, more action!

164
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,160
Why just three of you?

165
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,800
Where is another one?

166
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,120
I am here.

167
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Even though

168
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,160
it is Ms. Qiao who supervises

169
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,960
and mentors all the new recruits.

170
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,490
When the probation is over,

171
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,160
I’ll write work assessment about each of you

172
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
for the review of the board of directors.

173
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,560
It can grant you a work contract,

174
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,120
or send you to the gallows.

175
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,560
Understand?

176
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,040
Yes, sir.

177
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,920
Everyone!

178
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,000
I’ve talked to Mr. Fan.

179
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,200
I’ll take over all the

180
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,360
new analysts

181
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,400
to build a new team.

182
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,040
Just four of you.

183
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,360
So from now on,

184
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,440
you will work with me on

185
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,170
Wanxing Entertainment‘s IPO.

186
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,720
This is a great chance to show your talents.

187
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,480
I hope each of you will

188
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,040
let me see your

189
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,800
improvement, ambition and

190
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,160
competitiveness.

191
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,490
Understand?

192
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,520
Yes, sir.

193
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
Very good.

194
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Lunch is delayed.

195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,000
After work,

196
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,680
I will invite you to dinner.

197
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,280
Please read through the materials,

198
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
and meet me downstairs

199
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,160
in 15 minutes.

200
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,360
Yes, sir.

201
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,920
Wanxing has been an important client

202
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
of MH for 5 years.

203
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,120
In the past 3 years, we tried to get it

204
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,880
listed by using a shell company,

205
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,740
a wireless headphones producer.

206
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,120
But it’s banned under the new policy.

207
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,720
So we’re helping it

208
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,380
with its independent IPO now.

209
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,800
A failure in backdoor listing?

210
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
So it means the efforts were in vain.

211
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,440
Their CEO just died last week,

212
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
two weeks before the application deadline.

213
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
-It’s said Wan Shan is Wanxing’s
-Dead?

214
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,400
mastermind.

215
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,800
His taking office as the CEO now

216
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,330
will be very helpful for us.

217

-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

221
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,280
Hello,

222
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,500
we have met before.

223
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,840
But I’m sorry

224
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,080
last night was the final contest of

225
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,480
“Come on, girls”.

226
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Mr. Wan worked for the whole night.

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,160
He just came back to the office,

228
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,520
observing trainees in the training room.

229
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,500
No problem.

230
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,680
We can wait for him.

231
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,200
This is the team we built

232
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,720
for Wanxing’s IPO.

233
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,280
Would you please show us

234
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,160

235

Sure, no problem.

236
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,840
I’ll show you around.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,800

Usually,

242
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,240
before going to variety shows,

243
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,640
idols get dressed up and taken photos here.

244
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,109
This way.

245
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,560

254

255
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,720

Let me show you the way.

257
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,200

00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,600
What happened?

294
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,680
Do you need me to call the police?

295
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
No.

304
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,120
MH’s analyst?

305
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
What is that?

306
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,800
You crazy fans just pretend to be anything.

307
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,080
Crazy fan?

308
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,120
Stop it.

309
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,130
Take out your phone.

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,960
Delete the photos and videos you took.

311
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,160
I didn’t take anything.

312
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,040
Your phone.

313
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,640
Well, can I call my boss

314
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,040
Mr. Wan fainted and was hospitalized

321

322
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,560

326
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,040
please take care of yourself.

327
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,200
I didn’t expect Wan Shan to be like this.

328
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,860
They work much harder than me.

329
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,560
Work hard, no slack off!

330
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,040

334
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,040
Sorry, Mr. Wan.

335
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,440
What happened?

336
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
Go change your clothes.

337
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,680
Don’t get cold.

338
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,960
Go ahead.

339
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,080
Yes, sir.

340
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,240
I got it.

341
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,680
I am sorry.

342
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,640
The girl is just reckless.

343
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,120
Mr. Yuan, this way.

344
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,240
Isn’t it our popular girl?

345
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,800
And an eliminated one.

346
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,520
Where are you going?

347
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,720
What are you up to?

348
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,090
Guess what I am up to.

349
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,360
She didn’t see it coming today.

350
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes.

351
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,200
Right.

352
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,210
She deserves it.

353
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,400
Is this how you

354
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
seduced Mr. Wan?

355
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,880
You thought your dirty tricks

356
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,260
will get the guarantees from Mr. Wan?

357
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,320
Didn’t you get eliminated

358
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
before the final contest,

359
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,560
just like us?

360

361
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,200
No.

362
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,120
We are different.

363
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,040
We rely on our talents.

364
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,360
And you,

365
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,480
on your face.

366
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,000
Let’s go.

367
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,470
What a shame!

368
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,180
Let’s go.

369
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,480
Go, go, go.

370
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
Mr. Yuan,

371
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,980
shall we start now?

372
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,240
OK.

373
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,720
To prevent information leaks,

374
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,920
please turn off your phones.

375
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,720
Where is she?

376
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,800
Where are you?

377
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,100
Come to the conference room ASAP.

378
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,760
It’s my turn.

379
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,480
Go ahead.

380
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,600
4 Kings.

381
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,320
Are you in?

382
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,000
No, I’m out.

383
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,400
The Last two cards.

384
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,000
Go, go, go.

385
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,360
Jokers!

386
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,080
What a lucky streak!

387
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,160
How lucky you are!

388
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Such a good luck!

389
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,080
It’s my turn to ask questions.

390
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,000
You just said,

391
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,880
Mr. Wan has a resting room in the office.

392
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
Does he often work late and sleep here?

393
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,960
It’s a secret.

394
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,640
I’m telling you.

395
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Why did you pinch me?

396
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,680
I’m not finished.

397
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,160
What are you afraid of?

398
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,680
Yes.

399
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,920
Bet is bet. Let him finish.

400
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,720
Go ahead.

401
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,760
Last time at midnight, we saw a girl

402
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
came out of his office.

403
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,040
It was

404
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,920
almost 3 o’clock in the morning.

405
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,920
Yes, right.

406
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,400
I was wondering why did the girl

407
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,640
go out at midnight.

408
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,200
So you mean Mr. Wan and the girl…

409
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,520
Who is she?

410
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,600
Who?

411
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,880
Are you having fun?

412
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
Drinking, gambling?

413
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,360
No.

414
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,520
It’s not what it looks like.

415
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,580
You are out of line.

416
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:49,520
No, I…

417
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,960
Get up now.

418
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,920
You are really something.

419
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,160
Follow me.

420
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,840
I haven’t finished.

421
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,480
Who are you?

422
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,760
-Yeah.
-What are you doing?

423
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,400
Who are you?

424
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,880
We are just playing a game.

425
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,520
Truth or dare, OK?

426
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,920
She suggested playing it with us.

427
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,160
Want to leave?

428
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,960
Here.

429
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,980
3 cans left.

430
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,520
-Finish before you can leave.
-Finish.

431
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,380
Finish them and you may leave.

432
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,520
Pull yourself together.

433
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,080
Awesome!

434
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,250
Impressive!

435
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,050
Let’s go.

436
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Look at you, a girl

437
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,200
drinking and playing cards with

438
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,280
a bunch of guys at night.

439
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,020
Is this your attitude at work?

440
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,410
I was collecting information.

441
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,360
Due diligence, understand?

442
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,840
Due diligence.

443
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Due diligence.

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,130
What a creative way for due diligence!

445
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,400
What do you know?

446
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,800
I was so close,

447
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,040
just one step away, one step!

448
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,020
I will hand in the first report tomorrow.

449
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,360
My phone had been detained for 3 hours.

450
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,400
I could not enter the conference room later.

451
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,160
How did I get useful information

452
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,760
if I did not lower their guard

453
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,400
in my own way?

454
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,120
Your way is so, so

455
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,340
-genius.
-Shut up.

456
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,040
Stop interrupting. Listen.

457
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,600
I was just about to get inside information,

458
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,600
then you showed up and destroyed it.

459
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,600
Destroy?

460
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,640
It’s your fault.

461
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,160
Your fault, your fault!

462
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,930
I saved you just now.

463
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,970
I’m not listening, not listening!

464
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,000
Jiang Jun!

465
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,720
Jiang Jun!

466
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,880
I dare you to say it again.

467
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,580
[No cars nearby]

468
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,050
Get into the car.

469
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,800
No, I already hailed one.

470
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
It’s late night.

471
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,160
You, a drunk girl,

472
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,120
wandering on the street,

473
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,040
without any sense of security.

474
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,360
Is this the same girl I used to know?

475
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,520
I am what I am.

476
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,240
OK.

477
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,000
All right.

478
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,080
If you hand in the report later than others,

479
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,600
it would be counted as a mistake.

480
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,000
You are at probation period. It’s up to you.

481
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,600
You’re so mean!

482
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,360
Are you awake?

483
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,760
Hungry?

484
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,240
Let me feed you.

485
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Come on.

486
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,960
You have 50 questions left.

487
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,200
What?

488
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,000
50 questions left.

489
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
It’s too late now.

490
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,600
I have to go back for night shift.

491
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,720
I’ll finish it when I’m free.

492
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,880
And send it back to you.

493
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,680
All right.

494
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,320
Let me walk you there.

495
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,200
Walk me there?

496
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,360
Is he playing the trick of using

497
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,600
random excuses to spend time with the girl?

498
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,600
OK.

499
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,920
It’s on my way.

500
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,240
On your way?

501
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,330
You fell asleep,

502
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,130
I didn’t want to wake you up.

503
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,000
It’s a bit late now.

504
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,580
My campus is locked up.

505
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,880
I have to spend the night at the store.

506
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,920
Campus?

507
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,560
Are you still at university?

508
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,890
Third year of graduate school.

509
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,520
Not graduated yet.

510
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,120
He is younger than me.

511
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,200
But aren’t cradle snatcher

512
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,720
on-trend now?

513
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,200
Not a drinker at all,

514
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
yet not knowing how to drink safely.

515
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,280
So stubborn.

516
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,280
Jiang Jun.

517
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,400
I have been very nice to you.

518
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,240
If it was someone else

519
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,440
who made up his own mind and ran away,

520
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,320
I would have kicked him out of MH.

521
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,520
I’m talking to you.

522
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,880
She’s my girlfriend.

523
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Yuan Shuai.

524
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,400
Stop belittling me!

525
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,120
Stop bullying me!

526
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,320
Behave yourself,

527
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,240
or I’ll kick your ass!

Which hand is it?

532
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,960
The right hand, bro.

533
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,320
Wait.

534
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,440
You… When did you wake up?

535
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,840
Why didn’t you tell me?

536
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,530
Neither did you tell me we are back.

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,240
What?

538
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Why are you carrying me in your arms?

539
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,640
What do you mean by I didn’t tell you?

540
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,920
You don’t know how many times I tried,

541
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,840
but failed.

542
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,760
You were sleeping like a log.

543
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
Jiang Jun.

544
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,520
Did you pretend to be asleep?

545
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,440
Did you want me to carry you from

546
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,000
downstairs to your door?

547
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
What were you thinking about?

548
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,160
My butt!

549
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,080
Jiang Jun,

550
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,880
you had the nerve to push your boss?

551
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You.

552
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,880
Be careful about my revenge.

553
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,320
All right.

554
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,400
Thank you, boss, for sending me home.

555
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,200
Now it’s time to go home and rest.

556
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,240
Good night.

Verification failed, please try again.

558
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,400
The right hand.

559
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,960
I know.

560
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,280
Good night, boss.

561
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,840
Your bag.

562
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,440
My god!

564
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,210
When shall I register my fingerprint?

565
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,190
What a hardcore straight man!

566
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,480
So numb!

567
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,640
I bruised my ankle,

568
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,560
and broke my heel, what shall I do?

569
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
I…

570
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,720
Give… Give me your shoe.

571
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,240
Your shoe.

572
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,640
This one?

573
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,560
That one.

574
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,920
My shoe… You.

575
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,360
Here you go.

576
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,120
You can walk when they are the same high.

577
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,200
Let’s go.

578
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,760
My… The other foot hurts, too.

579
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,240
What’s wrong?

580
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,440
Can you just….?

581
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,400
Yes, I can.

582
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,560
Really?

583
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,050
Feels pretty good this way.

584
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,440
You, you… Put me down.

585
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,360
Put me down now.

586
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,840
I’m running late.

587
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,960
Wait a second.

588
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:58,840
Boss.

589
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,120
I’ll be back after changing my uniform.

590
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,250
All right, go ahead.

591
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,840
I’m back.

592
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,200
I’m leaving now.

593
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,130
OK. See you, bye.

594
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:20,880
Bye.

595
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,520
Hello,

596
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,920
20 yuan, please.

597
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,560
Alipay or WeChat pay?

598
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,020
Alipay.

599
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,680
OK.

600
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,760
Thank you.

601
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,410
20 yuan, please.

602
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,840
Thank you.

603
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,680
Sir,

604
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,520
your slippers, slippers…

605
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,720
I broke your shoe.

606
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
These are for you.

607
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,120
They look a bit ugly.

608
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,620
But the more I look at them, the prettier.

609
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,720
Xiang Ding,

610
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,320
your report is insipid,

611
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,920
but you classified the briefing

612
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,440
by assets.

613
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
Very meticulous.

614
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,840
It can be taken as a reference

615
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,440
before the deadline.

616
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,920
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

617
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,720
Chen Yicheng,

618
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,640
a Ph.D.

619
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,920
You put forward a creative idea,

620
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,380
yet it’s difficult to be implemented

621
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,800
under the current regulations.

622
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,080
But it’s very foresighted.

623
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,920
Very good.

624
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,210
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

625
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,480
Shen Xin.

626
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,280
It’s a waste of my time to

627
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,960
read such a report.

628
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,880
Please give me another 4 hours.

629
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,680
I will give you a perfect report.

630
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,600
4 hours?

631
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,820
You over-evaluate yourself.

632
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,770
You are far from perfect

633
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,380
even if I gave you 40 hours.

634
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,740
Let me say it again.

635
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,600
It’s less than 2 weeks away from

636
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,640
Wanxing’s IPO.

637
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,720
Before that,

638
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,640
you need to drain your brain,

639
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,010
strive for perfection in every report

640
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,400
and solve all the problems.

641
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Am I clear?

642
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,160
You may leave know.

643
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,760
OK.

644
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,050
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

645
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,240
Mr. Yuan, my report…

646
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,860
Jiang Jun, stay here for private lecturing.

647
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
You’ve been to the office

648
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,560
and played truth or dare.

649
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:26,120
So this is the truth you handed in?

650
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,560
You are stubborn as a mule.

651
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,880
Come here.

652
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
Mr. Yuan, please be straightforward.

653
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,970
I can hear you from here.

654
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,200
I can’t say it out loud.

655
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,340
Come over here.

656
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,340
You mentioned in your report,

657
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,920
they have serious disciplinary problems.

658
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,440
What are these problems?

659
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,160
I did find something.

660
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,260
But I don’t have solid proofs now.

661
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,250
So I can’t provide the details.

662
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,530
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

663
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,770
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

664
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,440
Ms. Qiao,

665
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
may I take a few minutes of your time?

666
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,480
I want to ask you how to fill out the data.

667
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,400
I am busy right now.

668
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,960
Turn to Mr. Yuan for Wanxing’s matters.

669
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
He is tutoring Jiang Jun

670
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,720
in private now.

671
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,240
The door is closed.

672
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,440
I can’t just break in.

673
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,700
But the data is needed right away.

674
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
Leave it for now.

675
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,680
Isn’t it the second-hand info you got

676
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,280
by drinking and playing cards?

677
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,880
Stop keeping me in suspense.

678
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,040
Don’t underestimate second-hand info.

679
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,200
It might be processed and exaggerated.

680
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,240
But in many cases,

681
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,200
it’s more reliable and objective.

682
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,960
Words alone are no proof.

683
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,760
It’s said Wan Shan has a hidden resting room,

684
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,240
which might be fishy.

685
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,160
But an entertainment group, you know,

686
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,000
is complicated.

687
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,200
So it’s hard to say.

688
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,000
You mean,

689
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,320
there is a hidden resting room.

690
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,080
And they said,

691
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,800
the entrance and exit are well hidden.

692
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,000
They are hard to find.

693
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,800
But in fact, it’s an open secret

694
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,920
among trainees.

695
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,240
So where is the resting room?

696
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,800
I was not messing around and playing cards.

697
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
I walked through the whole office area.

698
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,800
I have a photographic memory of that place.

699
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,280
You memorized the location of

700
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,680
their offices.

701
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,880
It’s just hard to believe.

702
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,480
When you were little, you were even

703
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,340
confused about the speech topic.

704
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,320
How dare you bring it up again?

705
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,480
I am sorry.

706
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
I forgot to knock on the door.

707
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,620
Love Is Sweet
