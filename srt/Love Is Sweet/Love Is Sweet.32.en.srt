Episode 32

5
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,500
Come in.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,039
Mr. Du,

7
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,400
Baxi's M&A loan was approved.

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,479
Director Liu agreed?

9
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,640
Yuan Shuai and Director Liu were acquaintances,

10
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,759
so I asked him for a favor.

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,320
Later, they got very cooperative.

12
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,479
After we resubmitted the materials

13
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,520
in accordance with their requirements,

14
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,720
it was soon approved.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,970
Don't you like the watch I gave you?

16
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,720
This is...

17
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,560
Jiang Jun,

18
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,280
please be professional in the future.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
Yuan Shuai works for GE now, after all.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,480
I think you know better than anyone

21
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
about the relationship between the two of you.

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
You need to avert suspicion.

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,920
This is MH’s project.

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,840
How can you just let someone

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,770
from a rival company get in the way?

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,900
It’s not like that.

27
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,560
We just had a meal

28
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,600
with Director Liu together.

29
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,260
But this is not the first time.

30
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,000
Last time in the Fengchao case,
they robbed us of our achievements.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,400
You think nobody in this company gossiped?

32
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
People who don't know

33
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,920
will think that we are inferior.

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,440
Do you still want to stay in the company

35
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,970
if someone with an ulterior motive finds out?

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,490
It’s not that I haven’t taught you that

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,300
gossiping is a fearful thing.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,880
This time I was thoughtless.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,080
I'll be careful in the future.

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Make sure it won't happen again.

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,040
When you get back,

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,800
go over the merger data yourself

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,200
and give me a detailed report on Wednesday.

44
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Ok.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,380
One more thing.

46
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,410
Please come to me

47
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,570
if you have any problems in the future.

48
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,460
After all, your current boss,

49
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,600
is me, not him.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,200
I see.

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,940
Have you heard that

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,960
Ms. Jiang was scolded?

53
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,200
Yes.

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,250
It's rare to see Mr. Du get so angry.

55
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
I heard that the Secretary Department

56
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,720
did not dare to send documents in the afternoon,

57
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,650
for fearing of being scolded, too.

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,640
I heard that

59
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Ms. Jiang had a meal with the client

60
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,480
and Mr. Yuan.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
I don’t think it's a big deal.

62
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,280
Why did he…

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,120
I’m telling you, out of kindness,

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,880
that Mr. Du is in a bad mood today.

65
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,040
You'd better stop gossiping here.

66
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Be careful about getting fired.

67
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
That makes sense.

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Honey,

69
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,829
I’ll wait for you to get off work tonight.

70
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,440
Ok.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,200
Single guy!

72
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,580
Come in.

73
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,380
Everybody's left. Why didn't you go?

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,010
I have a few things to do. Go back first.

75
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,440
All right. Then I'm gonna go. Go home early.

76
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Bye.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,440
Bye.

78
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,280
Tired?

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,730
Why are you so late from work today?

80
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Don't mention it.

81
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,880
Mr. Du was furious

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,920
when he found out you were helping me out
with Director Liu.

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,450
He gave me a piece of his mind

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,480
and ordered me to go over

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
all the materials for the merger

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,400
and write a report to him.

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,210
I'm not leaving early for the rest of the week.

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,640
What did he say?

89
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,100
He said I didn't know how to avert suspicion.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
But he's right.

91
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,520
I was too eager for quick success,
and did not separate business from private life.

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,360
It's my fault.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,090
What's the matter with you?

94
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I'm fine. I just have a stomachache.

95
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Jiang Jun, you haven’t eaten again?

96
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,520
I had coffee.

97
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,640
Let's go. I'll take you to dinner first.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,760
You are too busy to eat.

99
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
Why don't you quit?

100
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Stop working.

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,370
I'll provide for you in the future.

102
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,280
I have such a big appetite,

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,920
and you are not afraid that
I will empty all your property?

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,960
You're kidding.

105
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,760
When you are free, check my balance.

106
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
You will find that

107
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,800
it is only a ridiculous fantasy

108
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,330
to try to empty my property.

109
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Yuan Shuai.

110
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,480
I know

111
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,370
you are devoted to your job.

112
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,800
In fact, I will always support you.

113
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,960
I just don't want to see you work so hard.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,090
With you by my side, I don't feel it’s hard.

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,760
I'll take a nap. Wake me up when we are there.

116
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,700
Shengxin's case goes according to the plan.

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,080
Shen Xin, send a copy of the schedule
to my mailbox.

118
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:37,480
Ok.

119
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,840
Chen Yicheng,

120
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,960
send me the evaluation report of Rongda
before getting off work.

121
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,720
Thanks.

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,360
Ok.

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,890
If there is nothing else, the meeting is over.

124
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Why do you look so pale?

125
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
Are you all right?

126
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,280
Have you offended Mr. Du recently?

127
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
How can he assign you so many projects?

128
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,120
I don't think you can finish your work
even if you live in the company.

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,320
No, it's all normal work arrangements.

130
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,520
It’s so late.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,640
How about getting something to eat together?

132
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Go ahead. I'm not hungry.

133
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,570
I have work to do.

134
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,970
All right. Then I'll get going.

135
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,630
Jiang Jun!

136
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,909
Jiang Jun!

[Emergency Room, Inpatient Building]

139
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,280
Doctor,

140
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,560
how is she?

141
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Don't worry.

142
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
According to the preliminary diagnosis,

143
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,480
it was syncope due to the acute gastroenteritis.

144
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,320
It should be caused by long-term overwork

145
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,450
and irregular diet.

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
Stay in the hospital
for a few days and she’ll be fine.

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,280
Thank you, doctor.

148
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,210
You're welcome.

149
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,100
Are you satisfied now?

150
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,520
Unreasonable projects,

151
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,570
crazy overtime,

152
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,980
and ineffective and frequent meetings.

153
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
Du Lei,

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,920
are you doing this because you're jealous?

155
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,290
Why are you so childish?

156
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,280
I know

157
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,490
she's sick and you're worried.

158
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,360
However, your groundless speculation

159
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,690
will only make people think that you are the one
who is naive.

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,520
Sorry, Mr. Du,

161
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,170
but now is the time off work.

162
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,320
There is no reason for you to stay here.

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm her boyfriend.

164
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,440
I'll just stay and take care of her.

165
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,360
I'm her boss.

166
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
It's my job

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,810
to worry about a sick subordinate.

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,120
Jiang Jun,

169
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,840
how are you?

170
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm thirsty.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,560
Here.

172
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,040
Drink slowly.

173
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,280
How do you feel? Are you feeling better?

174
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
Mr. Du, I'm sorry.

175
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
I couldn't finish today's work.

176
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
You mustn't say that.

177
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,120
You're enslaved to syncope by the capitalists.

178
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,480
They have to send you
to the hospital immediately.

179
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,400
Or whom will they enslave in the future?

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,330
It's not your fault.

181
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
I've been putting too much pressure
on you lately.

182
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,840
Have a good rest.

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,520
I'll take care of the business of the company
right now.

184
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,560
Come back

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,250
when you are well again.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Look.

187
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
You didn't have a good rest

188
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,940
and worked until you fainted.

189
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,040
Your health is the most important of all things.

190
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Do you know?

191
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,400
I was too busy to notice the time

192
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,440
and forgot to eat.

193
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
Here, have some more.

194
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,480
Rest more

195
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,440
and eat regularly in the future.

196
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,410
Watch your step.

197
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,920
I am fine.

198
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,880
It's the same as the hypoglycemia.

199
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
It’s not like I lost my arms or legs.

200
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,880
Don't treat me like I'm the old or the disabled.

201
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,810
What did you say?

202
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,240
Hypoglycemia?

203
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,760
Ma’am,

204
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,960
you know,

205
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
the severe gastroenteritis can result

206
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,450
in shock from dehydration,

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,680
and environmental disorders,

208
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,120
or death.

209
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,080
I always tell you to eat on time
and take breaks on time,

210
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,410
but you ignore them all.

211
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,320
You have at least three cups of coffee a day.

212
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,120
Do you think you're made of iron?

213
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,960
If I hadn't been with you,

214
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,010
you would have fallen ill long ago.

215
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,080
This

216
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,380
[One-week recuperation diet]

217
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,920
is your menu for the next week.

218
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,330
Take a good look.

219
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,120
You can ask me if you have any questions.

220
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,080
Yuan Shuai,

221
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,120
did you

222
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,000
copy the diet for pigs?

223
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
If I eat like this for a week, I'll get so fat!

224
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,450
Your protest is denied.

225
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,120
And then,

226
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,840
I'm going to prepare your
fifth meal of the day,

227
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,360
kiwi with bean and longan sauce porridge.

228
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,780
Wait for me.

229
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,960
Bean and longan sauce...

230
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
What are you going to do with the computer?

231
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,760
Work?

232
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,370
No. I'm going to watch a TV play.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,860
Watch a TV show?

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Then why do you put the iPad aside

235
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,620
and use the computer instead?

236
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
I have a case to deal with.

237
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
I'll just have a look.

238
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,160
No.

239
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,880
Jiang Jun,

240
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,520
you are a patient now.

241
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,360
Any work will interfere with your rest.

242
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,980
Do you understand?

243
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Besides,

244
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,800
since you made a mistake,

245
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,160
you should be punished.

246
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
What punishment?

247
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,920
A pain in the ass.

248
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,640
Sleep tight. I'm here for you.

249
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,080
Here.

250
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,740
Good night.

251
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,080
Good night.

252
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,340
Where do you want to go?

253
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,660
Look at you.

254
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,440
I know

255
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,880
you haven't taken your annual leave yet.

256
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,520
So,

257
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,680
I asked Mr. Du

258
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,320
for a seven-day holiday.

259
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,480
In the next few days,

260
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
behave yourself,

261
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,720
stay at home,

262
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,280
and get a good rest.

263
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,680
I know you care about me,

264
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,440
but it's not so good to ask for leave for me.

265
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,560
Yuan Shuai.

266
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,080
What's the matter with you?

267
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,080
Why didn't you tell us you were sick?

268
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,480
Mr. Yuan, you can go to work.

269
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,140
We're here to take care of her.

270
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,480
Xiaochuan and I went to buy the things
to be stewed early in the morning.

271
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,240
There are chicken and things like that.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll stew them for you later.

273
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,520
It's reassuring to have someone
taking care of you.

274
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,200
Honey, I'm going to work.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,640
Bye-bye.

276
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,720
Bye-bye.

277
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Watch her closely.

278
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,960
Watch her closely.

279
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,320
Don’t you want something to eat?

280
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,120
No.

281
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
How are you feeling now?

282
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,760
Is there anything else wrong?

283
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm fine. I was already fine!

284
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Yuan Shuai insisted that I rest for a week.

285
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,940
He did the right thing.

286
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,000
Look!

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,760
See what I got you.

288
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,360
Your skin is so dry.

289
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,920
You haven't put on a face mask for days,
have you?

290
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,720
Take this small reservoir
and apply the mask well.

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,600
You are the best to me.

292
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,580
I have something else.

293
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,520
What is it?

294
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,210
Put it away! Put it away!

295
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,280
Why?

296
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
I’m bringing in good luck.

297
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Let's have one for each of us.

298
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,240
Maybe we all get pregnant.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
Put it away!

300
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,890
Jiang Jun, have some watermelons.

301
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,000
Thanks.

302
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,570
What are you talking about?

303
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,240
Woman's secrets. You don't need to know.

304
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,100
What's the secret? I want to hear.

305
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,829
The watermelon is too cold

306
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:06,880
for you to eat.

307
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,950
I'll get you something else.

308
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,440
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

309
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,770
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

310
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,060
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.
-Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

311
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,040
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

312
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,829
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

313
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:25,109
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

314
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,440
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

315
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,160
Good morning, Ms. Qiao.

[My love for you will never stop.
Jia Yuanji]

317
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,600
Little kid!

318
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,480
Hello.

319
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,320
Please ask the staff

320
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,680
to clean up my office.

321
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,840
Clean…

322
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
Qiao,

323
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,520
if you accept my love,

324
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,560
I can promise

325
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
to surprise you every day.

326
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,240
Kid,

327
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,120
your behavior

328
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,880
are too naive.

329
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,690
You want to chase me?

330
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,920
Save it!

331
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,720
Three minutes! Clean it up.

332
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Qiao!

333
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,130
Qiao! I've been preparing this all night.

334
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,960
I'm telling you,

335
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,000
I have a friend

336
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,420
who got pregnant during the safe period.

337
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,320
You’re awake?

338
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,570
Why did you wake up so early?

339
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,740
Didn't sleep well?

340
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,020
What's the matter?

341
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,560
Yuan Shuai.

342
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:34,880
I…

343
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,160
What?

344
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,520
I’m hungry.

345
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,400
I’ll get you something to eat.

346
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,020
What would you like to eat?

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:51,760
Crawfish.

348
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,920
Crawfish.

349
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,880
Ok.

350
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,780
You sleep a little longer.

351
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,580
Wait for me.

352
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,080
Rest assured.

353
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,640
I have told the accountant

354
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,960
about the financial report of Huanyu Group.

355
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,880
We will do it in the same way as last year.

356
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,560
I'll handle the CSRC.

357
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,040
Thank you very much, Mr. Du.

358
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,440
We've prepared

359
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,700
something for you.

360
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
Well, since you are sincere,

361
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,960
it would be impolite for me to reject it.

362
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,480
It’s the same account.

363
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,680
Yes.

364
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,520
I have to go.

365
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,480
Mr. Du!

366
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,040
Anything I can do?

367
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,040
I am anxious

368
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,400
to ask you to sign the SKL file urgently.

369
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,720
When did you come?

370
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,640
I've been standing outside for a while.

371
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,080
Pen.

372
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,680
Next time if you have an emergency,

373
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,940
just knock on the door.

374
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,160
Ok.

375
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,340

How is Jiang Jun?

379
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,120
She’s fine.

380
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,080
It’s just that she should pay more attention
to her diet in the future.

381
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,540
How's it going over there?

382
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm sad.

383

She said she did not have any interest in me.

Do you have any tips?

385
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,560
She needs to be surprised.

386
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,560
You have to figure it out by yourself.

387
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,330

I do have my own problems.

00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I should have thought about this
a little bit earlier.

No.

So, I will respect all your decisions.

In the future,

441
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,800
you can still work in the Investment Banking Department.

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,240
No! How ugly it is.

562
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,960
Children wouldn’t put away these things either.

563
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,560
If

564
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,000
he drops the block

565
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
and steps on it like this,

566
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,929
that would be fun then.

567
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,150
Li Xiaochuan, maybe you shouldn't
start your own business.

568
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:20,000
You should be a professional whose job
is to talk back.

569
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,800
Mr. Li,

570
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,080
I didn't expect it was really you.

571
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,480
I thought I was mistaken.

572
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
Do you remember me?

573
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,530
I’m Cheng from Weiran Technology.

574
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,840
Hello.

575
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,710
And this is…

576
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,320
My wife, Xu Li.

577
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,150
Hello.

578
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,440
So you are Mrs. Li.

579
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,920
I didn't expect that

580
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,230
Mr. Li would like

581
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,480
this kind of girl.

582
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,820
Is there a problem?

583
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,230
Not really.

584
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,280
I just didn't expect

585
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,360
Mrs. Li to be so pure and lovely.

586
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,670
I’d think she is a high school student
if you did not tell me this.

587
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm sorry.

588
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,800
My wife is free to dress as she likes.

589
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
She doesn't need your judgment at all.

590
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,560
Thank you.

591
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,480
Honey,

592
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
didn’t you say you like the building blocks?

593
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,440
Then buy the whole thing.

594
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,640
And that wet paper towel humidifier
or something.

595
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
We'll get it, too.

596
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,450
I'll buy you anything you like.

597

No, no. That…

622
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,440
That is the background music

behind my back?

633
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,930
