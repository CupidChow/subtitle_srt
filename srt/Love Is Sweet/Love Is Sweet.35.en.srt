Love Is Sweet

Episode 35

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,800
How do you think about

6
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,880
Yingchi Motor’s stock hitting the decline limit?

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,740
Three days ago,

8
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,440
Yingchi recalled all the new cars

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,600
that were launched this year.

10
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,840
The stock value of Yingchi

11
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,080
will hit the bottom.

12
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
But I think before long

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,320
its stocks will start to soar.

14
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,120
Because Baylor Energy will take over Yingchi.

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
Are you sure?

16
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,640
Both Yingchi’s debt ratio

17
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,160
and cost remain high.

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,660
Why would Baylor Energy take over it?

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,680
Although Baylor Energy has

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,920
billions of dollars on paper,

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,880
its equity is dispersed with low valuation.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,080
It’s facing the risk of the hostile takeover.

23
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,240
Purchasing Yingchi

24
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,960
will be their poison pill.

25
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,240
You are Shen Xin from MH?

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,050
Hello? Shen Xin.

27
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,610
How was your interview?

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,400
Jiang Jun,

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,040
I passed the interview in GE.

30
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I’ll start working there next week.

31
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,800
Really?

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,000
Congratulations!

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,200
Thank you, Jiang Jun.

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,560
I’m thankful that you and Mr. Yuan
vouched for me.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,440
By the way, are you free tonight?

36
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,960
I want to invite you, Mr. Yuan and Ms. Qiao

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,280
to a dinner to thank you guys.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,960
And we can also

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,820
take this chance to get together.

40
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
Of course. I’ll be there.

41
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,040
Bye.

42
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Come in.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,120
Jiang Jun!

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,600
Oh, sorry.

45
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,880
Ms. Jiang!

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,320
Shen Xin passed the interview in GE.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,240
Have you heard that?

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,120
I have.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,460
Congratulations!

50
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Now you don’t have to worry anymore.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
By the way, I need you to do me a favor.

52
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,920
Of course.

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,760
Go to the IT Dept. after work

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
and send me all the files regarding

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
Huanyu Group after Mr. Du took charge of it.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,200
Remember,

57
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,040
wait till everybody’s left.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,360
Mr. Du?

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,000
Is there a problem?

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,130
I’m not sure.

61
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,120
I just suspect

62
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,240
that it has something to do
with Shen Xin and Xiang Ding’s dismission.

63
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,320
Remember, you’ve got to keep it a secret.

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,200
Got it.

65
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,300
[TOWER 2]

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
Jiang Jun!

67
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,800
I was drunk last night. I’m sorry.

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,600
Mr. Du.

69
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,920
It wouldn’t be fine

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,420
if I told you it’s okay.

71
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,000
But don’t worry.

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,090
I will do my best to calm myself,

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,210
and maintain our

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,400
boss-subordinate relationship

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,000
before I resign.

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,720
You are still determined to leave MH?

77
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,480
Yes, I am.

78
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,520
Do I really mean

79
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
nothing to you?

80
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,240
Okay.

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,080
I see.

82
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
Then I’m leaving.

83
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,960
[West World]

84
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,880
Honey.

85
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,010
Where are you going?

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Honey?

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,240
What? You’ll also run away from home like I did?

88
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,660
I’ll go on a business trip.

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,760
A business trip?

90
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,680
For how long?

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,140
I’ll be back tomorrow.

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,320
But,

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,400
tomorrow is a very important day.

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,320
It is.

95
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,159
I’ll meet the investor.

96
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,440
That’s it?

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
Think again.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,960
Is there another important thing?

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,840
No.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
Li Xiaochuan!

101
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,920
Aren’t you even curious about yesterday?

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
What do you want me to ask?

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,280
I’ve seen it myself.

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,420
Congratulations!

105
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,010
Your willfulness has reached a new level.

106
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
But,

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,840
I’ve told you that I’d leave.

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,480
So of course I’d do what I was intended to do.

109
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,920
But I don’t want you

110
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
to be with that man.

111
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,280
You don’t know who he is

112
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,760
and what kinda person he is.

113
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,600
Besides,

114
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,820
he knows that you are married,

115
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,610
but he’s still going after you.

116
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,280
He’s not to be trusted.

117
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,560
Not really.

118
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,280
I think he’s a nice person.

119
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,170
He plays the guitar,
and he’s humorous and funny.

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,480
Unlike you,

121
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,200
he can also drink with me.

122
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,080
So you mean

123
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,159
you enjoy his company, right?

124
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,520
I guess.

125
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,600
Anyway, our love has passed

126
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
its most exciting time.

127
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,440
Somebody doesn’t think

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,480
I’m that attractive anymore.

129
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,320
And I

130
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,920
happen to find

131
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,920
that I’m no longer

132
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,400
attracted to you either.

133
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,000
Fine.

134
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,440
Whatever.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,930
Then go ahead and hang out with him.

136
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,800
Li Xiaochuan!

137
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,160
I was just kidding.

138
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,160
Why

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,000
did you take it so seriously?

140
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,680
I just want you

141
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,960
to care about me more.

142
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,760
Are you done?

143
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Xiaochuan,

144
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,200
I understand

145
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,000
that a lot of things in your world

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,620
are more important than love.

147
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,840
But to me,

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,320
Xu Li,

149
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,040
love always comes first.

150
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
You are the only light

151
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,120
in my world.

152
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,880
If you don’t love me anymore,

153
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,520
or,

154
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,730
you don’t love me as much as before,

155
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,000
I’ll get lost from your life.

156
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
I know

157
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,600
it’s a little selfish saying so,

158
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,400
but this is my real thought.

159
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,760
I really hope you can care about me

160
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,120
as much as I care about you.

161
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,650
At least let me feel it once.

162
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
Sometimes, humans will do the same.

163
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,280
When you fall in love with someone,

164
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,640
you’ll protect that person at any cost,

165
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,280
just like the Zhou Star.

166
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,000
It’s a small gift to show my gratitude.

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,120
Hope you’ll like it.

168
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:52,960
Looks like

169
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,120
I need a new suit to go with it.

170
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,840
They’ve been evolving

171
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,440
over the long course of time.

172
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,560
Maybe they got used to it long ago.

173
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,640
But I think,

174
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,240
if they ever had a chance to see the sunlight,

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,570
they’d no longer want to

176
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
live in the dark deep sea,

177
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,040
and would strive to head toward the sunlight.

178
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,840
If I were them,

179
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
I’d do the same.

180
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,560
Sorry.

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,740
It was thoughtless of me
to make you misunderstand.

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,880
You guessed right.

183
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,080
I want to get married.

184
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,880
So, you should realize

185
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,010
I will not reciprocate your feelings.

186
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,460
You really can’t wait to leave me?

187
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,320
Fine.

188
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,640
I’ll help you.

189
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,520
Hello?

190
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,720
I just sent an email to you.

191
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,040
Release it right now.

192
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,090
The more sensational, the better.

193
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,880
I haven’t sung like this for a long time.

194
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,840
What a great way to relax.

195
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,480
Here!

196
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,520
Cheers!

197
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,000
Cheers!

198
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,960
Shen Xin,

199
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,680
good luck on your new job in GE.

200
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,640
I know you can do it.

201
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,600
No worry, Ms. Qiao.

202
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,520
I will do my best

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,920
and work hard.

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,530
By the way, did Xiang Ding go back home?

205
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
Yes. He did.

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,640
He told his parents about it.

207
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,800
If he didn’t go,

208
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,760
his parents would be very sad.

209
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,240
I think everybody has a right

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,660
to choose his own path.

211
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,320
Perhaps he thinks

212
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,800
that having a decent job in a big city

213
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,730
is unnecessarily the only option.

214
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,880
Mr. Yuan, welcome!

215
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,800
Long time no see.

216
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,560
You are here.

217
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,410
I brought a friend here.

218
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,400
Hope you won’t mind.

219
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Of course, not.

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,520
Come in.

221
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,880
Yuanji, it’s you!

222
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,810
What are you doing here?

223
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,560
Qiao, don’t get me wrong.

224
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,380
I’m here because of Yuan’s warm invitation.

225
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,740
Take a seat.

226
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,600
Then, I’ll

227
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,320
sit here.

228
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,200
Yuan Shuai,
can you discipline your brother here?

229
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
I can’t.

230
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,300
He’s in charge.

231
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,400
Qiao, I only listen to you.

232
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
Why isn’t Chen Yicheng here yet?

233
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,000
I asked him to help me with something.

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,760
He’ll be here later.

235
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Okay. Then let’s start without him.

236
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,400
Today, I invited you over

237
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
to extend my gratitude to all of you.

238
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Ms. Qiao, thank you for your encouragement.

239
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,400
Jiang Jun, thank you for your trust

240
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,460
and all your effort

241
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,600
in helping Xiang Ding and me.

242
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Most importantly, I want to thank Mr. Yuan

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
for providing me with the opportunity

244
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,520
so that I can get the job in GE.

245
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Here, cheers!

246
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,680
Here!

247
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,120
Shen Xin.

248
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,720
Don’t mention it.

249
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,320
You can get the job in GE mainly because

250
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
of your own capabilities and experience.

251
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,600
Right?

252
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,480
Congratulations!

253
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Here, cheers!

254
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,640
Congratulations!

255
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Thank you!

256
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
Take it slowly.

257
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,120
I know.

258
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,600
Sorry! Sorry

259
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,600
that I’m late!

260
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
I’m sorry!

261
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,320
You are back.

262
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,080
There you are.

263
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,760
Oh, here,

264
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,680
Jiang Jun.

265
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
This is what you asked for.

266
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,600
Thank you.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,920
What is it?

268
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
The stuff you reminded me of.

269
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,080
I’ll tell you later.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,240
Since we are all here now,

271
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,080
I have something to tell you guys.

272
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,210
I’m going to resign.

273
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,560
What?

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,400
Why… Why so sudden?

275
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,650
Is it because we got you in trouble?

276
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,630
He approved?

277
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Seems like it.

278
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,160
By the way,

279
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,000
I resign

280
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,240
because I think there are

281
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,840
more important things to do.

282
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,160
It has nothing to do with you guys.

283
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,960
Don’t think I’m doing it for you.

284
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,960
I think Ms. Jiang is going to show us

285
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,080
how to invest when it’s a bear market
and how to take a break when it’s a bull.

286
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,640
I’m sure she has a strategy

287
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
carrying out her career development plan, right?

288
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,660
Good for you, Mr. Chen!

289
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,960
What a smart way to mock me.

290
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
I didn’t mean that.

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,130
You’ve made your decision?

292
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,040
I have.

293
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,000
I’ll toast to all of you!

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,860
Together or not,
we are always the brightest stars.

295
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,160
Cheers!

296
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,720
Ms. Jiang

297
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,400
is a delicate girl.

298
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,760
I will drink

299
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
on her behalf tonight.

300
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,560
I suddenly feel like

301
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,280
my body has become delicate, too!

302
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,960
What should I do?

303
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,490
Qiao, I’ll drink it for you!

304
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,960
-Stop it! Here!
-Cheers!

305
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,160
Now, watch me!

306
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
That’s amazing, Mr. Yuan!

307
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,660
Mr. Yuan, good for you!

308
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,880
You know that I can drink.

309
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,680
I really miss the days

310
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,440
when we first got in MH.

311
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,480
Back then, the four of us didn’t know anything.

312
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,600
Every day when we got to work,

313
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,840
Ms. Qiao would encourage us

314
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,320
and Mr. Yuan would inspire us.

315
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,160
And on top of that,

316
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
Jiang Jun, as the most outstanding one,

317
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
always led us to go higher and further.

318
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,210
When thinking about it,

319
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,650
I can’t believe time flew by this quickly.

320
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,840
Tell me about it.

321
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,440
After today,

322
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,640
we’ll all start a new chapter in life.

323
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
I think it’d be

324
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,480
really hard for us

325
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,060
to get together again.

326
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,360
So,

327
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,960
I think we should drink

328
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
as much as we can tonight,

329
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,840
okay?

330
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,480
Okay!

331
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,000
Alright!

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,560
Let’s drink it up!

333
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,080
Come on!

334
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,680
Fill the cup!

335
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,200
Fill the cup!

336
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Here!

337
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,450
Let me drink one more cup, okay?

338
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,320
Go ahead.

339
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,440
Here.

340
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,480
Cheers.

341
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,480
Here, let’s toast to our glorious time in MH!

342
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,960
Cheers!

343
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,440
You know what?

344
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,360
Shen Xin got the job in GE

345
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,720
because of Ms. Jiang’s recommendation letter.

346
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,120
There’s a lot of hard evidence in this post.

347
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,400
It’s Ms. Jiang who leaked the offer of SKL.

348
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,760
Is she really running a “family business” now

349
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,920
with Mr. Yuan of GE?

350
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,840
Ms. Jiang,

351
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,920
something happened.

352
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,280
What is this?

353
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,640
Mr. Du.

354
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,040
Come to my office.

355
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,780
[MD Yuan Shuai]

356
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,800
Boss, look.

357
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
This person has posted this rumor

358
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
on a dozen of industry BBS and groups

359
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,900
[Investment bank couple conspired to
reap huge profits by leaking clients' information.]

360
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,400
within two hours.

361
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,880
He claims that he’s from GE

362
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,200
and he knows a lot of inside information.

363
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,320
He said that you and Jiang Jun

364
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,920
poached the team in secret,

365
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,200
exchanged confidential files

366
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,330
and disclosed clients’ information.

367
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,120
He also said that you two are malignant tumors
in the investment banking industry,

368
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,850
and he has Jiang Jun’s recommendation letter
as the hard evidence.

369
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
What a bunch of lies!

370
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,760
If I find out who did this,

371
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,840
I will kill him myself!

372
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Hello? Chairman.

373
00:18:59,000 --> 00:18:59,680
Yuan Shuai,

374
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,960
what’s going on with the recommendation letter?

375
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,040
Chairman, I’m dealing with it right now.

376
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,080
The directors

377
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,840
have been calling me since early this morning.

378
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,040
Listen,

379
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,360
you’ve got to solve this problem as early as possible

380
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,560
Don’t worry. I will.

381
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,840
Apparently,

382
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
someone did this on purpose.

383
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
The HR Dept. wouldn’t dare release

384
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,650
the recommendation letter you gave them.

385
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,600
Besides,

386
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,920
this person knows you and GE quite well.

387
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
Chances are that this person

388
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,360
is one of us.

389
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,730
Unnecessarily.

390
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,540
It could be someone

391
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,360
who used to work in GE.

392
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,060
Is there anything I can help with?

393
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,160
No.

394
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
As long as you ask,

395
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,260
I will make all your troubles go away.

396
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,880
Thanks. But I can take care of it myself.

397
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,120
How will you do that?

398
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,440
Listen to me.

399
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
If you can’t solve this problem,

400
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,250
you’ll lose everything

401
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,840
you own!

402
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,040
At this moment,

403
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,100
why can’t you just ask for my help?

404
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,680
I admit that I got anxious.

405
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,480
That’s why I wrote
a recommendation letter to Yuan Shuai.

406
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,760
But I promise we never did any

407
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,160
of the other things that the post accused us of!

408
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,320
You think people would trust you

409
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,240
at this point when you claim

410
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,500
that you are innocent?

411
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,920
I will make a statement in front of the Board.

412
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,880
Even if I’m going to resign,

413
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,920
I won’t leave with guilt,

414
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,520
and I will definitely not get others involved.

415
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
As for you, Mr. Du,

416
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,360
how are you going to explain to the Board

417
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,360
about the false financial report of Huanyu Group?

418
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
You investigated me?

419
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,260
There’s a problem indeed.

420
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,520
It started from the Q4 income statement

421
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
and balance sheet two years ago.

422
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,000
There’s no way that Du Lei couldn’t find out

423
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,600
that there was a deviation of more than 30%
between the gross margin

424
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,660
and the annual average gross margin.

425
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,400
And the accountant wouldn’t have been able

426
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,840
to cheat during the field visit

427
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,880
and notice submission.

428
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,890
The three parties are all involved
in this fraud.

429
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,160
I guess

430
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,640
this is what Shen Xin overheard.

431
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,760
If Du Lei is really involved,

432
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,440
what are you going to do?

433
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,770
Deal with it in a professional way.

434
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,560
You thought Shen Xin overheard

435
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,280
that Huanyu Group bought you off

436
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,160
to forge their financial reports,

437
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,560
so you created trouble on purpose

438
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,720
to get rid of her.

439
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,400
I don’t know what you are talking about!

440
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,130
Rules can be broken for interests.

441
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,760
It’s okay to find a shortcut.

442
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,400
Is that what you taught me that

443
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,400
one should always fight for his own interests?

444
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Mr. Du!

445
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,140
Aren’t you afraid I’d report you to the CSRC?

446
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,920
Sometimes, a small sacrifice is worth it

447
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,200
for the long-term benefit.

448
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,930
Not everybody would

449
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,920
protect themselves by sacrificing others.

450
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,850
At least it wouldn’t happen
when Yuan Shuai was here!

451
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,200
Let me warn you!

452
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,600
I call the shots in MH now,

453
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,800
not Yuan Shuai!

454
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
Don’t compare him with me.

455
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,980
Even if I don’t report you,

456
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,760
you’ll sooner or later pay for what you did.

457
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,400
I hope you can confess to the headquarters

458
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
about your wrongdoings.

459
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I have my way of doing things.

460
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,180
I don’t need you to lecture me.

461
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
Besides,

462
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,370
you and Yuan Shuai are also
having a difficult time, aren’t you?

463
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,760
You are the one

464
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
who disclosed the recommendation letter?

465
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,020
[Recommendation Letter]

466
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,560
Mr. Du, what do you want me for?

467
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,200
When did you become

468
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
this kind of person?

469
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,440
When?

470
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,880
I have never changed.

471
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,840
Let me tell you,

472
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,680
I approached you

473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,410
because I wanted to use you!

474
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,700
I lied to you about Wan Shan’s matter.

475
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,960
I also set a trap to get rid of Shen Xin.

476
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,000
I was even involved in your father’s accident!

477
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,320
I have also used you.

478
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,280
But the only thing that has changed is

479
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,480
that I’ve cared about you more and more!

480
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Did you know that?

481
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,280
But in the end…

482
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
In the end, I found

483
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
that I actually meant

484
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,400
so little to you.

485
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,080
So, I…

486
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,640
So you want to destroy me!

487
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,720
Right?

488
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,400
Jiang Jun,

489
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
why don’t you just understand?

490
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,920
I just don’t want you to leave me.

491
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,010
Do you know that?

492
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,400
Do you remember
when you first celebrated my birthday for me?

493
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,370
It was the first time I’ve found

494
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,800
that a birthday celebration was a happy thing.

495
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,320
You are the one who gave me hope to start over.

496
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
I’ve loved you

497
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,800
for three years.

498
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,890
I’ve been waiting for you and protecting you.

499
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,880
I just hoped that one day

500
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,960
you could turn around and take a look at me,

501
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,480
even just one glance!

502
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,880
Do you think it’s fair to me?

503
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,200
For the past three years,

504
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,560
I only saw you as my teacher,

505
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:30,960
friend,

506
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,600
and supervisor.

507
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,040
I’ve never had any other thought about you.

508
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,040
Our feelings to each other

509
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,680
were never the same.

510
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,640
How could I make it fair to you?

511
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,760
Du Lei,

512
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,560
I hope you can stop

513
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,880
wasting your energy on me.

514
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,200
Either good or bad,

515
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,680
please just stop.

516
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,400
This is the fairest answer

517
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
I can give you.

518
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,320
Sorry.

519
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,620
It’s been three years.

520
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,040
A “sorry” is all I’ve got from you,

521
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:17,800
right?

522
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,760
Just leave.

523
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,060
You can investigate me

524
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,600
or report me.

525
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,080
Whatever.

526
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,380
Mr. Du, my teacher.

527
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,680
This is the last time I call you like this.

528
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,900
I think there’s no need

529
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,580
for us to see each other again.

530
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Leave!

531
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Jiang Jun,

532
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,440
due to your excellent performance,

533
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,560
you have become a full member of us

534
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,880
ahead of time.

535
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,440
Ms. Qiao asked me to sort these files out

536
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,360
by tomorrow.

537
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,400
Jiang Jun.

538
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,840
Let me do some for you.

539
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
You helped me

540
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,080
on the day of interview.

541
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,680
I owe you one. But after this,

542
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,160
we are even.

543
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,940
The valuation report is done.

544
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,440
Really? Already?

545
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,960
You are both novices at this.

546
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I knew you’d have a hard time to do it.

547
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,160
Thank you very much.

548
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,040
It’s such a miracle

549
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,640
that I can get this task done.

550
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,600
Hello?

551
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
You called me here

552
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,680
to show off your victory

553
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,480
or to insult me?

554
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,000
Victory is the result of a real competition.

555
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,320
You slipped yourself.

556
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
Why would I be happy about that?

557
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,450
Without your reminder,

558
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,920
Jiang Jun wouldn’t have thought
about investigating me.

559
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,160
Wrong is wrong.

560
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,610
It doesn’t matter who found it out.

561
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,720
You still think it’s okay to constantly

562
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,000
break the rules?

563
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,040
This world is never perfect.

564
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,560
A rational desire

565
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,040
may get more benefits in return.

566
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
Because of me,

567
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,920
hundreds and thousands of shareholders
and employees are benefited

568
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,320
or about to be benefited.

569
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,240
You think which one of us

570
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,480
is the bad person in their eyes?

571
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,960
You? Or me?

572
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,240
Never mind.

573
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,000
I’m not here to discuss the value ranking between

574
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,720
desires and rules.

575
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,720
I just want you to know

576
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,680
that Jiang Jun is soft-hearted.

577
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,560
Even though she called you out,

578
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,640
she wouldn’t go report you.

579
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,820
on the other hand, I am different.

580
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,200
I don’t have any patience

581
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,160
for wrongdoings.

582
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,640
So,

583
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,440
I hope you can stop

584
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
all your illegal operations

585
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,400
and leave MH right away.

586
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,040
Otherwise,

587
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,320
I will hunt you down,

588
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,200
till you lose everything.

589
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,120
That’s it?

590
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,320
You are pitying me?

591
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,800
Why would I pity you?

592
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,320
For one, MH

593
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000
means a great deal to me.

594
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
I don’t want the company’s

595
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
reputation to suffer because of you.

596
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,000
and secondly,

597
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,360
you helped me

598
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,240
and Jiang Jun.

599
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,160
I owe you one.

600
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,800
So,

601
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,320
as long as you stop right away,

602
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,640
I’ll pretend nothing

603
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,200
has happened.

604
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Then I think I should thank you, huh?

605
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,360
You are welcome.

606
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,780
[West World]

607
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,420
Xiaochuan?

608
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
Xiaochuan?

609
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,080
Sorry.

610
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,400
The subscriber you dialed
is temporarily unavailable.

611
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,760
Please redial later.

612
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,560
Sorry. The subscriber…

613
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,880
He forgot just as I thought.

614
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,120
Xu Li,

615
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,210
what are you expecting anyway?

616
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:08,140
[West World]

617
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,960
♫ I love you. It’s true ♫

618
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,320
♫ I can’t stop thinking of you ♫

619
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,520

00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,320
♫ Baby, I love you. It’s true ♫

Li.

627
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,880
Happy first anniversary.

628
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Do you still

629
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,040
want to celebrate it with me?

630
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,040
I thought

631
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,480
you forgot.

632
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,320
Li.

633
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,480
I want to sincerely

634
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,880
apologize to you.

635
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,440
For all this time,

636
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,800
I’ve been

637
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,080
selfishly taking the care and love

638
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,120
you gave me.

639
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,960
You know that I’m not good

640
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,770
at expressing my feelings.

641
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
If that bothers you,

642
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,400
I will change for you.

643
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,160
And

644
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,000
about that 72-hour theory,

645
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,800
actually I want to tell you

646
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,400
that in love,

647
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,220
I think what really matters is

648
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,440
when all the passion’s gone,

649
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,120
we are still willing

650
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,920
to spend the rest of our lives together.

651
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,840
I’m not

652
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,160
a humorous person,

653
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,000
but I can play the guitar,

654
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,290
and I can be your drinking partner.

655
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,360
Li,

656
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,520
I want

657
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,560
to be with you forever.

658
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,120
That’s the most sincere promise I can give you.

659
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,080
Will you accept it?

660
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,980
[West World]

661
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,780
You don’t have to do anything.

662
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,480
I only want you to love me.

663
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,320
By the way,

664
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,240
when…

665
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,360
When did you learn how to play the guitar?

666
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,680
That’s easy.

667
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
There are only six strings.

668
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,840
Did you learn it for me?

669
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,280
I was worried that my wife
would be stolen away by another guy.

670
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,640
I just don’t understand

671
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,840
what's so glamorous about playing the guitar.

672
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,200
Of course, it is!

673
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,120
When the spotlight

674
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,880
shined on you just now,

675
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,800
it literally lit up my heart.

676
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,960
I’m afraid our “72 hours”

677
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,800
will start over now.

678
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,640
Did you

679
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,320
prepare a gift for me?

680
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,400
I did.

681
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,880
And I just gave it to you.

682
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,960
What?

683
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,160
That’s it?

684
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
My kiss

685
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,920
is a valuable gift, okay?

686
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,930
Not everybody gets to enjoy it.

687
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,800
Since it’s valuable,

688
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,600
I think I need to enjoy it more.

689
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,360
What’s wrong?

690
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,970
Are you okay?

691
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,200
What is it?

692
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,280
I’m fine.

693
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,280
Just feel a little sick.

694
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,600
Could it be…

695
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,200
Are you…

696
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
Hello, Ms. Jiang.

697
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
About the recommendation letter,

698
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,160
the Compliance Department

699
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,800
has asked for all your work files
for investigation.

700
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,730
You need to get ready for a hearing.

701
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,640
Okay.

702
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,380
I will give the company my full cooperation.

703
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,200
Hold on!

704
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,280
I have a question.

705
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,680
Due to my personal reasons,

706
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
I submitted an application for resignation.

707
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,040
Is it following the procedures now?

708
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,480
We haven’t seen

709
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,820
your application yet.

710
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,080
You haven’t?

711
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,720
No.

712
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,180
Maybe I remembered wrong.

713
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,200
Okay.

714
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,200
Alright.

715
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,040
Bye.

716
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,600
Bye.

717
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,610
How is it going with you?

718
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,280
What do you think?

719
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:40,000
No salaries for the second half of this year
and no year-end bonus.

720
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,280
I’ll need you to support me now.

721
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,120
Poor baby.

722
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,080
Don’t worry.

723
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,640
I promise that you will be well-fed.

724
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,480
One more thing.

725
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,280
I met Du Lei today.

726
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,850
He’s decided to resign.

727
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,840
And he won’t

728
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,840
step into the investment banking industry again.

729
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,640
Really?

730
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,160
It’s good.

731
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,920
For him, and for the company.

732
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,880
Jiang Jun.

733
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,240
Actually,

734
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
if there’s something you like to do,

735
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,000
or something you are

736
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,440
reluctant to change,

737
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,660
then you should follow your heart

738
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,960
and continue to do it.

739
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,520
Why do you say that?

740
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,450
Although it’s your idea to resign,

741
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,200
I pressured you

742
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,840
more or less,

743
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,240
making you come up with that idea.

744
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,440
No matter how much we love each other,

745
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,360
we don’t have

746
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
to change who we are.

747
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,120
So,

748
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,760
whether

749
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,400
you want to resign

750
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,900
or continue to work in this industry,

751
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,320
no matter you want to stay in MH or come to GE

752
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,920
I will always respect your decision.

753
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,880
You are so nice.

754
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,900
So, are you still going to resign?

755
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,140
I thought I’ve thought it good

756
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,000
but I guess

757
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,260
I’d rather keep fighting.

758
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,600
I just knew it.

759
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,360
Wealth, daddy is so nice.

760
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,640
Right?

761
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,280
Do you remember

762
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,080
how big she was

763
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,700
when we first adopted her?

764
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,600
Of course, I do.

765
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,880
She was only this big.

766
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,320
No more than two months old.

767
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,160
Yep.

768
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:49,920
And now she’s already 13 years old.

769
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,200
Wealth.

770
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
Thank you for being daddy’s company

771
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,720
when mommy was not around.

772
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,640
We will take good care of you in the future.

773
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,720
No worry.

774
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,000
The three of us have never
taken a picture together.

775
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,040
Let’s take one.

776
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,040
Let’s take a picture.

777
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,470
Now.

778
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,880
One, two, three!

779
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
One more.

780
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,120
Three, two, one!

781
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,820
Love Is Sweet
