00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,539
Love Is Sweet

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,979
Love Is Sweet

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,979
Episode 22

5
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,220
Have you heard that

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,759
Ms. Qiao is in big trouble this time?

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,060
What's the matter?

8
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,720
A few days ago, she somehow

9
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,520
filled in the wrong data

10
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,120
in the financing plan of Yuanyang Group,

11
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
and directly sent it to the client.

12
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,039
As a result, it caused losses to the client.

13
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,970
Now she's being held accountable.

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,720
I’m telling you that

15
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
Yuanyang is a big client

16
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,800
that our company has always valued.

17
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,200
With such a serious mistake,

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,060
can she still stay in the company?

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,120
I'm afraid she'll have a hard time
in the investment bank.

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,920
That's right.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,750
The senior leaders have given the order.

22
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,840
Her dismissal

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,760
was a done deal.

24
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,880
But,

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,079
Mr. Yuan stepped forward and saved her,

26
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,120
and promised Yuanyang Group a new financing plan

27
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,000
within 24 hours.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,240
Did I hear you correctly?

29
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,280
24 hours?

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:23,840
That's right.

31
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,560
New plan?

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,200
Yes.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,880
Then Mr. Yuan has to work day and night again.

34
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,040
And if it doesn't work out this time,

35
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,920
our Mr. Yuan

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,600
will be sacked along with Ms. Qiao.

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,000
Sir Edward Coke once said

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,040
it was better to be careful beforehand
than to make up for it.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,600
They made the mistake

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,720
and now they should take the responsibilities.

41
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,920
Edward also said that Mr. Yuan had come.

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,640
Edward…

43
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,320
How are you?

44
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,980
Xiaochuan, good morning.

45
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:38,880
Good morning.

46
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,460
Xiaochuan,

47
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,200
is this for me?

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,280
I happened to pass by a cake shop
in the morning.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,140
I got it for you.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,060
Thank you, Xiaochuan.

51
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
This cake looks delicious.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,600
It’s a nice shop. Buy one and get one for free.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,760
It’s a bargain.

54
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
No wonder I don't think

55
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,650
this cake tastes that good.

56
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,019
Xiaochuan.

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,800
Mr. Du.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,880
Mr. Du, hello.

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
What did you say

60
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,100
about the fund?

61
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,840
Mr. Du, this way, please.

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,200
Ok.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,240
Mr. Du,

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
we have a small problem
about the fund right now.

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,530
What should I do?

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,770
We have a problem with the fund?

67
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,760
Mr. Du, have some water.

68
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,159
-Xiaochuan.
-Thank you.

69
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,280
Now you understand

70
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,080
why there are

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,740
two fund expenditure ratios?

72
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
Pretty much.

73
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,400
So, is there a problem with the fund?

74
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,120
No.

75
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,560
The fund expenditure ratio

76
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,680
is the percentage of a startup's fund

77
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,560
that is consumed before it becomes profitable.

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,880
Every startup has that indicator.

79
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,600
Xiaochuan has simply

80
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,440
misclassified the figures.

81
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,700
I’ll explain it to him.

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,440
I’m glad there’s no problem.

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,040
I’m glad there’s no problem.

84
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,080
By the way, Mr. Du,

85
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,280
are you free tonight?

86
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,120
How about having dinner together?

87
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,560
Ok.

88
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,920
Wealth.

89
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,620
Are you waiting for me?

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,920
How can you be so cute?

91
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,200
Wealth.

92
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Wealth,

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
your dad has a busy day.

94
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,200
So let's be considerate of him

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,260
and not bother him.

96
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Stay here and wait for him,

97
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:56,720
ok?

98
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,480
Maybe he'll come back
after we finish the cleaning.

99
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,960
Right?

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,120
Sit tight!

101
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,320
Wealth,

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,360
your dad is so great.

103
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,610
We should not hold him back, should we?

104
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,560
I must find

105
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,340
the most worthy client today.

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,210
Give me Five!

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,000
Give me Five.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,560
Five.

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,720
Five.

110
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
Five. Five. Five.

111
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:57,600
Five.

112
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,560
Kiss.

113
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,080
I see. I see.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
Don't wait for me.

115
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,800
Beauty sleep matters.

116
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,330
Love you.

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,180
Good night.

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:16,800
Wealth,

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,360
your dad doesn't come home at night,

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,320
and he's with a beautiful girl.

121
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,900
But I'm not jealous at all.

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,960
I’m such a tolerant girlfriend,

123
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,240
right?

124
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,320
Am I great?

125
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Yes.

126
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,210
Here you are.

127
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,440
Thanks.

128
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,420
Whether it works or not this time,

129
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
I'd like to thank you for helping me.

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
After all, it makes sense

131
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,480
if you don't help me.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,960
Actually, the reason I'm helping you
is very simple.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,560
Firstly,

134
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,360
when one of my subordinates made a mistake,

135
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,090
it was because of my oversight.

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,200
From the perspective of business,
I can't get away with it.

137
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,840
Secondly,

138
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,040
I am well aware of your abilities.

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,080
A mistake was made this time.

140
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,060
There must be some reason.

141
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
From the personal perspective…

142
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,320
From the personal perspective,

143
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,250
we have worked together for so long

144
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,640
that we have developed the tacit understanding
we should have.

145
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,320
I have always regarded you

146
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
as my comrade-in-arms.

147
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,280
Like Su Chang,

148
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
you are very helpful

149
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,000
for me at work.

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,130
Thank you, Mr. Yuan,

151
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,720
for being so candid.

152
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,020
Take a look at these pictures.

153
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,650
Mr. Yuan, don't be nervous.

154
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,810
I'm just trying to remind you,
as a comrade-in-arms,

155
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,280
to be careful about the consequences
of your relationship.

156
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,720
After all, if these pictures

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,160
were taken by someone with an ulterior motive,

158
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,600
it wouldn't just

159
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,160
affect the two of you at work.

160
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,080
Of course I'll delete all of them.

161
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,520
Then,

162
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,920
we are even.

163
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,410
If anything happens in the future,

164
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,170
it has nothing to do with me.

165
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,740
[To: MH Admin Dept.
MH HR Dept.]

166
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,500
[This email has no subject.
Do you still want to send it?]

167

[Cancel]

168
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,850
Thank you for reminding me.

169
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,080
But as I said,

170
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,480
since it was my choice,

171
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,560
I will see it through.

172
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,290
You’re welcome,

173
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,900
comrade-in-arms.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
Jiang Jun, good morning.

175
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Good morning.

176
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,180
Xiang Ding,

177
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,920
have you had breakfast yet?

178
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,960
No. What’s wrong?

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,540
I happened to have an extra breakfast. Here.

180
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,320
Thank you.

181
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,680
Hello.

182
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,840
Hello.

183
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,200
Is it Jiang Jun from MH?

184
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,800
I am the secretary to the director
of Xinshuo Technology. I’m surnamed Xia.

185
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Our company

186
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,160
is now thinking about an IPO.

187
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,680
I’m wondering if I can

188
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,280
make an initial contact with you.

189
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,940
No problem.

190
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,680
Is today a good time for you?

191
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,840
Can we meet for a chat first?

192
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
It should be ok.

193
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,720
Then send me the address.

194
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,840
Ok.

195
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,720
Ok.

196
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,020
Xiang Ding,

197
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,680
a client asked me out.

198
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,840
I saw that Mr. Yuan was busy,

199
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,760
so I didn't go in to report.

200
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,680
If he asks for me,

201
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,920
please help me explain.

202
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,520
Thank you.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,730
Then I'll go.

204
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,440
Bye.

205
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,940
Miss Jiang,

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:24,680
nice to meet you.

207
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

208
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
It's okay. I just sat down.

209
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
This way, please.

210
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,240
Here is my business card.

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,040
Thank you.

212
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,720
I've already ordered your coffee.

213
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,780
Let's talk over it.

214
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,400
Thank you.

215
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,530
You’re welcome.

216
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,480
This is our new proposal.

217
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,160
Thank you.

218
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:13,720
Mr. Fan,

219
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,560
MH is really professional.

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,920
They came up with a new financing plan

221
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,400
within one day,

222
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,400
and it’s improved a lot.

223
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,760
I even wonder

224
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,800
if the previous plan

225
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
was deliberately put out

226
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,200
to scare us into a cold sweat.

227
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
Anyway, in this case,

228
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,400
we know what to tell the Board.

229
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
This time, however,

230
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,320
it was our carelessness

231
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,840
that caused the problem.

232
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,240
So it's our job

233
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,000
to solve the problem.

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,840
We would like to thank
Yuanyang Group in particular

235
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,200
for trusting us again.

236
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,160
At the same time,

237
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,440
Mr. Yuan

238
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,960
is willing to be a technical consultant
for Yuanyang Group

239
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,440
for one year, for free.

240
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,800
Mr. Yuan, one year.

241
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Ok, Mr. Liu.

242
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,960
Go to my office and have a cup of tea.

243
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,560
Good idea.

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,720
Everyone, please.

245
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,560
Ok.

246
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,160
Thank you.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,400
You're being too polite.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,880
Do you have time

249
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:22,840
to talk?

250
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,240
Ok.

251
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,250
Let’s go.

252
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,040
Hello. Who is it?

253
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,640
What do you mean?

254
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,800
No need to be nervous.

255
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm just doing a test for someone.

256
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,330
She is very safe.

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,780
She is only sleeping quietly now.

258
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,250
Where is she?

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,650
I'll send you the location.

260
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,540
Sir, hello!

261
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,730
You can't park here!

262
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:38,720
Sir!

263
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,560
Sir!

264
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,680
Sir!

265
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:53,640
Sir!

266
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,680
Jiang Jun!

267
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,480
Jiang Jun!

268
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,600
Sir.

269
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:57,800
Sir.

270
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,800
Hello, please open the door for me.

271
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
I'm sorry. Please show me your ID card.

272
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,220
We need to check the information.

273
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,080
How about this?

274
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,200
Call Mr. Luo

275
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,080
and tell him this is Du Lei.

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,740
I'll make amends to him later.

277
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,280
Jiang Jun!

278
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Jiang Jun!

279
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,340
Xiang Ding.

280
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,130
Mr. Yuan.

281
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,260
Where is Jiang Jun?

282
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
It was not long before Jiang Jun left.

283
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,240
She said she was out to see a client.

284
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,040
A client?

285
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,240
Sorry.

286
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,840
The subscriber you dialed is not being answered for the moment.

287
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,280
Please redial later.

288
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,920
She must have taken some sleeping pills.

289
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,450
And she has low blood sugar.

290
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,280
But so far she's fine.

291
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,380
I think she'll wake up in a minute.

292
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:01,960
Ok.

293
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,140
Thank you, Doctor.

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Is Jiang Jun in this ward?

295
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:22,920
Mr. Du,

296
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,560
I…

297
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,760
What happened

298
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,120
to our Jun?

299
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,400
She might have low blood sugar, and suddenly fainted.

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,480
I was just in the neighborhood

301
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
so I sent her here.

302
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,770
What does the doctor say about her now?

303
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,170
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

304
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,140
She should wake up in a minute.

305
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,060
I'm relieved you're here.

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,240
Then I'll leave her to you.

307
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,320
I have to go.

308
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,240
Ok.

309
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,760
Now that you have something to do, go ahead.

310
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,420
The two of us should be enough.

311
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,000
Remember to ask her to drink more water
after she wakes up.

312
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
What’s going on?

313
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,220
[Li Xiaochuan]

314
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,370
Jiang Jun had an accident. Come to the hospital quickly.

315
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,400
Hello. Is it a good time

316
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
to meet and talk?

317
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,920
I'm so happy for Jun.

318
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,000
She's so charming.

319
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
There are two men around

320
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
ready to protect her.

321
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If only

322
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,320
I could meet someone

323
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040
so spoony.

324
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,680
I agree.

325
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,320
Although Mr. Du is really nice,

326
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,850
I am still on my brother’s side.

327
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,800
After all, they're the only perfect match

328
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,400
in West World.

329
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Then let me ask you

330
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,680
where

331
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,960
the perfect match is.

332
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,720
Let me make a bold prediction.

333
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,320
I'm going to count down from five,

334
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,040
and the perfect match

335
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,080
will be here.

336
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,370
Do you believe that?

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,120
I don't believe it.

338
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,280
Let's have a try.

339
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,840
Five.

340
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,720
Four.

341
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,040
Three.

342
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Two.

343
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,840
One.

344
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,440
Jiang Jun.

345
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,000
Jiang Jun.

346
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,360
How is she?

347
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,620
She is ok, Brother.

348
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,120
The doctor said she had low blood sugar.

349
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,760
Mr. Du was just around the corner

350
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,880
and sent her over.

351
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,360
Du Lei?

352
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,040
Jun,

353
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,360
you are awake.

354
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,080
Jiang Jun.

355
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,740
How are you?

356
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,560
Do you feel all right?

357
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,960
Why am I here?

358
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,920
The doctor said you were hypoglycemia
so you fainted.

359
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,440
She was fine.

360
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,220
How come she's hypoglycemic?

361
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,160
Who did you meet this afternoon?

362
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,360
You are asking her!

363
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,810
I haven’t asked you yet!

364
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,560
I entrust her to you.

365
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,360
But

366
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
two days later, she is hospitalized.

367
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,560
Did you do your job?

368
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,000
Ok. Ok.

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,600
I'm not done yet.

370
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,010
How can you be such a boyfriend?

371
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,360
Li, I'm fine, really.

372
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,410
Don't blame him.

373
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm sorry.

374
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,380
I didn't take good care of you.

375
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm really fine.

376
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,800
You don't have to blame yourself.

377
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Isn't this all right with me?

378
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,960
Let’s go.

379
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
And she is on his side!

380
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,740
It’s… It’s unbelievable!

381
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,440
Sorry.

382
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,400

I recently got a dog named Wealth Yuan.

571
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,880
It just barked.

572
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Why can a dog talk like a man?

573
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,560
No.

574
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,800
Mom, you heard it wrong.

575
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,840
Mom, what do you want with me?

576
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,080
I just want to ask whether you have bought the ticket
for New Year's Day.

577
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,520
Well…

578
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,400
I… I'll buy the ticket

579
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,440
as soon as the company announces the holiday.

580
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,280
Hurry up.

581
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,640
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be able to get a ticket.

582
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,120
Jun,

583
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,200
I’m telling you.

584
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,640
I have prepared a lot of delicious food for you,

585
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,840
including your favorite rice noodles.

586
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,400
Ok.

587
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,880
Mom, you…

588
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,800
Where are you, Jun?

589
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,930
My dog has diarrhea.

590
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,360
Don't keep a dog if you live alone,

591
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
Jun.

592
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:34,600
Ok, mom.

593
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,080
I think you're sleepy. You should go to bed.

594
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,360
I'll call you next time. See you on New Year's Day.

595
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,490
Bye. I love you, mom.

596
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,360
Is it fun?

597
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,040
Is it fun?

598
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:46,960
You…

599
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,280
I was wrong! My apologies!

600
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,960
I was wrong! My apologies!

601
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,760
-Were you wrong?
-I…

602
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,440
Were you wrong?

603
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,770
I was wrong. I was wrong.

604
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,180
Why didn't you let me talk to your mom?

605
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,120
We haven't been together very long.

606
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,520
I haven't told my mom yet.

607
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,240
It's not like you don't know my mom.

608
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,440
If she sees me

609
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,960
with a man at night,

610
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,440
she'll be scared into tears.

611
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:07,960
Yes.

612
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,080
She is like you.

613
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,920
It’s like there’s a faucet on your face.

614
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,320
Your tears come so quickly.

615
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,720
There’s a faucet on your face!

616
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,240
Wealth,

617
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,080
bite him.

618
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,400
So,

619
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,540
you're going home for New Year's Day?

620
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,500
Isn't that normal?

621
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,600
You know my parents are both abroad.

622
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,280
I know that.

623
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,770
Then if you go home for the New Year,

624
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,400
I'll be the only one in Shanghai.

625
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,200
What?

626
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,360
You want to go home with me
to meet your mother-in-law?

627
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,320
Why not?

628
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
You are dreaming!

629
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,980
I haven't seen her for a long time.

630
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,880
I haven't seen your parents

631
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,800
since I went abroad.

632
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,930
I really miss your dad's rice noodles.

633
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,739
It's a taste I can't stop thinking about now.

634
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,699
What happened?

635
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,949
You might never see my dad again.

636
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:23,530
My dad passed away five years ago.

637
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,659
What happened?

638
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,060
A sudden heart attack.

639
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,920
After you moved abroad,

640
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,400
he and his friends

641
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,960
created a brand of rice noodles in partnership.

642
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,420
It was called Yixianqian.

643
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,320
Yixianqian?

644
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,360
I remember that Yixianqian

645
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,280
is the flagship product of C Group.

646
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,760
So this rice noodle brand was made by your dad?

647
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,230
Yes.

648
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,840
He built it step by step.

649
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,920
From offline to online,

650
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,440
it gradually grew stronger.

651
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,500
Its production was also increasing.

652
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,090
But my dad was not good at business,

653
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
so he turned to MH for financing.

654
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,600
My mom said

655
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,000
it was MH

656
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,490
that made Yixianqian be bought by C Group.

657
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,720
But then,

658
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,720
they wanted to turn my dad's work

659
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,450
into cheap homemade rice noodles.

660
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,960
Both taste and ingredients

661
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,650
were greatly compromised.

662
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,090
My dad got so mad that he got sick

663
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,090
and passed away.

664
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,600
So you wanted to join MH

665
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,280
because of your dad?

666
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,600
Right.

667
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,760
My professor told me

668
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,640
that the law of jungle

669
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,360
is the real world of capital.

670
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,560
So I was determined to join MH and see,

671
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,560
in the financing circle,

672
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,040
whether there is only cruel competition

673
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,220
and in front of interests,

674
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,600
kindness and conscience

675
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,700
are only at the bottom of the list.

676
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,720
You’ve been here for half a year.

677
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,980
What do you think of it?

678
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,400
I don't judge others.

679
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,040
But at least in you,

680
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,440
I see hope.

681
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,720
Whether it is Deng Ke or Wan Shan

682
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,840
or Zhu Youyi,

683
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,060
you didn’t put your interests first.

684
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,600
You are wrong.

685
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,940
I am also a person who deals with capital.

686
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,160
But,

687
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,570
some people are shortsighted.

688
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,560
They only see the immediate interests,

689
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
so they earn fast and die fast, too.

690
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
I'm not like them.

691
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,570
I take the long view.

692
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,060
I'm more interested in long-term benefits.

693
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,330
Only by respecting capital

694
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,760
and treating capital well

695
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,420
can you benefit from capital.

696
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,170
Little girl,

697
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,160
you still have a lot to learn.

698
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,680
Master Yuan, I’m enlightened.

699
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,640
So,

700
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,280
can I go home with you
to celebrate the New Year?

701
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
Yes.

702
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,320
But you have to stand my mom's test

703
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,560
before you can tell her our relationship.

704
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,520
No problem!

705
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,040
She liked me when I was a kid.

706
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:01,960
Now,

707
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,290
she’ll like me, too.

708
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,960
Not necessarily.

709
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,200
There's something I didn't tell you.

710
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,240
The man who stole my notes

711
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,840
was always my mom's number one enemy.

712
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm still hiding it for you.

713
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,000
If my mom finds out that, you're doomed.

714
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,080
Why can't we get through this?

715
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,560
The speech thing…

716
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,260
You deserve it.

717
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,690
Who asked you to do that?

718
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,400
-Still talking about it?
-What are you doing?

719
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,440
What are you doing?

720
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,480
-Still talking about it?
-What are you doing?

721
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,000
Itchy!

722
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,320
Crayfish?

723
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:38,960
Ok.

724
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Peanuts and edamame?

725
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:41,800
Ok.

726
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:42,960
Escargot?

727
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
I'll eat whatever you order.

728
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,160
Ok, boss.

729
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,720
Then it’s up to me.

730
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:48,920
Sir,

731
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,280
I want each of the things I just said.

732
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,840
And then I’ll have this and this,

733
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,480
and this.

734
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:52,800
Ok.

735
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,420
Thanks.

736
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:57,880
Xu Li.

737
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,330
I was thinking of

738
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,960
doing a program for West World

739
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,800
to increase the matching value.

740
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,920
What program?

741
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,200
You raise a plant

742
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,040
with the one you love.

743
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,680
When you find that

744
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,600
you like him a little bit more,

745
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
you can help him to water.

746
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,800
If the two people water the plant
more than ten times,

747
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,320
the plant will grow,

748
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,880
and their match value will increase.

749
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,840
What do you think?

750
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,170
People can actually increase
the degree of match like this.

751
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,740
What about me? Can I use it?

752
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,360
Yes.

753
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,680
It's just that I haven't decided

754
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,400
whether to use pine or banyan for this plant.

755
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,680
Pine?

756
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,080
Do you want to wish your users a long life?

757
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,480
I think since it’s an app

758
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,640
about love,

759
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,490
why not use forget-me-not?

760
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,280
Its meaning is the eternal love.

761
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,680
It also sounds great. What do you think?

762
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,880
Ok.

763
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,120
Just forget-me-not.

764
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,920
-Here is your food.
-Thanks.

765
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,520
Thanks.

766
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,450
You are welcome.

767
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,340
Thanks.

768
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,260
Xiaochuan.

769
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,520
Are you going home for New Year's Day this year?

770
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,960
Isn't it just a festival?

771
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,440
It is just a way

772
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,000
created by people to maintain

773
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,320
the so-called friendship and love.

774
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,160
It’s nothing to me.

775
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,400
Why?

776
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,560
You will be very happy on New Year's Day.

777
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,240
You think about it.

778
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,520
Life is already so boring.

779
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,000
We're all looking forward to it,

780
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,360
hoping we can take a vacation.

781
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,240
That way,

782
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,530
you can go home and be with your family.

783
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,520
If you can spend time with someone you like,

784
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,400
it’s so much better.

785
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,960
Even if you are going to spend it alone,

786
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,320
you can use it as a pretext

787
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,880
to take a holiday

788
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,080
and reward yourself.

789
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,640
Life needs to be a little ritual.

790
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,080
But I really don't want to get together

791
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,520
with my seven sisters-in-law and three uncles.

792
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,720
It's the seven aunts.

793
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,400
Don't change the idiom.

794
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,800
I do have seven sisters-in-law and three uncles.

795
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,120
And my three uncles

796
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,240
particularly want to introduce
their friend's granddaughter to me.

797
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Introduce granddaughter to you?

798
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,170
Then you'd better not go back home!

799
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,280
Weren’t you talking about

800
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
how great it was for family reunion?

801
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,280
I just think

802
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,160
that

803
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,280
your home is abroad.

804
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,080
You'll have to fly back. It’s far away.

805
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:24,960
The air tickets are so expensive.

806
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,690
And you're working on this app.

807
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,120
You’d better focus on your career.

808
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,880
Am I right?

809
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,680
Ok.

810
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,980
What about you?

811
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,080
What are you doing during the New Year?

812
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,480
I'll just go home.

813
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,970
My mom misses me so much.

814
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,220
Eat something.

815
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,420
Thanks.

816
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,760
Brother Bao, you are in luck.

817
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,520
It’s not that I’m in luck.

818
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,120
It’s that you are out of luck.

819
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,180
[Unknown Caller]

820
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,620
Hand out the cards!

821
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,660
[Unknown Caller]

822
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,200
Hello?

823
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,640
Mr. Cao.

824
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,640
This is Du Lei. Remember me?

825
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,440
Why?

826
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,820
Why did you contact me?

827
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,720
Did Linda tell you to call me?

828
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,320
Sort of.

829
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,320
Cao Heng,

830
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,960
you want to escape again?

831
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,000
How much do you owe me?

832
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,080
Brother Bao,

833
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,200
how dare I run?

834
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I’m answering a phone call.

835
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:35,920
I’ll be back in a minute.

836
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,560
In a minute. In a minute.

837
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,420
You play first.

838
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,810
Let me tell you this.

839
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,480
What happened before has nothing to do with me!

840
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,880
Don't bother me anymore!

841
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,650
Don't get so irritated.

842
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,160
Of course I know you had nothing to do

843
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,290
with what happened.

844
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,640
It's just that

845
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
you've been on Linda's mind lately.

846
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
She is wondering if there is anything

847
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
we can do for you.

848
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,290
Why don't we meet first?

849
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,680
It's not convenient for me right now.

850
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,410
I am far away.

851
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,640
I'll contact you when I get back.

852
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,460
Love Is Sweet
