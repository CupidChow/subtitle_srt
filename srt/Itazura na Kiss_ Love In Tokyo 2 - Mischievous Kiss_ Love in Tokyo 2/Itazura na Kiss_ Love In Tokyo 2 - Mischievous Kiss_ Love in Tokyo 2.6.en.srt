1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,660
Kotoko!

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,730
-Hey!
-Kotoko?

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,940
Kotoko!

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,210
Hey! Are you okay?

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,860
Move aside!

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,600
What are you gonna do after that?

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,130
You know it, don't you?

8
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,490
She's married to me.

9
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,970
Don't you dare to lay your hands on Kotoko.

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,850
I think about Kotoko more than you do!

11
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,930
I can take care of her much better than you can.

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,120
Bring it on!

13
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,340
You know, when I woke up,

14
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,200
there was a worried-faced Irie-kun looking at me.

15
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,260
He always keeps his cool, but

16
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,060
he looked sooooo sweet.

17
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,780
It wouldn't hurt to faint every once in a while.

18
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,120
By the way, who was that good-looking guy?

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,990
Good-looking guy?

20
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,830
You know, the guy who was running while holding you, that guy.

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,550
Oh, Keita?

22
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,770
He's in the same nursing department, Kamogari Keita.

23
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,540
Is he a good-looking guy?

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:14,640
I know you think of Irie Naoki as your number one, but...

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,570
But, well...

26
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,020
Ka-ka-ka- something, you know, that Keita guy,

27
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,930
after seeing him panicking,

28
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,880
I thought he might like you.

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,320
You are having an affair!

30
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,280
Keita, no-no-no way.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,360
No fun! It'd be fascinating to see them fight over you.

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
Kotoko isn't that popular, you know?

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,580
Isn't she?

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,080
Hey!!

35
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,280
And then, one month later...

36
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,860
the first summer of nursing school began.

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,530
Hey!

38
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,800
You're finally awake.

39
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,420
Let's do it.

40
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,870
Keita was trying to wake you up so many times.

41
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,300
Sorry, I fell asleep?

42
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,500
"Irie-kun," was what you said.

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,020
You even dream about Irie-kun, right?

44
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,170
It was a dream!

45
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,930
Sorry, sorry!

46
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,410
Sadly, we have to write the report

47
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,940
during the summer break.

48
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,510
Tonan University Library

49
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,260
I'm tired.

50
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,260
We worked so hard today, too, didn't we?

51
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,820
"Someone" fell asleep in this situation.

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,090
Okay, all we have left is the individual assignments
we were assigned earlier.

53
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,890
Let's finish them up individually.

54
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:58,860
So today is the last time we're meeting?

55
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,260
That's right.

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,220
I see.

57
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,890
Well, how about we all go out somewhere?

58
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,770
I've gotten sick of writing reports every day too.

59
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,430
Let's go have fun!

60
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,530
Sounds good! Let's go.

61
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,670
Then, it's been decided.

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,900
What about Tomoko-chan?

63
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,400
Sorry, I have to work.

64
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,510
Tomoko-chan, you had a part-time job?

65
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,790
What do you do? Flower shop?

66
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,100
- Cake shop?
- Or a waitress?

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,120
I work at a food section at a Department Store.

68
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,390
- Are you the cashier?
- No.

69
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,420
At a fish-store.

70
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,960
It fits you!

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,960
Then, I have to get going. Bye bye!

72
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,130
-Bye bye!
-See you.

73
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,020
We should get going, too.

74
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,890
We should, huh?

75
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,530
Then how about we go bowling?

76
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,790
I'll bring my ball.

77
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,880
"My ball"?

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,100
I don't have the money...

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,910
Moto-chan, wait!

80
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,260
Wait for us at the main gate.

81
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,820
Yes!

82
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,990
Then, let's go!

83
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,840
The main gate is this way.

84
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,270
-Oh, this way?
-Yeah.

85
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:30,070
Irie-san , after this, everyone is going out to eat, if you are okay with it, how about going?

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,170
Nope, I'm okay.

87
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,620
That's right!

88
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,660
Irie's got a wife waiting at home for him!

89
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,680
Enviable!!

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,220
I prefer a home-cooked meal rather than dining out.

91
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,270
I want to be married too.

92
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,480
Too bad.

93
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,080
I really wanted to discuss with you
about the molecular and cellular biology over drinks.

94
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,410
But more over that...

95
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,020
Mischievous Kiss 2: Love in Tokyo

96
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,590
You're on a roll aren't you Kotoko.

97
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,220
"Episode 6: The illness that annoys a genius"

98
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,080
I told you to leave it up to me.

99
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,930
-Here you go.
-Thanks!

100
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,280
Let's start the game after taking a short break.

101
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,180
Shall we?

102
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,470
Can you teach me how to hold the ball?

103
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,010
-Follow me!
-Yes!

104
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,150
Here you go.

105
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,540
Thanks!

106
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,270
I feel revived after shouting out loud.

107
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,670
Right?

108
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:42,280
You seem stressed out.

109
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,480
Things aren't going well with Irie lately?

110
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,190
No, that's not what I...

111
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,930
...well, it happens.

112
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,930
Irie-kun has been busy lately.

113
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,120
I barely see him at home.

114
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,400
Even when I see him,

115
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,200
maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but...

116
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,830
he's somehow cold.

117
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:24,000
You know, you always over exert yourself whenever
it comes to Irie.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,060
You should relax a bit.

119
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,990
Okay? Just relax.

120
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,050
Well, it can't be helped.

121
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,800
Today, I'll hang out with you til you get sick of me.

122
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,360
I don't need your sympathy.

123
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,000
I said it's fine!

124
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,340
Thank you for treating me.

125
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,430
I lost to you who got paired with Kotoko ...

126
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,840
It's absurd.

127
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,810
Then let's go to a karaoke bar.

128
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:58,660
Sounds good. Let's have a singing competition this time.

129
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,350
I won't lose to you this time.

130
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,380
Well, I'm going now.

131
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,550
Are you running away?

132
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,830
As you know, I'm a married woman.

133
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,640
You fellow won't go!!

134
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,310
We won't let you slip away.

135
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,160
Please let me go.

136
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,090
Do you have to make dinner for Irie-kun?

137
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like this! So let go of me!

138
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,120
No way, I'll let you go.
We need to have a good time.

139
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Oh, my shoulder...

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,010
You guys are from the Nursing Department.

141
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,750
Isn't that Irie-san?

142
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,580
That's true! Irie-kun!!!

143
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,100
What are you doing here?

144
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,070
I'm having dinner with my classmates.

145
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,960
I see.

146
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:54,600
Marina-san, it's our fate to meet you here.
I can never be apart from you, like a Eudiplozoon Nipponicum.

147
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,770
- Eudiplozoon Nipponicum?
- Yes, a parasite that infests on gills of gold fish.

148
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:01,350
They find their partner and stick together for the
rest of their lives.

149
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,060
Isn't it romantic?

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,870
You guys need to come get him.

151
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,750
Those two are strange! Aren't they, Irie-kun?

152
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,310
Yeah.

153
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:18,090
I went bowling with the others earlier.

154
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,940
- Bowling?
- Yeah, I'm pretty good at bowling!

155
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,210
It was my first time, but I scored many strikes while thinking of Irie-kun.

156
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,650
I wish you could've seen it, Irie-kun!

157
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,360
Irie, let's go, we're running late.

158
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,060
Well, I'm going then.

159
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,010
Hey!

160
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:01,230
Why don't you spend more time with your wife
if you have time to go partying.

161
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,350
Come on!

162
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,460
You're trying so hard to get her attention.

163
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sick of your meddling.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,140
That's mean, Irie-kun!

165
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,240
Keita said that for my sake.

166
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,870
He knew I was feeling down...

167
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:24,730
Then you can just go home with Kamogari.

168
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:30,200
Because he's so worried about you.
(said in a very formal way)

169
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,390
That's mean!! Why are you saying such things?

170
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,020
You idiot!

171
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,670
Kotoko!

172
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,800
Aren't you going to go after her?

173
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,700
If you're not going, I will!

174
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,620
Wait, Keita!

175
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,170
Kotoko! Wait!

176
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,440
Marina, hurry up!

177
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,850
Irie-kun...those mean words you said...

178
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,400
I just wanted to be with you...

179
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,500
Did you come to hate me?

180
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,870
- Hey!
- Ir... !

181
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,630
It's me, not Irie.

182
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,030
I'm sorry, Keita.

183
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,680
To make you go through such unpleasant things.

184
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,110
It's our fault, you don't even have anything to do with it.

185
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,460
Has nothing to do with me?

186
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,130
Don't say it has nothing to do with me!

187
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,330
That kind of guy...

188
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,060
Give up on him.

189
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:42,280
Sorry to make you wait!

190
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:48,500
I wanted show off my cooking skill,
so I prepared Chirashi-zushi.

191
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,600
Wow, it's my favorite dish.

192
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh, it looks delicious!

193
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,570
Madame, this is a restaurant-quality dish.

194
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:06,680
Oh no, it's embarrassing to offer my dish to a professional like you.

195
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,420
So...help yourselves!

196
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,490
Thank you.

197
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,620
Please dig in.

198
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,510
Squid too, how about some squid?
('ika' for 'squid' is a pun on 'ikaga' for 'how about')

199
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:26,880
Can you guess...

200
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,530
what it is?

201
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,080
- Salmon.
- Correct!

202
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,540
Iri-chan, this salmon roe is so good, I can't have too much of it!
('ikura' can stand for 'salmon roe' or 'how much')

203
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,970
Wow, that's a good one.

204
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,410
Thanks for the meal.

205
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,150
You're already finished, Onii-chan?

206
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,910
Yeah, I'm taking a bath and going to bed.

207
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,830
Thanks for the meal.

208
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,200
You, too, Kotoko-chan?

209
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,450
I'm exhausted from the heat.

210
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,270
Dad?

211
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,880
May I use the study for a while?

212
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,660
Y-yeah, of course, you may.

213
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,580
Thank you, I have tests right after the break.

214
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,870
So isn't it better for you to study with Onii-chan.

215
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,510
But Irie-kun said he's going to sleep.

216
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,330
Don't worry about that. It's all right.

217
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:37,360
But I don't want to be a nuisance.

218
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,100
Then, I'll do the cleaning up later.

219
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,870
They are totally weird....those two.

220
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,260
Lately, it's always been like this.

221
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,260
What should we do?

222
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,540
If this goes on, divorce is only a matter of time.

223
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,360
Yuki, what are you saying!

224
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,150
You know what they say about
"One should not interfere in loves' quarrels".

225
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,660
The diencephalon (interbrain)...

226
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,480
Bridge ...?

227
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,950
Oh, the pons!

228
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,050
No good! I can't concentrate.

229
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,860
Whatever I do...Keita's voice from that time
won't stop ringing in my ear.

230
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,140
That kind of guy...

231
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,830
give up on him.

232
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,320
Stop messing around, Keita.

233
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,140
Joking around…

234
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,630
Are you making fun of the married woman?

235
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,810
Let's go, I'll send you.

236
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,860
Thank you.

237
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,220
From then on we haven't spoken a word.

238
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,570
Whether he was joking, or trying to comfort me...

239
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,370
I've never been embraced by anybody apart from Irie-kun.

240
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,170
That's why I panicked.

241
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,960
I have barely spoke with Irie-kun after that.

242
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,120
I want to reconcile with him...somehow,
but he seems to be avoiding me.

243
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,310
It's no use thinking about this.

244
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,410
Okay, I'll go to sleep now.

245
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,960
Such a sweet sleeping face.

246
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,160
Why did we become like this?

247
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,030
Although we're this close, I can't kiss him.

248
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:11,150
The new semester finally starts after the long break.

249
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,690
Good morning!

250
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,180
- Oh it's you, Moto-chan.
- Why are you like that?

251
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,520
Is there someone you don't want to see?

252
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,550
Well, not really...

253
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,790
Oh, Keita!

254
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,190
Hey! It's been a while!

255
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,990
It's been a while!

256
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,110
Kotoko!

257
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,660
Yes! What?

258
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,990
Did you...

259
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,330
write the report on the pathophysiology?

260
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,200
Huh? Pathophysiology?

261
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,500
Don't tell me...you haven't?

262
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,880
We can't complete our assignment because of you!

263
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,410
I'm sorry!!!

264
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,120
I'm relieved! It's the usual Keita!

265
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,700
He really was joking that night.

266
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,880
Calm down!

267
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,000
Don't make me hit you.

268
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,950
Irie-kun. . .

269
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,030
I want to be accepted by Irie-kun by getting good marks.

270
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,370
And also make up.

271
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,530
Day of the Exam

272
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,620
You're already going?

273
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,480
Yeah, there's something I want to research.

274
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,330
Then...wait a while, I'll make your breakfast quickly.

275
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,540
I don't need it.

276
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,200
But you don't look that good today...

277
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,650
I'm going.

278
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,470
All the best...

279
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,800
[First exam of the First semester]
[First Day]

280
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,480
Please start now!

281
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,940
[Second Day]

282
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,010
[Third Day]

283
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,910
Okay, that's it!

284
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,470
And like this, three-day exams were over.

285
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,020
It's over. It's over.

286
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,880
I'm so tired.

287
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,830
How did it go, Kotoko-san?

288
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:41,590
Well, I feel like I did okay.

289
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,750
That's great!

290
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,580
Are you sure?

291
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,450
- I'm sure of it.
- Marina-san!

292
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,530
Marina-san

293
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,890
What is it? You need something from me?

294
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,670
Do you remember that promise?

295
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,650
What was that again?

296
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,360
You promised that you were going to date me
if I surpassed Irie-san to be the top, right?

297
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,940
What? You were serious?

298
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,920
Yes, I'm always serious!

299
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,000
This summer, without stepping a single foot
outside, I spent the whole time studying.

300
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
So the exam results were?...

301
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,890
Today's exam...

302
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,270
as expected, I did great!

303
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,510
I believe 99.9% that I beat Irie Naoki.

304
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,030
Well then.

305
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,770
Where is Irie-san?

306
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,900
It'll be okay! There's no way Irie-kun would lose.

307
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,490
That's true, right?

308
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,060
Though it should be alright,

309
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:55,840
we should still check with Irie-san anyway
on how he did on the exams.

310
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,970
Let's go! Hurry up!

311
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,750
Keita, let's go.

312
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,120
You guys came as well?

313
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,870
Irie-san!

314
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,630
How was it, the exam?

315
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,450
The exam...

316
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,630
...was bad.

317
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,480
There's no way that Irie-san wouldn't be ok, right?

318
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,370
Please stop joking.

319
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:42,720
Nope, it's the worst I've ever done.

320
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,920
Yes!!! I'm number one!

321
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,810
Marina-san...

322
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,670
Where shall we go on a date?

323
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,950
- Take a look at this, by the way.
- Oh, no!

324
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,720
Is that true, Irie-kun?

325
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,400
Yeah.

326
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,360
Are you sick? Do you have a fever?

327
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,160
Don't worry. It's okay.

328
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:33,380
See you.

329
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,390
Hold on, you guys are not getting along?

330
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,010
Did you fight?

331
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,270
Not at all.

332
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,450
But Irie-san's attitude...doesn't it seem like he dislikes you?

333
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,960
That's not true. Irie-kun is just tired.

334
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,860
Marina has Funatsu now.

335
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,510
My rivals are dwindling.

336
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,850
I've already said, you're mistaken!

337
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:12,110
- Calm down!
- But...!

338
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,690
Has it been like that all the while?

339
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:22,670
It's already a month since that night, but...

340
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,230
am I the reason?

341
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,820
No, that's not it.

342
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,600
You have nothing to do with it, Keita.

343
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,270
I told you not to say I have nothing to do with it.

344
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,990
What?

345
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,570
I have nothing to do with it ...?

346
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,660
But...

347
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,430
You were joking then, weren't you?

348
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,880
I wasn't joking.

349
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,290
I meant what I said that time.

350
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,370
Keita!

351
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,480
That's how it is.

352
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,760
If you're with a cold guy like him, you won't be happy.

353
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,060
Just get it done with and get a divorce.

354
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,670
Kinnosuke, I'm done with this.

355
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,550
Alright, shall we close up then?

356
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,140
Are you closing already?

357
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,540
Please come tomorrow!

358
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:20,760
-Irie!
-Oh, Naoki!

359
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,730
What do you want to eat? Just say it, anything.

360
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,480
Look, I'm the one who makes it!

361
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,830
Just something simple will do.

362
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,900
Oh, can you make a fried chicken set meal?

363
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,310
Something so troublesome...

364
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,470
Kin-chan.

365
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,130
Thanks.

366
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,980
Please wait for a while, Naoki-kun.

367
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,550
Closed for today--Tonan Canteen

368
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,450
Here you go.

369
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,600
The things that Kinnosuke make are delicious, right?

370
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,420
Isn't that obvious?

371
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,850
Yeah, it's good.

372
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,070
I know, right?

373
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,170
I am here, so Kinnosuke is revved up.

374
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,630
What are you saying?

375
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,870
Looks like you're getting along well.

376
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,210
What?! Who would with this person?!

377
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,670
Oh, we are getting along VERY well.

378
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,770
Aren't you and Kotoko getting along, too?

379
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,810
Well, I don't know.

380
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,870
Seems like we're not right now.

381
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,270
Why? What do you mean?

382
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,820
Did you make Kotoko cry?

383
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:41,010
Well, I'm not in a good condition.

384
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,350
What? You're sick? Aren't you going to be a doctor?
That's so pitiable.

385
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,460
I'm not really sick...

386
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,760
but I can't really sleep at night.

387
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,150
Then what's it about? What's the problem?

388
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,730
I don't even know myself...

389
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,730
why I am treating Kotoko like that.

390
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,050
Ever since that Kamogari guy started lingering around Kotoko,

391
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,590
I just somehow get annoyed looking at Kotoko.

392
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,120
Do you really not know?

393
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,810
What?

394
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:40,220
Are you an idiot? Don't talk nonsense.

395
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,670
Why? Do you understand something I don't?

396
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,160
Jealousy!

397
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,850
That's just jealousy.

398
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,440
Jealousy?

399
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,270
Me?

400
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,060
That's not possible! I'm not you.

401
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:06,310
Idiot! It is!

402
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,010
Listen. Thanks to you,

403
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,920
I've been jealous for six years on end, haven't I?
I'm a veteran!

404
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,390
Because this veteran is telling you, there's no mistaking it.

405
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,640
Seeing that guy with Kotoko,

406
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,510
you're jealous!

407
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,560
It's a pain, even for a genius, right?

408
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,900
By the way,

409
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,500
there's a weird guy around Kotoko?

410
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,230
I'll get rid of him with one hit.

411
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:48,440
Kinnosuke, you can get jealous about me, too!

412
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,240
Are you an idiot?

413
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,450
I'm not going to!

414
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,040
Even though we had to change from wearing
short sleeves to long sleeve shirts,

415
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,930
my relationship with Irie-kun
has remained the same since that summer's day.

416
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,360
Irie-kun.

417
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,650
Nursing practice room

418
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:45,480
And what about Kotoko-chan?

419
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:54,060
Kotoko, how is it? The exam results.

420
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,330
You had such confidence....

421
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:01,140
Just show us already.

422
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,110
What's this?!

423
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,680
51%, 36%...

424
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,970
48%, 43%?! What?!

425
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:14,720
Stop it!

426
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,380
Why not?

427
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,330
Here you go.

428
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,820
Thank you, Keita.

429
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,080
Youuuu!

430
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,990
It's amazing you managed to get such
scores while being so confident.

431
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,560
Do you think you can become a nurse with these kind of results?!

432
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,510
I'm soooorry!

433
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,670
I'm sorry!

434
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,010
Ah! Scary face!

435
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,730
- I wonder if I should go to a shrine to get exorcized...
- Huh?

436
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:57,320
Recently nothing good has been happening.

437
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,680
You haven't made up with Irie yet?

438
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,100
Nope.

439
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,330
If I had made good marks in the exams,

440
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:06,030
I thought I would be praised by Irie-kun

441
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,200
and make up with him.

442
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,310
But it didn't work.

443
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,160
Making up with him, huh?

444
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,760
What should she do this time? What do you think Satomi?

445
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,760
What happened Satomi? Are you okay?

446
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,460
Did you eat too much cake, like I did?

447
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,830
Could it be...!
You're pregnant!?

448
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,690
That's right.

449
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,790
I...

450
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,110
it seems like I am.

451
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,920
I took a pregnancy test.

452
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,180
What are you going to do?

453
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,330
Does Ryo-kun know?

454
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,660
What did he say?

455
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,950
He said let's get married.

456
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,140
Seriously?!!

457
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,600
Marriage!

458
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,380
He wants me to give birth to the baby, too.

459
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,220
The order is reversed, though.

460
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:15,220
Ah, in this day and age, its normal! Normal!

461
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,530
Satomi, congratulations!

462
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,950
Congratulations!

463
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,150
Thank you!

464
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,280
So, when is the wedding?

465
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,520
Probably when it's (pregnancy) more stable,
so we're still discussing.

466
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,080
I see.

467
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,300
Satomi is going to be a mom.

468
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,420
Kotoko you, too. Hurry up and make up with Naoki.

469
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,070
Please make one, too.

470
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,120
Come to the wedding as a married couple!

471
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,180
Yeah...

472
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,960
Wow, Satomi is?

473
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,050
That's nice!

474
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,840
Marriage and a baby.

475
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,080
We must really congratulate her.

476
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,650
They say that her due date is estimated around
June next year.

477
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,380
Wow...

478
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,070
It'll surely be an adorable girl that takes after Satomi-chan.

479
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,890
I hope Kotoko-chan and Naoki will also...

480
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,950
Well, things like this (wouldn't happen as we wish) ...

481
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,510
Mother really wants a baby, too.

482
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:35,400
But we don't even kiss lately.

483
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,850
But you know, Kotoko-chan...

484
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:44,760
they say that people's happiness gets transferred.

485
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,430
Surely, soon enough,

486
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,350
I believe good things will happen to Kotoko-chan.

487
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,300
Mother,

488
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,560
thank you very much!

489
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,090
Okay!

490
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,090
Irie-kun, can I have a minute?

491
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,930
What?

492
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,660
You know, I have great news!

493
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:45,520
Satomi will get married to Ryo-kun.

494
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,910
And on top of that...she's pregnant.

495
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,330
That's great.

496
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,970
They're going to hold the wedding
when her condition is more stable.

497
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,570
And Satomi said that I should attend it with you.

498
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,200
Yeah.

499
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:20,070
I wonder how Satomi's wedding will be...

500
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,890
I'm looking forward to it.

501
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,420
I wore a wedding dress,

502
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,790
but Satomi would also look good in a white Kimono.

503
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,370
Isn't it nice...a wedding.

504
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,240
That kind of happy thing, it'd be nice
no matter how many times it happens, right?

505
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:42,730
I would wish to have one again, too.

506
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:44,840
Somehow, right?

507
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,870
Is that all you wanted to say?

508
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,260
Sorry for disturbing your studies.

509
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,140
Kotoko?

510
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,000
What are you doing?

511
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:28,290
Hey! Kotoko!

512
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,030
Stop it! What are you doing!

513
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,320
No! This is wrong!

514
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,460
This is wrong, okay?!

515
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,890
I can't bear it anymore!

516
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:41,340
You're not even concerned about me, I can't stand it!

517
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,290
You don't even care about what happens to me, right?

518
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:48,650
What am I doing, how I'm doing...

519
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:52,260
Keita said he likes me.

520
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,570
He said I should break up with such a cold guy.

521
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:01,530
Irie-kun, you stopped loving me, didn't you!?

522
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,420
No,

523
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,870
you didn't love me from the start!

524
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,870
-Calm down!
-No!

525
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:09,720
Why?

526
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,430
Why?

527
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,680
Why did you get married with me?

528
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,080
It's only I ...

529
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,730
It's only I who is in love.

530
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,530
I can't bear it anymore.

531
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,470
Kotoko!

532
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,790
Kotoko, what is it?

533
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:37,200
Where are you going?

534
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,220
Kotoko-chan!

535
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,780
What I was most afraid of and didn't dare ask,

536
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,730
but was always somewhere buried in my heart, what I always thought of...I said it.

537
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,960
I brought an end to it myself.

538
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:35,260
Is it...over for us?

539
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,950
(Preview)
Want to come to my place?

540
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,490
Let's do a retest.

541
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,280
Why do you want to be a nurse?

542
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:17,020
We will wholeheartedly support doctors and get trusted by them.

543
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,530
We devote ourselves for people's happiness.

544
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,020
You're a man, aren't you? You can't!

545
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,900
My dream...

546
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,740
Because Irie-kun's going to be a doctor,
I want to support him.

547
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,650
Irie-kun, can you hear me?
