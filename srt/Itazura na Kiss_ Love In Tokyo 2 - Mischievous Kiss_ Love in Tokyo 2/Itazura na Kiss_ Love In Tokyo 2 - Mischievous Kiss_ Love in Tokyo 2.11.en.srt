1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,870
How did you do on the test?

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,210
Perfect score.

3
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,220
Are you serious?

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,290
How do you ace a test like that?

5
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,070
Like what?

6
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,170
It was super hard.

7
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,950
It was.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,160
Will you ace the next one?

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,870
Probably, if I study.

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,200
What do you want?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,180
What's wrong?

12
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,630
A stray cat has been following us.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,630
Stray cat?

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,590
Whatever.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,110
Excuse me, Irie-kun.

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,410
Well, I...

17
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,110
Well...

18
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,900
What?

19
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:12,340
I'm Konomi Sagawa from Class F.

20
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,010
Sagawa from Class F?

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,560
What, Irie?

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,100
Do you know this girl?

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,120
No.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,590
You may not know who I am,

25
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,520
but I've known you for a long time.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,780
So what?

27
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:35,500
I want to be your friend.

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,040
Whoa, you're so popular Irie!

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,580
No way.

30
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,420
Can't we be friends?

31
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,680
I don't want any stupid friends from Class F.

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
What? You already told him?

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,930
Kotoko-san!

34
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,140
Sorry.

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,300
But you're moving so fast.

36
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,560
You've never even talked to him, right?

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,030
But I was in the same way so I can't blame you.

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,300
I was encouraged by our last conversation.

39
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,450
I decided to "go for broke"!

40
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,200
I see!

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,770
And what did Yuuki-kun say?

42
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,350
He'd think about it if I made the top 100 in the upcoming test.

43
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,220
Within the top 100?!

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,460
Wow, that's nostalgic!

45
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,380
But it's okay now.

46
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,560
I think I'll give up on Yuki-kun now.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,890
What?

48
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,870
I told Yuki-kun how I felt.

49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,370
I feel relieved now.

50
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,030
And I'll never make the top 100 anyway.

51
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,410
What are you saying?

52
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,910
Why are you giving up?

53
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,950
You just need to make it in the top 100!

54
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,620
Bring it on!

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,200
Kotoko-san, that's impossible.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,530
How can I do that?

57
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,310
I'm in Class F.

58
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,340
I was in Class F, too.

59
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,350
But I climbed my way to #100 in the class.

60
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,950
Wow! Amazing!

61
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,320
There's nothing you can't do if you try.

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:36,090
But even if I start cramming now, the top 100...

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,770
Don't worry, I'll help you out.

64
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,730
I'm half-responsible anyway.

65
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,470
I'll help you study.

66
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,340
Really?

67
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,580
Leave it to me!

68
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,160
I feel so motivated now!

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,030
Get into the top 100 and prove Yuki wrong!

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,780
♫KISS what I've longed for♫

71
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,490

♫On the sloping path♫

74
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,320
♫The wind passes through. And if I look towards the sky♫

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,050
♫The sun is shining brilliantly♫

Mischievous Kiss 2 ~Love in TOKYO~

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,710
Episode 11
"Kiss of Goodbye"

93
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,670
Yes.

94
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,020
Hello.

95
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,200
What's with you? What business do you have?

96
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,970
Oh uhm...

97
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,950
Come in Konomi-chan!

98
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,840
Kotoko-san!

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,760
You know her?

100
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,150
Kind of.

101
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,690
I'm going to tutor her starting today.

102
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,330
What? You?

103
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,900
Leave it to me, Konomi-chan!

104
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,560
Okay!

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,860
Let's go to my room!

106
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,430
Excuse me.

107
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,380
Hey!

108
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,890
My heart was pounding!

109
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,690
I'm so envious you get to live with Yuki-kun.

110
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,390
Really?

111
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:54,380
This may be your first step towards a life with Yuki-kun.

112
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,640
But first, we have to get into the top 100!

113
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,980
Please take care of me!

114
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,620
Likewise!

115
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,070
Okay, let's work hard!

116
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,620
Let's see where should we start.

117
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,770
Give me a moment...

118
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,630
Ah this one...this one...

119
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,040
Can we insert this?...

120
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,860
Uhh…Kotoko-san...

121
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,690
It's already been over an hour...

122
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,300
And not a single problem...

123
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,890
It'll be okay!

124
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,900
Seems like I'll be able to solve this soon!

125
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,610
Alright, let's have some snacks and refresh our minds.

126
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,570
I'm back.

127
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,830
Welcome back, Irie-kun!

128
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,070
Hello.

129
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,300
Nice to meet you.

130
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,620
What are you doing?

131
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,370
She's from Tonan Middle school and is
in the same year as Yuki-kun.

132
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,630
I'm helping her study for her end-of-term exams at the moment.

133
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,080
Even if she teaches you, I don't know if that'll be of
any help for you.

134
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,920
What?

135
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,750
Hey, what are you saying?!

136
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,000
I plan on getting her in the top 100!

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Within the top 100?

138
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,720
Ohh…there was something like that, wasn't there.

139
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,830
Right right! Doesn't it bring back memories?

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,760
This part becomes 4, so 4 squared is...?

141
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,300
Studying, with just the two of us in the room...!

142
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:44,210
If I think about it, since that moment, we have become closer.

143
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,480
Just the two of you...

144
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:53,460
Well, try not to waste time.

145
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,150
Hey, Irie-kun, don't get in the way of our studying, okay?

146
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,240
Yes, yes.

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,850
What are you doing?

148
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:19,810
Nothing, I was just passing by.

149
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:24,140
Why don't you just help her study.
Wouldn't that be more realistic?

150
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,160
I don't want to help that stupid girl.

151
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,090
If she gets into the top 100, then I'm the one that's troubled.

152
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,040
There's a more complex reason behind it then.

153
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,320
There's none!!

154
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,190
Kotoko-san...

155
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,710
Oh, sorry.

156
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,260
I...

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:19,330
for some reason whenever I see math equations I get sleepy.

158
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:22,430
Kotoko-san!

159
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,170
Kotoko-san!

160
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,380
Don't sleep please!

161
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,680
What do I do?

162
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,320
Hey, dinner is...

163
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,240
What a useless person.

164
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,970
What about tutoring her...

165
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,090
It's about time I go back now...

166
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,200
How far did you get to?

167
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,990
Ah well…we finished one question.

168
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,540
After three hours?!

169

But…I'm stupid so I'll annoy you.

176

I'm used to that…teaching those types of kids.

177

Correct.

187

WE DID IT!

You got your foot in the door!

199

Now love and exams!

200

Kill two birds with one stone!

Yes!

202

You…are becoming more and more like mother...

203
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,210
Huh, what?

204
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,130
Nothing.

205
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,940
I'm feeling really fired up!

206
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,080
Yuuki-kun's spartan like tutoring continued.

And today is the final day.

216

Konomi-chan, Yuki-kun, how about some tea?

217
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,700
Yes!

218

Yes! Thanks to you.

Yuuki-kun is strict, isn't he?

221

He hasn't said anything unpleasant?

No...

She's stupid so there's no choice.

Again with saying things like that.

225
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,520
Konomi-chan, don't let it bother you. Yuuki-kun
says it like that but...

226
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,880
You know boys like to bully the girls they like.

It's okay, so go on and open it.

She was 97.

338
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,300
Wow, that's amazing!

339
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,350
It's decided then.

340
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,580
Well, I was a good tutor that's why.

341
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,800
I see.

342
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,490
I felt the same way with Kotoko, too.

343
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:45,090
It's a big deal for someone from Class F to make the top 100.

344
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,930
The strength of love is amazing, isn't it

345
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,350
I'm saying it's thanks to my teaching skills...

346
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,270
More than the difficulties of studying...

347
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:57,210
The time spent together…is more like nurturing
the love between you two...

348
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,270
Yuki-kun you seem to have gotten really
friendly with Konomi-chan anyway!

349
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:03,180
Don't talk like you know me.

350
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, you did want to be Konomi's friend~!

351
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,970
I said...

352
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,010
By the way, when is Naoki's graduation?

353
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,590
March 20th.

354
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,910
I see.

355
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,260
So he's finally going to be a doctor.

356
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,130
He's going to speak on behalf of the graduates again.
Right, Irie-kun?

357
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,460
Irie-kun, what's wrong?

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,910
Oh, what?

359
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,540
You're speaking at the graduation, right?

360
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,310
-Yeah.
-I knew it!

361
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:45,610
Then I'll bring my video camera.

362
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,680
Yuki is graduating, too.

363
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,120
Shall we buy a new one on this occasion?

364
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,650
Kotoko.

365
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,730
I have something to tell all of you.

366
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,910
What's this, being all formal?

367
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:07,390
I met with my professor today.

368
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,090
I'm thinking of working at a hospital in Kobe.

369
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,700
Kobe...

370
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Weren't you going to Tonan University's hospital?

371
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,550
That was my intention at first, but

372
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,810
I want to explore some specialized fields.

373
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,910
What?

374
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,460
So, at that specialized hospital...

375
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,220
But Kobe is really really far you know.

376
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:46,240
It takes more than 6 hours there and back. How ...

377
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,940
I'm not traveling.

378
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,970
That's impossible.

379
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:51,590
Then?

380
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:56,510
I'll leave this house and live in Kobe.

381
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,520
Naoki...

382
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,220
are you being serious about this?

383
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,900
Yes.

384
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,960
I've already been invited by a prestigious doctor there.

385
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,400
I'll study there for a couple years and return after that.

386
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,900
Irie-kun, then, I'll have to look for a school in Kobe!

387
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,200
I wonder if I can find it in time.

388
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,540
You stay here.

389
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,380
I'll go alone, so

390
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:33,000
you stay here and properly study.

391
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,550
I don't want to!

392
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,390
To be away from you...

393
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,940
You should study properly here for another year,
then come look for me when you've graduated.

394
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,110
No!

395
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:49,610
To be away from you for a year, I don't want that!
I don't want that at all!

396
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,300
I mean, I'm a fool!

397
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,710
If I can't become a nurse this time,

398
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,630
it'll take me much longer than a year to become one!

399
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,500
Kotoko-chan...

400
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,250
Then, we'll be apart even more!

401
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,870
Then, I should wait for you to become a nurse,

402
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:06,920
and go to Kobe after that, is that right?

403
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,330
Onii-chan, why do you say such things!?

404
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,310
Think about Kotoko's feelings!

405
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,610
You are a married couple!

406
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,560
Yeah.

407
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,210
Couples can't be separated!

408
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,520
Don't only think about yourself!

409
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,850
I know that.

410
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,950
You don't understand.

411
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,890
You don't understand.

412
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,450
I like you so much more than you like me.

413
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,350
For me…my feelings…being separated...

414
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,970
To be separated, you don't understand how painful that is.

415
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,600
Because...

416
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,200
you...

417
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,750
are totally fine being separated from me.

418
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,800
When you decided that,

419
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:15,770
you didn't even think about me, right?

420
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,440
For me to be the only one that's sad is unfair!

421
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,130
Kotoko-chan...

422
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,210
What should I do...

423
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,220
What should I do… ? What do I do?

424
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,880
I'm troubling Irie-kun

425
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,530
I'm a failure as his wife now.

426
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,240
I know.

427
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,350
I know that.

428
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:05,590
But…but you know...

429
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,410
I don't want to be separated from Irie-kun.

430
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,220
Kotoko?

431
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,600
-You didn't eat dinner again?
-Yeah.

432
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,980
But I'm already sleepy so...

433
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,730
-Kotoko
-Good Night.

434
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,950
Welcome back.

435
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,190
I'm back.

436
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:30,260
What? You were still awake?

437
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,230
Dad, is it okay if we talk a bit?

438
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,700
How is Kotoko?

439
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,970
Is she sulking as usual?

440
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,220
Yes.

441
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,490
I was prepared that it might turn into this.

442
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,050
But…seeing Kotoko like that...

443
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,910
She is really in love with you after all.

444
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,000
Dad...

445
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,690
I think I'll take Kotoko to Kobe after all.

446
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,110
What?

447
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:15,370
But Naoki-kun...

448
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,650
If I look for a nursing school right now and try to transfer,

449
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,540
it will probably work out.

450
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:27,700
It's just, in a city she doesn't know and people
she doesn't know...

451
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,940
can she comfortably stay calm and study?

452
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,860
And I will probably already have my hands full
with my own work...

453
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:43,970
About her…would I properly be able to take care of her.
I was worried about that.

454
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,500
I want her to properly become a nurse, too.

455
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,970
I thought it would be best if we parted for just a year.
That's what I believed, but...

456
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,120
Naoki-kun...

457
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,660
She…about my love for her...

458
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,410
She doesn't seem to know that.

459
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,030
Irie-kun...

460
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:59,800
The student representative of the medical faculty, Miura Takayuki.

461
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,430
Representing our class, Irie Naoki.

462
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,030
Yes.

463
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:33,300
If I recall those days spent at Tonan University...

464
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:40,230
Many a memory, difficult to forget, come to mind.

465
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:45,850
What was it like looking at Irie-kun during
our high school graduation again?

466
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,440
♫From his nonchalant behavior ♫

467
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,700
At that time there was Jinko and Satomi…even Kin-chan,

468
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:01,430
I was rejected for the second button.

469
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:08,720
♫I feel you're far away from me♫

470
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,790
But my thoughts were the same.

471
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:17,540
I love Irie-kun! Like an idiot as if that was the
only thing I knew,

472
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,480
I will always love Irie-kun.

473
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,590
Graduating student representative of the medical department,

474
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,470
Irie Naoki.

475
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:36,130
♫If I squeeze it tight, it would break in pieces♫

476
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:38,450
♫Like a glass ball♫

477
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,900
No matter then or now, that is the only
thing that will never change.

478
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:47,940
♫ So I want to hand it down to our grandchildren♫

479
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,140
♫Until the end of our lifetime, till forever♫

480
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:58,060
This is the Science department campus
Irie-kun was at in the first year.

481
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,570
There was Matsumoto Yuuko, too!

482
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,990
Have you decided on the electives?

483
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,640
No, I haven't decided yet.

484
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,160
♫If we can live like that♫

485
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,080
How nostalgic! The Tennis Club.

486
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:21,850
We played the doubles together, didn't we.

487
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,400
- Smooth.
♫The breathing♫

488
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,710
♫Of you who's asleep beside me♫

489
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,680
♫Is it ok if I keep all of you for myself?♫

490
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,240
The cafeteria where I had lunch with Irie-kun...

491
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,140
There was lots of bickering with Kin-chan, too.

492
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,480
What's with this difference?

493
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,900
What's wrong, dear customer?

494
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,570
Kin-chan?!

495
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,200
♫In your memories♫

496
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,930
The seminar rooms of the medicine department...

497
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,340
I used to look at Irie-kun a lot from here.

498
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,780
There he is! There he is!

499
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,490
As expected of Irie-san, the aura is different!

500
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,930
♫So that I can stay by your side♫

501
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,670
That view...I won't be able to see that any more, right?

502
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:27,080
Irie-kun. Irie-kun.

503
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:32,590
Irie-kun!

504
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,840
-What?
-Ah!

505
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,090
Such a loud voice.

506
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,750
Wh-why?

507
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,800
Because I thought you'd probably be here.

508
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,690
I have something to talk to you about. I thought
it'd be better than talking at home.

509
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,220
-It's about Kobe.
-I!

510
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,890
I will definitely become a nurse in a year.

511
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,190
Then I'll go to Kobe!

512
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,870
I will definitely go! So...

513
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,360
wait for me.

514
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,080
Cheating…don't do that, okay?

515
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,700
If I call you everyday…

516
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,950
don't get mad, okay? And...

517
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,190
And?

518
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,190
During vacation visit...

519
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,240
...someone might come.

520
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,760
I don't care. That is fine.

521
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,990
Let's part here.

522
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,270
Huh? I'll send you to the platform!

523
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,150
It's fine. If you come,

524
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:01,020
seems like you might stop the train.

525
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,930
Huh? No way...

526
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,500
But…it'll be unbearable…so

527
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,780
I suppose we should say bye here.

528
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,790
Yeah. See you.

529
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:19,710
Ah…you know…hum…when you get there

530
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,100
-call okay.
-Yeah.

531
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,980
Your lunch...

532
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,560
I'll buy it in the station.

533
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,090
Shin-kobe is the station after Okayama, alright?

534
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,470
Don't miss your stop.

535
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,330
Actually, it should be after Shin-Osaka.

536
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:52,700
Is it okay if I really go now?

537
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:59,160
You can give me a goodbye kiss, too.

538
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,380
Just saying.

539
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,340
Good luck...

540
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,630
with your studies.

541
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,040
You too! Work hard, okay?

542
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:08,160
All the best... all the best, Irie-kun!

543
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,810
All the best...Kotoko.

544
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:35,800
All the best...to us.

545
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:49,000
♫Just the words "Good Morning"♫

546
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,270
♫Makes me happy whenever♫

547
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,980
♫There was such thing?♫

548
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:04,930
♫"Thank you", to the one I love♫

549
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,890
♫I kiss you with an indifferent face♫

550
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:17,190
♫But my heart is the only one feeling the changes♫

551
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:22,460
♫I'm loving you with all my heart♫

552
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,770
♫No matter what you're like♫

553
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:33,950
♫The love that understands all♫

554
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:40,660
♫We'll make that happen together♫

555
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:49,400
♫Embrace me so that we don't get separated♫

556
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,990
[#12- And Love in KOBE]
When are you going to stop rolling the bandages?!

557
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,500
[#12-And Love in KOBE]
I haven't heard Irie-kun's voice for 3 days!

558
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,780
I bet 1000 yen Kotoko will go to Kobe within a week.

559
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,080
I bet 5000 she'll go tomorrow.

560
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,030
I...I did it.

561
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,410
I found you! I'm filling up with energy!

562
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:27,150
If his wife isn't around, he feels like he's single again and will let his hair down.

563
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:28,700
I found you!

564
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,370
Kotoko...
That parent and child's name is Shiina-san.
This drama is a work of fiction.
