1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,060
Because of us...

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,990
although it doesn't concern you at all...

3
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,690
Doesn't concern me?

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,240
Don't say that it doesn't concern me.

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,300
That kind of guy,

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,050
just give up on him.

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,680
Jealousy.

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,990
Jealousy?

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,150
Me?

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:49,550
Irie-kun...you don't like me anymore, right?

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,070
No...

12
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,470
You didn't like me from the very beginning, right?

13
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,470
-Calm down!
-Enough!

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,840
Why?

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,840
Why?

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,070
Why did you marry me?

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
Only me...

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,580
It's just me who loves a lot.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I've had enough!

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,400
Kotoko!

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,610
The thing that I was most afraid of asking...

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,450
The thing that was always on my mind...I said it

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,900
I put an end to it myself.

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,300
Is it over between us?

25
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,220
Aihara Japanese Cuisine

26
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,400
It was a busy day today as well...

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,700
Sorry, we're already closed...

28
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,210
Kotoko?

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
-What happened Kotoko?
-Oh, Kotoko...

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,000
Have some tea at least...

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,900
Did you quarrel with Naoki?

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,460
I've warned Irie, if he makes Kotoko cry I won't forgive him.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,430
There's really no way around this isn't it...
let's go back together later.

34
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm not going back.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,460
Naoki will be worried.

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,740
Irie-kun...what I'm doing, how I'm doing...

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,110
he doesn't care.

38
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,700
Something must've happened right, at this hour...

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,570
Please, don't tell him I'm here.

40
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,580
I...

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,200
can't go back.

42
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,460
Kotoko, why don't you come to my place?

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,790
-Is it ok?
-Of course, it is.

44
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,560
You can stay in my apartment as long as you want.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,900
Kinnosuke!

46
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,600
Hello? Kotoko just came.

47
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,980
No problem, it's ok.

48
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,120
Looks like she's going to stay at Chris' place tonight.

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,110
She'll probably calm down after some time.

50
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,390
Don't worry.

51
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,090
- Thank you very much.
- Bye

52

♫ Kiss, what I've been longing for, the complicated kiss from you

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,940
♫ Mischievous kiss ♫

54
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,910
♫ The wind passes through the slopping path
If you look up at the sky♫

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,690
♫ The sun shines brightly ♫

♫ Catching up with an innocent face, our eyes meet SPARK! ♫

♫ Even if I cry, or laugh. Even if things are hard and I want to escape reality ♫

♫ The only thing I can't control is that feeling ♫

♫ Kiss, a greedy kiss, the kiss I remember,

Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in TOKYO

66
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:51,880
Episode 7
A pledge to the nurse cap

67
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,600
Aren't you going to eat, Kotoko-san?

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,900
Now... I'm a bit...

69
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,740
Are you alright?

70
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,080
She apparently quarrelled with Irie-san, ran away from home, and drank like there's no tomorrow.

71
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,890
Kotoko-san...you must feel horrible.

72
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,540
As a girl, having a hangover is quite disgraceful.

73
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,600
Here.

74
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,080
Keita.

75
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,060
It's the most effective.

76
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,370
Drink up.

77
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,210
-Thank you.
-Chris!

78
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,780
-I can't see!
-Ouch, what are you doing?

79
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,750
That guy, that guy!

80
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:06,080
Mmm...you're so gentle towards Kotoko.

81
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,560
Bitter!

82
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,690
Is it true that you left home?

83
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,880
Huh?

84
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,720
I could hear you all the way over there.

85
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,450
Oh, yes. Keita you should say something about it.

86
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:24,280
Quarrelled with Irie, right?

87
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,820
Why don't you come to my place?

88
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,010
Huh?

89
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,780
It's just a small apartment.

90
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,660
Wait a moment... What are you saying, Keita?

91
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,140
I told you, right? That I was serious.

92
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,590
I like you.

93
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,910
That guy...

94
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,150
What is he say...

95
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,050
Where are you going? Kinnosuke!

96
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,270
I'm interested in you and I can't take my eyes off (you).

97
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,920
But...I am Irie-kun's...

98
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,780
That's why, get divorced!

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,730
Did he chase after you? Did he get jealous of me?

100
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,440
What has he done for you?

101
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,600
That's not what a married couple is supposed to be like.

102
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,940
A couple can't be together if they don't both need the other!

103
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,290
You need me.

104
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,300
You're wrong.

105
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,480
You're totally wrong.

106
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,330
Irie-kun.

107
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,450
Look who's talking?
You made her suffer long enough.

108
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:53,780
You can't make her happy.

109
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,500
You didn't deserve to get married to her!

110
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,960
What's going on?

111
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,930
Kamogari and Kotoko...

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,490
an affair?

113
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,320
Probably...that might be the case.

114
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,010
It's not "might be the case",

115
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,000
that IS the case!

116
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,230
I was jealous.

117
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,000
I was...jealous of Kamogari.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Huh?

119
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,370
Up until now, being jealous

120
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,720
or envying someone,

121
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,170
sorrow or suffering--

122
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,390
I've never felt these kinds of

123
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,340
despicable emotions which humans normally possess.

124
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,470
But...

125
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,930
I've changed ever since I met Kotoko.

126
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,110
Those feelings hidden within me...

127
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,320
they just overflowed.

128
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,790
Not even knowing what to do about them myself,

129
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,260
I felt lost and got annoyed.

130
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,980
And so, what are you trying to say?

131
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,670
Kamogari, you have enough of those

132
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,960
despicable feelings, don't you?

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,230
What? Are you picking a fight with me?

134
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,040
I wanted to praise you, but

135
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,710
I'm not exactly envious either.

136
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,830
So...you don't need Kotoko.

137
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,240
I'm the one who needs her.

138
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,990
Huh?

139
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,940
For me, to be myself,

140
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,570
is only when Kotoko is by my side.

141
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,120
Really? Irie-kun?

142
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Yes,

143
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,700
I didn't even know such things until recently...

144
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,030
until Kinnosuke taught me that.

145
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,500
Kin-chan?

146
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,790
He even took the trouble to find me just now.

147
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,380
He has really been through all these the last six years...

148
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,440
He's really quite an admirable guy.

149
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm a better person than you are.

150
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,850
Irie-kun.

151
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,560
Yes?

152
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,310
I...

153
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,210
I...

154
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,620
Can I really be by your side?

155
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,960
Didn't I just say so?

156
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,640
I definitely...

157
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,290
won't leave you until I die.

158
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,800
I'm prepared for that.

159
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,820
Congratulations!

160
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,170
We're at the cafeteria...

161
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:16,680
Seems like I barely have that kind of feeling, too.

162
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,420
Looks nice.

163
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,430
Why did you do that for, Motoki?

164
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,750
What do we do now?

165
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:51,510
It just strengthened their relationship.

166
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,110
It's only for now...

167
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,540
You...

168
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,150
just wanted to save a pitiful looking person.

169
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,900
That's just what you thought.

170
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:15,470
"Kotoko looks unhappy" right. Right, hot-blooded Keita-kun?

171
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,690
Let's just leave it at that then.

172
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,770
The patients that you must save,

173
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,050
there'll be lots of them from now on.

174
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,720
So, you don't have time to be stuck on one person.

175
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,250
But well, I'm not going to give up on Irie-san anyway.

176
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,690
I'm home.

177
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:49,370
Kotoko-chan, welcome back...

178
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,260
Ah, what's going on?

179
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,480
Did you patch things up?

180
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,520
Sorry to have worried you, Mom.

181
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,390
We've patched things up!

182
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,380
That's really great...

183
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,860
When are you going to stop being so clingy?

184
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,210
So...what happened?

185
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,770
Irie-kun confessed...

186
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,710
his love for me

187
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:39,210
in front of everyone!

188
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,360
Onii-chan really does things right when he needs to!

189
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,590
Onii-chan did?

190
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,730
"For me, to be myself,

191
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,770
is only when Kotoko is by my side."

192
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,720
Like that.

193
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,880
Hey!

194
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,450
Kotoko-chan, you're so loved, right?

195
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,810
Quarrel, then make up...

196
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,500
From now on, you're going to be a married couple for real.

197
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,910
-Thank you, Kotoko-chan.
-Huh?

198
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,980
I think that after meeting you, Onii-chan has matured a lot.

199
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,560
Should I say...he seems to be
more understanding of people's feelings now.

200
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,260
I'm sure, that heart of ice of a cold guy like Onii-chan,

201
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,600
has been melted by your love!

202
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,950
My love's not that...

203
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,890
Please, always stay by his side.

204
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,100
Yes. Of course.

205
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,430
Let's celebrate the anniversary of your first making up!

206
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,870
Let's do it! What shall we do?

207
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,890
How about a cake?

208
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,810
Let's make it together!

209
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,870
Mischievous Kiss 2 ~Love in Tokyo~

210
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,550
Irie-san...

211
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,130
can't do injections,

212
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:18,570
can't measure vital signs,

213
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,900
can't transfer a patient to a wheelchair.

214
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,750
If it's like that, things are going to be difficult.

215
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,540
Practicum at a hospital is going to start next month, you know?

216
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,570
Yes...

217
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:34,290
There's going to be a re-test tomorrow.

218
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,830
If you don't pass that, you'll have to repeat for a year.

219
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,980
Understood?

220
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,050
No way ...!!

221
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,040
Next day

222
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,360
Kotoko?

223
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,870
What are you doing so early in the morning?

224
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,450
Keita...

225
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,690
Suddenly, I need to retake the exam

226
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:29,420
of everything I learned so far.

227
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,150
I've been practicing for 6 hours this morning, but...

228
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,370
I'm not getting any better.

229
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,210
You have wasted all these needles...

230
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,070
Whatever I do isn't going right...

231
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,320
I can't even do a single injection.

232
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm worried if I can really become a nurse like this...

233
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,550
If that happens...

234
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,460
I don't think you have time to cry, right?

235
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,130
Huh?

236
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,580
Ok.

237
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,900
Use my arm.

238
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,240
It'll be easy after you master the knack.

239
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,670
It's ok no matter how many times you fail,

240
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,330
so try as much as you want to.

241
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,970
Really?

242
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,520
Yeah.

243
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:36,390
Then, I'll do it, ok?

244
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,330
Hey!

245
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,900
Use the practice pad!

246
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:55,870
Sorry, I'll definitely do it this time...

247
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,550
Look at the needle properly!

248
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,250
Yes

249
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,150
Kotoko, relax your arms.

250
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,110
Somehow...that's what Keita tells me all the time.

251
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,040
If you're nervous, the patient will feel it, too.

252
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,250
Relax, alright?

253
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,670
Ok, try one more time.

254
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,430
Ok.

255
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,260
I did it! It's done!

256
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,200
You did it, Kotoko!

257
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,140
Finally, I did it!

258
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,610
Thank you, Keita.

259
00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:00,680
Well...I have one more favor to ask.

260
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,320
Huh?

261
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,460
Kotoko, you are too tense.

262
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,770
-Slowly.
-Yes.

263
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,210
Hey, focus.

264
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes

265
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,020
Don't rush.

266
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,660
-Go slowly.
-Okay.

267
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,330
Just like that.

268
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,150
I did it!

269
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,300
That's great.

270
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,660
Thanks to Keita!

271
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,140
I definitely won't forget this.

272
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:07,780
Actually, why do you want to become a nurse?

273
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,120
There are lots of reasons, right?

274
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,540
Like an ambition from when you were young,
or wanting to help people who are ill.

275
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,280
For me...because Irie-kun's going to be a doctor,
and I want to support him.

276
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,410
Just that?

277
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm clumsy, I always make mistakes,

278
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,870
and I always cause people problems.

279
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,090
But recently I've been thinking that despite all that,

280
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,990
I want to be useful to someone and
support discouraged patients.

281
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,850
Though Irie-kun is still the main reason.

282
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,020
I'm no match for you.

283
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,920
You're really happy with Irie-kun, aren't you?

284
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,890
Good luck on your test.

285
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,340
Thank you, Keita.

286
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,270
Hey!

287
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,430
What's up, when it's early in the morning?

288
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,000
I've been the training partner for injections
for your wife up till now.

289
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,470
She said that she's going to have re-tests today.

290
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,210
Thanks for doing that.

291
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,380
Seriously, a guy like you...

292
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm not going to chase after Kotoko anymore.

293
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,070
Even if you're a horrible husband and an annoying person,

294
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,020
if Kotoko is happy,

295
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,210
I won't say anything else anymore.

296
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,430
Her strong feelings for me...

297
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:25,570
I see you've realised you can't beat that.

298
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,660
It would have been good if you realized that earlier though.

299
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,810
I'm trying to be modest, and yet you mock me.

300
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,490
You stupid narcissist!

301
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,740
Treat her well.

302
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,730
Congratulations on passing ❤

303
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,690
What's that?

304
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,350
Kin-chan was really excited when I told him
about passing the re-test.

305
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,550
That's great. Now everyone can go on to their practicums.

306
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,590
Yeah.

307
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,780
But before that...

308
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,730
Finally...

309
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,330
What?

310
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,090
We can go to the capping ceremony.

311
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,010
Yeah...the capping ceremony... What's that again?

312
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,530
You! Someone who wants to become a nurse
doesn't know what the capping ceremony is?!

313
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,630
Well that... I'm a transfer...

314
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:39,900
That has nothing to do with it.

315
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,890
The capping ceremony...

316
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,450
is the first step for nursing students becoming nurses.

317
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,760
-It's like the coming of age ceremony for nurses.
-Oh...

318
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,080
Receiving the nurse's cap from the head of department
for the first time...

319
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,820
That's right, while holding candles. So romantic!

320
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,820
I've dreamt of that moment countless times.

321
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,860
My own nurse's cap...It's the first day of becoming
an angel in white(description used to refer to nurses)!

322
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:16,830
I won't be lying, if I say I've decided to become a nurse
because of the capping ceremony.

323
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,310
Is it really that good?

324
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,550
Apart from that, there's another thing to look forward to, right?

325
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,530
What?

326
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:27,090
They say that you should also receive a flower from
the boy you like in the medical department.

327
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,770
-Flower?
-Right.

328
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,430
It's a tradition of the medical department of Tonan University.

329
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,220
After the ceremony ends and you exit the auditorium,

330
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,490
the guy you like will be waiting and you'll receive the flower!

331
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,480
You know, it's once in a life time event.

332
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,080
Everyone is working hard to earn the rights
to receive the flowers that day.

333
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,620
I'm pretty lucky in that respect.

334
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
Kotoko

335
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,180
Congratulations

336
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,150
The nurse's cap looks good on you.

337
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,110
I've fallen in love all over again.

338
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,130
Irie-kun

339
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:22,170
It's only my imagination...but somehow, somehow...it's amazing!

340
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:26,750
I'll receive flowers from Irie-kun, right?

341
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,000
No good, she's in her own world.

342
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,220
Who should I ask?

343
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,240
How about Funatsu-san? I'm sure he'll be glad to do it.

344
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,230
No way! That person...

345
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,490
Speaking of which, we haven't seen Funatsu-san recently.

346
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:48,480
I went to my favorite parasite museum yesterday.
Unfortunately, it was closed.

347
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,600
Speaking of which...

348
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,860
Irie-san? Are you listening?

349
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,810
Irie-san!

350
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:57,890
Funatsu, your story is too long.

351
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,830
Irie-san!

352
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,110
Irie-kun!

353
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,630
Irie-san, I'm feeling sick.

354
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,920
Irie-kun~ What happened to Funatsu?

355
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,220
He said that he doesn't feel well.

356
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,470
It's a lie.

357
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,730
What happened?

358
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,610
Irie-san, the tests during this time, you were first, right?

359
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,220
Yeah.

360
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,420
Although you said that was the worst test score,
as expected, Irie-san...

361
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,240
That's expected of my husband!

362
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,700
What are you saying?

363
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,060
As expected...

364
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,820
Funatsu-san made such a huge promise
but ended up losing to Irie-san.

365
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,440
He can't face me. Such a coward!

366
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,910
How does he call himself a man?

367
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,150
Irie-kun, I have a favour to ask...

368
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,300
There's going to be a capping ceremony. You know, right?

369
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:16,040
A guy from the medical department is supposed to give
a flower to a girl from the nursing department.

370
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,440
I'm so happy~

371
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
Though I'll be happy with any flower, but still, for me roses will...

372
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,100
That's not possible though...

373
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:31,030
I'm going to a medical conference in Nagoya with a teacher so it's not possible.

374
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:36,550
But...!

375
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,960
It'll be until late so I'm probably staying overnight,

376
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,210
I'd rather not get involved in such an embarrassing matter.

377
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,080
Don't bother with the trivial things. Bye then.

378
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,460
You're awful!

379
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,560
Well, Irie-san was so popular last year and got numerous request from the seniors.

380
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,480
But he rejected them all,

381
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,300
-so...
-So?

382
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,720
Everyone, we're finally approaching the day of the capping ceremony.

383
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,820
We have here today the head of the nursing department of Tonan Hospital who will be at the ceremony.

384
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,930
I'm Hosoi Sayuri. Nice to meet you.

385
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,590
Ugh. What a powerful appearance!

386
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,970
Her name is Hosoi (skinny) even though she's fat.
She's well known.

387
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,980
She's supposedly really mean to the nurses she doesn't like.

388
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,240
If I catch her eye, I'll be in trouble.

389
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,700
Oh right, there's an Irie-san in this class, right?

390
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,680
Yes. I'm Irie Kotoko.

391
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,610
Oh, you're Irie-san?

392
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,810
Your husband has been at our hospital for his clinical practice.

393
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:57,960
Well, he's so brilliant he has a really good reputation.

394
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,180
You must be as brilliant, right?

395
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,120
Ah, that...

396
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
Yes, very.

397
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,880
Ah, I'll look forward to that.

398
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,470
Now for the matter at hand.

399
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,470
We need to choose 4 people to recite the nurses' oath
at next week's capping ceremony.

400
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,090
Me-me-me!

401
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,830
What is it?

402
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,250
My name is Kikyou Motoki.

403
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,810
I'd like to volunteer.

404
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,170
You're a boy, aren't you? This is no good!

405
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,290
Hu...huh? Why?

406
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:45,570
At our university it has been decided that
girls will recite the nurses' oath.

407
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,830
Unfortunately, there is no part for you.

408
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:54,270
Furthermore, male students do not receive
nurse's caps.

409
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,730
You'll be wearing a patch.

410
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:03,060
My...dream...

411
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,780
Up until now...for this day...

412
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,040
-Well then, Ogura-san.
-Yes?

413
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,110
-Mori-san.
-Yes?

414
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,330
-Shinagawa-san.
-Yes?

415
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:23,110
And finally, Irie Kotoko-san.
You four will do it.

416
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,810
Huh?

417
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,430
I'm looking forward to it.

418
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,890
Moto-chan, you're drinking too much!

419
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:49,730
Why do you guys get to do it?!

420
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,490
We've said it countless times,

421
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,150
it's not like I even want to do it!

422
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:58,950
That's right! Then to top it off, you also told her I was brilliant!

423
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,130
I have to memorize the last and longest part of the pledge.

424
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,910
I can't even wear a nurse cap.

425
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,130
Okay, okay.

426
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,870
I've a call.

427
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,450
Ok.

428
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:26,910
I will do all in my power to maintain and elevate the standard of my profession and will hold in confidence all personal matters

429
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:32,710
committed to my keeping and all family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my calling.

430
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,130
That's amazing, Moto-chan.

431
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,490
You... are the worst at remembering stuff.

432
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,870
Please memorize it properly?

433
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,230
Put in effort on my behalf, too.

434
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:52,550
And don't cause embarrassment to Irie-san, too.

435
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:58,070
I understand, but...it's so stressful.

436
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,990
With loyalty will I aid the physician in his work,

437
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,910
I will dedicate myself to devoted service for human welfare.

438
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,130
Moto-chan!

439
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,270
What?

440
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,970
I have an excellent idea...

441
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,950
What?

442
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,280
Well, at the capping ceremony...

443
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,820
Huh?

444
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:34,190
And after a week, the day of the capping ceremony came.

445
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:43,310
We will now begin the capping ceremony
of the nursing department of Tonan University.

446
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,670
Shinagawa Marina.

447
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,390
Yes!

448
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,800
Good luck.

449
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,130
Ogura Tomoko.

450
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,750
Yes.

451
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:12,090
Huh? Where did Motoki go?

452
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,120
Kamogari Keita.

453
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,830
Yes.

454
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,760
Irie Kotoko.

455
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,490
Yes.

456
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,720
Good luck.

457
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,590
Irie-kun...

458
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:48,880
I've gotten a little bit closer to you now.

459
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:59,190
I really wanted you to see it.
Me, in a nursing cap.

460
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,320
Kikyou Motoki.

461
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,220
-Yes!
-Huh?

462
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
-Motoki!
-Moto-chan!

463
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,560
Oh, it looks good on you!

464
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,610
Motoki. Why?

465
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,460
Why are you wearing this?

466
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,100
Go change now!

467
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,420
What kind of blasphemy is this at the capping ceremony?

468
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,140
Please forgive him.

469
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,910
Moto-chan worked so hard to get to this day!

470
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:34,640
Whether he's a boy or a girl,
his feelings toward patients is the same!

471
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,700
Please!

472
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,350
Kotoko...

473
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,060
Please forgive him, Sensei.

474
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,610
We're begging you.

475
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,220
Sensei,

476
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,950
I don't need it, but...please put the nurse's cap on for Motoki.

477
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,420
-That's right!
-I think its a good idea!

478
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,780
Isn't it fine!

479
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,220
It'll look good on him!

480
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,910
He'll look good in it!

481
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,790
Understood.

482
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:08,450
I'll concede defeat to everyone's intentions.
Though unprecedented, a nurse's cap for Kikyou.

483
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,380
Really?!

484
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,720
That's great, Moto-chan!

485
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,890
Thank you, Kotoko!

486
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,980
Thanks to you...

487
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,250
Thank you, everyone!

488
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,860
I love you!

489
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,320
Congratulations!

490
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,630
Good luck.

491
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,260
Thank you so much, Sensei.

492
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,030
As an exception, Moto-chan was able to
to wear a nurse's cap.

493
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:23,180
I solemnly pledge myself before God
and in the presence of this assembly

494
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,720
to pass my life in purity
and to practice my profession faithfully.

495
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,970
I shall abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous,

496
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:41,010
and shall not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug.

497
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:48,370
will do all in my power to maintain and
elevate the standard of my profession.

498
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:54,650
I will hold in confidence
all personal matters committed to my keeping

499
00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:01,720
and all family affairs coming to my knowledge
in the practice of my calling.

500
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,520
With loyalty,

501
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,260
Irie-kun...

502
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,040
will I aid the physician in his work,

503
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,580
Can you hear me?

504
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,530
I will dedicate myself

505
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:20,790
to devoted service for human welfare.

506
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:25,190
I'll do my best to help you, Irie-kun

507
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,680
In any case, Irie-kun won't be coming back today.

508
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,850
I'll stay here a little longer.

509
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:56,600
Being a nurse requires a lot of studying,
human relations, and stamina,

510
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,110
but today I feel like I can do it.

511
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:05,910
If I feel like I'm going to be crushed,
I just need to remember today...

512
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,640
Wh...who's there?

513
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,240
Don't tell me...a g..ghost?

514
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,140
Idiot.

515
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,350
Irie-kun?

516
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,170
Seriously,

517
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,770
How long are you planning to stay here?

518
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,090
What happened?

519
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:35,240
What about Nagoya?

520
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,210
I came back on the Shinkansen.

521
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:42,880
You came back for me?

522
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,630
But I didn't make it in time.

523
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,080
The florist's closed, too...

524
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,630
It's fine.

525
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,010
I don't need it.

526
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,820
Just you coming here...

527
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,940
Say it again.

528
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,920
The part that you recited.

529
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,940
With loyalty

530
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,040
will I aid the physician in his work.

531
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,050
I will dedicate myself

532
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,910
to devoted service

533
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,770
for human welfare.

534
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,050
One more time.

535
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:39,550
With loyalty will I aid the physician in his work.

536
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:42,820
I will dedicate myself

537
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,220
to devoted service

538
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:54,730
to devoted service of those committed

539
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,090
for ...

540
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:04,390
human welfare.

541
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,480
Ms. Nightingale,

542
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,560
no matter how many difficult times await us,

543
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,620
I will never forget this day.

544
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,640
Starting next week we'll be doing our practicum.

545
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,620
I'm so nervous.

546
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,500
I'm sure she is a wonderful grandma.

547
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,480
She might match you pretty well.

548
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,140
I don't care about the names of the interns.

549
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,090
She called nurse eight times in the morning.

550
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,350
She just likes to pick on interns.

551
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,840
I lost my confidence.

552
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,460
How about quitting? Being a nurse...

553
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,910
Ah, I have pain in my chest.

554
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:34,850
What's wrong, Toyo-obachan?
