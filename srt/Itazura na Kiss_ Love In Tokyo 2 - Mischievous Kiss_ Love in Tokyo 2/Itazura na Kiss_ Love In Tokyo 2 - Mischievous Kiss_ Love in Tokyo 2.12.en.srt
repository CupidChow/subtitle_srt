1
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,910
Irie-kun...

2
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:36,310
That's right. He left.

3
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,450
Irie-kun, are you doing well?

4
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,860
Have you adapted to your life there yet?

5
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,900
Irie-kun, congratulations!

6
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,080
Irie-kun passed the National Examination for
Medical Practitioners, which had been his dream.

7
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,840
It's not a bad thing, so think about it.

8
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,970
I think I'll work at a hospital in Kobe.

9
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,730
You stay here. I'll go there by myself.

10
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,230
You should stay here and study.

11
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,060
I... will definitely become a nurse in a year.

12
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,940
And then I will go to Kobe.

13
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,090
I will definitely go. So...

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,780
please wait.

15
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,350
All the best, Irie-kun!

16
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,980
So it has been 2 months since he left for Kobe.

17
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,420
All the best...Kotoko.

18
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,690
All the best...to the both of us.

19
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,260
I... I...

20
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,080
might not be able to

21
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,870
stand it any longer.

22
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,870
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in Tokyo

23
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:22,440
Nursing Practice Room
#12 - And Love in Kobe

24
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,780
Jeez, recently, she's been absent-minded.

25
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,650
Or rather,her absent-mindedness by nature got worse recently.

26
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,180
Are you getting along with Irie?

27
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,180
Of course we are!...Isn't that a given...

28
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,470
No... why are you crying, Kotoko?

29
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,130
This is pretty bad...

30
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:48,310
Don't stress yourself out. Just go see him.

31
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,410
That's right. I don't want you to make any more mistakes.

32
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,990
We are okay! Our relationship as a couple is really deep and ...

33
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,640
Men feel like being bachelors
when their wives are not around.

34
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,870
And they go on the loose.

35
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,190
Right. He is a man, you know.
If he were approached by pretty nurses and patients,

36
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,810
he would actually feel fairly pleased.

37
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,770
If Kotoko doesn't go...

38
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,230
-I could go to Kobe and approach him.
-Marina don't say that...

39
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,180
I'M FINE!!

40
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,020
Oh my.

41
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,550
So mean! Everyone is so mean!

42
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,350
Even though I really want to see Irie-kun,

43
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,220
and I've been suppressing this feeling.

44
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,630
They just keep talking about what I don't wanna think about.

45
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,310
Of course,

46
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:55,420
meeting Irie-kun, kissing him and hugging tightly ...

47
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,730
I wouldn't ask too much like that.

48
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:08,370
Even from far away, I just want to catch
a glimpse of Irie-kun.

49
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,580
From far away...a glimpse...

50
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,800
That's right!

51
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,110
I did it...such a reckless act.

52
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:38,910
But if I'm just seeing him from afar...

53
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,730
As long as I don't actually meet him...
I'm not breaking the promise, right?

54
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,680
After all...

55
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,420
After all, I feel...

56
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:00,180
out of energy~!

57
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,880
Here, this street, is where Irie-kun is.

58
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,960
We're breathing the same air.

59
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,890
Doctor Irie!

60
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,010
Doctor Numaguchi has something to discuss with you.

61
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:48,490
He's at the examination room for outpatients.

62
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,040
- Okay.
-Excuse me, then.

63
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,960
I found him! It's Irie-kun!

64
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,470
My energy level is going up now.

65
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,440
I can go back to Tokyo now...

66
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,340
It's Doctor Irie!

67
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,460
He is so handsome.

68
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,760
He is definitely the best among all the interns.

69
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,980
I wonder if he is married.

70
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,430
Here, I am his wife.

71
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,490
I heard he doesn't even have a girlfriend.

72
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,260
No way! He is definitely ... popular.

73
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:27,580
See? That's why he doesn't have to look for a girlfriend.

74
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,530
- Oh, my goodness ...
- Then, should I approach him?

75
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,050
There's no way you can get him. It's too competitive.

76
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,050
I know at least 10 people are already making a pass at him.

77
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,790
Hey, I might become the 11th.

78
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,110
It's okay.

79
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,280
Things like this used to happen all the time in Tokyo, too.

80
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,040
While I am still full of energy,

81
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,190
I should go back home now...

82
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,460
Ouch.

83
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:04,160
What a hindrance.

84
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,710
You were just standing around here. That's why!

85
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:12,370
What's this? She is like the Kansai-version
(southern-central region of Japan's main island) of Yuuki...

86
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,260
I'll have to talk to this kind of kid strictly!

87
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,580
Hey, you should say "I'm sorry" when you bump into a person.

88
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,480
Please, say it.

89
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,470
Idiot!

90
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,480
This kid...

91
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,740
Mom, I'm scared. She is like Slit Mouth Woman.

92
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,830
Hey!

93
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,860
I'm sorry. My daughter is foul-mouthed.

94
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,490
- Wow, such a pretty and young mother.
- Apologize to her.

95
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,990
Go ahead.

96
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:51,490
Sorry. You are not the Slit Mouth Woman.

97
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,090
You're so cute, it's okay.

98
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,660
Auntie, you look like Kuidaore Taro.
(the famous drum-playing doll in Osaka)

99
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,100
My goodness, Nami ...

100
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,040
She is just like it. Just like it!

101
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,910
Wait, don't run.

102
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,110
Nami-chan, you shouldn't run around in a hospital.

103
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,450
I saw an auntie who looks exactly like Kuidaore Taro.

104
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,260
Auntie who looks like Kuidaore Taro?

105
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,640
If only I'd seen her.

106
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,830
I wonder where she went...

107
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,620
Hello, Doctor.

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,430
Hello, you came.

109
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:36,650
What's with them? Do they know Irie-kun?

110
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,690
What are you doing, Nami?

111
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,700
I am sorry, Doctor. This kid...

112
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,960
Mom spends a lot of time wearing make-up when she meets Irie-sensei. Right?

113
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,670
What are you talking about?

114
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,930
That's true. Mom loves Irie-sensei.

115
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:58,850
Come on! Cut it out.

116
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,500
I'm sorry.

117
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,400
Irie-sensei ... do you have time today?

118
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,980
Yes,of course.

119
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,290
Oh, good.

120
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,220
Then, I'll see you at Central Park at 5 o'clock.

121
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,880
Okay.

122
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,390
What?

123
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,950
What? You're going on a date with Mom?

124
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,990
Yeah, kind of.

125
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:33,700
I..I...Irie-kun

126
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,270
The sun's starting to go down.

127
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,840
I'm so...

128
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,810
Why do I have to be here

129
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,140
and do such an embarrassing thing?

130
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,910
Is the doctor not coming yet?

131
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:00,230
But I have to confirm for myself what his relationship is with the married woman.

132
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,790
I can't go back even if I wanted to!

133
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,520
He's here!

134
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,980
- Doctor.
- It's Doctor Irie!

135
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,190
Sorry, I'm late.

136
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,270
No, thank you for coming, as always.

137
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,700
Irie-kun...

138
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,090
Dr. Irie, let's go to the slide!

139
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:21,900
Over there! Let's go!

140
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,020
Nami, go buy some juice with this.

141
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,530
OK, fine. I guess I'm intruding, right?

142
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,180
Can't be helped! I'll be thoughtful (and leave you alone).

143
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,810
No way!

144
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,040
Don't be thoughtful...don't!

145
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,650
What is with this mood?

146
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,020
What? What is...

147
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,450
Something must be wrong, right?

148
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,370
Irie-kun...

149
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,850
Found you!

150
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,590
Doctor Irie!

151
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,000
-Come here, quick!
-Wait, hang on!

152
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
- Please!
-Ahhhh!

153
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,000
Be quiet!
You're going to blow my cover!

154
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,620
Kotoko.

155
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,660
What are you doing?

156
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,850
The mother and daughter, their name is Shiina-san.

157
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:57,560
The daughter Nami-chan is under my care.

158
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,650
But there's another surgeon in charge of their care.

159
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,560
She seems so healthy.

160
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
Yup, she seems healthy right now, but

161
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,320
she's had heart problems since she was born.

162
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,300
Up till now, she's had several seizures.

163
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,030
Her heart...

164
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:22,050
She had an operation once when she was 5 years old but

165
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:25,580
heart procedures aren't so easy.

166
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,420
She was told that when she got older

167
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,000
there's a need for her to have another surgery.

168
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,620
The surgeon and I both

169
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,080
feel that the best time is now.

170
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:45,700
However, I heard Nami-chan's father passed away two years ago.

171
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,980
Nami-chan is thinking that during this next surgery

172
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,800
she might also die as well.

173
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,910
She's scared.

174
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,040
Her mom is also very worried.

175
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:05,700
So I was supporting them and offering them advice.

176
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,950
Oh, so that's what it was. I am so (bad).

177
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,900
Speaking of which, Irie-kun you're going to work
at the Pediatrics Department?

178
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,590
Yeah I am. You didn't know?

179
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,270
I had no idea.

180
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:26,560
I had assumed you were going to be a surgeon.

181
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,210
If I can, I'd like to become a pediatric surgeon.

182
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,580
That hospital is famous in that field.

183
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,270
I was contemplating going into the field of surgery, but

184
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,440
I was thinking over what I really wanted to do

185
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,000
and what I aim to do by becoming a doctor.

186
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,370
When I thought about that, the answer came to me quite easily.

187
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,080
What got you interested in becoming a doctor?

188
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,380
It's not a big deal.

189
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,750
What is it? What is it?

190
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm not telling you. I'm going to bed.

191
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,370
Awww...I want to hear! Tell me!

192
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,450
Good night

193
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Irie-kun in Pediatrics.

194
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,910
Might be good!

195
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,040
I'll be going now.

196
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,630
I feel bad but I can't see you off.

197
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,630
It's ok. I've fully recharged (my energy).

198
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,460
Plus I'm sure Mother and the others are worried.

199
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,250
Irie-kun, work hard ok?

200
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,580
Hey, it's the "all-you-can-eat" big sister.

201
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,990
You're with Dr. Irie again!

202
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,700
Were you with him since yesterday?

203
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,440
Nami-chan...

204
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,910
-What's your relationship with Dr Irie?
- Nami!

205
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,840
I'm sure it's impossible but I'll ask anyway.

206
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,460
Are you perhaps his girlfriend?

207
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,300
If you say a girlfriend...

208
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,840
You're being rude to her.

209
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,670
No.

210
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,590
I knew that. I thought it could never be that.

211
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:28,000
Even if you thought that, you shouldn't say it!

212
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,020
I am so sorry.

213
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,590
She is my wife.

214
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,550
What?

215
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,550
I said that she is my wife.

216
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,940
No way.

217
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,830
It is true.

218
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,420
That's a lie. I don't believe it.

219
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,880
Nami-chan.

220
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,710
But...

221
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,950
you have to marry my mom!

222
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,040
My mom is much prettier,

223
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:05,000
and her cooking is super good and...

224
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,500
Nami-chan,

225
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,080
I can't do that.

226
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,840
You're an idiot!

227
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,210
Nami-chan, don't run!

228
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,790
Nami.

229
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,870
Nami!

230
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,090
Nami!

231
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,820
That girl, on top of her father passing away,

232
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,040
she's probably nervous and sad because of her illness.

233
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,230
So she figured that, Doctor Irie, if you were her father...

234
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,370
She wanted to choose the person she looked up to the most.

235
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,940
But everything's okay.

236
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,090
I'm sure I'll be able to convince her before her surgery in three days.

237
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,620
I'll do everything I can on my side, too.

238
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,020
I will, too. Please leave it to me!

239
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,380
I will for sure convince Nami-chan to have the surgery.

240
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,090
What are you talking about?
You're heading home now, aren't you?

241
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,590
I can't leave like this!

242
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,960
You're better off going home!

243
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,840
Why? This is partly my fault, too!

244
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,960
Plus, you're attitude just earlier

245
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,250
is too blunt and direct for a child.

246
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,280
You should consider a child's feelings first and foremost.

247
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,290
It's okay, mother!

248
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,900
Even if I don't look like it, I am a nurse!

249
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,560
I've decided last night that I'm going to become a pediatric nurse in the future.

250
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,880
There is no way you can do that.

251
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,920
Then...I'll leave it to you.

252
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,980
Okay!

253
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,590
We might have to use drastic measures for her.

254
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,840
Yeeees, I am "drastic measures."

255
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,190
You didn't understand the meaning of it, did you?

256
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,840
I will convince Nami-chan with everything I have within 3 days!

257
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,310
And I'll ensure that she gets better as soon as possible.

258
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,120
And have her give up on Irie-kun.

259
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,750
Hey, I came to visit you!

260
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,750
Nami-chan?

261
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,660
Nope.

262
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,910
What did you come here for?

263
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,080
Nami-chan!

264
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,070
Hey, I thought I'd bring you flowers!

265
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,640
Well, I kinda made a mistake...
-You like flowers, right?

266
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,610
I don't want it!

267
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,620
-Well, since I got them for you...
-I don't want them.

268
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,420
I really like roses but...

269
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,870
Woof woof! Woof woof!

270
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,550
You're here again?

271
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,570
I'm here again!

272
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,340
By the way, that's more like a fox.

273
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,650
Isn't it a dog?

274
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,810
It's not a dog.

275
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,550
A dog is like this!

276
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,860
Like that?

277
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,170
You do this and say "woof woof."

278
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,910
And so this is how I ended up staying in Kobe without producing any results.

279
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:13,490
Two days passed like that.

280
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,690
Hello~

281
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,710
What? It's you again.

282
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,400
I bought taiyaki. Want to eat together?
(taiyaki: a Japanese fish-shaped cake)

283
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,000
Have you made up your mind
to have the surgery and get healthy?

284
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,170
How about you? Do you feel like breaking up with Doctor Irie?

285
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,770
That's the only thing I can't do, right?

286
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,560
What's with your Kansai-ben?
(a dialect used in Kansai region)

287
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,370
How did someone like you manage to marry Dr Irie?

288
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,730
That alone would be worth praising for.

289
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,820
Even Irie-kun...

290
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,850
couldn't resist my charm.

291
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:58,390
I said you are worth to be praised,
but I'll take my words back.

292
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,690
It was just a joke.

293
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:05,660
There were lots of difficulties leading up to
my marriage with Irie-kun, you know?

294
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,750
I can imagine.

295
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,410
I fell in love at first sight with him in the first year of high school.

296
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,700
And confessed in the third year.

297
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,520
Then one thing led to another, and I ended up
living in Irie-kun's house.

298
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,390
Eh? Sounds like everything went smoothly
for you and him. No fair!

299
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,100
Or...could it be fate?

300
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,720
Yes. Fate!

301
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,360
After that, we have slowly but surely nurtured our love.

302
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,210
Didn't you have competitions?
I'm sure he was pretty popular.

303
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,380
Well, there were some tough competitors, but

304
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,690
I chased them away with my Love Beam towards Irie-kun.

305
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,260
No one couldn't win against my passion.

306
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,370
You probably freaked everyone out.

307
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:58,600
But I'm confident that I won't lose to anyone
for my love towards Irie-kun.

308
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,950
You, too, grow up and one day
you'll fall in love with someone nice.

309
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,750
But until then, you have to save your strength
to chase that person.

310
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,800
If you do that, you can get a boyfriend like I did with Irie-kun!

311
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,340
Nami-chan,

312
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,860
what you said about your mom was just an excuse, and

313
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,060
you like Irie-kun for yourself, right?

314
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:27,270
W-what are you talking about?
It was for my mom.

315
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,730
It's okay, you can tell me.

316
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,580
Irie-kun is like Superman.

317
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,680
He comes to rescue people in need.

318
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,040
He might be only an intern,
but he is very capable as you know.

319
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,420
He would definitely help you when you need him.

320
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:54,820
I know you trust him, don't you, Nami-chan?

321
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,400
Yup.

322
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,410
But... even if I become healthy after the surgery,

323
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:05,580
he is still your husband, so...

324
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,960
I know you won't give up on him.

325
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,570
I wonder if there is a person like Irie-sensei somewhere.

326
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,590
If there is, I can bear anything.

327
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,540
Nami-chan... this is only a suggestion...

328
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,230
Shiina Nami-sama
Chirata Hiroyuki-sama
Osanai Mitsuki-sama

329
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,160
Are you sure you want to go through surgery?

330
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,620
- Yes. I'll do it.
- Really?

331
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,950
That's great!

332
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,120
Good girl, Nami. Thank you.

333
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,290
Okay, leave everything to me, Nami-chan.

334
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,450
Irie-sensei and I will do our best.

335
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,200
Right, Irie-sensei?

336
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,940
Yes.

337
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,930
You made a good decision. What happened?

338
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,610
I promised with Onee-chan that after the surgery...

339
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,250
Right?

340
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,310
Yes..

341
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,320
What are you plotting?

342
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,710
No... nothing at all.

343
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,730
It is a secret between us.

344
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,500
Yes.

345
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,700
So, thank you very much!

346
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,920
We will get started after preparations.

347
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,690
I don't know what you did, but hands down to you.

348
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,450
Irie-sensei.

349
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,770
What's the matter? Are you scared?

350
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:13,160
You'll be fine. It'll be over while you are asleep.

351
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,300
No, I'm not scared at all.

352
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,420
Because I trust you, Irie-sensei.

353
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,240
Thank you.

354
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,380
Why did you decide to become a doctor?

355
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,030
When I didn't know what I should do in the future...

356
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:40,040
and I was suffering, I remembered someone telling me,
"It'd be nice if you became a doctor."

357
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,770
And I thought it wasn't a bad idea.

358
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,440
Was that person Onee-chan?

359
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,980
She probably doesn't remember saying that anyway.

360
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,220
How's Nami?

361
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,850
She's fine.

362
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,330
Thank you very much!

363
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,080
That's a relief.

364
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,270
I'm sorry I broke our promise.

365
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,240
But don't you think I was pretty good being a pediatric nurse?

366
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,750
Oh, right.

367
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,770
Nami-chan gave me this to give to you.

368
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,790
Nami-chan! How is she doing?

369
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,840
She is doing well. It's remarkable
to see how kids recover quickly.

370
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,520
I see.

371
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,300
I wonder what she wrote.

372
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,740
"Dear Nee-chan (Kotoko),
I'm recovering quite nicely.

373
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,240
I'll go to Tokyo soon!

374
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:42,490
If you break our promise, I'll kill you."

375
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:52,220
She's scary. What did you promise her?

376
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,410
Well...um...

377
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,880
What was it?

378
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,340
Actually...

379
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,490
Yuuki to be married with Nami-chan!?

380
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,440
Well... because she said
she would like someone just like Irie-kun...

381
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,140
but I can't let her have you.

382
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:20,060
Also she agreed to have the surgery, so I was really excited.

383
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,090
So, I couldn't take it back anymore ...

384
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,480
So...

385
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,500
So you promised that?

386
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,690
You are an idiot! Such a liar!

387
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,850
How can you make a promise you can't keep?

388
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,110
How are you going to explain this to Nami-chan?

389
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:47,470
That's why... I was counting on genius Irie-kun to solve this...

390
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,230
There is no way to solve this.

391
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,530
Don't you feel sorry for her?

392
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,620
I thought you were supporting her.

393
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:59,050
That's why... I feel terrible about that.

394
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:03,110
But I thought she'll forget soon enough.

395
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,130
This is so awkward, but we must say goodbye now.

396
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,060
Bye.

397
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,200
Thanks for seeing me off.

398
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,120
Why am I always...

399
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,720
...being this way.

400
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,620
You must definitely pass the National Nursing Exam in one try.

401
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,480
Irie-kun!

402
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,030
I..

403
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:03,150
I'll do my best!

404
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,260
Wait for me, Irie-kun.

405
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,710
I'll become the best nurse in Japan, who is right for you.

406
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,900
108 days until the National Nursing Exam

407
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,210
Seasons have passed after that;
summer came and went,

408
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,390
and fall has passed...

409
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,640
[ Until National Nursing Exam... 1 day! ]
( Wait for me, Irie-kun )

410
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:07,090
I'm not sure if I can endure this long winter safely.

411
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,000
Okay!

412
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,590
[After two weeks]

413
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,330
Results of National Nursing Exam

414
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:28,670
National Nursing Exam
Result announcement (bulletin)

415
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,750
Alright. It's 2 o'clock.

416
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,810
Hey, Kotoko. Hurry.

417
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:44,060
No! I can't look!

418
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,020
- Wait!
- Kotoko-chan, it's okay!

419
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,530
Didn't you study hard?

420
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,640
But Mother, my examination number

421
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,240
is 794!

422
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,200
I'll cry! 
Pun: 7 "NA" 9 "KU" 4 "YO" = I'll cry! (Like a bad omen)

423
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,730
Is that so? Oh my...

424
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,360
Okay, okay. So you're number is 00794?

425
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,350
I look for it for you.

426
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,300
I passed!

427
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,010
My number's here, too!

428
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,920
-Mine, too!
-Mine, too!

429
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,760
Moto-chan, Marina, Keita and even Tomoko-chan...

430
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,590
I see.

431
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,640
Everyone passed.

432
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,010
I passed!

433
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,740
- Woohoo!
- Congratulations!

434
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:02,570
That's awesome! Whether it was a miracle
or by chance, passing is passing!

435
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,060
You passing in one try really is a miracle.

436
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,580
You actually had Irie sit your exam, didn't you!

437
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,140
How mean!

438
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,800
I think it would be good for you to study for five years.

439
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,960
For the patients' sake.

440
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,450
Hmm. That's right.

441
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,330
Jinx!

442
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,910
Not you, too, Fathers!

443
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,700
But still,

444
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,690
with this, everyone are nurses!

445
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,950
I'm so glad!

446
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,400
Let's celebrate!

447
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,830
Yeah!

448
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,840
The long winter ended

449
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:54,260
and my long awaited spring is here.

450
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,660
But...

451
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,270
The number you have dialed is unavailable,

452
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:04,270
please leave a message after the tone...

453
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,580
No matter how many times I call,
it won't go through.

454
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,210
Oh why?!

455
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,150
Is he working a night-shift!?

456
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,160
Even though I passed!

457
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,860
I don't want to say this kind of thing through voicemail!

458
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,790
Alright.

459
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,600
I'll go to Kobe,

460
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,190
then meet Irie-kun and announce it in person!

461
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,300
Kotoko-chan, are you sure you're okay? Do you remember how to get there?

462
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,020
I'm alright.

463
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,140
Irie-kun, my first appearance as a nurse!

464
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,490
Wait for me!

465
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:11,220
So cold.

466
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,960
Why did it turn out like this?

467
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,550
I came on the last train but he's not here...

468
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,630
Jeez...

469
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,780
I have no idea...

470
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,850
I don't have a map so I don't know which direction...

471
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,680
I don't have my phone so I can't call either...

472
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,480
And it's cold, too.

473
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,800
Can such a horrible day even exist?

474
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,360
There's nothing I can do about it.

475
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,820
Tonight, I'll just do what that drunk guy is doing.

476
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,550
Excuse me, Mister?

477
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,230
I'm not really used to this, but

478
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,140
I'm not really sure how to act around you so I might come across as rude.

479
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,110
But would you let me stay here for the night?

480
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,710
I'm sorry if I'm noisy.

481
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:24,360
It's my first time sleeping outside.

482
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:27,770
Please don't mind what I'm wearing.

483
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:30,580
It's not cosplay or anything.

484
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,390
There's a lot going on so...

485
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,070
There's really so much...

486
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,330
Will you hear me out?

487
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:46,480
Ah, it's okay if you fall asleep. I'll just talk by myself.

488
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,140
My husband is a very excellent doctor and

489
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,200
he's working in the hospital here.

490
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,910
So, I worked and worked my butt off in Tokyo to become a nurse and finally today...

491
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,610
no, yesterday...

492
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,380
I passed the National Nursing Examination!

493
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,440
And then, Irie--- ah...

494
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,830
I wanted to tell my husband the most,

495
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,680
I took the bullet train in a hurry.

496
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,850
I thought I'd surprise him when we met, so I am wearing this.

497
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,570
But I met a person who suddenly became ill on the train,

498
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,060
and I entrusted the person to the parademics at Shin-Osaka

499
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:29,370
and the train had left!

500
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,180
What is more, I left my coat on the train,

501
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,080
AND my phone and map was left inside!

502
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,000
I pulled myself together and took the next train

503
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,820
but it didn't stop at Shin-Kobe...

504
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:49,090
It was really like a nightmare!

505
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:59,050
Hey! Don't laugh! After all I'm...

506
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,690
That was a big ordeal, wasn't it.

507
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,060
Hey.

508
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,100
- Iri--
- What the heck do you mean by 'please sleep'?

509
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,590
You're voice was too loud.

510
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,190
These past three days, I haven't slept because of surgeries.

511
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:31,170
Even though I thought I'd be the one to surprise you...

512
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,260
I was surprised alright, with what you're wearing.

513
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,390
W-w-why...

514
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,410
are you in this kind of place?

515
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:43,640
Mom contacted the hospital.

516
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,060
She said you were coming here but you'd definitely get lost on the streets,

517
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,170
so she told me to meet you at the train station.

518
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,580
But who knew, instead of on the streets, you got lost on the train...

519
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,310
Why do you always come without informing me?

520
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,560
Because, Irie-kun...

521
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,980
I couldn't talk to you on the phone or leave a message.

522
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:15,860
Not only that, I wanted to tell you

523
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:20,200
as soon as possible.

524
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,230
I'll finally be able to work with you.

525
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,360
You worked hard for one whole year.

526
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,390
Umm...

527
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:43,750
Irie-kun!

528
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,440
You look pretty good in that.

529
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,990
♫ The world is brighter because you are in it. ♫

530
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,880
- I got off the train at Shin-Osaka.
- You alaready told me.

531
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:05,690
I left my coat and cellphone in the train.

532
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,270
You told me that too.

533
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:12,210
That was me talking to the old man.
You know, in Okayama...

534
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,390
You were explaining better before than now.

535
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,640
I know, right?

536
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,570
I asked about the train to Shin-kobe,
but they said the last train already left.

537
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:23,970
You already told me.

538
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:30,480
I didn't even know where the platform for Shin-Kobe...

539
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,870
♫ Just to hear you say 'Good morning' ♫

540
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:54,220
♫ feel like we'll stay happy together forever. ♫

541
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:04,760
♫ I never knew this could be happening to me,
but thank you, my love.  ♫

542
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,870
♫ I kissed you with an indifferent expression ♫

543
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:17,200
♫ But i'm the only one feeling it ♫

544
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,580
♫ I love you with my all, ♫

545
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,870
♫ no matter what you're like. ♫

546
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:33,930
♫ The love that understands all ♫

547
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:43,210
♫ we'll make that happen together.
So that we don't get separated ♫

548
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:50,040
♫ embrace me please ♫

549
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,720
~Next on Mischeievous Kiss 2~
Hospital in Kobe...

550
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,400
has no opening, so I can't go?

551
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,110
Irie-kun!

552
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,280
I'll teach you all about injections.

553
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,010
- Right.
- You might be a nuisance to Irie-sensei.

554
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,110
If it's Kotoko, you can overcome flowers and storms!

555
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,090
You are right. I have to hang in there.

556
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:28,810
Finally, we can work together here.
I'll be right there. I need to suture the blood vessel here.

557
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,950
- I can't, Irie-kun!
- Kotoko!

558
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,710
Change into scrubs now.
