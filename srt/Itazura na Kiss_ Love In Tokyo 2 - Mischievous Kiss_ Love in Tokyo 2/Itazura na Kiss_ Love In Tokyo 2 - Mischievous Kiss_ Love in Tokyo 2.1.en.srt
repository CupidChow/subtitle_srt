1
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:26,268
Excuse me, Madam.

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,500
Madam.

3
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:31,951
Would you like something to drink?

4
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,751
Oh, yes.

5
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:35,851
- Are you OK?
- Yes. Excuse me.

6
00:00:35,893 --> 00:00:39,543
We have coffee, tea, Japanese tea,
and orange juice.

7
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,618
Then, coffee...

8
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:45,501
Coffee, please!

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,800
Certainly, Madam.

10
00:00:58,476 --> 00:00:59,350
Here you are.

11
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,370
Thank you.

12
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,385
Why are you speaking English when you don't speak it?

13
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:16,026
Oh dear, I didn't know you were awake.

14
00:01:16,026 --> 00:01:20,051
We're going to Okinawa,
you don't need to speak English.

15
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,951
Because this is my first time flying.

16
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:28,626
When it comes to flights, it's:
"Attention, please! Coffee or tea?"

17
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:30,968
Ugh. You're getting carried away.

18
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:37,460
Of course, I am. It's our honeymoon!

19
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,985
Yes, we're on our honeymoon...

20
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:45,460
to Okinawa!

21
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,710
And sitting here next to me

22
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:54,051
is the person that I've loved for a long time: Irie-kun!

23
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:00,735
What?

24
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:09,026
We really got married!

25
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:12,260
It's really starting to dawn on me now.

26
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,626
How many times do you have to
look at those pictures?

27
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:17,026
I'm gonna take a nap.

28
00:02:17,026 --> 00:02:20,093
Are you sleeping?
It's our honeymoon.

29
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:25,968
My mom's set up our wedding and
this honeymoon without asking me.

30
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:28,501
I'm tired.

31
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,343
Are you on your honeymoon?

32
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:33,401
The girl who laughed at me earlier.

33
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,151
Yes.

34
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:37,168
So are we! Right?

35
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:38,351
Hi.

36
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:42,351
Oh, did your husband fall asleep?

37
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:47,735
Poor you, it's your
long-awaited honeymoon.

38
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:52,126
I'd never fall asleep and leave
Mari-chan alone.

39
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,151
You have such a sweet husband.

40
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:59,218
'Cause Takumi-kun is madly in love with me.

41
00:02:59,218 --> 00:03:01,293
Madly in love...

42
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:06,501
The day Mari-chan joined our company,
I felt, "She the one!"

43
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:07,843
It was just a boring office romance.

44
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:09,485
What do you mean boring?

45
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:12,385
And you?

46
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:15,143
I'm Kotoko. Iri...

47
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,051
I'm Kotoko Irie.

48
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,060
Your husband proposed to you?

49
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,463
N-No! Never! No way!

50
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:24,671
What?

51
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,546
For us, I'd say...

52
00:03:27,546 --> 00:03:35,109
I was the one who tried and
pushed him like crazy.

53
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:36,701
Tonan High School
Entrance Ceremony

54
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:44,118
All the way back at the High School Entrance Ceremony
it was love at first sight.

55
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:46,062
I love you.

56
00:03:46,062 --> 00:03:48,053
I don't want it.

57
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,170
I'm sorry for what happend to you.

58
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,870
I'm the eldest son, Naoki.
Nice to meet you.

59
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,687
Will you keep you're distance from me?

60
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:02,887
I hate stupid girls.

61
00:04:02,887 --> 00:04:04,678
Kotoko.

62
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:09,245
What?

63
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:13,087
You may not know me, but I know you.

64
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:17,420
I was attracted to your intelligence and good looks
at the Entrance Ceremony.

65
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,337
I'll...

66
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:24,053
I'll stop loving you.

67
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:26,712
I'll see if you can do that.

68
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:34,328
Serves you right.

69
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:39,128
Yuki-kun! Yuki-kun! Hold on!

70
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,370
Papa! Are you all right!?

71
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,253
I'll protect my dad's company.

72
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,462
This is Mr. Oizumi,
the chairman of Hokueisha.

73
00:04:59,462 --> 00:05:04,028
How about having
a marriage interview?

74
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:09,445
I'll snatch Kotoko away from you.

75
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:12,953
I'll make you forget that bastard.

76
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,153
No! Stop! Irie-kun!

77
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,053
You love me!

78
00:05:22,337 --> 00:05:26,228
You can never love anyone but me.

79
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:32,353
How could you be so confident!?

80
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:36,845
Yeah, you're right, you're right! I can't help it!

81
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:42,153
But you don't even love me!
You don't even...

82
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,512
I love you so much.

83
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,953
Serves you right.

84
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,353
And so...

85
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:13,345
My 6 year-long one-sided love
finally ended with our marriage

86
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:16,045
and here we are.

87
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:19,253
You were quite patient, Kotoko-san.

88
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,353
Oh my, what am I...

89
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:23,287
You came from behind to win at destiny.

90
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,728
Yeah, maybe.

91
00:06:24,728 --> 00:06:28,745
So you pushed and pushed and
pushed him down into the bed? Right on!

92
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:34,853
No way! We have yet to go
that far...that far...

93
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:40,853
Last night, he said he was tired and so just fell asleep.

94
00:06:40,853 --> 00:06:42,953
Wait, so you mean...

95
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:48,303
You're kidding!
You haven't has sex with him yet?

96
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:52,903
It's really rare nowadays.

97
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:56,028
But, aren't you nervous?

98
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,853
What?

99
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:02,103
I would be shocked if my partner
didn't want me as a woman.

100
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:05,453
I might wonder if I'm not attractive.

101
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:07,353
Well...

102
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:13,362
Are you guys OK? Please don't
end up being a Narita airport divorced.

103
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:17,800
Oops, it's not Narita.
It's Haneda.

104
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,970
My bad.

105
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:26,020
Narita... divorce...!?

106
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:30,353
I feel I'm a bit tired.
Takumi-kun, give me a shoulder massage.

107
00:07:30,353 --> 00:07:32,487
Yes, gladly.

108
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,553
Na... Narita divorce...!?

109
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:43,728
How dare she say that to me
on the first day of our honeymoon!

110
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:35,303
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in OKINAWA

111
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,395
What's up?

112
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,153
My sunglasses.

113
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:43,653
Sunglasses? I thought you were
night-blind.

114
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:47,053
Night-blind people
feel brightness, too.

115
00:09:48,145 --> 00:09:49,637
Let's see...

116
00:09:50,553 --> 00:09:52,078
Wait till we get to the hotel.

117
00:09:52,097 --> 00:09:55,456
I wanna wear them right now.

118
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,839
It doesn't open..

119
00:09:58,964 --> 00:10:00,406
Yeah, right.

120
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:04,089
What, maybe the lock is broken?

121
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:09,447
You don't wanna break that.

122
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:19,064
It's open, Irie-kun!

123
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:26,972
You wear that?

124
00:10:26,972 --> 00:10:30,172
No! I never wear
this kind of swimsuit!

125
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:33,406
I wonder who would wear
this kind of showy stuff.

126
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:36,972
Hey! That's mine!

127
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:45,347
Is that... mine?

128
00:10:56,547 --> 00:11:01,289
I'm so glad that we're staying
at the same hotel!

129
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:07,347
Why in the world do we have to stay
at the same hotel with this woman!?

130
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:11,006
Hey after this why don't we have
a meal together?

131
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:13,731
Irie-kun! Let's hurry and go to our room!

132
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,389
Excuse us, please.

133
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:21,997
So finally, it's just the two of us.

134
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:24,197
Kotoko!

135
00:11:24,197 --> 00:11:27,489
I'm sorry! Are you alright?
Are you hurt?

136
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,247
I'm fine.

137
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:34,347
Go... Minam?

138
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,400
Minam ...

139
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,981
Are you Go Minam of the A. N. JELL?

140
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:46,906
Kang Shin-woo... Jeremy...?!

141
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:47,947
Yup, we are.

142
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:48,989
(Chinese) I'm Go Minam.

143
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:49,947
Kang Shin-woo.

144
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:51,414
Jeremy.

145
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:58,789
Oh my gosh! It's A. N. JELL!
The popular band from Taiwan!

146
00:11:58,789 --> 00:11:59,747
From Taiwan?

147
00:11:59,747 --> 00:12:03,172
I love these guys!

148
00:12:04,522 --> 00:12:05,656
Sorry for the trouble.

149
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:09,189
We're OK thanks to you.

150
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:13,139
Please ask them why
they're in Okinawa.

151
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,206
You do it.

152
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:17,106
But, I don't speak their language.

153
00:12:17,106 --> 00:12:18,589
Come on.

154
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:20,781
Why are you guys in Okinawa?

155
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,331
To shoot a music video.

156
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:24,697
Okinawa is awesome!

157
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,356
What? What did they say?

158
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:29,097
They're here to shoot a music video.

159
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:35,239
Really? That's so cool!

160
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:37,872
Have a nice trip.

161
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,647
Bye-bye.

162
00:12:39,647 --> 00:12:40,647
Best wishes.

163
00:12:40,647 --> 00:12:43,997
Wow, thank you!

164
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,031
Bye-bye!

165
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,639
- Let's go.
- Ok!

166
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,447
Fantastic! How fantastic!

167
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:10,664
It's the ocean! Amazing. And blue sky!

168
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:14,439
Okinawa! We're in Okinawa, Irie-kun!

169
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:17,097
Calm down a bit.

170
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:26,696
It's like a princess bed.

171
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:29,390
I can roll over and over!

172
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,920
Hey, look, Irie-kun!

173
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:40,087
Wait. Tonight in this bed...

174
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:42,487
with Irie-kun...

175
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:50,046
I will truly become one
with Irie-kun.

176
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:00,987
Irie-kun...

177
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:01,987
Yeah?

178
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,654
Um...

179
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:10,187
I'll do my best to become
a good wife, so...

180
00:14:10,187 --> 00:14:13,029
So, please don't give up on me.

181
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:20,087
You were caught up with
A. N. JELL a few minutes ago.

182
00:14:20,087 --> 00:14:21,687
What?

183
00:14:23,554 --> 00:14:25,104
Nothing.

184
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,200
I don't expect too much.

185
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,290
Just stay as you are.

186
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,162
Stay as you are.

187
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:09,662
Hello?

188
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:13,387
Hello? Naoki-san? It's me! Mari!

189
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:18,112
Naoki-san, Naoki-san! Kotoko-san!
Over here!

190
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:20,446
We saved seats for you!

191
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:24,387
How dare she repeat
his name like they're dating!

192
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:28,112
Naoki-san! Right here!
We saved seats for you guys!

193
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:30,071
Hi.

194
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:32,762
They said you can have drinks at the poolside.

195
00:15:32,762 --> 00:15:35,262
Naoki-san, let's go order together!

196
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:37,660
- Ok, then let me...
- Sure.

197
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,510
Let's go.

198
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,279
Please excuse her,
I guess she likes Naoki-san.

199
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,171
Hey, Takumi-san! ...is it right?

200
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:56,779
What kind of discipline
are you giving your wife!?

201
00:15:57,554 --> 00:16:02,187
If you know what's going on,
stop her! Aren't you her husband?

202
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:06,329
Yeah, but my love was one-sided
for a long time,

203
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:08,254
It's like I finally got her to marry me.

204
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:12,804
Why are you talking
You guys are married aren't you? Your status is equal!

205
00:16:12,804 --> 00:16:14,987
It's 50/50!

206
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:18,896
Stupid Kotoko.
How can you say something like that?

207
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:27,887
I think I just heard
Yuki-kun's voice.

208
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,529
It looks like those two are getting along.

209
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,312
So we should hang out too!

210
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:42,487
Hey! She's being all clingy to Irie-kun!

211
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,460
Oh, no.

212
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:49,562
- It's so cold!
- Are you all right?

213
00:16:49,562 --> 00:16:51,821
I will bring you a towel immediately.

214
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:55,430
What the heck!?

215
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,604
Oh, I'm sorry.

216
00:16:57,604 --> 00:16:59,754
Hey, what are you doing?

217
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,812
Good work! Ms. Blonde!

218
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,854
Mari-chan, are you OK?

219
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,087
Are you OK, Mari-chan?

220
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,270
This is terrible.

221
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,780
Sorry very much.

222
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,700
It was my mistake.

223
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,080
Hey, Mom, come on.

224
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,840
Let's go to the beach.

225
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,010
Sandy, wait.

226
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,210
Sorry.

227
00:17:28,096 --> 00:17:32,062
Wait a minute, those people

228
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:37,404
are foreigners.

229
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:43,687
Wow, so you're a future doctor?

230
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,712
No, I'm just aspiring
to be a doctor.

231
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:49,562
Even just aspiring to that is fantastic.

232
00:17:49,562 --> 00:17:54,087
Irie-kun, will, without problem
get into medical school!

233
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:57,787
Because he has an IQ of 200!

234
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:02,954
You two got married after Kotoko pushed violently, right?

235
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,687
Violent?

236
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:10,479
Because. You're from a completely different world than me.

237
00:18:10,479 --> 00:18:14,610
You two are married, and
you still call him "Irie-kun."

238
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,280
It's funny!

239
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,521
So you're not close enough to call him by name?

240
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:19,612
Mari-chan!

241
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:23,929
It's just a habit after many years.

242
00:18:28,171 --> 00:18:31,946
Oh, after only that little alcohol.

243
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:49,371
Kotoko, we're back in our room.

244
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:58,404
Hey, Kotoko.

245
00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:15,087
Wife, we're back in our room.

246
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:28,521
Irie-kun...

247
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:30,871
I love you.

248
00:19:37,612 --> 00:19:39,546
Day 2

249
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,487
It's Shisa! So cute!

250
00:19:45,487 --> 00:19:47,771
Let's have a picture taken with him.

251
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,412
No way.

252
00:19:48,412 --> 00:19:50,387
Let's ask somebody
to take a picture!

253
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:52,421
Let's see...

254
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:57,187
Excuse me, could you take
a picture of us?

255
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,710
Of course. That's okay.

256
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:03,887
Thank you! I appreciate it.

257
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,846
Here we go! Irie-kun!

258
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:11,010
Get more closer to each other!

259
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,480
Yes, yes. Pretty.
(speaking broken English)

260
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,550
Oh, no, boy. Look, look.

261
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,890
Look at me and smile, smile.

262
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,780
Viva!

263
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,110
Say, Chinsuko!

264
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,480
Yes!

265
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:25,821
Thank you very much!

266
00:20:25,821 --> 00:20:26,562
Is it okay?

267
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:29,480
Yes, this is great! Thank you!

268
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,440
Okay.

269
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,290
Come on!

270
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,680
Oh, Bob. Sorry.

271
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,280
Oh, sorry.

272
00:20:43,087 --> 00:20:45,987
I've seen those guys somewhere.

273
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,229
We were at the pool together!

274
00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:55,110
They're the people that were at the pool yesterday!

275
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,700
We came to the same place. What a coincidence!

276
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,487
Not surprising. This is a recommend spot!

277
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:07,021
That was so much fun! I'm starving.

278
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:09,621
Let's eat!

279
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:12,062
Oh, what a coincidence!

280
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:17,054
Can we have lunch with you?
Excuse me!

281
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,460
- What have you been doing today?
- We just saw the Eisa show.

282
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,490
Eisa show?

283
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,287
Cool! We're going to see it after this!
We're so excited, aren't we, Takumi-kun?

284
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:24,929
Did you enjoy it, Naoki?

285
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:26,862
Yes, we did!

286
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:44,662
Say, Cheese!

287
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,088
Day 3

288
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:53,713
What is this? How colorful these fish are!

289
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:57,388
Irie-kun, a coconut crab!
Do you think this tastes good?

290
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,280
Excuse me! Can I have this?

291
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,180
Yes.

292
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:05,260
Let me show you to the second floor.

293
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,950
Let's go.

294
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:14,655
Naoki-san! This way!

295
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:17,380
Hurry, we got seats for you!

296
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,580
Hurry, Naoki-san!

297
00:22:21,421 --> 00:22:22,663
Day 4

298
00:22:22,663 --> 00:22:26,355
Naoki-san!

299
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:30,246
Hurry, Naoki-san! Over here!

300
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:34,446
Can you see me? Hurry up!
I'm waiting for you!

301
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:37,205
Naoki-san!

302
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:44,246
Why the heck does
she get in the way every day?!

303
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:46,921
Day 5

304
00:22:49,955 --> 00:22:52,230
Voila! This is the main-temple.

305
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,540
They say this was a Ryukyuan castle long ago.

306
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,055
1, 2, 3... 3 dragons!
I wonder why it's not Shisa!

307
00:22:58,055 --> 00:22:59,738
A bright red castle!

308
00:22:59,738 --> 00:23:02,896
Naoki-san, what's your favorite color?

309
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:07,713
Day 6

310
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,846
You're kidding, right?

311
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:22,046
All of a sudden, all of a sudden...

312
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:28,880
it's our last day in Okinawa!

313
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:33,038
Tonight is the end.

314
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,246
We're heading back
to Tokyo tomorrow.

315
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:40,563
But we haven't made any progress
in our relationship.

316
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:46,588
It's all because that couple
bothers us every day.

317
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:50,755
Every night they invite us for drinks.

318
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:52,571
Cool. I wonder if it's the same as mine.

319
00:23:52,571 --> 00:23:55,305
Oh look we have the same marriage line.

320
00:23:55,305 --> 00:23:57,013
You have two lines of fate!

321
00:23:57,013 --> 00:23:59,346
Another round!

322
00:23:59,346 --> 00:24:04,530
I know it's partially my fault that I drink
even when I have a low tolerance.

323
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,438
Thanks to all that, we're still
far away from anything romance.

324
00:24:12,438 --> 00:24:17,163
Please don't end up being
a Narita divorced.

325
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:25,146
What if we continued on with nothing happening?

326
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:30,821
My dear Kotoko-chan! I expect a lot from you!

327
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:35,130
For my mom's sake, and for my sake!

328
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,888
I'll never go back to Tokyo
like this!

329
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,771
Tonight!

330
00:24:43,446 --> 00:24:49,255
We will definitely have
a true bridal night!

331
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,671
Wow, it's a whale shark! So huge!

332
00:24:59,671 --> 00:25:02,930
Tonight, I will definitely...

333
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:25,955
Look, Irie-kun!
What a beautiful chapel!

334
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:31,338
Good smile both of you!
OK, are you ready?

335
00:25:31,338 --> 00:25:34,280
Say, Cheese!

336
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,055
OK, let's take another one.
Looks good! Say, Cheese!

337
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:42,180
And another one. Say, Cheese!

338
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:48,130
Now, sir, please put your hand
gently on your wife's shoulder.

339
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,338
Looks great! Good smile, Madam!

340
00:25:51,338 --> 00:25:56,330
Sir, give me a smile! Smile please!
Say, Cheese!

341
00:25:57,971 --> 00:26:02,855
Lucky us, we could have
our photo without reservation.

342
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:06,746
It reminds me of
our wedding ceremony!

343
00:26:06,746 --> 00:26:10,821
Ugh. I'm never gonna do this again.

344
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:12,380
Thank you so much.

345
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,446
No problem. We were expecting another newlywed
couple for a photoshoot so it was perfect.

346
00:26:17,446 --> 00:26:19,646
Newlywed couple...?

347
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:22,688
I guess they're here, the newlyweds.

348
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:25,120
This way, please.

349
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:30,746
Oh! You two were here?

350
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:33,538
We met again.

351
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:34,746
You know each other?

352
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:36,446
Yes. Kind of.

353
00:26:36,446 --> 00:26:38,646
Naoki-san, you look so handsome.

354
00:26:38,646 --> 00:26:43,980
I bet it's because you're tall!
Look our height is perfect for each other.

355
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,755
Oh! While we're at it, maybe I'll take photos
with Naoki-san too!

356
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,046
Nah, I think not.

357
00:26:48,046 --> 00:26:52,230
Kotoko-san, I'd lend you Takumi-kun.
What do you think, Naoki-san?

358
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,246
Sorry, but we need to go now.

359
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:57,646
We're going to buy souvenirs, right?

360
00:26:57,646 --> 00:26:59,096
Y... yes.

361
00:26:59,096 --> 00:27:01,021
Let's go, Kotoko.

362
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,780
Yes.

363
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,246
Wait for me, Irie-kun!

364
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:28,979
What happened?

365
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:32,629
Mari... Mari...

366
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:43,429
It hurts.

367
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,754
Early, she said her stomach
suddenly started hurting.

368
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:48,629
Why don't you take her
to the hospital?

369
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:52,646
It's the weekend, and
it's probably too late.

370
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,021
Then call an ambulance!

371
00:27:54,021 --> 00:27:58,129
She doesn't want to make this serious.

372
00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:04,096
It'll get better if I keep
lying down. Oh, it hurts!

373
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:08,346
Mari-chan! Are you OK? Are you OK?

374
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,704
Naoki-san! You said you wanna be
a doctor, right?

375
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:13,771
Can you do anything?

376
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,979
No way! Though he aspires to
be a doctor, he is still...

377
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:21,513
Okay. I'll take a look.

378
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:23,629
Does she have nausea?

379
00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:24,954
No.

380
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:25,746
Fever?

381
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,554
Not particularly.

382
00:28:28,771 --> 00:28:31,429
Let me check your pulse.

383
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,229
Naoki-san, is Mari going to be OK?

384
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:42,429
Where does it hurt?
Let me see your stomach.

385
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:52,213
No, Irie-kun! Don't touch her!

386
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:55,629
Hey, I think we should call
an ambulance.

387
00:28:55,629 --> 00:28:57,138
It depends on her condition.

388
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:59,254
Then what about our dinner?

389
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:00,960
This is not the time for that!

390
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,350
It hurts...

391
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:10,688
No! Don't touch her, Irie-kun!

392
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:12,629
Don't touch another girl!

393
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:15,171
That's enough!

394
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,220
You married a guy who wants to be a doctor.

395
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,079
Be a bit more self-conscious.

396
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,271
Irie-kun.

397
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:28,571
Are you always going to be that way
when I see patients?

398
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:32,129
I don't want to deal something so pathetic.

399
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:36,754
If you don't understand,
I can't be with you.

400
00:29:36,754 --> 00:29:40,104
Naoki, you're going too far...

401
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,729
Kotoko-san!

402
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,429
You don't have to
go after your wife?

403
00:29:59,429 --> 00:30:03,604
Your wife's alright. I assume
she's got mild food poisoning.

404
00:30:03,604 --> 00:30:09,804
The pharmacy is still open, give her
some stomach medicine and that should do it.

405
00:30:09,804 --> 00:30:10,829
Thank you so much.

406
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:12,821
Takumi-kun, go buy it for me.

407
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:16,288
Yeah, sure. I'll be back soon.

408
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:19,271
You should go find your wife.

409
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:21,538
Takumi-kun, hurry up!

410
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:23,879
Yes, then...

411
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:28,629
So, I'm off here.

412
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:30,888
Naoki-san, you're so cold.

413
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:34,229
I guess it can't be helped as Kotoko-san as your partner.

414
00:30:34,229 --> 00:30:36,663
Maybe you don't really love her.

415
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:41,521
I thought you had a stomach ache.

416
00:30:41,521 --> 00:30:43,429
I made it up.

417
00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:44,446
You made it up?

418
00:30:44,446 --> 00:30:48,796
Because I wanted to be alone with you.

419
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:52,879
I heard you guys haven't had
anything sexual yet.

420
00:30:52,879 --> 00:30:55,229
Well, it's understandable.

421
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:59,529
You don't even really want to touch Kotoko-san, right?

422
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:03,013
I fell in love with you
at first sight.

423
00:31:03,013 --> 00:31:07,138
I wish I had met you before she did.

424
00:31:07,138 --> 00:31:11,588
Then both of us wouldn't have
had to make mistakes in our marriages.

425
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:14,963
It's not too late.

426
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:16,421
Shut up.

427
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:18,271
What?

428
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:26,071
If I met a woman like you 100 times,
I would ignore you 100 times!

429
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:27,529
What...

430
00:31:32,688 --> 00:31:35,729
Do not compare yourself with Kotoko.

431
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:38,963
Sorry, sorry, I forgot my wallet.

432
00:31:41,438 --> 00:31:43,388
What happend, Mari-chan?

433
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:46,154
Naoki-san seemed angry.

434
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,163
I'm not gonna forgive him.

435
00:31:51,488 --> 00:31:54,138
He made a fool of me.

436
00:31:56,329 --> 00:31:57,446
Mari-chan?

437
00:31:57,446 --> 00:31:59,446
I'll definitely break them up!

438
00:31:59,446 --> 00:32:02,988
He didn't have to be that mean!

439
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:03,929
What are you doing?

440
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:05,029
That's my line!

441
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,530
Why do I have to get hit? I gave you a marriage!

442
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,554
We're finished! We're splitting up!

443
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,338
You're right!

444
00:32:12,338 --> 00:32:14,696
We started off with
my one-sided love!

445
00:32:14,696 --> 00:32:18,638
But now we're married, we're
at the same level.

446
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:22,788
You're my wife! Don't look
at other guys!

447
00:32:24,829 --> 00:32:26,729
Do you understand?

448
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:33,229
Yes.

449
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,021
I'm so stupid.

450
00:32:45,021 --> 00:32:48,238
I'm so embarrassed that
I want to die.

451
00:32:48,238 --> 00:32:53,938
I thought I understood Irie-kun's
ambition to become a doctor.

452
00:33:02,596 --> 00:33:05,404
Where am I?

453
00:33:07,663 --> 00:33:11,829
I'm totally lost, aren't I.

454
00:33:11,829 --> 00:33:15,363
I don't remember how and
where I came from.

455
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:18,796
I left my wallet at the hotel.

456
00:33:18,796 --> 00:33:23,629
Feels like I came to a sketchy part of town.

457
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,410
Hey, excuse me.

458
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,320
Can I help you?

459
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,138
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

460
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,763
I'm going to be kidnapped!

461
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:43,313
What if I get kidnapped and
never see Irie-kun again!

462
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:47,229
Irie-kun, help me!

463
00:33:47,229 --> 00:33:51,054
Irie-kun!

464
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:54,829
Irie-kun, I love you!

465
00:33:54,829 --> 00:34:00,363
I didn't want a Narita divorce!

466
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,130
- Don't worry. It's ok.
-No!

467
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,138
- Hey, I will take you there.
- Help me ...!

468
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:07,020
What is she doing?

469
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,910
Don't worry.

470
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:10,920
I'll help you out.

471
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,330
Hey, what's the matter with my wife?

472
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,330
Your wife?

473
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:18,920
- Irie-kun!
-Kotoko.

474
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:25,996
I thought I would never
see you again!

475
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:31,188
I thought you will
never find me.

476
00:34:31,188 --> 00:34:34,171
Everything is okay.

477
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:42,363
He thought you were a lost elementary
school student and tried to help you.

478
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:45,029
An elementary school student?

479
00:34:45,029 --> 00:34:47,329
So, he is not a bad guy?

480
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:50,770
Anyway, apologize.

481
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,880
I'm sorry.

482
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,100
Okay, okay, okay.

483
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,860
Don't worry, don't worry.

484
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,260
It's okay, thank you.
You guys are nice.

485
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,250
Good luck.

486
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:05,260
I wish you guys can enjoy your
fantastic and good, amazing honeymoon.

487
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:07,340
Thank you.

488
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,040
Have a nice day, thank you.

489
00:35:22,379 --> 00:35:26,304
Thanks for coming.

490
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:29,588
Your screams were real loud.

491
00:35:29,588 --> 00:35:31,529
Because...

492
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:36,038
Narita divorce... how classic.

493
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:40,980
If you're gonna say that it would be a Haneda divorce, right?

494
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,640
Really ...

495
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,238
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:50,329
I was jealous.

497
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:55,738
I was being selfish,
I was being so stupid.

498
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:59,463
You fool,
I really worried about you.

499
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,821
Splendid!

500
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:20,988
I was right to buy
this fantastic camera.

501
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:36,146
That chaotic irritated, "don't know
what to do" feeling inside me

502
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:42,788
was turning into something
warm and sweet like candy.

503
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,129
It took a long time to get here.

504
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:59,213
Yeah, but it's OK.

505
00:36:59,213 --> 00:37:03,263
I was happy just being
by your side.

506
00:37:15,779 --> 00:37:18,254
I'm not okay.

507
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:53,113
If there was a way to
measure my happiness...

508
00:37:58,229 --> 00:38:03,246
I wouldn't have been the happiest person in the world.

509
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:07,038
I'll never forget
what happened today.

510
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:09,113
Never.

511
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:31,971
Time flies in the blink of an eye.

512
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:37,838
I'm so sad. I already miss Okinawa.

513
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,954
It was our honeymoon and we didn't
spend that much time together.

514
00:38:48,696 --> 00:38:50,863
It, it, it tastes good!

515
00:38:50,863 --> 00:38:52,088
You're silly.

516
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:54,879
Mari-chan, your turn.

517
00:38:57,946 --> 00:39:00,129
What is up with those two?

518
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:04,079
They're the reason for all this jealousy!

519
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,804
It's good for them.

520
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:10,346
Well, you're right. But...

521
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,079
What?

522
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,679
Nothing.

523
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:26,229
Our stay was short, but
Okinawa gave us sweet memories.

524
00:39:26,229 --> 00:39:29,179
Sorry for making you wait, Okasan.
(okasan: mother)

525
00:39:29,179 --> 00:39:34,279
Irie-kun and I finally
met your expectations.

526
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,340
Excuse me.

527
00:39:51,379 --> 00:39:54,079
- It's sweet.
- Tastes good.

528
00:40:02,863 --> 00:40:06,321
That was fun!

529
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:07,938
Let's go again someday.

530
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,079
Yeah, someday.

531
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:12,579
Next time, we'll be all alone and…

532
00:40:15,071 --> 00:40:16,579
Naoki-san!

533
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,746
Kanamori-san…

534
00:40:19,746 --> 00:40:21,479
Welcome home, Naoki-san.

535
00:40:21,479 --> 00:40:24,079
And Misus.

536
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,279
Misus...

537
00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:28,979
What are you doing here?

538
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:31,779
I came to meet you.

539
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,813
Meet us?

540
00:40:39,421 --> 00:40:43,646
What is it? Did something happen
at the company while my father was away?

541
00:40:43,646 --> 00:40:46,846
Your father was away?

542
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:50,313
It's not for me to say.

543
00:40:54,196 --> 00:40:58,063
Aren't we heading home?

544
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:02,613
Where are we headed, Kanamori-san?

545
00:41:02,613 --> 00:41:04,579
We'll be there shortly.

546
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:08,963
Shortly?

547
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:07,304
[Preview- Ep.02 My Marriage Still On Hold?!]
You're not officially married?!

548
00:43:07,304 --> 00:43:09,538
I'm not ready to register our marriage.

549
00:43:09,538 --> 00:43:12,579
I don't understand Irie-kun at all.

550
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:13,396
It's fine.

551
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:15,463
There must be some reason.

552
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:18,679
Tennis warrior Koto-rin!

553
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,638
What a useless bride.

554
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:21,929
Don't play with her heart!

555
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:25,388
What are you men thinking?

556
00:43:25,388 --> 00:43:27,871
I don't want to see him.

557
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,038
This isn't a marriage!

558
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:32,129
Then leave.
