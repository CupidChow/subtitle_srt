1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:11,750
Happy birthday to you!

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:22,110
Happy birthday, Kotoko!

3
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,780
Irie-kun..

4
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,830
Kotoko, blow the candles.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,650
Yes.

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,290
Hmm?

7
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,290
That's strange...

8
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,860
Good morning.

9
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,050
Good morning.

10
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,050
You were practicing making funny faces in your sleep?

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:23,920
One moment you laughed,
and next moment you made a clown face.

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,380
You were breathing like "ffff," "ffff".

13
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,560
Clown face?

14
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,470
It was a dream.

15
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,470
What's up?

16
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,880
You let out such a big sigh.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,420
Although I think you guys already know,

18
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,380
my birthday's the 28th of this month.

19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,300
-Why would we know that?
-I see...

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,710
Irie-kun probably doesn't know, too, right?

21
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,020
-Huh?!?
-What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,310
Despite being husband and wife?

23
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,440
Exactly! Why doesn't he remember it
despite having an IQ of 200...

24
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,750
Right. At least a small part of his brain
should remember that ...

25
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,670
Is it because he doesn't input what he isn't interested in?

26
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,710
Every year, Mom throws a party

27
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,190
and although he is forced to attend...

28
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,570
But ..."I'm going to celebrate my beloved wife's birthday!"

29
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,660
He doesn't think like that ...

30
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,220
That certainly means there's no love.

31
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,570
I wouldn't be able to stand it if it were me!

32
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:53,240
I think I'd probably be satisfied with an expensive present.

33
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
Seriously...

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
It's fine if Kotoko just receives a present, too, right?

35
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,560
An expensive one. Ask him to buy one!

36
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,020
Presents aren't about their price!

37
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,410
There has to be love.

38
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,150
So, what kinds of things have you received so far?

39
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,120
What kind of things? Well~

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,510
I want to know! I'm curious about what Irie-san would give!

41
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:25,070
Oh no? Don't tell me...not once have I...

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,500
I've never received a present from Irie-kun...

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,530
You're joking!!

44
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,680
How many years have you guys been together?

45
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,880
Unbelievable.

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,020
Kotoko-san is so pitiful...

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,500
Divorce, divorce! You're not being loved at all.

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,960
I don't think so. It's just Irie-kun is bashful.

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,120
It definitely doesn't mean he doesn't love...

50
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,430
This is a problem, isn't it?

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,830
Do you think there's another woman?

52
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:58,550
Okay, this year, I'll have a flower bouquet
that has as many roses as my age,

53
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,560
champagne and a present filled with love.

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,310
I will definitely make it happen!

55
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,650
I'll wager $10 that it won't happen.

56
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,240
I'll also wager $10 that it won't happen.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,810
Me, too. I'll wager $10 that it won't.

58
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,840
Hey, doesn't anyone try to hit the jackpot?

59
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,530
Mischievous Kiss 2 ~Love in Tokyo~

60
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,020
[Final episode: The best birthday present]

61
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,710
-The 28th?
-Yup!

62
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,820
I have a surgery scheduled and have to work the night shift.

63
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,350
Was there something on that day?

64
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,580
R-really seems like he doesn't remember.

65
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,030
Then, that's fine!

66
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,590
I won't be discouraged by something like this!

67
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,930
Alright, if things are like that...

68
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,320
You're here! Irie-san.

69
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,670
What's with the commotion?

70
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,050
It's you, Funatsu.

71
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,520
Your night shift on the 28th, I will do it for you.

72
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,110
What?

73
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,380
I'm saying, on the 28th...

74
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,490
But I have no need to change it.

75
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,320
- That makes things difficult for me.
- Eh?

76
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,850
You should definitely change it.
Otherwise, Kotoko-san will ...

77
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,170
What do you mean difficult?

78
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,670
Nothing.

79
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,630
What did Kotoko tell you?

80
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,180
N-nothing at all.

81
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,330
Funatsu!

82
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,380
Kotoko-san said that if I changed shifts with you on the 28th,

83
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,370
she'd set me up on a date with Marina-san!

84
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,390
A date?

85
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,140
That's why please let me do the shift on the 28th!

86
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,400
That's a promise, alright?!

87
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,990
Funatsu, what was that?

88
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,840
Alone with Onii-chan?

89
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,400
- I'm sorry ...
- Whaaat?

90
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,560
I feel so sad. I've been looking forward to this event.

91
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,440
I was just about to finish making banners.

92
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,670
Banners ...?

93
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,290
See?

94
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm sorry ...!

95
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,100
Maybe we should have a regular party
like we always do ...

96
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,660
No! You are right. Definitely right!

97
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,510
Our parties in the past ...

98
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,970
Onii-chan has acted as if it was
a hassle for him to attend.

99
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,360
I've never seen him prepare presents at all.

100
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,910
All right, Kotoko-chan.

101
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,880
You should spend a romantic birthday
alone with Onii-chan this year.

102
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,770
This time, I will regretfully give up.

103
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,810
I'm sad though ...

104
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,690
Mother ...!

105
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,740
If you decided that, this is our plan, Kotoko!

106
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,070
Yes!

107
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,140
How can we subtly let Onii-chan realize

108
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,270
when Kotoko-chan's birthday is?

109
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,060
Right.

110
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,110
Subtly? Can't happen now.

111
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,060
You made a secret deal with Funatsu at the hospital.

112
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,800
He said it!

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,350
Now I recollect it is your birthday.

114
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,530
Mother always gets excited around this time of the year.

115
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,150
But I'm not interested in that.

116
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,020
You are the worst!

117
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,380
How can you say "I'm not interested" about
your beloved wife's birthday?!

118
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,560
Do you really want to spend your birthday with me
to that extent?

119
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,060
That has been a dream so far.

120
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,320
Tell me what kind of birthday you want to have.

121
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,240
Right! Tell him, Kotoko!

122
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,470
I'm embarrassed, and

123
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:06,390
I just want to get super dressed-up and

124
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:13,240
want Irie-kun hold a bouquet
that has as many roses as my age.

125
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,250
Have dinner.

126
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,740
A chef brings me a cake,

127
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,110
and the entire restaurant congratulates me on my birthday~

128
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,700
Happy Birthday, Kotoko

129
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:48,050
Then, Irie-kun and I would drink champagne...

130
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,790
A night for just the two of us~!

131
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,160
I've fully understood your passion for your birthday.

132
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,600
Huh?

133
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,220
I will switch shifts with Funatsu on the 28th.

134
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,350
R-Really?

135
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,460
Is that okay?

136
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,330
Yeah. He's annoying, too.

137
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,610
Yay!

138
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,750
You did it, Kotoko-chan!

139
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,920
Yay, Irie-kun!

140
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,610
Since the day I got to know Irie-kun,

141
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,530
how many times have I dreamed of

142
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,070
celebrating my birthday like this?

143
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,580
And after this and that, the actual day
of my birthday finally arrived!

144
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:58,100
September 28th, that day

145
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,530
Irie-kun, you remember right?

146
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,570
At the lounge of Royal Hotel, at 7pm, alright?

147
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,730
Yeah.

148
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,790
That's right, Onii-chan.

149
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,940
I gave up celebrating Kotoko-chan's
birthday myself regretfully.

150
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,540
Yeah.

151
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,910
Irie-kun! You don't have to get a bouquet
that has as many roses as my age. Okay?

152
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,780
Yeah!

153
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,140
I don't need it! It's not like I want it...

154
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,930
Enough! You've been saying it everyday!

155
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,860
Poor Onii-chan.

156
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,690
Yes..a bit.

157
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,670
I'm off.

158
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,760
♫ As I dash down the stairs, I see the back of my beloved♫

159
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,750
♫Pulling the cuffs of his sleeves♫

160
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,180
♫I have an urge to make him look back at me♫

161
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,990
♫Embrace both my heart and my body♫

162
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:15,750
♫Steal all of me!♫

163
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,230
♫I wish you would only look at me♫

164
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,840
♫For the reflection in your eyes♫

165
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,750
♫To be that of another girl ...♫

166
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,030
♫I can't stand that♫

167
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,610
Well, I can't be lazing around!

168
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,240
♫The reason the world glistens♫

169
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,100
♫Is because you are here♫

170
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,860
♫The feeling of love♫

171
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,230
♫Is overflowing♫
- I'll wear a pretty dress,

172
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,450
and have my hair set at a salon.

173
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,840
♫Love me more♫
- I'll have it curled nicely.

174
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,300
♫Hug me more, kiss me more♫
- I might as well have my make-up done at the salon, too!

175
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,890
For a day like this,

176
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,730
I'll show the very best side of me!

177
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,430
Irie-kun might fall in love with me all over again ...!

178
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,510
♫I've trimmed the ends of my hair just a little bit♫

179
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,720
♫That's how you like it, right?♫

180
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,810
Mom, that lady's hair is like a parrot.

181
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,840
Hey, shush!

182
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,770
What is this...?

183
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,990
Why did this hair...turn out like this...?

184
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,780
I should go to another salon...no, I don't have time for that...

185
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,010
Maybe it's not as bad as I think?...

186
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,410
Why couldn't I tell them that I didn't like it?

187
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,390
I am such an idiot...

188
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,690
Hey! What's wrong?

189
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,820
Are you alright?

190
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,400
What happened?

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,980
She suddenly started tottering and squatted down.

192
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,050
She collapsed and hit her head.

193
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:27,050
Are you okay? Are you okay?

194
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,380
I'll be lifting your head.

195
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,270
Okay.

196
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,260
Sorry, could somebody lend me a handkerchief?

197
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,790
Here, please use this.

198
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,060
Thank you.

199
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,120
- Y-You..
- Yes?

200
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,830
Can you call the ambulance?

201
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,760
Yes.

202
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,290
C-could you please lend me your bag?

203
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:52,740
Yes.

204
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,760
Please place it under her head.

205
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,870
Is that person a nurse?

206
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:03,190
She is not a hostess ...?

207
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,520
The ambulance will be here in a while.

208
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,080
Can you tell me your name?

209
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,800
Do you hurt anywhere else?

210
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,990
She was saved because you, a nurse, was there.

211
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,240
I think she had an attack of anemia,
but she was also bleeding.

212
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,610
Now, thank you.

213
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,890
Hey you, you did good!

214
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,640
That's right, that was really great!

215
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,060
That's amazing.

216
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,990
You were cool!

217
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,170
Well...

218
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,780
Excuse me, the bag..

219
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,500
Oh, please put it there.

220
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,290
Ah, the friend, please go inside.

221
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,620
Ah, I'm not...

222
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,290
I'm not her friend!

223
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,130
Hey! Ahh!

224
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,330
What should I do? I'm already more than 2 hours late...

225
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,500
Irie-kun would probably have left already...

226
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,870
Why must it be today that such a thing...

227
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,340
Irie-kun...I'm sorry!

228
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,610
Please...just a while more..

229
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,510
Wait for me!

230
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,200
Miss...Pardon me, but

231
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,450
What happened to your dress?

232
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:45,370
What do you mean?

233
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,710
Were you hurt?

234
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:52,180
No, it's not that.

235
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,060
Oh no, what should I do?

236
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,040
Miss?

237
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,420
I can't meet Irie-kun like this...

238
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,620
I was going to meet someone here, but...

239
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,990
it's already been 3 hours...

240
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,980
Should I call for him over the speakers?

241
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,230
It's my birthday...

242
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,570
To meet Irie-kun like this...

243
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,110
Miss...

244
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:24,160
It's the first time Irie-kun's celebrating my birthday for me...

245
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,520
I can't meet him like this, right?

246
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,980
Well, shall we first...

247
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,060
Irie-kun must have returned already, right?

248
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,910
I'm afraid there is no knowing...

249
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,050
Irie-kun?

250
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,790
I thought it was you who got injured ...

251
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,860
Seriously, making me worried like that.

252
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,250
Irie-kun!

253
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,980
Sorry, I'm late!

254
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,140
Many things happened, and I couldn't get here in time.

255
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,970
I felt like I was losing my mind.

256
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,380
But, even though I thought you might have gone back already...

257
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,650
But I couldn't just give up.

258
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,920
No matter what happened today,

259
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,730
I knew you would come here
even if you had to crawl all the way.

260
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,070
I couldn't just go back.

261
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,380
But look at the way you look.

262
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,090
Irie-kun...

263
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,490
You can take your time and tell me about the rest later.

264
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,710
You're hungry, right?

265
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,680
The restaurant we made a reservation at is already closed,

266
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,900
and with your state...

267
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,540
Hold on, the Onii-san over there.

268
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,790
Hi~

269
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,520
These are your belongings, right?

270
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,500
You left them over there. If you leave things around like that,
they're going to get stolen.

271
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,960
Here, hold on to it Onii-san.

272
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,760
Oh no! It's about time for my flight.

273
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,060
If I can't get back to my country...

274
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,090
Please enjoy your time~

275
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,560
See you~

276
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,000
Pretty!

277
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,510
There is definitely the same number of roses as my age.

278
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,380
Hey, there's cake, too. Do you want some?

279
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,670
This mother..what is she thinking?

280
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,510
What am I supposed to do with this?

281
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:24,110
I wonder if she had been waiting all along for me.

282
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:26,030
I know, right?

283
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,140
I bet she was filming us ...

284
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:32,650
Seriously, what a person with free time.

285
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:37,380
But I'm super happy.

286
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,000
There must be no bride happier than me.

287
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,900
Happy birthday, Kotoko.

288
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,660
Irie-kun.

289
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,830
What do you want for your present?

290
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,020
Really!

291
00:21:55,020 --> 00:22:00,620
Let's see! Umm...

292
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,080
Well...

293
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,530
I'd like to hear you say that you love me...

294
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,490
That you love me...

295
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,090
Actually, actually let's forget that!

296
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:19,450
I'll rethink it...um, um...

297
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,830
Kotoko, I love you.

298
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,620
Me too... I love you very much.

299
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,980
A lot of time has passed since I met Irie-kun, but

300
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,000
why is my heart beating so fast?

301
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,330
Why do I love him so much?

302
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,850
Oh, shoot!

303
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:50,490
Does Irie-kun love me the way I do, too?

304
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:55,410
He makes my heart beat faster everyday even now.

305
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:02,570
I wonder if I make his heart beat faster occasionally?

306
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:07,370
If so...won't that be great?

307
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,590
Don't grin stupidly so suddenly!

308
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,790
I can't stop looking at it~

309
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:30,400
It's already been 2 months since you got that
from Onii-chan, hasn't it?

310
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,490
That's true, but...

311
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,340
I'm still enjoying looking at it.

312
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,120
It was worth giving you the gift for Onii-chan.

313
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,500
You are over-joyed like this!

314
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:45,180
Here, this came for you Kotoko.

315
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,140
Thank you.

316
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,150
Oh? It's from Chris.

317
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,300
What is it?! Amazing!

318
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:07,100
Wow, great!

319
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,070
What is it?

320
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,230
Hey, look! Look at this!

321
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,260
Greetings, Naoki and Kotoko.

322
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,660
We had our wedding at a castle which is our vacation house.

323
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,760
We'll be on our honeymoon and be in England for some time.

324
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:32,000
We will be a happy couple like Naoki and Kotoko.

325
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,680
I'm really super happy!- Chris

326
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:44,170
Chris is from a rich family ...

327
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:46,690
I know, right?

328
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,150
But she's really pretty, isn't she?

329
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,170
Kinnosuke looks unexpectedly good
(in the white tuxedo).

330
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:57,480
The two of them look so happy together.

331
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,910
Yuuki?

332
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,210
I've been feeling kind of feverish since a while ago.

333
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,020
What?

334
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,760
Oh my! It's true.

335
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,880
Konomi seemed sick, I probably got it from her...

336
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,640
I wonder what you did to get it from her, right?

337
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,550
Ko ...Kotoko, what are you saying?

338
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,870
Yes, yes, wait just a minute.

339
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,160
At this moment, everyone was still

340
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,310
very much worry-free.

341
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,860
The next morning

342
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,590
Seriously, all of you ...

343
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,750
Breathe in.

344
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,840
Breathe out.

345
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,300
Open your mouth.

346
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,330
Your throat is inflamed.

347
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,630
Next, Dad.

348
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,830
Thank you.

349
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,400
At the same time, things at the hospital became difficult, too.

350
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,060
There came more patients with
flu-like symptoms than yesterday.

351
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,750
What?

352
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,040
Excuse me.

353
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,920
Are you the one coming from the surgical department
to support us?

354
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,650
Yes, I have come from the surgical department. I am Irie Kotoko.

355
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,430
Nice to meet you.

356
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,350
Irie-kun!

357
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,270
Kotoko.

358
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,020
What are you doing here?

359
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,290
The same reason as you.

360
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,580
Really? Why is it such a coincidence?

361
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,910
We must really be the couple that people can depend on~

362
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,730
We?

363
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:22,290
If Irie-kun is around, anything is possible.
Let's do our best!

364
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,010
Alright then.

365
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,050
I'm working together with Irie-kun.

366
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,650
How lucky I am~!

367
00:30:36,650 --> 00:30:38,830
Irie-san?

368
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,330
Don't space out, come here please!

369
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes.

370
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:50,000
And this was followed by a torturous schedule...

371
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,670
Yamada Makiko-san, please wait in front of the second room.

372
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,230
Yes.

373
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,680
- Are you Yamada-san?
-Yes.

374
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,660
Please wait right here.

375
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:10,240
I will prescribe you an inhalant.

376
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,260
As soon as you get the medicine, please use it right away.

377
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,200
Thank you very much.

378
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,790
Please take care.

379
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,790
Delicious!

380
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,110
Yes!

381
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,110
Yes, this is the Irie Residence.

382
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,300
Ah, Kotoko-chan...?

383
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:50,340
Huh? You still can't come back?

384
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,020
That must be difficult.

385
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,730
Are you okay, Kotoko-chan?

386
00:31:55,730 --> 00:32:01,650
You haven't been able to get sleep because of work and taking care of us, have you?

387
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,240
We're alright here at home. My fever's totally gone, too.

388
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,950
Thanks to Kotoko-chan.

389
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,950
Yes, then...

390
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:18,520
Don't overwork yourself, okay?

391
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,660
Yes! Yes.

392
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,160
I wonder if she's really okay?

393
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,100
You can't go home, too?

394
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,360
Irie-kun.

395
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,300
Irie-kun, you're still here, too?

396
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,390
I can't leave in this situation...

397
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,770
I'm so happy~

398
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,390
Since we don't really get to work together~

399
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,870
How come can you be happy ...?

400
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,940
That's because ...

401
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,090
I've always hoped for something like this.

402
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,840
What?

403
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,530
I've been wanting to ask you...

404
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,890
Do you feel unwell anywhere?

405
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:16,370
Well, I'm a little tired, but...

406
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,910
Now that you mention it, I seem to be a bit feverish.

407
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,980
-But it's probably nothing.
-Have you had meals?

408
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,920
Not much...I haven't had an appetite...

409
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:30,430
Because I've been so busy running around, but I'm fine.

410
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,300
I see.

411
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:39,040
Wow, Irie-kun, you've been worried about me, haven't you?

412
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,000
In case your beloved wife gets infected by the influenza, too~

413
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,150
Hey, that is-

414
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:50,850
Hey, just like Irie-kun! I'm so happy!

415
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:53,660
I get it, you're healthy.

416
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,730
I found you, Dr. Irie .. and Kotoko-san.

417
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,810
What happened?

418
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,180
It's an emergency.

419
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,120
- It hurts!
-You'll be okay..-

420
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,050
-Doctor! Doctor! My child ...!
-What happened?

421
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,110
He crashed into a glass window on a bike.

422
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,590
It doesn't stop bleeding ...
although I have applied pressure on it.

423
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,790
In such situations you can call the ambulance.

424
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,760
But if I remove my hands...

425
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,610
He keeps bleeding, so I couldn't make a call.

426
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:29,650
Anyway, please let him sit down here.

427
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,100
Okay, remove your hand from the wound.
Please let me take a look at it.

428
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,960
Give me the light.

429
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,360
Mother, please place the towel here.

430
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,800
It'll be okay.

431
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,280
You'll be alright.

432
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,460
Firstly, we'll have to remove the glass fragments.

433
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,980
It might hurt a little, but you can do it.

434
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,670
Takashi...

435
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,480
Sorry, Mommy couldn't help you Takashi...

436
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,630
Mother, please calm down.

437
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,790
If you don't, Takashi-kun won't have a sense of security either.

438
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:03,250
Let's cheer him on together, alright?

439
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,340
-Nurse...
-It'll be alright!

440
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:11,310
Dr. Irie is the best in Japan at removing glass fragments!

441
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,740
Okay?

442
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,820
Takashi, you can do it!

443
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,010
You can do it, Takashi-kun.

444
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,340
Ouch...

445
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:31,390
-You can do it, Takashi!
-Just a bit more, Takashi-kun.

446
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,950
I'm really sorry about just now.

447
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,710
I got distraught ... I'm ashamed.

448
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,080
That's understandable, you must have been shocked, right?

449
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,730
You woke me up when you told me I had to stay firm.

450
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,550
I realised, "that's right."

451
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:54,140
-"How could I let him feel insecure?"
-It's nothing...

452
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,830
But it's good that the wound wasn't as deep as we thought it was, isn't it?

453
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,340
You're amazing Takashi-kun, you did it!

454
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,770
Thank you very much.

455
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:10,630
It was great that there was Japan's best doctor at removing glass fragments,

456
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,250
and a kind nurse like you.

457
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,240
Excuse us.

458
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,960
Take care of yourselves.

459
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,900
-Bye bye!
-Let's go.

460
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,980
It hurts!

461
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,030
Isn't that great?

462
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,600
Being complimented as a nurse for the first time since you were born.

463
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,790
What do you mean? It's nothing like that!

464
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,770
And I'm the best in Japan at removing glass fragments, aren't I?

465
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,010
I'm so honored.

466
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,020
Anyway...I'm glad, Irie-kun.

467
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,410
That mother's amazing, isn't she?

468
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,740
Carrying Takashi-kun all the way here even though she is small.

469
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,890
Amazing, isn't it?

470
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,700
The power of a mom protecting her child's just amazing, isn't it?

471
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,950
That's right.

472
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,540
Dr. Irie!

473
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,260
I'm sorry. Patient, again.

474
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,810
Seriously, it's endless tonight.

475
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,200
Kotoko, you should go home already.

476
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,460
It seems like someone else will come help out.

477
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:31,060
That's right. Yamamura-san will come help out soon, too.

478
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,540
I'm alright.

479
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,150
Irie-kun's doing his best still, I can still ...

480
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,210
Hmm?

481
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:46,390
That's strange...the strength in my legs...

482
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,970
- Kotoko!
- Kotoko-san?

483
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,860
Irie-kun...

484
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,080
Ah, she opened her eyes!

485
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,940
You're right! Kotoko-chan, you're conscious, right?

486
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,390
Onii-chan..Onii-chan!
Kotoko-chan..

487
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,100
-Kotoko-chan has woken...
-Mama, calm down!

488
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,120
Ah...I...

489
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,420
Kotoko-chan, you collapsed in the hospital!

490
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,810
Onii-chan carried you back from the hospital.

491
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,630
And you've been asleep since then!

492
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:37,300
We were so worried! It's great you finally woke up.

493
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,120
Sorry, I worried everyone...

494
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,760
Seriously...

495
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,120
You...made us so worried!

496
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,370
Everything's fine now isn't it, Ai-chan?

497
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:54,360
Sorry, Kotoko-chan!

498
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,290
You caught our influenza!

499
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,290
And on top of that you were working without rest in the hospital...

500
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,080
while taking care of us all at the same time.

501
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,840
I'm so sorry...to have let you suffer like that.

502
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,300
It's nothing like that, Mom!

503
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,410
I'm fine now since I've gotten my sleep.

504
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:22,560
I'll be fine tomorrow after I take some flu medicine now.

505
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,360
Really, Kotoko-chan?

506
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,430
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry!

507
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,440
Then...I'll go get you some water, alright?

508
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,310
Yes, thank you.

509
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,890
Onii-chan! Kotoko-chan has...

510
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,230
Don't take it.

511
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,140
Don't take it yet.

512
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,300
I'm sorry I worried you, Irie-kun.

513
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,520
But I'm absolutely fine already!

514
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,910
Somehow I just blacked out...

515
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:06,340
Kotoko ... when was your last period?

516
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:14,110
W-why do you ask?

517
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,820
That's right, Onii-chan!

518
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,280
Are you..

519
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,920
Irie-kun..

520
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,780
... pregnant?

521
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:40,220
♫Kiss, what I've been longing for,
the complicated kiss from you♫
