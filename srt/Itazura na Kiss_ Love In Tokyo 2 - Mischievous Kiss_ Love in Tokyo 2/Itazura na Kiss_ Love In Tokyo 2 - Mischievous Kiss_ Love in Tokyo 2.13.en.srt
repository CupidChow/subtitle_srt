00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,440
Whoa, I did it!

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,960
Congratulations!

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:16,470
Irie-kun, my first appearance as a nurse!

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,050
Wait for me~

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,670
I wanted to tell you

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,060
as soon as possible ..

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,530
Finally,

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,280
I'll be able to work with you.

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,690
You worked hard for one whole year.

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,380
Irie-kun!

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,180
You look pretty good in that.

[ Tonan University Hospital ]

13
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,580
Excuse me.

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,520
Yikes!

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,610
It's Kotoko-chan!

16
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,010
Why do you have to say "yikes" as soon as I come in?

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,600
H-Hey, w-what are you going to do?

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,090
What do you mean? I'm going to take blood samples.

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,930
W-Whose?

20
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,720
Harada-san and Kimura-san.

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,070
- Ahhhh! Me?
- Ahhhh! Me?

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,660
Come on.

23
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,080
I will do it now.

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh, you're not aware of this
because you just got admitted here today.

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,750
I feel sorry for you. You have to go through this on the first day.

26
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,880
That nurse is Kotoko Irie. You have to watch out for her.

27
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,830
Okay, why don't you

28
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,460
watch her ...?

29
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,610
Hey, don't be so nervous.

30
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,780
Kimura-san, you're like a child.

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,520
Okay, give me your arm. Should it be right or left?

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,150
Don't make mistakes.

33
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,170
Count on me!

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,500
Okay. I have to apply a tourniquet first.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Make a tight fist, okay?

36
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,960
Here we go~.

37
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,680
I'll make sure the veins are dialated.

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm going to disinfect your arm.

39
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,950
It will feel a bit cold.

40
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,530
Okay.

41
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,900
All right.

42
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,460
This will sting a bit.

43
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,830
Ouch!

44
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,380
Oh, something is wrong. I can't draw blood.

45
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,390
It's ok..

46
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:09,220
His veins might be thin.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,510
Here, wait a minute please.

48
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,050
Okay, this will sting again.

49
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,810
Ouch!!

50
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,850
Ahhhh!

51
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,090
Ahhh!

52
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,910
- Ahhh!
- Oh?

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,980
It's so weird.

54
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,710
I usually do better than this.

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,290
This is the last one. One more time!

56
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,040
My arm got so many needle holes! Stop it already!

57
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,210
Wait, Irie-san, what are you doing?

58
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,530
- Assistant Chief Shimizu ...
- Ugh ... give it to me!

59
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,740
You saved me.

60
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,590
Well, it was difficult to work on Kimura-san.

61
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,340
But maybe Harada-san ...?

62
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,260
Give me a break! Give me a break!

63
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,190
Oh, no ...

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,610

[ Nurse Station ]

83
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,620
This is outrageous!

84
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,960
Irie-san, how long have you been working as a nurse?

85
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,530
For t-two months ...

86
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,620
I told you to call someone if you fail to draw blood twice!

87
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,890
I'm sorry.

88
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:34,780
You act as if you're still a trainee. Yesterday, too...

89
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,780
Oh, it's from a room I'm in charge of.

90
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,370
Hello. May I help you? Yes, yes, yes.

91
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,280
I understand, yes.

92
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,730
Assistant Chief Shimizu, see you later!

93
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,240
Irie-san, Iri..

94
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,070
She is really quick at running away.

95
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,480
Okay, take care.

96
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,750
Kotoko.

97
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,310
Moto-chan.

98
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,910
I heard you got a pretty good scolding by Assistant Chief Shimizu again.

99
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,790
Hey, you look down.

100
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,120
Aren't you used to be scolded by the Assistant Chief and doctors?

101
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,100
That's not it.

102
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,700
I finally became a nurse after working so hard, and

103
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,960
I thought I could work with Irie-kun.

104
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,190
I was so happy, but ...

105
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,920
But, but...

106
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,880
The hospital in Kobe wouldn't hire me because there is no vacancy!

107
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,160
I can't believe it!

108
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,290
I'll have to stay separated from Irie-kun.

109
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,530
That's too much!

110
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,290
How can I be in a good mood?

111
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,000
That's true, huh?

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,080
It might be time to think about getting divorced.

113
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,710
- No way!
- It can't be helped.

114
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,200
You have to be happy to be able to work at
Tonan Univ. Hospital you are familiar with.

115
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,510
Well, you're right about that.

116
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,360
Marina and Funatsu-san work at the Cardiology Dept. together.

117
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,030
Tomoko, of course, works at the Surgical Dept.
Keita works at the Orthopedic Dept.

118
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,140
Moto-chan and I work at another Surgical Dept. We've been together since college,

119
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,400
but only Irie-kun is not here~!

120
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,610
When can I work at the same hospital as Irie-kun?

121
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,290
I finally became capable enough to help Irie-kun.

122
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,230
God is not on my side ...

123
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,790
Irie-kun,

124
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,110
you don't look happy.

125
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:51,580
You made a mistake again?

126
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,540
Dr. Nishigaki~.

127
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,010
She failed to draw blood from a patient

128
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,020
and made a lot of needle holes on his arm.

129
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,460
Hey, don't tell him unnecessary things ...

130
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,730
- That's terrible.
- Ahhhh!

131
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,550
I will make time to teach you how to inject next time.

132
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,540
Maybe when you are on a night shift ...

133
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,420
No, thank you.

134
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,360
Really? Then, shall we go on a date?

135
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,460
Oh, Dr. Nishigaki, I am married although I may not look so.

136
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:32,390
So, I heard! Well, you don't look married at all!

137
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,840
I heard your husband is a quite capable intern.

138
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,480
- Is he better-looking than I?
- Of course!

139
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,490
I kinda feel disgusted ... Well, he is not here anyway,

140
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,720
so he can't even be my rival.

141
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,500
When you feel lonely, missing your husband, come to me. Don't hesitate.

142
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,480
- I won't!
- I will.

143
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,710
Dr. Nishigaki, would you like to eat lunch with me?

144
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,130
Oh, Tanaka-kun, of course.

145
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,610
Hey, you changed your hair style.

146
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,980
You noticed it? I'm so happy.

147
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,310
Of course, I did.

148
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,070
I can tell even a little change on beautiful women.

149
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,450
It's nice. You look good.

150
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,950
Oh, really?

151
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,210
It seems we'll have a long lunch break!

152
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,500
He is so flirtatious! I'm getting a chill.

153
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,470
But he is a cool guy.

154
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,410
I'd feel okay about being with him.

155
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,410
Huh? How could you?

156
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,420
He is so shallow!

157
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,210
He is an excellent surgeon and is good-looking.

158
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,940
He is 29 years old and single.

159
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,980
Now that Irie-san is not around, Dr. Nishigaki
is the only guy to feast my eyes on.

160
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,500
Don't you think so?

161
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,370
Not at all!

162
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,380
He sure is good-looking and

163
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,120
might be an excellent surgeon,

164
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,290
but he is so different from Irie-kun.

165
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,040
Irie-kun wouldn't fall for nurses or patients no matter how sexy they are. He is reserved!

166
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,750
He wouldn't fall for you, either.

167
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,200
Talking about being reserved around women,

168
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Dr. Daijamori is, too, right?

169
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,740
Oh, well ...

170
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,380
Don't lump him together with that doctor!

171
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,930
He is different ...

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,740
What's wrong?

173
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,610
At 11:00am at the MRI room...

174
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,250
I was supposed to take Dr. Daijamori's patient.

175
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,690
Oh, that doctor will scold you if you are late even a minute!

176
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,370
He is insistent. Okay, the time now is ...

177
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,510
11:15am!

178
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,800
NO~~~~~!

179
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,920
Irie-san, don't run in the hallway.

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,530
Ahhhh!

182
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,380
Assistant Chief Shimizu reported to me what happened.

183
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,460
This is a problem.

184
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,620
Today alone, Dr. Ezaki and Dr. Daijamori complained about you already.

185
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,860
Some patients placed complaints, too.

186
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,460
My goodness! You make too many easy mistakes.

187
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,120
Irie-san,

189
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,700
I know you want to work at the hospital in Kobe. Correct?

190
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,860
Yes.

191
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,620
Is it because your husband,

192
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,320
Dr. Irie, works there?

193
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,450
Yes, Irie-kun... I would like to work with Dr. Irie.

194
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,850
That's wonderful.

195
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,790
I also think a married couple shouldn't be separated.

196
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,250
However! Do you think it is okay to stay the way you are now?

197
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:15,490
Dr. Irie has been brilliant ever since he was a medical student.

198
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,850
He must be doing even better now.

199
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,370
You want to be a good partner to him, right?

200
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,610
Yes.

201
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,950
But if you stay the way you are,

202
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,750
you won't be able to be his good partner.

203
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,610
Or rather, you might even cause trouble to him!

204
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,640
I might cause trouble to him ...

205
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,250
[ Japanese Restaurant Aihara ]

206
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,640
- Wha..
- What happened, Kotoko?

207
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,980
You came here for the first time in a while, but you seem down.

208
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,340
Yeah, Kotoko, what's the matter?

209
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,430
You finally became a nurse, right?

210
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,070
I've been looking forward to

211
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,730
having you take care of me when I get sick.

212
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,700
I will take care of Kinnosuke.

213
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,360
Idiot! It's been my dream for a long time.

214
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,460
Forget about such a dream.

215
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,280
I can be a nurse to you, too.

216
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,670
- Can you?
- Yes, I can.

217
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,610
Why don't you try?

218
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,100
You two are getting along so well.

219
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,000
Why don't you get married?

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,780
Yes, right! Tell him more!

221
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,700
Hey, let go of me.

222
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,080
You two have been working together

223
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,620
and staying together all the time.

224
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,360
I envy you.

225
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,620
It's so hard for you to stay separated from Irie, right?

226
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,480
Why do you allow yourself live apart from him?

227
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,030
As for me, I had quit going back to England, you know.

228
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,650
Yeah, right.

229
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:16,050
To be honest, I really want to stay with Irie-kun every day.

230
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,390
But ... I realized I can't stay the way I am now.

231
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,230
I will only cause trouble to Irie-kun.

232
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,470
That is so true ...

233
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,300
I always make mistakes.

234
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,670
I cause trouble to doctors and patients.

235
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,960
They are afraid of me.

236
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,800
At this rate, I won't be able to help Irie-kun.

237
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,200
I will only pull his leg.

238
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:57,430
Kotoko.

239
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,960
Cut it out, Kotoko!

240
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,500
Why are you whining?

241
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,820
You used to be my love role model. What happen to you?

242
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:11,540
The Kotoko that I know wouldn't whine like this!

243
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,240
Kotoko will .... Kotoko will ...

244
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,240
step over flowers and storms.

245
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,620
She will go after Irie no matter what!

246
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,780
That's how Kotoko should be.

247
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,460
Flowers and storms ...?

248
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,000
Right!

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,180
Step over them ...?

250
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,340
That's right!

251
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,840
You are right.

252
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:39,760
If I can't do it, I only have to work hard to make it happen.

253
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,520
If I stop now, I won't be able to see Irie-kun, right?

254
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,100
That's right, Kotoko!

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,240
Chris!

256
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,660
That's how Kotoko should be.

257
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,940
I will do it!

258
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,310
She is really resilient.

259
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,310
Step over flowers and storms ...

260
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,410
I have finished IV for Yokouchi-san.

261
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,790
I'll serve lunch for the patients.

262
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,620
Really? I'll rely on you.

263
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,420
Yamagishi-san, did you change the sheets on room #203?

264
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,340
Ah, sorry. I'll get right on it.

265
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,100
I've already done it.

266
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,320
What?

267
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,740
So, I'm going.

268
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,120
What's going on with her... Irie-san?

269
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,320
Don't know...

270
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,800
What do you want to be in the future?

271
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,220
Well, let me think... in the future...

272
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,420
I don't know yet.

273
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,860
For me... my husband is a doctor,

274
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,840
that's why I became a nurse.

275
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Dear god, dear god...

276
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,480
You will feel a pinch, okay?

277
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,540
Dear god, dear god...

278
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,560
The room #261, Hasebe-san
complained some pain after the surgery,

279
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,840
I added a painkiller to his IV.

280
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,560
Okay. Understood.

281
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,290
Excuse me.

282
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,370
Hello, Irie-san. You are here!

283
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,990
I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong again?

284
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,820
No, not this time. I have a good news for you.

285
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,540
There is an opening...

286
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,640
What?

287
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,080
I was notified from Irie-sensei's hospital in Kobe.

288
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Let's complete your transfer by next week.

289
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,800
I know you are eager to see him.

290
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,950
A-ah... I...

291
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,030
You mean... I can work at Irie-kun's hospital?

292
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,270
That's right! Being separated from him
must have been hard for you.

293
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,030
You have shown great improvements lately.

294
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:13,590
Please keep this up and
be a great support for Dr. Irie.

295
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,570
Yes, thank you, Chief Nurse.

296
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,740
Hospital in Kobe?

297
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,910
I see, so Kotoko-chan is leaving.

298
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,590
I feel like I'll be able to live longer.

299
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,490
Hey!

300
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,380
We will miss you.

301
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,860
That's right, we won't be able to hear
your cheerful voice anymore.

302
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,820
Be good to your doctor-husband.

303
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,760
You need to work on the injection more, though.

304
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,160
I... about everyone...

305
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,880
- There you are. Irie-kun, what are you doing?
- Ow!

306
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,800
Let's start our round from Harada-san.

307
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,840
O-Ok.

308
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,960
Harada-san, let me check your wound.

309
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,290
Thank you.

310
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:07,320
Excuse me.

311
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,420
Everything looks good post-surgery.

312
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,620
Is it?

313
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,630
Your wound is healing nicely.

314
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,210
That's good to hear.

315
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,000
Hand me the disinfectant.

316
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,280
That's right, I should call Irie-kun.
I wonder if he would be shocked.

317
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,550
Disinfectant!

318
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,220
Disinfectant!

319
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,600
Yes!

320
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,430
Sorry.

321
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,570
Wipe the smirk off your face.

322
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,670
You are so arrogant for an intern.

323
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,900
What is Irie-kun doing here?

324
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,060
As of today, I was transferred here at Tonan University Hospital.

325
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,420
I'm Irie Naoki, nice to meet you.

326
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,360
Wait, Irie means...

327
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,640
Is he Kotoko-chan's....?

328
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,650
You mean, we can...

329
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,860
You and I can together...

330
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,940
Finaly, we will be working together,

331
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,910
Kotoko.

332
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,030
Irie-kun!

333
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,870
All the memories I had up to this point,

334
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,060
crossed my mind like a flashback.

335
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,130
I..

336
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,780
The thing I want to do most,

337
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,920
is to help you with your job.

338
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,920
In other words..a nurse.
To be able to be with him like this,

339
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,780
is what I have dreamt of for a long time.

340
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,140
I devote myself...

341
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,000
I want to work at a hospital in Kobe.

342
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,510
It has been a long journey.

343
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,490
Hey... we are at the hospital.

344
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,990
Is he your husband, Kotoko-chan?

345
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,630
Yes, he is my husband.

346
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,520
Good for you.

347
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
Yes. (Thank you.)

348
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,320
Everyone, please watch over us.

349
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,200
But... aren't you going to Kobe?

350
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:57,930
Oh, I see. We missed each other again.

351
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,620
How unfortunate we are!

352
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,910
Good luck working over there!

353
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,290
Can I interrupt you? I'd like to continue our round.

354
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:21,120
Head Nurse! Please cancel my transfer~!!

355
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,030
I'm home.

356
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:48,830
Ready, set...

357
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:54,570
Welcome back home, Onii-chan.

358
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,400
[ Congratulations!
Husband and Wife, living together again! ]

359
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,750
You have waited for a long time, Kotoko-chan.

360
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,070
Yes.

361
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,500
Onii-chan, since you left her alone for such a long time,

362
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,680
please be super nice to her from now on.

363
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,650
Do you understand?

364
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,440
Mother.

365
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,210
Since Naoki returned,
we are here together as a family again.

366
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,680
From this day, not to mention the husband and wife,
but let's get along well as a whole family.

367
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,600
Yes!

368
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,970
Okay, let's toast.

369
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,770
Let's toast.

370
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,290
Here.

371
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,330
Don't forget about thinking about having a baby, too.

372
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,220
Tonight is your welcome back party,
so eat and drink!

373
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,850
Thank you very much.

374
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,890
I'm sure I will be busy as usual,
but Kotoko and I will work hard together.

375
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,730
Right! Naoki, truly good to have you back!

376
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,160
Cheers!
- Cheers!

377
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,900
Okay, I'll bring out the food.

378
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,390
Let's bring them out.

379
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,710
It looks delicious.

380
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,160
Welcome home, Onii-chan.

381
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,220
You look matured, Yuuki.

382
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,580
R-really?

383
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,250
He grew 4 inches in a year.

384
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:23,350
You must be relieved,
you are taller than Konomi-chan.

385
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,730
Shut up, Kotoko.

386
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,760
I'm happy for you.

387
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,330
Hehe... I'm sorry to tell you, but...

388
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,860
Naoki-san.

389
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,210
Welcome back.

390
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:35,900
I'm sorry to intrude.

391
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,590
Konomi-chan, long time, no see.

392
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,170
- How is school?
- I'm still not good at studying, and

393
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,310
Yuuki always scolds me.

394
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,720
How is it going between you and Yuuki?

395
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,840
He helps me study, and we go to movies and such...

396
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,190
Really? Yuuki does ...?

397
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,130
Oh? What did you tell him?

398
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,740
Kotoko! We are here.

399
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,310
Naoki, welcome back!

400
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,040
Let's eat slowly.

401
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,400
My sunglasses fell.

402
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,850
Are you at that age already?

403
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,490
Kin-chan, stop!

404
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,920
- What?
- This monkey is on my face.

405
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,460
But you are the one who put it on me.

406
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,150
You might catch a cold, Irie-kun.

407
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,260
Are you tired?

408
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,220
They are all excited to see you.

409
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,650
I haven't been in a riotous gathering like this for a year.

410
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,410
I have lived alone, too, you know.

411
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,540
But everyone is overly joyed,

412
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,600
because you returned.

413
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,730
Not just Mother and Father-in-law and Yuuki-kun...

414
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:06,190
even Kin-chan is happy.

415
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,600
I ended up not going to Kobe.

416
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,460
I finally get to be with you,

417
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,720
and it makes me really happy.

418
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:33,170
This boisterousness made me realized
that I'm finally home.

419
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,240
I'm home.

420
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,360
Welcome home, Irie-kun.

421
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,600
We can stay together now.

422
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,760
Room #215, Kimura-san is removing
a tumor from the large intestine tomorrow.

423
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,890
- Okay.
- Yokoi-san is removing his stitches.

424
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:26,690
- Okay.
- He's so hot!

425
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,640
I can see Irie-kun dressed in a white robe all day long.

426
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,430
H-a-p-p-y.

427
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,560
It must be hard for you.

428
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,830
I think I underestimated him.

429
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,370
Nishigaki-sensei, you are Irie-kun...

430
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,930
Irie-sensei's mentor, aren't you?

431
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,220
How come an intern is more popular than his mentor?

432
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,660
Well... it's hard to say...

433
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,680
Irie-sensei... what is the condition of Ito-san, #202?

434
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,670
I prescribed primperan to the patient,

435
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,200
his condition hasn't improved.

436
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,610
So... how would you treat him, then?

437
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,950
I would perform enteroclysis, to determine which parts to work on, and

438
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,150
perform a right hemicolectomy or left hemicolectomy.

439
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,840
You have no flaws!

440
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,880
Not cute at all.
It's boring to be your mentor.

441
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,940
Kotoko-chan, you know he'll cheat on you
in a heartbeat. And you'll be miserable.

442
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,480
You should break up with him
before that happens.

443
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,600
After that, you can go out with me.

444
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,190
What do you think?

445
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,060
Well... Dr. Nishigaki...

446
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,170
- Ow!
- Dr. NIshigaki.

447
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,330
This is the patient record for Tsuda-san
who is having surgery this afternoon.

448
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:53,300
Oh... you don't even understand the joke.

449
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,490
Get ready since you will be my second assistant.

450
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,310
Yes.

451
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:02,080
I'm back.

452
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,360
Irie-san!

453
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,220
How long have you been loitering around?

454
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:10,900
You have been slacking since Dr. Irie came here.

455
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,150
I'm sorry.

456
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,870
I'm not sure if she can handle this.

457
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,210
Huh?

458
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,440
Irie-san, you'll be assisting the surgery this afternoon.

459
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,590
What?!

460
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,450
Isn't this your first time?

461
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,220
The surgery itself is quite simple, so no worry.
I'll be there to help you too.

462
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,010
Yes.

463
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,090
Assisting the surgery...? No way.

464
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,300
Perhaps...

465
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,550
Get ready since you are my second assistant.

466
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,490
Yes.

467
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,050
This is my first time assisting...

468
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,600
Maybe it will be with Irie-kun?

469
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,730
Do you know... the procedure?

470
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,080
Make sure you know the procedure before you go in.

471
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,260
Assistant Chief Nurse Shimizu, who is the surgeon?

472
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,070
The surgeion is...

473
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,660
Why are you here?

474
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,400
I'll be assisting you today, I'm Irie.

475
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,870
I'll be in your care.

476
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,780
Please... give me a break.

477
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,700
How am I suppose to work with her?

478
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,520
Alright then, let's get started.

479
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,550
Please pay close attention today,

480
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,380
since we have a troublemaker here.

481
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,660
Please distinguish between clean and unclean.

482
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,420
- Let's work hard.
- Let's work hard.

483
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,060
I can't make any mistakes.

484
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,470
I practiced so many times, so I should be fine.

485
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:54,570
I'll make Dr. Daijamori surprised.

486
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:58,990
Irie-kun..I'll..Work hard!

487
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,990
Scalpel.

488
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,750
Yes.

489
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,220
Oh no...

490
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,250
I'm having a cold sweat.

491
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,870
I'm feeling sick.

492
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,290
- Gauze.
- Y-yes.

493
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,520
Why are you wiping your face?

494
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,420
Hand it to me.

495
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,990
Oh, I'm sorry.

496
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,820
No, I'm going to faint.

497
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,230
Pean.

498
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,760
Hurry up, Pean!

499
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,540
O-okay.

500
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,090
I found it. Sorry for the wait.

501
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,440
[ Treatment Room ]

502
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,200
How dare you...

503
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,140
cause so many disturbances?

504
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,480
I'm sorry.

505
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,060
Good thing that surgery was completed safely.

506
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:42,200
Dr. Daijyamori's injury wasn't critical.

507
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,330
I'm so disturbed that you can't even complete a simple task.

508
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,000
Maybe it was too soon for you.

509
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,580
I've misjudged you.

510
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,620
Night shift?

511
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:26,160
I forgot... you have night duty.

512
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,540
Drink this, it'll wake you up.

513
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,090
Um, you know what? I... the truth is I...

514
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:03,000
The rumoured accident that resulted in injury, right?

515
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,330
Seems like quite a way to make your debut as an OR assistant.

516
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,540
As you'd expect, I'm a bit down.

517
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,190
To injure the hand of a doctor in the surgical department...

518
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm the worst as a nurse, aren't I?

519
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:23,350
Thinking about my action which put a patient's life at risk,

520
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,410
made me realize how serious my mistake was.

521
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,250
I thought that I might cause you trouble...

522
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,000
And ...

523
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,450
being apart from you is lonely

524
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,160
but...

525
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,980
I'm thinking to ask for a transfer from the surgical department to

526
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,250
dermatology or otolaryngology.

527
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,330
OK, I'll get going then. Thanks for the drink.

528
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,160
Yes, it's Irie.

529
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,200
Got it. I'll go right away.

530
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,410
Is it an emergency?

531
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,020
Yes, there was a car accident, and
three patients are arriving here shortly.

532
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,270
Three people!?

533
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,310
Other hospitals rejected them, so I have to go.

534
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,080
I'll go too!

535
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:28,440
Oh, Dr. Irie!

536
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,850
Please take this patient to the room.

537
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,770
He's stable now, so
I'll check on him after the surgery.

538
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,350
He has a compound fracture to his femur.

539
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,310
I understand.

540
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:39,020
Call me right away if anything changes.
Please take care of him until them.

541
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,330
Yes.

542
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,580
I wondered how it would work out, but it seems like it'll be fine.

543
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,750
Why... is his blood pressure dropping?

544
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,310
A blood vessel in his thigh might be ruptured.

545
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,400
Kotoko, call Dr. Nishigaki.

546
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,950
Ok.

547
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,670
Dr. Nishigaki, we have an emergency situation.

548
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:28,730
His blood pressure is down into the 50s.

549
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:31,830
I think the blood vessel in his thigh has ruptured...

550
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,770
What? No... Dr. Nishigaki!

551
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:39,000
Hello? Hello?

552
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,730
He can't leave the surgery room,
so he told us to wait.

553
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,300
No. If we wait any longer, it'll become dangerous.

554
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,840
But..

555
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,870
we must suture the blood vessel here.

556
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,300
I'll do it.

557
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,470
No, you can't. You are only an intern
and he told us to wait.

558
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,940
We don't have time to wait.

559
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,580
But if you do this, surely afterwards...!

560
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,060
I'll take all the responsibility.

561
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,480
No, I will call him again.

562
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,000
Kotoko.

563
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,230
Kotoko!

564
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,270
Yes?

565
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,750
Get changed into your gown now.

566
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,450
Be my support.

567
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,420
B-But..I..

568
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,240
I can't...! I'll do it again for sure...!

569
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,630
But... I'll cause trouble for you...

570
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,910
There's no time to argue, a patient's life is at risk.

571
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,630
I you don't do this now,
you won't be able to overcome.

572
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:42,200
After this, you can go to dermatology,
otolaryngology or wherever you like.

573
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:53,110
Then fine. I'll call another nurse.

574
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,950
Wait!

575
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,350
I'll... help you and...

576
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:01,750
save this patient!

577
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,370
Well said.

578
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,020
I can be Irie's support.

579
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,540
I'm not scared at all...

580
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,830
Not a bit...

581
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,730
Irie-kun, you're scared, right?

582
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,940
He doesn't have someone guiding him.

583
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,670
I still remember the mistake clearly

584
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,340
when I assisted Dr. Daijyamori's surgery.

585
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,020
But I have to support Irie-kun properly!

586
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,410
I won't cause him any trouble.

587
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,100
Scalpel.

588
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,660
Yes.

589
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,810
Gauze.

590
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,250
Yes.

591
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,060
If someone had to experience the worst-case scenario because of me...

592
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,620
that's scary. And plus, all of it will definitely be pinned on Irie-kun.

593
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,730
Forceps.

594
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes.

595
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,670
Kotoko, vitals.

596
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,090
Blood pressure is at 50/30 and

597
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,100
heart-rate is at 300.

598
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,290
What?

599
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,000
The heart rate is 160!

600
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,270
The mosquito clamp?

601
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,700
Yes!

602
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:07,690
I've got to get it together! I can't be a hindrance to Irie-kun!

603
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,630
Mosquito clamp!

604
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,450
Yes!

605
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm sorry!

606
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:25,050
My mind is totally blank... it's over...

607
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,060
The patient will... Irie-kun will... all because of me...!

608
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,040
What should I do!?

609
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:48,940
♫ Just to hear you say 'Good morning' ♫

610
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,250
♫ feel like we'll stay happy together forever. ♫

611
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:58,960
♫ I never knew this could be happening to me,
but thank you, my love.  ♫

612
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,820
♫ I never knew this could be happening to me,
but thank you, my love.  ♫

613
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,980
♫ I kissed you with an indifferent expression ♫

614
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,550
♫ But i'm the only one feeling it ♫

615
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,250
♫ But i'm the only one feeling it ♫

616
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:22,600
♫ I love you with my all, ♫

617
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:27,980
♫ No matter what you're like. ♫

618
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,930
♫ The love that understands all ♫

619
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,980
♫ We'll make that happen together.
So that we don't get separated ♫

620
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,270
♫ We'll make that happen together.
So that we don't get separated ♫

621
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:49,040
♫ Embrace me please ♫

622
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,170
- Stand up.
- Ow!
- All you have to do is to do what I say.

623
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,150
What are you doing?

624
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,020
I decided to do the surgery.
Kotoko, hurry up and go.

625
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,880
I can't let her assist all by herself.

626
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,600
Mosquito clamp. Please prepare for the suture.

627
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,300
It's unheard of!

628
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,270
You must take full responsibility.

629
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,980
Do you have a boyfriend ?

630
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,350
I don't have one...

631
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,420
You're acting like my girlfriend even though you aren't.

632
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,040
Sorry.

633
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,550
What's the matter?

634
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,170
I've been waiting for you.

635
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:34,440
Wait.
