1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,420
Kotorin

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,090
I will now introduce...

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,660
This is my wife, Irie Kotoko.

4
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,790
Hey, you sign it, too.

5
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:38,860
Okay.

6
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:45,750
I'm in your care, my wife.

7
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,210
9 months later
It's already our final year as undergraduates.

8
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,390
It's kind of sad, isn't it?

9
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,110
It seems I won't be able to come to school that often in the future.

10
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,670
I'm also pretty busy, too.

11
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,900
Even though I'm a magazine writer, in reality I have to run about a lot.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,810
We also have many end-of-year countdowns to attend.

13
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,250
I wish I had time to enjoy what's left of my undergraduate life.

14
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,400
You guys are busy with your part time jobs
at your future companies.

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,590
So we probably won't be able to see
each other very much, will we?

16
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,950
I got the job, but I am still on a trial period.

17
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,990
But you're lucky, Kotoko.

18
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,090
Having a doctor as a husband is just like
getting employed permanently.

19
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,370
You're set!

20
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,510
So lucky!

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,080
Tonan University.

22
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,070
Hello, Baby?

23
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,080
Is it really okay?

24
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,370
Just staying like this and not getting a job.

25
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,660
The thing I want to do...

26
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,910
Well, excuse me.

27
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,700
I don't understand English. I'm sorry.

28
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh no...not at all. You're welcome. Excuse me.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,770
Well, excuse me.

30
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:50,440
By the way, hello?
What is the literature department?

31
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,210
Good question...

32
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,480
That's wrong. Sorry. No, no, no.

33
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,300
Where would the literature department be?

34
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,800
Oh! Where is it?

35
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,270
I...go together...to literature department.

36
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,480
Please, let's go!

37
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,270
Okay! Thank you!

38
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,700
She understood!

39
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,130
I am Christine Robins.

40
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,590
From England...South...

41
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,450
Came! I came from England.

42
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm 19 years old.

43
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,050
Please call me Chris.

44
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,240
Okay?

45
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,590
Oh, okay! Chris!

46
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,200
I came...

47
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,100
for half a year...

48
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,900
to study.

49
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,710
My name is Kotoko Irie.

50
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,700
21 years old.

51
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,020
Kotoko.

52
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,690
Okay! Please take care of me.

53
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,330
Please take care of me, too!

54
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,350
Tonan University Medical School 
- Your husband is a doctor?

55
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,870
He's still a student.

56
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,080
Where are the classrooms?

57
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,320
Whatever. Let's just ask.

58
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,630
Excuse me.

59
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,440
Yes?

60
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,500
Do you know Irie-kun? He's a senior.

61
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,370
Irie?

62
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,220
Irie Naoki?

63
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,600
Yes! The genius!

64
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,330
Of course, Irie-kun is famous.

65
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,700
You are…?

66
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,860
A good friend? Or rather...

67
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,540
his wife?

68
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,040
I said it!

69
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes?

70
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,120
I was wondering about the girl that
was in genius Irie's heart, but...

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,870
You're a little different than I imagined.

72
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,670
What kind of laugh is that?

73
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,590
It's like he's trying to hint at something.

74
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,950
It's kind of unpleasant.

75
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,610
Kotoko?

76
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,400
Oh, Chris.

77
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,790
This girl, is she perhaps a foreign student?

78
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,190
Hi.

79
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,550
I am Seiichi Funatsu.

80
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,990
I am a medical student.

81
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,450
I am one of the top students here.

82
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,150
If you don't mind, I'll show you around?

83
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,500
I would like to see whether my English skills are world class.

84
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:43,160
I'm thankful, but I'm sorry.

85
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,290
You and my type...different.

86
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,960
My ideal…is high.

87
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,660
You're really not good.

88
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,080
So, I'm sorry.

89
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,270
Not good?

90
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,150
That bad?

91
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,500
Chris has high standards.

92
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,250
Kotoko! What are you doing?

93
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,870
Irie-kun!

94
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,820
Eh!

95
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,250
Did you need something?

96
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,380
This is Chris, an exchange student.

97
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,220
She's my classmate.

98
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,350
Chris, this is my husband Irie-kun.

99
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,250
Nice to meet you, Chris.

100
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,710
We're going to go to Father's restaurant

101
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:37,150
So if you're free, would you like to come too?

102
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,540
Is it okay if I go too?

103
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,330
What? What happened to Chris?

104
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,050
Shall I interpret for you?

105
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,120
Is it okay if I join you as well?

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,100
Of course, of course, of course.

107
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,660
Let's do that.

108
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,580
Chris.

109
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,910
By any chance, is Chris' ideal person, Irie-Kun?

110
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,480
If you play around too much it'll affect your grades.

111
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,630
Thank you for worrying about me Funatsu.

112
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,670
But even if I play a little my grades won't drop.

113
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:26,600
You can rest assured and stay as no.2.

114
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,720
What??

115
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,400
Alright! Let's have a showdown.

116
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:40,390
I will definitely smash you in the next thesis presentation.

117
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,430
That person...

118
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,650
Funatsu?

119
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,420
It's okay. Just leave him be.

120
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,800
I'll go once I'm done writing my report.

121
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,650
Aihara - Japanese Kitchen

122
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,410
It looks delicious!

123
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,520
Please don't hold back, and enjoy the food!

124
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,330
Thank you so much Kotoko's papa!

125
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,810
Irie-kun said he will come later.

126
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,680
I see.

127
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,350
It's delicious!

128
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,320
Chris is so cute...

129
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,140
I have a bad feeling about this.

130
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,530
Boss, I've finished what you asked me to do.

131
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,820
Good.

132
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,780
Oh Kotoko! I wanted to see you.

133
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,950
Irie-kun!

134
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,840
Welcome!

135
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,560
-You came!
-Good evening.

136
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,300
Darn it, why must Irie come at this time?

137
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,580
Hurry up and get a divorce.

138
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,830
I'm begging you.

139
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,270
This blonde girl is...

140
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,720
So Chris really does...

141
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,990
Why aren't you saying anything, blondie?
Do you understand Japanese?

142
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,590
Hello!

143
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,680
I love Kotoko.

144
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
Kin-chan, this is Chris.

145
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,840
She's studying abroad at my university for half a year.

146
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,050
This is Ikezawa Kinnosuke or Kin-chan.

147
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,900
He was originally my classmate,

148
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,940
but now he's an amazing chef!

149
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,250
What's wrong, Chris?

150
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,230
Kotoko, I'm going to be honest!

151
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,580
I've found someone I like!

152
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,940
I've never felt this way before!

153
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,210
Kotoko might feel bad, but . . .

154
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,270
That means...

155
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,850
Please let me say it.

156
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,810
The person that I like . . .

157
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,270
No! Irie-kun's my husband!

158
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,080
Hey.

159
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,600
Oh my..

160
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:25,890
Kinnosuke!

161
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,270
Oh my god!

162
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,050
Are you okay?

163
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,350
Oh my love, are you okay?

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,670
Sorry Naoki-kun, for having you help out.

165
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,100
Not at all, I haven't been much help.

166
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,280
You really helped us.

167
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,820
That Kinnosuke. We are so busy and he goes and faints.

168
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,170
He's sleeping so happily.

169
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,430
It's my fault.

170
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,720
I feel bad.

171
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,480
To be kissed and then pass out...

172
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,790
Kinnosuke's sleeping face is cute, too!

173
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,340
You really think that, huh?

174
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,890
Obviously!

175
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,320
Do you have a problem?

176
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,830
No! No!

177
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,640
If you're fine with it then there's no problem!

178
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,470
The person with a problem is you.

179
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,650
I wasn't able to say it because I'm your friend.

180
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,170
But because we're friends I'm going to tell you.

181
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,380
Kotoko, you have bad taste in men.

182
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,420
When I looked at Naoki I thought,

183
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,890
you really have no sense of handsomeness.

184
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,130
What?!

185
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,460
That would be you, wouldn't it?

186
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,750
What part of Irie-kun...

187
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,450
Love is blind. But I have good eyes.

188
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,650
Kinnosuke is the best! He is like a gold medal.

189
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,550
Kin-chan is not cool at all!

190
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,550
Irie-kun is a hundred times cooler!

191
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,770
That's why I said you have no sense of handsomeness.

192
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,650
I'm probably going to marry Kinnosuke!

193
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,680
I've decided! I've already decided.

194
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,210
You're really the one who has no sense of handsomeness!

195
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,580
It's so weird to wake up to this...

196
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,060
Several Weeks Later

197
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,060
You're leaving tomorrow for three days?

198
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,740
Yeah, three days starting tomorrow.

199
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,860
I'm going to an academic conference in Kobe.

200
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:45,640
Could it be about the presentation you were selected for recently?

201
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,420
Yeah.

202
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,330
Woah, awesome!

203
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,890
Isn't it awesome!?

204
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,580
Isn't Irie-Kun awesome?

205
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,670
It's not anything special.

206
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,010
That's not true!

207
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,740
Irie-kun is amazing!

208
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,570
He's on a whole different level!

209
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,690
Speaking of level, how'd it go with Funatsu-kun?

210
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,640
Oh, him...

211
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,920
Hey!

212
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,500
Why wasn't I chosen? This is a conspiracy.

213
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,880
No matter how you look at it, I'm far better.

214
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,350
Hey, Irie-kun.

215
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,730
No matter what, you know that I'm better, right?

216
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,800
If you're a man, why don't you acknowledge this fair and square!

217
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,630
I understand.

218
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,150
Right!

219
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,470
I understand very well.

220
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,690
You finally understand!

221
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,300
You really like to be in second.

222
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,920
Calm down! Calm down!

223
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,770
Let go of me! Let go of me!

224
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,460
Irie! Let go of me! Stop it!

225
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,120
Stop it!
Calm down!

226
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,020
Let me go!

227
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,420
As expected of Irie-kun!

228
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,090
What a waste.

229
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:06,150
If it's him, he could've been a good surgeon.

230
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,800
Is Funatsu-kun really that good?

231
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,910
Yeah.

232
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,360
Nobody can match his surgical skills.

233
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,190
Even you?

234
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,220
Well, I wonder.

235
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,860
That amazing, huh?

236
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,500
What will happen with that twisted personality.

237
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,650
But to not see Irie-kun for three days, I'll be lonely.

238
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:33,980
It's just me and you again.

239
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,010
What's wrong?

240
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,960
Nothing, ever since lunch time
I've been feeling a little unwell.

241
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,540
You probably just over ate again.

242
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,390
You immediately think it's that...

243
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,930
Maybe you have a slight fever.

244
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,630
Open your mouth.

245
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,930
Lie down and show your stomach.

246
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:13,800
Irie-kun! It's like playing doctor!
Isn't it something perverted?

247
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,770
It's not a game.

248
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,660
What are you thinking?

249
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,600
Get some rest.

250
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,690
Yes.

251
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,260
While Irie-kun is gone I'll be with you.

252
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,640
You'll be with me.

253
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,110
Yes! We'll be together!

254
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,480
We're coming.

255
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,160
Jinko, Satomi! You came all the way here?

256
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,070
What an amazing room!

257
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,940
How are you feeling?

258
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,310
I'm still feeling a little nauseous.

259
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,420
Since Irie-kun isn't around, I have been resting since morning.

260
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,090
That will only make your stomach worse.

261
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,870
The way you ate your food yesterday, it isn't surprising.

262
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,970
You ate 8 pieces of cake.

263
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,860
I kept it secret to Irie-kun.

264
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,780
Saying 'Haha'...

265
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,030
I brought fruits. Shall we eat them?

266
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,630
Oh, I'm so happy!

267
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,390
I've been wanting to eat something sour.

268
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,670
Are there any grapefruits?

269
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,080
Well, there probably is.

270
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,520
Kotoko-chan…just now you said
...grapefruits?

271
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,350
Yes.

272
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,860
Nausea.

273
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,370
You have nausea, right?

274
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,880
You want to eat something sour, right?

275
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,910
You have a fever, right?

276
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,390
What about your period?

277
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:43,120
Come to think of it, it's a little late.

278
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,540
Oh no!

279
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,700
Kotoko-chan, you're pregnant.

280
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,590
Yes, yes, yes! That's it!

281
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,790
There is no mistaking it.

282
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,790
Kotoko, is that true?

283
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,090
- I don't know..
- Please think carefully.

284
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,480
Do you have any memory of doing that?

285
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,090
Doing anything together?

286
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,810
That...is something I remember...

287
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,310
I've been waiting for this day!

288
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,910
Kotoko and Naoki's baby~

289
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,350
It's like a dream!

290
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,760
But Mom...

291
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,790
No, Kotoko-chan! Listen to me, I've given birth
to two kids. My instinct is right!

292
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,980
I have a hunch!

293
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,070
At such an important time like this, why is Naoki away?

294
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,210
Oh, yes! I have to go find papa!

295
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,420
Aihara-san, too!

296
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:40,320
I want to tell the whole world about this!

297
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,320
Please calm down!

298
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,360
I'm pregnant?

299
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,500
My and Irie-kun's baby is inside my stomach?

300
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,400
That's awesome, Kotoko!

301
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,800
That's amazing, congratulations!

302
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,460
It hasn't hit me yet, but..

303
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,280
Is it true?

304
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,370
Is there a baby?

305
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,610
Kotoko!

306
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,750
You…I heard you're pregnant?

307
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,240
Is it true, Kotoko-chan?

308
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,640
Well, I haven't gone to the hospital yet.

309
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,180
No. There is no mistaking it.

310
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,300
Because I'm the veteran here.

311
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,550
Isn't it better to go to the hospital with Naoki, anyway?

312
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:41,560
Right, Grandfathers?

313
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,460
Grandfather?!

314
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,880
Grandfather.

315
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,780
Grandfather!

316
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,890
Congratulations, Kotoko-chan.

317
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,640
Good for you!

318
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:10,740
Congratulations, Kotoko.

319
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,300
Please take care of yourself, won't you?

320
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,290
Hello, Aihara-san.

321
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,280
Oh, Matsumoto-san.

322
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,550
I've heard all about it. Congratulations.

323
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,480
You're pregnant, aren't you?

324
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,560
About that.. from whom did you hear..

325
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,970
Oh, don't you know? Irie's mother is spreading
the news like wind.

326
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,750
But from now on, you don't have to
do any more studying which was not for you.

327
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,430
You've worked hard.

328
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:48,310
I've been surprised by you all along.

329
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,760
See you.

330
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,670
Kotoko's pregnancy news is spreading around the world!

331
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,460
This isn't a laughing matter..

332
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,720
Even my lecturer congratulated me,
and on top of that in the middle of class!

333
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,280
It's still so early, I don't know how to respond.

334
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,160
Isn't that good? It  is  something to be congratulated for.

335
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,890
That's right.

336
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:20,800
Look here, it's so small and cute!

337
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,690
This one is a TRISTAN shirt.

338
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,060
Even diaper covers come in many cute designs.

339
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,930
And this one has angel wings printed on it.
So cute!!

340
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,570
But mother, everything is pink.

341
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:45,430
Of course! I would definitely want a girl!

342
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:50,220
-Kotoko-chan, I'm relying on you.
-Yes.

343
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,900
Yes.

344
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,690
I'm back.

345
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:58,880
Here, here, please come in.

346
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,140
Kotoko look at these.

347
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,810
Even though it might be a little too early..

348
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:09,430
I already went shopping for children's toys.

349
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:11,240
Papa, you too?

350
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,840
Eh? Mama too? Such coincidence!

351
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,680
Thank you!

352
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,330
Look at this, look at this.

353
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,790
Mr. Truck...

354
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,140
And this too, Mr. Aeroplane.

355
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,130
Eh, Papa. Why are they all toys for boys?

356
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,750
Oh? Well, Mama, you see..

357
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:38,270
Since it's the first child, I thought it would be a boy.

358
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,130
What are you talking about? It's definitely a girl!

359
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,030
- It's definitely a boy.
- No. Girl!

360
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:48,190
-A first grandchild is a boy!
-No! It's a girl!

361
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,210
- Boy!
- It's obviously going to be a girl!

362
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,270
- Definitely boy!
- No! A girl is better!

363
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:57,220
Seriously, these two. How tiresome.

364
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,240
- It's a boy!
- No! It's a girl!

365
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,280
- Boy!
- No, girls are better!

366
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,790
- It's a boy!
- No, girl!

367
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,250
Kotoko!

368
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,010
I brought this from the restaurant!

369
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,270
Aihara's special pregnancy meal!

370
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,510
Please eat.

371
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,660
- Dad..
- Don't hesitate, eat up.

372
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,090
Oh, I forgot the chopsticks!

373
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,100
Well, that..

374
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,190
Now it's slowly sinking in.

375
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:44,530
Irie-kun's baby... will you be cute?

376
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:50,120
When Irie-kun comes back tomorrow, I wonder
what his reaction will be.

377
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,140
Will he be happy?

378
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,000
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in TOKYO

379
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,860
If you're Naoki, ring twice! - Mama

380
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:17,530
This is good.

381
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,610
- He's back!
- It's brother!

382
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,720
Alright, here we go..

383
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,970
Congratulations!

384
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:41,840
What on earth is this prank for?

385
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,860
Do you want to know, Naoki?

386
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,930
I definitely want to know.

387
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:51,670
Kotoko, why don't you tell him yourself?

388
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,690
Oh, welcome back.

389
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,630
I'm back home.

390
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,060
Well, you know...

391
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,320
You know..

392
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,290
You know..

393
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,340
Stop with the "you know."

394
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,170
Mm! Err...

395
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,280
You know…sorry...

396
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,560
Well...

397
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,990
Baby...

398
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,680
What? What did you say?

399
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,290
I think we are going to have a baby.

400
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,630
Yes!!!

401
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,100
- Really?
-I guess.

402
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,100
- Have you been to the hospital?
- Not yet.

403
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,980
- Let's go.
-Eh?

404
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,640
Go? Where to?

405
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,380
Gynecology Clinic

406
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:14,110
Is it embarrassing for a man like you to be here?

407
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:16,090
Not really.

408
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,450
I'm going to be a doctor. The smell of hospitals
doesn't bother me.

409
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,640
Hey, Irie-kun?

410
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,610
When you heard the news about the baby,
what did you think?

411
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,890
Irie-san? Irie Kotoko-san? Please come in.

412
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,180
Yes.

413
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm going.

414
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,970
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

415
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,790
I see.

416
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,060
As I thought, it was a mistake?

417
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,740
Yes, it was. I'm so sorry!

418
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,320
I made a big, big, big mistake.

419
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:05,000
Just because my stomach hurt..
My period is coming soon, too..

420
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,820
Seriously.

421
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,350
You also jumped to conclusions without visiting a doctor.

422
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,970
Although I guess the one who blew up the matter was my mother.

423
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,290
It was my fault that they had such expectations.

424
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,150
If there is no baby, then there is no baby.
There is nothing we can do about it.

425
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,630
But...

426
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,020
to say there is no baby…

427
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,540
What's the matter?

428
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,540
Are you feeling down?

429
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,500
Irie-kun.

430
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:04,000
Let's go inside before you catch a cold.

431
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,360
It's okay.

432
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,120
Even if I hurt my stomach I don't catch colds.

433
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,760
I'm stupid after all.

434
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,100
You're right.

435
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,680
What? You should have corrected me. So mean!

436
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,620
How could I correct you?

437
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,950
Hey, Irie-kun,

438
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,570
Yeah?

439
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:38,510
Isn't it nice to look at the same sky together like this?

440
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,650
To always look at the same view from now on would be nice.

441
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,430
Yeah.

442
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:04,070
I've been thinking for some time.

443
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,460
Of course, I know that my thoughts are too naive.

444
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,680
Honestly, I don't know yet if I will succeed or not.

445
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,200
What do you mean?

446
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,740
I...

447
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,360
I have been thinking of what I want to do the most.

448
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,060
You'll probably make fun of me, but...

449
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,960
I...

450
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,010
the thing I want to do most,

451
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:48,760
is to help you with your job.

452
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,700
In other words... A nurse.

453
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,800
Today in the hospital, as I saw the doctors and nurses
I confirmed it with myself.

454
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,680
From now on, I will study properly, and then graduate.

455
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,820
I want to become a nurse.

456
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,680
It's a profession that handles life. So you might say it's impossible..

457
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,000
But I thought this out completely.

458
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,840
That's why, I want to be a nurse.

459
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:32,020
What do you think?

460
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,820
What is there to think?

461
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,250
As you know, nurses deal with people's lives.

462
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,050
One mistake can cost a life.

463
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,240
I understand. I've thought about it thoroughly.

464
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,040
Unlike the part-time jobs you've had before,
it requires more serious determination.

465
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,780
I know! I have thought it through.

466
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,580
Being a doctor, being a nurse;

467
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,140
unless you have the feeling of wanting
to save someone, you can't do it.

468
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,480
Do you really have those feelings?

469
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,240
I want to help you!

470
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,460
I want to be useful to you!

471
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:20,380
If I become a nurse and help patients, I will be helping you indirectly, won't I?

472
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,980
Then I'll save patients with everything I've got!

473
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,920
I may not have confidence in anything else.
But I at least have confidence in that!

474
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,790
Oh you..

475
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,830
Irie-kun?

476
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:47,350
Even if I try to stop you, you won't anyway. Right?

477
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,170
If that's the case then do everything you can do.

478
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,010
Irie-kun.

479
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,890
Well, in order to become a nurse, you have to get a nursing degree.

480
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,230
That's if you pass the exams.

481
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,710
That's right, exams.

482
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,350
Of course, I will have to take tests.

483
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,970
Of course.

484
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,210
Alright! I will do my best!

485
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,160
At the gynecologist,

486
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,280
you asked me what I thought when
I was told you were pregnant.

487
00:34:54,940 --> 00:35:00,260
At that time, when I was told we were having a baby;

488
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,400
honestly, for a moment my mind
went completely blank.

489
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,310
Huh?

490
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:17,970
But while I was at the hospital waiting
for you while you were being examined,

491
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,390
I thought about a lot of things.

492
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:25,170
I had a feeling you weren't pregnant.

493
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:31,290
But if, if there was a baby;

494
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,360
for that short while, I had a father feeling.

495
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,120
How was that? The father feeling?

496
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,400
It was pretty good.

497
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,820
Me, too.

498
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,520
I've started to want a kid, just a little bit.

499
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,180
Huh?

500
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,140
Should we make one?

501
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,200
Irie-kun?

502
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:24,970
I also... I also wish to have Irie-kun's baby.

503
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,890
that short time

504
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:30,170
I was very happy!

505
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,280
That's why some day...

506
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,880
some day, let's really have one.

507
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,880
A baby.

508
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,690
I don't understand anything.

509
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,270
Kotoko, we're going home.

510
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,930
Irie-kun!

511
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,550
I don't understand a thing. Help me.

512
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:18,270
Why me? Weren't you going to work hard on your own.

513
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,210
We're going.

514
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,640
Just a little! Just a little.

515
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,390
I'm also busy!

516
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:30,140
Why don't you understand?

517
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,540
I just taught it to you!

518
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,100
Ah..well..

519
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,690
You have to apply this formula here.

520
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,060
Huh? What formula do you mean?

521
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,800
What?

522
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,460
Irie-kun?

523
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,780
Think a little bit yourself!

524
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,060
What?

525
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:02,300
I was just thinking your angry face is cool, too.

526
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,280
You...

527
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,310
That face is wonderful, too!

528
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,830
Idiot!

529
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,310
Sorry.

530
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:15,370
Getting always scolded like this everyday,

531
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,810
just like that, days and months have passed.

532
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,780
Tonan University Nursing Examination

533
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,890
Ah, I'm getting nervous.

534
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,930
Even if you're nervous, there's nothing you can do now.
There is no point in getting nervous.

535
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,250
I know that..

536
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,590
What I'm worried about is...

537
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,490
What?

538
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,750
Whether you can fill in your exam number correctly or not.

539
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,830
I can write at least that much!

540
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,520
It's not here! My entrance ID isn't here!

541
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,500
You left it on top of the desk.

542
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,360
Thank God.

543
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,220
Are you seriously okay?

544
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:16,040
I'm okay! I'm strong.

545
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,820
No failing! Let's go!

546
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,480
Irie-kun,

547
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,200
I love you.

548
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,490
There I go!

549
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,780
Aihara

550
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,450
Want to have some drinks? My treat tonight.

551
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,890
For real? Thank you!

552
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,830
Kinnosuke! I've been waiting for you.

553
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,230
Should we go home together?

554
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,690
Chris!

555
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,590
How many times must I tell you?

556
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,730
Right now, I ONLY LOVE Kotoko.

557
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:27,370
Even though she has married, my feelings have not changed.

558
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,250
Also you, what are you doing out so late by yourself?
At a place like this, too?

559
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,890
It's dangerous.

560
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,150
That's true, but...

561
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,560
I guess there's no choice. Only for tonight, I'll..

562
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,360
Sorry, Chris-chan! Kinnosuke already has plans for tonight.

563
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,400
Okay! Lets go drinking!

564
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,790
Come on, Kinnosuke!

565
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,730
See, that's how it is.

566
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,730
Kinnosuke!

567
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,340
What are you still loitering about for? You should hurry back home.

568
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,630
Kinnosuke!

569
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,570
Yes!

570
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,960
April 2, Wednesday

571
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,270
Kinnosuke...

572
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,130
There's no more time..

573
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,740
Congratulations, Kin-chan!

574
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,880
I have to return to England.

575
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,490
Don't go, Chris!

576
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:15,110
I wish to see him one more time.

577
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:16,170
Damn it!

578
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,490
Ta-da!

579
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:22,330
If you pass, let's go on a date?

580
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,950
Is what I was told!

581
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:32,230
Seems like the couples that ride the boat
at this park break up.

582
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,250
So what will you do?
