1
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,590
When I open my eyes, Irie-kun is right next to me.

2
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,210
I'm so happy!

3
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,960
Perhaps... I am the most happiest person in the world?

4
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,480
It's already been 2 and a half years since the marriage,

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,580
and still my love for Irie-kun reaches a new record everyday!

6
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,300
Good morning.

7
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,010
Don't look at me with your swollen face.

8
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,890
It's not good to look at.

9
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,610
Forget about what he said now.

10
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,150
I love you.

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,200
Good morning.

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,670
Good morning, Kotoko-chan.

13
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,020
You could have slept a bit more since it's the spring holidays.

14
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,290
I'm your unchanging Daughter-in-law...

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,570
Oh my.

16
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,920
Nice Mother-in-law!

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,670
Good morning, Mama.

18
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,660
And Kotoko-chan.

19
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,610
Good morning.

20
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:44,750
Good morning, Father.

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,390
Shall I make you some coffee?

22
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,310
Oh~! Thank you, Kotoko-chan!

23
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,460
Nice Father-in-law!

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,640
Kotoko!

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,120
You washed my shirt with my student handbook in a pocket.

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,660
You noticed that?

27
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,630
It won't fit into a pocket now!

28
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,510
Forget about him, too.

29
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,530
- Good morning
- Good morning!

30
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,400
Kotoko, can you make me some coffee?

31
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,660
Of course~!

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,580
And... And...

33
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,190
The coolest person in the world - my husband!

34
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,440
This happiness will never end... was what I thought.

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,830
Until that time.

36
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,980
Oh, I forgot to mention,

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,440
but Rika-chan will stay with us for a while starting tomorrow.

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,180
Rika?
- Rika will?

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,950
So she came back.

40
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,460
That's right! In 7 years!

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,310
Who is Rika-chan?

42
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:57,800
That's right. You didn't know, right?

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,180
She is Naoki and Yuki's cousin.

44
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,520
You're incomparable to her.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,760
She is really smart and pretty.

46
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,790
Until she went to America because of her dad's job 7 years ago,

47
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,490
she used to come here and play with these two.

48
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,590
Why will she stay here for a while?

49
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,240
Oh, her family will come back in May,

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,860
but Rika-chan will go to a high school here in April and came back by herself.

51
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,870
So, for a month, until her family comes back here,

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,100
we agreed to let her stay here with us.

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,490
That's how it is. So Rika is coming back.

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,150
What kind of girl is Rika-chan who makes woman hater Yuki-kun this happy?

55
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,230
As I recall, Rika-chan used to win

56
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,250
piano competitions and cooking competitions, right?

57
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,410
She is cheerful and nice, isn't she?

58
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:00,150
Yes, she has been bright ever since she was little.

59
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,590
So Rika-chan is like a perfect person.

60
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,190
So different from idiot Kotoko.

61
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,120
Think of her as your little sister. Please take care of her.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,160
Okay.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,020
So heavy!

64
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,450
It feels like my arms are being torn.

65
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,990
I'm almost there.

66
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,550
I'm sorry!

67
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,370
No, I'm sorry!

68
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,200
Sorry.
- Sorry!

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,330
Thank you.

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,760
So you were coming to our house, right?

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,100
Are you Rika-chan? You're Rika-chan, right?

72
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,860
No, I'm not.

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,220
You're not...

74
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,890
I'm sorry.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,450
Thank you.

76
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,340
I'm so sorry.

77
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,570
It's okay.

78
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,510
Perhaps you're Yuki's friend?

79
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,620
What?

80
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,320
Excuse me, then!

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,200
Wait a minute!

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,330
I'm home.

83
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,420
Welcome back.

84
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,770
Seriously.

85
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,550
Look in front of you.

86
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,980
I was.

87
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,070
You suddenly ran into me.

88
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:01,600
She seems to be about the same age as Yuki-kun.

89
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,020
Onii-chan!

90
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,110
Oh, Yuki.

91
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,660
Yuki, there was...

92
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,050
Rika. Rika is here!

93
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,300
Hey Rika!

94
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,590
Wow. She is so cute!

95
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,560
Naoki!

96
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,190
Naoki, you've become more handsome again.

97
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,120
You, too. You've become prettier as well.

98
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,800
What is this?!

99
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,740
♫KISS what I've longed for♫

100
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,530

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,070

Mischievous Kiss 2 ~Love in TOKYO~

122
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
Thank you for doing this for me today.

123
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,390
I'm so happy nobody has changed.

124
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,730
Let's toast for Rika-chan's safe return

125
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,540
and her becoming a part of our family for a while.

126
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,840
Cheers!

127
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,470
- Thank you.
- Yes, welcome back.

128
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,450
Cheers! Thank you.

129
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,450
Thank you.

130
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,390
Nice to meet you, Kotoko-san.

131
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,840
Nice to meet you.

132
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,530
So you go to school from tomorrow, right?

133
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,640
Yes, I'm going to Sumiregaoka Gakuin.
(gakuin: school)

134
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,430
Sumiregaoka Gakuin?

135
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,540
The one that's very famous and for the intelligent...?

136
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,620
Yeah, well because it's kind of in my neighbourhood.

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,380
It's not the kind of school that you can enter...

138
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,110
just because it's in you neighborhood, right?

139
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,910
I heard you scored full marks for the transfer admission test.

140
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,070
Full marks?!

141
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,170
Kotoko, you should learn from Rika.

142
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,050
Ah, but Kotoko-san is more amazing, don't you think?

143
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,520
Which part of Kotoko? Better than you?

144
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,670
Well, I think capturing Naoki's heart is
a hundred times harder than getting full marks on a test.

145
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,360
Now that you mention it, that seems true!

146
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,420
Onii-chan is stubborn.

147
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:08,420
We were so surprised to learn Naoki got married.

148
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,340
Kotoko-san is great to win the heart of Naoki who's been known as a woman hater.

149
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,690
I did try my best.

150
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,470
But you approached him, right?

151
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,720
Yes.

152
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,610
I thought so. Otherwise ...

153
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:33,970
Bummer. I should've claimed him before going to America.

154
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:41,430
I know she is his cousin, but she is getting too clingy.

155
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,060
Rika-chan!

156
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,960
Enough with touching Naoki!

157
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,370
Why don't you eat my special lasagna?

158
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,750
Wow, it looks delicous!

159
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,470
I missed your cooking so much!

160
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,000
Here you go.

161
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,960
Isn't that...

162
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,300
a serious crisis?

163
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,610
I thought so.

164
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,110
She's a lively high schooler.

165
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,640
Face, style and brain. They're all perfect, right?

166
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,970
-Yes.
- And...

167
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,360
they're cousins who grew up together.

168
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,160
She has a past with Irie-san that you
don't know anything about.

169
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
They hugged each other suddenly ...

170
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,880
"Naoki~!"

171
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,070
She called his name so casually.

172
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,040
She's not bad. Such an admirable enemy.

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,890
What do you mean an enemy?

174
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,930
She is, isn't she?

175
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:46,260
To you,

176
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,110
and to me, too.

177
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,790
But there is no way that she would have feelings for Irie-kun.

178
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah. Probably.

179
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,240
It's obvious! What are you saying?

180
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,260
Hey, we're talking about Irie-san here!

181
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,750
-Are you sure?
- I am absolutely sure.

182
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,570
This cream parfait is delicious.

183
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,490
She really is cheerful and seems like
a good girl, doesn't she?

184
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,450
It's just, I feel a bit left out.

185
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,480
Like I'm being alienated.

186
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,630
I see.

187
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,620
Your biggest problem this time...

188
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,000
is his family.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,880
What?

190
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,540
Up until now they were always on your side,

191
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,710
but now they're all on her side.

192
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:42,530
Don't exaggerate.

193
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,250
You're too soft.

194
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,480
This is no time to be talking so complacently!

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,310
While everyone is making such a fuss of her,

196
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,590
Irie-san...

197
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:56,690
may be taken from you before you know it.

198
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,920
N-No way.

199
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:03,550
You will be completely forgotten.

200
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,490
Moto-chan!

201
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,610
Thanks for the dessert.

202
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,080
What?

203
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,500
Kotoko-san.

204
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,320
Rika-chan.

205
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,740
So many guys have been trying to pick me up until now.

206
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,600
Pick you up?

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,050
Guys here are so immature.

208
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,620
Is that okay?

209
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,480
The guys in my class aren't great either.
Not one of them is good-looking.

210
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,970
I grew up with Naoki, so no one else
measures up.

211
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,230
I have high standards.

212
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:56,760
Poor things. Being compared to Irie-kun.

213
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,560
Hey, Kotoko-san...

214
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,890
Naoki...

215
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,430
Could you give him to me?

216
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,650
What?

217
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,770
It's fine, right?

218
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,390
Give him to me.

219
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,870
R-Rika-chan...that's...

220
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:24,380
Just look at your face! I'm kidding.

221
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,930
Kidding. Just kidding.

222
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,550
Maybe I should just let it go...

223
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,070
Who is it? Mother might be doing laundry?

224
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,440
Kotoko-san.

225
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,870
Rika-chan! What is it?

226
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:01,150
Let's take a bath together!

227
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,400
Rika-chan..that's a little...

228
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,660
We're both girls, so it's fine!

229
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,220
That's a bit...

230
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,810
She has a great figure.

231
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,610
Hey, Kotoko-san...

232
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,900
you're the one who proposed, aren't you?

233
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,440
Of course not.

234
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,960
Really?

235
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,720
I always seem to end up following Rika-chan's pace.

236
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,010
No, no, no! Don't get caught up!

237
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,950
I have to be confident! confident!

238
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,500
She's just a high school girl.

239
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,630
And I am Irie-kun's wife!

240
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,360
Can I ask one more question?

241
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,390
What is it?

242
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,360
Is Naoki good at kissing?

243
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,060
What?!

244
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,580
Well...

245
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,030
I don't know...

246
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:18,180
I've really only kissed Irie-kun, so...

247
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,660
Really?

248
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,110
Then you wouldn't really know.

249
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,990
I had lots of boyfriends while I was in the US,

250
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,330
so I kissed quite a bit.

251
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,220
No.

252
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,530
I feel dizzy now.

253
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,940
I think I'm done for now.

254
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,680
But...

255
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,220
the best kisser so far

256
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,820
is Naoki.

257
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,450
Naoki's really good...

258
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:05,800
at kissing.

259
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,100
What did she say?

260
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,420
I'm jealous. You can kiss Naoki whenever.

261
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,840
I really want to kiss him one more time.

262
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,860
But there are all kinds of kisses.

263
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:26,380
Like the kind of kiss you give your childhood friend on their cheek.

264
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,770
I was in 5th grade and Naoki was a junior in high school.

265
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,200
It was on the lips, of course.

266
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,410
What?!

267
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,540
I think it was both of our first kisses.

268
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,890
This can't be true!!!

269
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,440
Kotoko-san?!

270
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,590
Irie-kun's first kiss...

271
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,030
wasn't with me but with Rika?

272
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:03,260
Kotoko-san!

273
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,900
Somebody...tell me it's a lie...

274
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,540
Irie-kun...Irie-kun...

275
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,970
Irie...

276
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,580
Kotoko-san, I started dating Naoki.

277
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,090
What?

278
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,470
What are you saying?! Irie-kun's married to me!

279
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,230
No matter how you look at it, I and Naoki look better.

280
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,950
And I kissed Naoki first.

281
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,440
-Right, Naoki?
-Yeah.

282
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,100
That's right.

283
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,820
Naoki and I, it was both our first kiss.

284
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,480
Hey, Naoki.

285
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,470
Let's kiss in front of her.

286
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,220
Sure.

287
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,840
Stop it!

288
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,040
What? It was a dream?

289
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,960
I slept in!

290
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,280
Oh, good morning, Kotoko-san.

291
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,830
Are you alright?

292
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,040
You fainted last night. You could have slept some more.

293
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,180
Oh, I borrowed your apron.

294
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,660
Naoki, you like omelets. Do you want some?

295
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,850
-Yes.
- Me, too.

296
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,480
-Okay, leave it to me
-Rika-chan, it's okay! I will do it!

297
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,220
But I am better at making this.

298
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,060
You don't know until you do it, right?

299
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:58,340
It's okay. You can rest, Kotoko-san.

300
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,700
What's up, you two?

301
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,750
I said I will do it!

302
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,600
- You want to know about Rika?
- You would know, right?

303
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,470
Yeah. We were close since we were young.

304
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,790
So we three were like siblings.

305
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:03,710
Does Rika-chan like...

306
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,890
Irie-kun?

307
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,040
Not sure.

308
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,840
But I really liked Rika.

309
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,230
So I asked her to live with us,

310
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,370
and she said this to me;

311
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:33,280
if she gets married to my brother, then she will become my real sister.

312
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,880
Marriage?

313
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,060
Yeah. I wanted her to be my sister, so...

314
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,200
she asked for me to help to get her married to my brother.

315
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,980
And I promised her...

316
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,760
Kotoko-san, can you give Naoki to me?

317
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,260
She has liked Irie-kun since she was young.

318
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,060
Is she serious about it?

319
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,370
Alright. This should do.

320
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,540
Wow, Kotoko-san. You're early.

321
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,970
You, too.

322
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,250
What happened this morning?
- You guys are getting along!

323
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,570
That's great!

324
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,350
Good morning.

325
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,250
- Irie-kun!
- Naoki!

326
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,240
Naoki! This is really good. Eat it.

327
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,000
Irie-kun! I made this myself. Have it.

328
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,820
I am not going to eat all that in the morning.

329
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,960
No way. Please~

330
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,140
So cruel. I made this for you.

331
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,640
Seriously. What should I have first?

332
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,600
Fish, fish. Here you go.

333
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,670
So bad.

334
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,090
Naoki, eat this too.

335
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,160
- It's really good.
- Really?

336
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,200
Kotoko-chan, don't be discouraged!

337
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,900
Why?

338
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,400
Kotoko. Coffee.

339
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,590
I will bring you some.

340
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,400
It's okay.

341
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:30,430
I like her coffee.

342
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,170
I will bring it to you!

343
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,750
Kotoko-san.

344
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,550
Rika-chan, what's up? What about school?

345
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,870
I...

346
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,290
like Naoki.

347
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:12,670
I liked him from the start.

348
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,070
Give Naoki back.

349
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:19,210
What are you saying?

350
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,970
She is serious. She is serious about this.

351
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,720
If I didn't go to America,

352
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,150
Naoki wouldn't have married you.

353
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,260
How would you know that?

354
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,870
Naoki liked me!

355
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,520
We exchanged a kiss, too.

356
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,600
Naoki was holding me tight.

357
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,520
We were in a good mood.

358
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,040
That doesn't matter. I don't know how he felt at that time.

359
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,340
Because all I could do was watch him from far away.

360
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,760
And he noticed me little by little and asked me to marry him!

361
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,580
Little by little?

362
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,760
You forced yourself on him!

363
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,160
No, I didn't!

364
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,220
What is this?

365
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:22,480
Who do you think you are? How stupid!

366
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,520
Give that back! Give that back!

367
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,900
You're in your own little world.

368
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,120
How stupid.

369
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,710
Enough!

370
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,170
Rika!

371
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,390
Naoki!

372
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,460
Naoki, it hurts.

373
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,820
Rika, let me see your leg.

374
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,860
Irie-kun, I didn't mean...
- Enough!

375
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,160
What are you trying to do against a high school student?

376
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,400
You have been acting weird, recently.

377
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
Can you stand up? I will take you home.

378
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:43,550
That's not it...

379
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,200
Naoki carried Rika away. Far away.

380
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,170
Kotoko-chan!

381
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,090
We brought home your drunk daughter.

382
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,910
So you're Kotoko-chan's friends.

383
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,690
Yes.

384
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,770
Thank you.

385
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,350
I'm sorry.

386
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:21,250
She's been crying since the morning, saying she injured a kid named Rika so she can't go home.

387
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:24,760
We tried to comfort her and went out for a drink but...

388
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,400
I can't drink anymore...

389
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,970
Hey, hurry and get off, you're too heavy!

390
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,370
Really... What are you doing?

391
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,730
Irie-kun!

392
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,110
Sorry for the trouble, Kikyo.

393
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,040
No, it's no problem.

394
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,440
He called me by my name!

395
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,530
Hey, let's go.

396
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:52,470
No!

397
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,360
You hate me, don't you?

398
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,560
I'm an immature, violent girl.

399
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,700
Your eyes are telling me that you're disgusted!

400
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,560
So you know well.

401
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm totally disgusted.

402
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,710
Let me go!

403
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,340
Don't talk nonsense.

404
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:28,140
But you, you like...

405
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:34,470
Rika-chan... Rika-chan... more than me!

406
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,830
Seriously.

407
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,310
Did kotoko-san fall asleep?

408
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:45,910
I'm sorry she hurt you.

409
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:50,250
I don't want you to apologize.

410
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:57,650
Don't taunt her too much.

411
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,490
What? When did I?

412
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:01,390
Good night.

413
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,110
Hey, it's done!

414
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,180
Hurry before it's burnt!

415
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,930
Eat up!

416
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,010
Naoki, I picked out the good ones.

417
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,000
Thanks.

418
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,800
Is it good?

419
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,380
Yeah. It's good.

420
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,100
It's good when we eat outdoors!

421
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,460
Irie-chan, don't eat too much!

422
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,230
It's okay.

423
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,000
Kotoko, bring some beer.

424
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,850
Yes.

425
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,630
I am coming, too.

426
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,600
Kotoko-san,

427
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,400
when did you start liking Naoki?

428
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,380
It was first year in high school, so 8 years ago I guess.

429
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,260
That's pretty long, huh?

430
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,100
For me, I liked him when I was two, so it has been 15 years.

431
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,970
Rika-chan,

432
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,190
you told me to give Naoki back last time, right?

433
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,990
Hey, is beer ready ye...

434
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:11,370
This is dangerous.

435
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,060
I can never do that.

436
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,260
Never.

437
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,250
Okay.

438
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,280
But that's your opinion, right?

439
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,380
What?

440
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,740
I wonder what Naoki thinks.

441
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,680
If Naoki says he likes me,

442
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,650
you should give him to me, okay?

443
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,100
Sure. You better ask him, then.

444
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,750
So...

445
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,260
You were listening, Naoki?

446
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,940
What?

447
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,770
Yeah, somewhat.

448
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,030
I have always liked you.

449
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,990
I don't understand how you like her!

450
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,440
I suit you better.

451
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,500
Then why? Why did you marry her?

452
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,090
Do you know how shocked I was when I heard it, while in America?

453
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,540
Then...

454
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,580
Then...

455
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,510
You shouldn't have gone to America!

456
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,880
Why did you stay away from the one you loved for so long then?

457
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,740
I had no choice!

458
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,970
I was only in primary school at that time, my parents...

459
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,030
That doesn't matter!

460
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,000
I could never stay way from the one I love.

461
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,870
If I were you,

462
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,930
I wouldn't have gone to America.

463
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,300
If it were me,

464
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,050
I'd stay near him even if all I could do was just to watch him.

465
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,710
You might have loved him longer, but...

466
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,750
but you'll never love him as much as I do!

467
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,530
Then...

468
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,350
Although I don't know how Irie-kun feels,

469
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,770
that's the way it is.

470
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,940
Then...

471
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,150
Kotoko-san!

472
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,990
That's why.

473
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,870
That's why I fell in love with her.

474
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:42,250
She can't do anything right,

475
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,080
unlike you, but

476
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,790
I like that power of her.

477
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,620
You like her over me?

478
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,550
Yeah. Over you.

479
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,140
Okay.

480
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,890
If it were Kotoko-san,

481
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,150
she wouldn't have gone to America, I guess.

482
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,180
I guess so.

483
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,870
Look at your face.

484
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,220
Why are you crying?

485
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:03,810
I thought it might be the end with you.

486
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,570
I made a resolution that I would become stronger by myself...

487
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,400
A resolution...

488
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,390
Did you achieve that resolution?

489
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,330
I can't.

490
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:52,830
When did I ever give you reason to doubt me?

491
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,140
I have never done that even once.

492
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,530
I chose you.

493
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,090
So be more confident.

494
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,980
Rika.

495
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:45,230
Hey, Naoki didn't like Kotoko at first.

496
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:50,350
Ever since she came, this house turned upside down.

497
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,910
But he came to like her before he realized it...

498
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,850
You betrayer.

499
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,530
Hm?

500
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,650
You betrayer!

501
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,060
Didn't you promise me?

502
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,170
That you would help me become your sister!

503
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,740
That you would help me get married to Naoki!

504
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,440
This is your fault!

505
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,620
You're such an idiot!

506
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,350
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

507
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,610
Sorry.

508
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,920
Sorry.

509
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,520
Rika.

510
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,400
Uncle, Aunt,

511
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,220
and everyone, thank you for taking care of me.

512
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,540
We'll miss you.

513
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:57,050
I felt like I had another daughter.

514
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,320
Come again anytime.

515
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,020
Of course!

516
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:04,270
I will come with a boyfriend much cooler than Naoki next time and hang out.

517
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,270
Well, there is no one like that.

518
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,220
My, my. These two girls.

519
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,610
Rika,

520
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,750
- see you.
- Yeah.

521
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,100
This kind of reminds of that time.

522
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,880
That time?

523
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,660
The day I left for America.

524
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:36,660
When Naoki and I kissed for the first time.

525
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:43,210
So it was a good-bye kiss.

526
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,270
Then do you want me to show you?

527
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,060
No!

528
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,220
This is what happened 7 years ago.

529
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,060
Sorry.

530
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:04,600
What I told you was a bit dramatized.

531
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,420
Dramatize?

532
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,140
Actually, I forced myself on him.

533
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:14,550
But it was still a kiss, right?

534
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,130
So that's how it was...

535
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,620
Here.

536
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,850
This is... for me?

537
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,390
I have no choice.

538
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,670
I'll accept you as Naoki's wife.

539
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,440
See you again.

540
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,150
- Be careful.
- Seeya.

541
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,110
- See you!
- Bye!

542
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,290
Rika-chan! See you again!

543
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,440
Bye, bye!

544
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,210
Seriously. She is such a noisy person.

545
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,380
Bye bye, Naoki.

546
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:29,390
In fact, I'm the one who really understands how Rika-chan feels.

547
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:36,500
Rika-chan, next time we meet, we can become closer, right?
[Sorry about it--Rika]

548
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,640
#10 Naoki-san, please take good care of Kotoko

549
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,470
You like Yuki-kun, right?

550
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,960
Those cold eyes!

551
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,980
I'll support you!

552
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,260
Next week is the death anniversary of Kotoko's mother, right?

553
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,980
-This year I'll go with you, too.
-What?!

554
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,670
It's...it's ok, you don't have to go out of your way to!

555
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,990
Is there something you're hiding from me?

556
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,300
You'll see when we arrive...

557
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,920
Thank you for your unimaginably warm reception.

558
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,730
But...the character for 'ki' in Naoki has been spelt wrongly...
