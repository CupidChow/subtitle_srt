1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:05,110
I'm going to study hard.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,990
After I graduate, I want to be a nurse.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,070
It's a profession that handles life. So you might say it's impossible.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,390
But I thought this out completely.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,780
That's why,

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,480
I want to be a nurse.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,290
What do you think, Irie-kun?

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,190
If I tried to stop you, you wouldn't even listen.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,720
So...

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,190
try your best.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,750
Kinnosuke..

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,980
I'm running out of time.

13
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:57,780
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in TOKYO

14
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,950
Episode 4:
Exciting! My first date!

15
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,070
You guys came.

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,150
Congratulations, Matsumoto.

17
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,110
Congrats!

18
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,120
I heard that you're transferring to the nursing school.

19
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,740
How did you know?

20
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:32,010
Everyone knows.
You transferred to the nusing school for the sake of Irie-kun.

21
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,350
That makes it sound like I'm only there for Irie-kun.

22
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,100
Isn't it?

23
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,330
You think so, too?

24
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,960
Well I guess so....

25
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,590
So how did you do on your exam?

26
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,510
Ta-da!

27
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,750
"Congratulations....."
You passed?

28
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:03,150
I passed the hardest nursing school examination!

29
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,850
That's right! I did it!

30
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,470
I passed the nursing school exam!

31
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,810
Did you?

32
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,800
I don't think it's good for people, but..

33
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,640
I guess congratulations.

34
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,760
I share your concerns, but...

35
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,110
Irie-kun!

36
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,560
Well then, good luck... Nurse.

37
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:34,940
You're graduating!?

38
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,390
Take care always!

39
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,820
Thank you so much! You guys take care, too!

40
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,430
You're leaving?

41
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,700
Bye!

42
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,880
Satomi!

43
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,050
Jinko!

44
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,120
Are those your friends who are crying out?

45
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:04,700
Well actually neither of them are graduating.

46
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,660
Not graduating?

47
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,010
Satomi barely attended an elective class which turned out to have

48
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,090
strict attendance requirements.

49
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,400
And Jinko turned in her brother's homework

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,380
instead of hers by mistake.

51
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,070
Oh...

52
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,490
It sounds fake, but it's true.

53
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,530
So, because of that, they're not graduating?

54
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,210
Yes...

55
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,660
-They both had job offers and their boyfriends graduated already.
-"Congratulations!"

56
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,900
"Take care!"

57
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,570
Your friends are incredible.

58
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,970
I can't bear to watch.

59
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,110
Don't act like you're above them.

60
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,570
You would have not graduate, too.

61
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,300
Irie-kun!

62
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,490
Good thing that she passed nursing school.

63
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:00,580
I thought I had enough credits to graduate

64
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,600
but I made a mistake calculating.

65
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,580
You shouldn't be laughing.

66
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,660
I still can't believe that you passed the test.

67
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,070
You think you can be a nurse
when you make such simple calculation mistakes?

68
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,580
I'll be more careful!

69
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,750
Seriously.

70
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,350
All three of you couldn't graduate.

71
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,980
It's a very hard task.
I'm actually impressed.

72
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,900
So rude.

73
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,350
Isn't this good, though?

74
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,880
At least you can all stay in school together.

75
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,320
You got your dream job.

76
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,930
Right. I'll be working in the IT industry.

77
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,060
My goal is to work hard and find the best man out there.

78
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,320
I want to show you up, Irie-kun.

79
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,390
Here comes your best man carrying a bouquet of roses.

80
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,510
I wouldn't even consider him.

81
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,520
Irie-kun.

82
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,100
Thanks to you, I enjoyed my college life.

83
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,860
Be a good doctor, okay?

84
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,660
Thank you.

85
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,420
Aihara-san.

86
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:34,420
I had fun with you, too.

87
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,130
Don't trouble Irie-kun, okay?

88
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,210
I hope you make a good wife.

89
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,350
Thank you so much and good luck in the IT industry.

90
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,670
See you!

91
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,990
Hey! Matsumoto!

92
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,460
Congratulations on graduating.
You became an independent member of society.

93
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,720
You are just like me now.

94
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,630
Oh that's right, this is for you.

95
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:19,090
That's very nice of you, but
I have a party to attend.

96
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,420
Matsumoto! I'm going with you!

97
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,340
Wait for me! Matsumoto-san!

98
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,920
Let's go together!

99
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:41,470
Kinnosuke will never have feelings for me.

100
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,580
Kotoko, he really still loves you.

101
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,170
That is not true.
He's just shy.

102
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,570
In truth, he's aware of your feelings.

103
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,240
Oh, Kotoko.

104
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,680
I...

105
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,460
should go back to England.

106
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:11,310
But if Kinnosuke tells me not to go...

107
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:14,420
Oh, I...

108
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,670
I...

109
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,750
Chris...

110
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,670
Huh? Birthday party?

111
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,190
Yeah! We haven't had one yet, right?

112
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,800
That's why everyone agreed to have a party.

113
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,660
Well, that's okay but my birthday was on Dec. 29th.

114
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,880
That was already three months ago.

115
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,580
Oh that's true, isn't it.

116
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,050
That's why let's celebrate Kinn-chan's 3 month anniversary.

117
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,340
Huh?!

118
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,020
Wow, I'm embarrassed. You're treating me like a VIP.

119
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,420
Yeah, that's right. VIP, VIP, VIP.

120
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,780
You really mean it? Okay,
since you are celebrating it for me,

121
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,260
I will be happy to attend it.

122
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,250
Awesome!

123
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,910
Happy Birthday, Kin-chan!

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,680
Thank you, thank you!

125
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,990
Kin-chan's already 22?

126
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,030
It seems like long but short.

127
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,340
It seemed long, but it was short.

128
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,310
So which is it?

129
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,620
You know, I have matured as I aged.

130
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,540
Sorry though!

131
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,560
I'm gonna light a candle, Kin-chan.

132
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,840
Wow, it's a big cake!

133
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,870
Chris made this full of love!

134
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,010
Oh, really?

135
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,540
Kinnosuke, do you like it?

136
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,200
Well, I'm not really good with sweet things... maybe.

137
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Your cake is kind of gaudy, too.

138
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,950
Kin-chan!

139
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,140
Wow! How gorgeous!

140
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,740
I know, right! Eat up!

141
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,670
I'll dig in then.

142
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,880
Wow this meat and potato stew is delicious!
Did Kotoko make this?

143
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,850
Nope, Chris did.

144
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,120
Is it delicious, Kinnosuke?

145
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,960
I'm happy!

146
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,820
You just got lucky. Let me try other food.

147
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,410
Okay.

148
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,990
Horrible! What's this?!

149
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,350
See? You're not that good.

150
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,090
Kin-chan, that's mine.

151
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,380
What?!

152
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,210
Don't you see Chris in a different light now?

153
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:08,280
Chris has tried very hard to be like an ideal
Japanese woman just for you for 6 months.

154
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,920
Kinnosuke,

155
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,640
this... is your birthday present!

156
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,580
Won't you accept it?

157
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,590
Amazing! Isn't that a sweater?

158
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,760
It says Kin!

159
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,210
We have matching sweaters!

160
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,730
It says Kuri!

161
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,480
I'm not good at knitting, so

162
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,690
it took me a while.

163
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,070
But...

164
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,980
I did my best to knit it!

165
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,850
This is so awesome! Maybe I should
learn from Chris and make one for Irie-kun.

166
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,980
Teach me, Chris!

167
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not that good,

168
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,950
I just put in lots of love!

169
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,830
She said "love"!

170
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,940
Oh, Kin-chan's embarrassed!

171
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,300
If you're happy just say so!

172
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,230
Shut up!

173
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,130
Kin-chan?

174
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,670
Listen. I'll say it as many times as it takes.

175
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,150
I like Kotoko. Kotoko is my "only love".

176
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,920
I don't like you at all.

177
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,160
Kinnosuke...

178
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,950
What's all this?

179
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,150
This...who'd wear this kind of sweater?

180
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,380
You...

181
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,450
Why don't you go back to England or something?

182
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,500
Alright.

183
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,540
Chris?

184
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:58,080
It'll go according to your wishes.

185
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,890
It's time to go.

186
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,080
Why is she sulking? Is she stupid?

187
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,950
Kin-chan, you idiot!

188
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,720
Chris is going back! Is it alright if she does?

189
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,700
Why are you over-exaggerating?

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,800
Chris is returning next week!

191
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:34,210
She was so tortured about being separated from you
and was trying her best to please you.

192
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,820
Even if you don't like her,
you don't have to hurt her like that!

193
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,240
You're so cruel!

194
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:03,800
Thanks for coming everyone!

195
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,250
Thanks for taking care of me all along.

196
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,540
Chris!

197
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,530
Chris!

198
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,530
Stay well.

199
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,150
Kotoko!

200
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,120
- What's hapening?
- Sorry

201
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,050
What are you doing Kinnosuke,
being so listless today.

202
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,210
It must be because Chris isn't here.

203
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,960
She got fed up with you.

204
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,320
Right, Chris-chan hasn't been coming lately...

205
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,770
Since she used to come everyday,
it's kind of lonely without her around.

206
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,350
Oh?

207
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:53,730
Oh, oh, oh! Does the age not matter?

208
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,850
I mean that she's like a daughter!

209
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,420
She...

210
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,400
She...today...

211
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,120
What's with today?

212
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,390
Master?

213
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,950
Master...I...sorry!

214
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,540
I'll be away today!

215
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,270
Where are you going Kinnosuke?
Kinnosuke!

216
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,450
Kinno-Kinnosuke!
Hey!

217
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,030
The plate! Clean up the plate!

218
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,000
Damn...

219
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,980
Damn it!

220
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,350
I'll definitely write to you!

221
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,710
-Thank you
-Oh the tears!

222
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,790
It's about time, right?

223
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,780
Just a while, why don't you wait a while?

224
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,130
Kin-chan will come soon!

225
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,340
It's enough, Kotoko.

226
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm alright.

227
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,820
Oh, Kotoko, you did a good job.

228
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,380
But, what if he is on a train to come here?
Can you wait a little more?

229
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,840
Thank you, Kotoko. But it's fine now.

230
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,450
But, but!

231
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,000
Because of Kinnosuke,

232
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,920
I had a great time. Won't you tell him that?

233
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,350
Chris...

234
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,270
Bye then!

235
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,810
Oh, I'm going.

236
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,660
Bye!

237
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,290
Chris!

238
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,200
I really...did wait. For Kinnosuke.

239
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,410
I really wanted

240
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,420
to see him one more time.

241
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,830
Bye bye!

242
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,540
Chris!

243
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,110
He didn't come in the end, Kin-chan.

244
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,700
Shall we go?

245
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,870
Chris!!!

246
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,470
Chris!

247
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,350
Kin-chan?

248
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,890
Kotoko, where's Chris?

249
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,870
Kin-chan, Chris...

250
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,500
Toilet? Did she go to the toilet?

251
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,610
You did come, Kin-chan.

252
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,500
Kin-chan, you do like...

253
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,360
But Chris has already...

254
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,830
Kotoko...

255
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,250
Sorry.

256
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,830
Kin-chan...

257
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,620
Chris!

258
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,870
Where are you Chris? Chris!

259
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,560
I'm here!

260
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,120
Won't you come back?

261
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,750
It's too late Kin-chan.

262
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,620
Chris is gone.

263
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,330
Really?

264
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
Chris!

265
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,200
Idiot...

266
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,000
Why didn't you wait...

267
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,550
I came all the way here!

268
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,860
I even came...

269
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,000
wearing this ugly sweater!

270
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,200
I even went home to get it!

271
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,580
Look at it!

272
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,580
Kin-chan...

273
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,250
If you had just come a little earlier...

274
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,410
You were too late...

275
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,230
I came to like you a little.

276
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,250
So why don't you stay in Japan?

277
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,240
Is it true?

278
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,210
I'm serious.

279
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,410
So, come back! Chris...!

280
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,050
Hi, Kinnousuke.

281
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,300
What!?

282
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,690
If it's Kinnousuke's request...

283
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,050
Chris...?

284
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,390
Chris... the plane?

285
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:48,600
Oh plane, the plane...I went inside.

286
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,300
But before the plane takes off,

287
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,330
Kinnosuke's face comes to my mind.

288
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,050
Oh, Kinnosuke, I'm so happy!

289
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,750
I'm happy you are wearing this sweater.

290
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,560
Oh no, I though I'd give this back to you. Don't misunderstand.

291
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,320
Oh, Kinnosuke!

292
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,860
Wa-wai-wait. I can't breath!
Do something, Kotoko!

293
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,170
Save me, Kotoko!

294
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,550
What's wrong?

295
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:26,230
You're too close! Let me go!

296
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,620
I feel that spring seems to somewhat come to Kin-chan.

297
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,050
Oh, Kotoko-chan, are you doing a fashion show by yourself?

298
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:59,330
Mother, I'm actually going on a date with Irie-kun.

299
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:02,270
Wow, that's great!

300
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:06,910
Speaking of which, the two of you
haven't been on a proper date, right?

301
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,560
Exactly.

302
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,220
Congratulations, Kotoko-chan!
Isn't this good?

303
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,020
Before the examination,
Irie-kun actually said

304
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,860
"If you pass the exam, we'll go on a date."

305
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,840
That's what he said!

306
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,780
3θ=-16/√25

307
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,620
This become negative one-fifth, right? Then the tangent...

308
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,690
What?

309
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,410
Hey, Irie-kun.

310
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,030
What is it?

311
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:43,910
If I pass, can't we go on a date?

312
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,300
You...

313
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:51,260
Look, if I have something to look forward to,
I'll be more motivated to study!

314
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,250
Besides, we haven't had a proper date right?

315
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,930
Aren't we always together?

316
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:59,410
But we haven't really gone out together...

317
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,730
Didn't we go to Odaiba?

318
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,380
That was me following you
on your date with Matsumoto-san.

319
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:08,740
Speaking of which,
you had a date with Matsumoto-san.

320
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,760
Isn't it weird that you haven't had
a date with your pitiful wife?

321
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,700
I really want to have a date at least once!

322
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,950
Please, Irie-kun! Please!

323
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,650
Alright, alright! Hurry up and memorize.

324
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,530
Really?!

325
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,260
That's great! Work hard, I'll work hard.

326
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,640
That's why, you...

327
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,020
Isn't Naoki great!?

328
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,960
Since we've been busy, we couldn't find
a common timing but finally, tomorrow!

329
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,200
-Tomorrow?
-Yes!

330
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,330
And you're choosing your outfit for tomorrow.

331
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,050
Yes!

332
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,230
Wow, I'm looking forward to it!

333
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,070
Somehow, I'm also getting excited!

334
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,030
Me too!

335
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,630
It's really great that you passed.

336
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:07,110
Yes! Irie-kun, a doctor,
and I, a nurse...

337
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,040
it's a step closer to my dreams!

338
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,940
Amazing!

339
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,660
But it must be difficult right? Studying.

340
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:23,280
It wasn't that difficult,
you could say that it was relatively...easy?

341
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,940
Hmm?

342
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,190
Irie-kun!

343
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,150
Ah, Onii-chan.

344
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,480
Did you say it wasn't that difficult?

345
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,040
Well, that...

346
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,980
Irie-kun, welcome home!

347
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,650
By the way Irie-kun, about that date...

348
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,560
Tada!

349
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,540
What's this?

350
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,840
I thought about this overnight.

351
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,980
Please follow this schedule on our date tomorrow!

352
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:05,840
Overnight?
You really put in a lot of effort Kotoko-chan!

353
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,160
Onii-chan is so fortunate, right?

354
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,610
If you're going to do something like that,
why not spend the effort studying nursing?

355
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,810
Wow, look!

356
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,330
It's a secret!

357
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,050
Good morning, Onii-chan.

358
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,930
Good morning.

359
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:37,470
What? Onii-chan, you're still around?

360
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,310
What do you mean "still around"?

361
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,230
Aren't you going on a date?

362
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,080
Why are you being so relaxed?
Kotoko-chan already went out you know!

363
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,230
According to her plan,
we're supposed to meet at noon.

364
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,040
What?

365
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,570
It's still too early to go out then?

366
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,030
Kotoko is so worked up.

367
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,630
What's she planning to do,
leaving the house so early?

368
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:07,190
Precisely.
Why are we meeting outside when we live together...

369
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,560
Yes! Best position!

370
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:29,120
Let's review the plan!

371
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,520
11.30am: Irie-kun who arrives 30 minutes
before the arranged time

372
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,740
at the agreed location.

373
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,400
Guess I'm a bit early.

374
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:07,390
Irie-kun who's been waiting for me
will be just a little restless.

375
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:17,190
12.05pm: A little past our arranged time,
I'll appear!

376
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,580
Sorry, Irie-kun! Did you wait long?

377
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,160
Nope, I just arrived too.

378
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,560
I'm really sorry.

379
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,630
It's enough that you arrived safely.

380
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,150
Irie-kun

381
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,910
This, this, this!

382
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,490
Yes.

383
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,120
Won't Irie-kun come quickly?

384
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,040
11:30 a.m.

385
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,430
12:05 p.m.

386
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,640
Hmm, he knows it's today, right?

387
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,730
He's not picking up even when I call...

388
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,670
What if something happened to him...

389
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,990
Like an accident? What should I do!

390
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,810
If something happened to Irie-kun, I...

391
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,780
What are you doing here?

392
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,140
Irie-kun!

393
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,820
On the bridge, right? Where we're supposed to meet.

394
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,040
Thank goodness you arrived safely, Irie-kun!

395
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,680
What?

396
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:21,340
If I'm busted here it'll be such a waste...

397
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,340
Did you just arrive? Such a coincidence!

398
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:30,090
Anyway, why did you leave 2 hours earlier and hide here?

399
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,670
Busted...

400
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,230
You were the one who said
to meet on the bridge at noon.

401
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:37,390
I really don't understand you...

402
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,980
Well, that's...

403
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,020
Let's go.

404
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,560
My plan didn't start well.

405
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:50,160
No, the date is from here onwards.
For my dream date, let's go!

406
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,090
I'd prefer action.

407
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,950
I've already bought them in advance.

408
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,310
What?

409
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,300
Tada!

410
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,550
Eternal Love. It's supposed to be very romantic!

411
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,910
Irie-kun

412
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:46,670
"The End"

413
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,220
That was a good show, right?

414
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,180
I cried.

415
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,960
Let's see. These are our seats.

416
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,620
Okay.

417
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:29,510
Will he hold my hand? Will he?

418
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,770
Irie-kun...

419
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,590
Kotoko.

420
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,630
Wake up.

421
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:56,930
If it's Irie-kun...

422
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,750
The movie's over.

423
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,190
Let's go.

424
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:25,140
I always wanted to come to a place rich in nature like this.

425
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,590
Do it again...

426
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,320
Talking about this park here.
If a couple ride a boat ...

427
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,640
Yes, Irie-kun! Let's ride in a boat together!

428
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,900
Quickly!

429
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,500
Come, hurry up.

430
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,500
Excuse me! A boat, please.

431
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,130
- One boat is 400 yen.
- Yes.

432
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,190
Kotoko, wait a second.

433
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,870
I'll go buy something to drink.

434
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,560
What? Now?

435
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,740
You want to drink something on the boat, right?

436
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,010
Please excuse me. I'll be back soon.

437
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,060
Oh, okay.

438
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,240
Irie-kun?

439
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,870
Irie-kun is still not back...?

440
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:29,580
How far away did he go to get it?

441
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,320
What's wrong?

442
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,200
Are you okay? Are you alright?

443
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,960
Kazuhiko?

444
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,180
Kazuhiko, are you okay?

445
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,580
What's wrong, Kazuhiko?!

446
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,520
-Kazuhiko!
-What's wrong?

447
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,810
Kazuhiko suddenly ...

448
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,720
Are you okay?

449
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,980
You're in pain, right? Excuse me, may I unbutton his shirt?

450
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,370
Up we get.

451
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,460
Here we go.

452
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,720
Are you okay?

453
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,850
Kazuhiko!

454
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,040
Kotoko.

455
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,610
Irie-kun.

456
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,670
What is the matter?

457
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,880
I'm not sure.

458
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,690
He started coughing, and he can't stop it.

459
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,660
Has he been diagnosed with asthma before?

460
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,970
No, he hasn't.

461
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,620
Lying him down on that bench over there is better.

462
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,020
No, he has to be held upright.
Otherwise, he won't be able to breathe well.

463
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,730
Ma'am, please support him from behind like this.

464
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,250
-Call an ambulance right away.-Okay!

465
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,140
Can you put this in your mouth?

466
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,460
You will feel better.

467
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,790
Excuse me, we have got a boy here who is 5-6 years old
and he has trouble breathing.

468
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,250
You will feel better.

469
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,960
How is it?

470
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,030
Mischievous Kiss 2
Love in TOKYO

471
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,470
Okay, breathe in.

472
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,480
And breathe out.

473
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,020
I want to be on the basketball team next year.

474
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,520
Then you have to do your best to go through treatments.

475
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,940
Yeah!

476
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,600
Thank you very much.

477
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,540
Is your son alright, Ma'am?

478
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:42,050
He's seeing a doctor now. He got a lot better.

479
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:45,360
I don't know how to thank you.

480
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,470
It's fine.

481
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,770
The doctor also said it was good that we noticed and brought him in quickly.

482
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,580
That's a relief.

483
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,800
So, what did the doctor say?

484
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,410
He said he thought it was bronchial asthma.

485
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,510
I see.

486
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,960
Indeed, he has been coughing for a long time.

487
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,820
I just thought it was a cold the whole time.

488
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:06,880
There can be cases of asthma because of a cold.

489
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,490
Nowadays, it can be controlled by medicine.

490
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:13,770
He is going to be okay if he is treated right.

491
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:17,370
You don't have to worry too much, Ma'am.

492
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,520
Oh, yes.

493
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,940
He's a medical student.

494
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,910
Oh, really!

495
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,690
Really, thank you very much.

496
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,780
I was a little surprised before.

497
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,500
What?

498
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,730
You're usually cool-headed
but were caring about that lady so warmly a while ago.

499
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,170
I did nothing special.

500
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,490
Yeah, I guess, but...

501
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:00,160
Yeah.

502
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,800
What is it?

503
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,240
You kind of...

504
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,500
seemed like a reliable doctor.

505
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,310
Fool.

506
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:20,950
But there are a lot of children with illnesses.

507
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,180
Yeah.

508
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,160
But you know, when you become a doctor,

509
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:33,080
you'll be able to help those kinds of kids, right?

510
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,630
Don't say it so simply.

511
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,780
When you become a doctor, I think there will be many children that you can help.

512
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:46,900
You better become a doctor soon.

513
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:50,690
Same to you.

514
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,830
Become a good nurse.

515
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:58,780
No worries about that! In three years, I'll become a fantastic nurse!

516
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,140
Don't you know that if you don't pass the national exam, you can't become a nurse?

517
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,590
What? There are more exams?

518
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,840
Irie-kun, wait up!

519
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,420
You were a pretty good nurse back there, though.

520
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,130
It closed up after all.

521
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,360
Yeah.

522
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,380
Hey! Are you guys...

523
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,820
Excuse me, is the boat ride closed?

524
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,910
That man saw everything. He said we could have it special since we saved the child.

525
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,540
Yeah.

526
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,310
This date was a little different from how I imagined it would be.

527
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,470
Even though I had come up with various plans.

528
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:29,520
If the date had gone exactly like I thought it would, it would have been boring, right?

529
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,100
Even if we did none of those, if I can be with Irie-kun, I'm happy.

530
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,780
What is it?

531
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,690
Don't you know?

532
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,890
Couples that ride boats in this park break up.

533
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,570
What!?

534
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,740
The goddess that protects this park is a woman.

535
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,330
Apparently, she gets jealous of the couples, and makes them break up.

536
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,300
-No way!
-Hey! Don't stand up!

537
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,630
Irie-kun, you knew that and...

538
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,400
What are you going to do? We're already in the boat.

539
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,830
Why couldn't you tell me this before we got on?

540
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,630
If you knew, we shouldn't have-...

541
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,710
You wanted a date like this, right?

542
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,170
(You wanted to kiss) with me on a boat.

543
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,160
Irie-kun, how did you-

544
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,500
What was after that...?

545
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,290
You wanted me to hold your hand in the movie theater.

546
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,740
You wanted me to come to a meeting spot 30 minutes earlier.

547
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,190
Irie-kun? Could it be that you knew everything?

548
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,940
Well, I wonder...

549
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,550
I can't believe this!

550
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,070
When did you see? So mean!

551
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:57,490
Honestly, I don't want to follow your date plan.

552
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:01,250
But you planned this staying up all night.

553
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,170
I couldn't not grant at least one wish.

554
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,770
What are you going to do?

555
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,960
Are you going to believe a stupid jinx and get off the boat?

556
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:15,090
Irie-kun...

557
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,020
That, or...

558
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,620
♪ If I hear you say "Good morning,"

559
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,950
♪ I stay happy for a long time.

560
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:58,560
♪ I can't believe this is happening.

561
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,590
♪ Thank you. I love you.

562
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:09,640
♪ I kissed you nonchalantly.

563
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:16,900
♪ But only my heart is changing colors.

564
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,250
♪ I love you to my fullest.

565
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,570
♪ I don't care how you are (toward me).

566
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,580
♪ We share our love .

567
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:42,900
♪ And we're going to grow our love.

568
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:49,240
♪ So embrace me so I won't be separated from you.

569
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,160
Finally, the first step in becoming a nurse will start from here!

570
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,540
-May I?
- You are not related to Irie in Medical School, are you?

571
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,370
My membership number in your Fan Club is 1701.

572
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:24,880
I...
I'm Irie-kun's wife!

573
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:29,610
Medical School blind date party.

574
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:33,710
- I'm escorting her to her house.
- Who are you?
