1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,280
The frying oil spilled on Chris?!

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,250
If something happened to Chris, I..

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,240
She's got a second-degree burn which went through to the dermis.
- oh

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,310
Regarding scars...

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,170
What?

6
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:18,070
It might scar a little.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,090
Irie-kun!

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:26,490
Irie-kun, is something wrong? You're a little off.

9
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,090
Kotoko-chan, what's with all these?

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,890
It seems like Irie-kun's operation is going to
take a long time today.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,230
I was thinking that I should bring him a bento
filled with nutritious food.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,810
Irie-kun!

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,990
You finished the operation, right? You've worked hard.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,180
Well...well, actually, I was hoping you'd eat this for me...

15
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,430
Special Stamina-

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,530
It hurts.

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,600
Irie-kun..

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,480
Irie-kun?

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,030
Irie-kun?

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,660
Hey, Irie-kun?
Hey, Irie-kun?!

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,290
Hey, Irie-kun!

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,500
Hey, Irie-kun! Irie-kun!

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,220
Hey!! Irie-kun! Irie-kun!

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,820
Wake up!

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,420
Kotoko!

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,680
Kotoko, what happened?!

27
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,220
Moto-chan!

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,940
I heard about it at the nurse station, and was so shocked.

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,720
How is Irie-san?

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,800
Irie-kun..

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,130
Irie-kun…from the stairs...

32
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,480
He was protecting me, because of me...

33
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,060
What do I do if Irie-kun dies?

34
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,960
Wait! Please calm down!

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,280
What did the doctor say?

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't know.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Dr.Nishigaki said "You're in the way," and wouldn't let me in.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,040
Irie-kun was unconscious.

39
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,230
He probably hit his head.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,460
What should I do? Because of me..

41
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,950
What do I do? What do I do if he dies because of me?

42
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,890
Me too…me too...

43
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,800
Kotoko! Calm down, please!

44
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,070
You are a nurse, aren't you?

45
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,330
What will you do if you're like this?

46
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,170
You're Irie-san's wife after all.

47
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,570
If you're not strong, what will you do?

48
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,110
It'll be okay, he's under the care of Dr.Nishigaki.

49
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,150
His skills are No.1.

50
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,050
Please God,

51
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,950
Irie-kun…please somehow save him.

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:29,570

~ Mischievous Kiss 2 ~
Love in TOKYO

74
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,210
Episode 15
Proposal of tears

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,990
Come to think of it...

76
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,790
Kotoko and a lunch box came flying didn't it.

77
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,800
I hurt my leg ...

78
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,980
Oh, well... It couldn't be helped.

79
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,460
Irie-kun, you are awake?

80
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,040
It's a relief! It's a relief!

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,360
You know ... you broke your leg yesterday, Irie-kun.

82
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,100
I can tell just by looking.

83
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,200
And you have been sleeping ...

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,980
You came here to take my temperature, didn't you?

85
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,520
You're right.

86
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,020
Okay, then ... put it under your arm.

87
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,600
Please lend me your arm for a moment.

88
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,260
Alright, today we have a blood test and two drips to do.

89
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,410
Also...

90
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,660
What are my symptoms?

91
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,030
You have a simple fracture in your lower right leg.

92
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,050
The swelling is severe so you'll be kept in the hospital
until it goes down.

93
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,860
Also extreme fatigue caused by

94
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,910
anemia, lack of sleep, lack of nutrients...

95
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,160
It's exhaustion.

96
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,040
Lack of sleep, working too hard, lack of nutrients, anemia.

97
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,570
He is more like sleeping like a log than being unconscious.

98
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,170
I don't see any problems with his head.

99
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,050
It'll take about two months for him to fully recover, alright?

100
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,190
Kotoko?

101
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,580
The reason you were unconscious...

102
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,010
wasn't because you hit your head, it was exhaustion...

103
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,920
Exhaustion?

104
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,640
It's my fault, I made you tired.

105
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,620
Kotoko.

106
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,250
The reason you have anemia, the reason you broke your leg,

107
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,150
everything was my fault.

108
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,630
That's why... That's why, that's why...

109
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,810
I will take full responsibility and care for you.

110
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,550
I'll become your legs!

111
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,470
Hey.

112
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,090
As a wife or even as a nurse,

113
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,860
it's my responsibility!

114
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,350
Here say "ahh."

115
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,690
Come on, "Ahh." "Ahh," come on do it.

116
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,510
Like I said! I told you I could eat on my own!

117
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,090
No, no, you fractured your leg just yesterday.

118
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,570
Forcing yourself is not allowed!

119
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,090
I only can't move my leg.

120
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,270
A patient is suppose to listen to the nurse.

121
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,020
Okay! Say "Ahh." Come on!

122
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,560
Nice shot! I got you!

123
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,320
Mother!

124
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,140
We helped prepare for the hospitalization!

125
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,420
Konomi-chan!

126
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,560
You came.

127
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,600
Yes!

128
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,680
No, she said she wanted to come no matter what.

129
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,870
Hmm? You were the one who said,
"If it's okay with you, come along."

130
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,910
Stop saying unnecessary things!

131
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,270
You're not honest at all.

132
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,010
Well, Onii-chan is so clumsy, isn't he?

133
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:44,030
To fall down from the stairs.

134
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,530
Mother…I was the one that fell and he saved me-

135
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,350
It's a given that you have to catch your beloved wife.

136
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,490
You should've somersaulted once and landed properly!

137
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,430
Am I part of a circus?

138
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,120
Ge-ge-ge! Haha!

139
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,400
It really is Irie!

140
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,320
We came rushing over after hearing the rumor.

141
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,260
Chris, Kin-chan!

142
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,020
Helping Kotoko resulted in injury.

143
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,480
It was such a crisis, wasn't it?

144
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:23,210
That's so uncool, Irie!

145
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,650
You are an uncool and pitiful guy.

146
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,190
Alright Irie-kun, let's take your blood sample and do the drip!

147
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,510
Wow! It's nurse angel Kotoko!

148
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,070
Here we are!

149
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,790
I'd want you to give me a shot, too!

150
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,500
We've been waiting for this, Kotoko-chan!

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,540
I'm about to do it!

152
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,720
Okay, Irie-kun please pull your arm out.

153
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,080
Are there no other nurses?

154
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm here, aren't I?

155
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:00,870
OK, I'll disinfect it now

156
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,410
It'll be a little cold.

157
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,860
Alright!

158
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,890
You'll feel a little prick!

159
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,630
It hurts!

160
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,820
Hm? Why? That's weird...

161
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,840
The angle of the needle is wrong! It isn't a
muscular injection.

162
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,600
Sorry, sorry. One more time.

163
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,060
Here I go...

164
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,420
Don't fumble about with the needle!

165
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,440
There! It's safely succeeded.

166
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,800
Which part was safe!? How long did you
take just to get a blood sample?!

167
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,180
I was extremely nervous about giving you a shot!

168
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,520
I was thinking, "What if I make a mistake?"

169
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,240
It's already full of mistakes without you worrying...

170
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,520
Uhm, next is the drip.

171
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,020
The root for the drip is already in there!

172
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,460
Don't open any more wounds than you already have!

173
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,240
Oh, was that right?

174
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
Well...

175
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,060
Since then Irie-kun's life as an admitted patient began.

176
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,120
Irie-kun I'll peel you an apple, okay?

177
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,240
It's fine just as is.

178
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,560
Ouch!

179
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,780
Are you okay?

180
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:45,510
What nice weather!

181
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,510
Irie-kun, it feels great outside, doesn't it?

182
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,240
The little birds...

183
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,220
Kotoko! Ahead!

184
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,140
Ah! Sorry, Irie-kun…I just suddenly...

185
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,380
Now, now, don't get so mad. Let's go!

186
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,220
Let's start afresh now.

187
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,140
Although I'm doing my best taking care of Irie-kun everyday...

188
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,660
This is a fail as a nurse and a wife...

189
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,590
205
1. Irie Naoki-sama

190
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,900
Alright!

191
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,780
Good morning!

192
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,530
Good morning.

193
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,540
About yesterday, I'm sorry for waking you while you
were sleeping.

194
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,770
It's fine. I'm used to it.

195
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:04,450
Kotoko, you will be going off soon since you were
on the night shift yesterday, right?

196
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,730
Yeah.

197
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,550
This, on the way back, could you leave it on top of my desk?

198
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,510
Sure. Just leave it on the desk, right?

199
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,750
Yeah, that'll be great.

200
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,090
Yes, I get it!

201
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,620
Medical Office

202
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,960
Excuse me.

203
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,010
Oh, Kotoko-chan.

204
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,470
I was asked by Irie-kun to drop this off.

205
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,170
Oh, there, there..

206
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,960
How is he doing?

207
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,090
Thanks for asking, he seems to be recovering smoothly.

208
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:48,780
That chap sure is lucky, having such an admirable wife
caring for him.

209
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,580
That's so true!

210
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,540
I'm sorry!

211
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,840
Oh no, oh-no-oh-no-oh-no
-Oh no, oh no, oh no...

212
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,670
I think... it's alright?

213
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,070
Well…it's still readable. It will most likely be okay
once it dries.

214
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,760
Right!

215
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,780
Yes!

216
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:29,880
Next Day

217
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,490
Dr.Irie, good morning! I've brought you your meal.

218
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,970
Thanks. It's rare for you to come, isn't it?

219
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,310
Well, Kotoko has been guarding you from all the other nurses.

220
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,290
No one can get close.

221
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,220
By the way, Kotoko isn't here? That's rare~

222
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,700
If so...let. me. do. the.

223
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,010
feeding~

224
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,550
Wait! Stop feeding him!!

225
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,480
I'm the nurse in-charge of Irie-kun! Don't try
to do things as you like.

226
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,820
Why are you causing such a commotion early in the morning?

227
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,150
I'll look after him today.

228
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,270
Dr.Irie, say "Ah.."

229
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,810
I said I can use my hands!

230
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,330
I wanted you to eat this!

231
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,110
Ta-da!

232
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,390
Ugh, it stinks of garlic!

233
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,920
Breaded pork cutlet, omelettes with leeks.

234
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,010
fried chicken, beef ribs with extra garlic, and okra salad!

235
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,930
The gooeyness of it gives you energy.

236
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,090
You...all these from early in the morning?

237
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:51,880
Well, you didn't get to eat the bento from the last time...

238
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,030
And it was also because of the bento that you became like that...

239
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,660
I'll make it every morning for you!

240
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,060
Every morning?

241
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,050
So look forward to it~

242
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,680
Irie-san! Why are you still here?

243
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,600
Assistant Chief!

244
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,310
No matter how much of a wife you are,
please do what you're supposed to do first.

245
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,700
You didn't attend the meeting.

246
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,570
My goodness, you're suppose to change
Sakamoto-san's sheets this morning, right!!

247
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,420
Ahh... I'm sorry..

248
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,850
Yes.

249
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,090
Well then, Irie-kun, I'll see you later!

250
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,740
What power...

251
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,990
Irie? Can I have a minute?

252
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,260
Dr. Kato, what's the matter?

253
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,080
You see, it's about room 2095's patient, Kusakabe-san's operation procedure...

254
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,590
Kusakabe-san has mid-intrathorasic esophageal cancer.

255
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,880
It would be better if we do a resection and reconstruction
of the esophagus.

256
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,570
Oh, I see. Alright then.

257
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,110
I'm sorry, because I've been injured I can't do any operations.

258
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,780
It's fine! You should rest a little, too, okay.

259
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,140
On my desk, there are my notes about the surgery plan

260
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,170
that I haven't written in the medical record yet.

261
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,710
Thanks. On your desk.

262
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,020
Yes, it's on top of the desk.

263
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,610
Oh. On the desk?

264
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:34,130
Dr.Kato?

265
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,520
It's already twelve o'clock.

266
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,800
Irie-kun is probably sleeping.

267
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,060
Irie Naoki

268
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:58,040
I'll just have a glance at his sleeping face!

269
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,670
He's sleeping well.

270
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,390
What a cute sleeping face.

271
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,050
Good night, Irie-kun.

272
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,130
That…that shocked me. Irie-kun, you were awake?

273
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,370
There's one thing I want to ask you.

274
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,890
Huh?

275
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,490
What exactly is this?

276
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,730
With this, it should dry faster.

277
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,620
You don't have to go that far. If you leave it alone,
it'll dry anyway.

278
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,640
But I want to have it dry as cleanly as possible.

279
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,080
I see.

280
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,600
This...

281
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,860
What exactly did you want to do?

282
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:45,690
"What... ?" I just wanted to be useful to you...

283
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,790
I'm asking you, don't do unnecessary things!

284
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:52,840
It's lucky I remembered what was written.
Don't recklessly touch things on a doctor's desk!

285
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,820
Patient's lives are on the line!

286
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,800
I'm sorry!

287
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,150
I didn't think it would turn into something like this.

288
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,270
I just wanted to lessen your load of work a little.

289
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,530
But I ended up spilling coffee...

290
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,280
I also caused trouble for Dr.Kato...

291
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,010
I just increased your load of work, didn't I?

292
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,050
Even though I like you...

293
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,840
Even though I love you…

294
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:40,000
I make you tired, and injure you...

295
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,300
I've been a pest to you.

296
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,830
No matter when...

297
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,970
I...

298
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,060
am a failure as your wife, aren't I?

299
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,630
If that's the case, then I am, too.

300
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,470
I couldn't catch hold of you properly by myself

301
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,360
and landed in this state.

302
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,450
No way.

303
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,240
I'm a failure as a husband.

304
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,370
Irie-kun.

305
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,350
I wasn't able to catch the wife I love,

306
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,330
somersault and land properly, right?

307
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,990
What I learned after being hospitalized,

308
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,020
were the feelings of other patients,

309
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,050
and how hard you've been working as a nurse.

310
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,170
A nurse and patient,

311
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,780
in such a situation...

312
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,500
it feels kind of sexy, right?

313
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,770
Irie-kun's injury,

314
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,920
because of the power of my love,

315
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,760
will heal completely soon.

316
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,080
Propose?

317
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,360
Shh! Don't say it in such a loud voice!

318
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,220
I didn't say it in a loud voice.

319
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,320
Well...Irie...in other words...

320
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,560
I was wondering how you proposed to Kotoko...

321
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,530
I don't want to know that much ...

322
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:14,210
But I thought I could listen to you just a little bit.

323
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,230
Ah. Come to think of it, it was the day that
Kotoko dumped you.

324
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,650
What!?

325
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:26,710
The thought just came to me, and I said that
I would marry her in front of the family.

326
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,490
Ojisan, I have something to tell you.

327
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:31,410
Before that, you should change...

328
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,620
With Kotoko-san...

329
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,430
Please allow me to get married with your daughter.

330
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,230
Irie-kun..

331
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,600
You...just did it without asking for Kotoko's consent?

332
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,660
Not really. I knew her answer without her having to say it.

333
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:08,040
What a person...

334
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,840
Was it helpful?

335
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,120
As if! Whatever!

336
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,020
Kin-chan!

337
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,060
What's going on with Kin-chan?

338
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,580
He's probably going to propose to Chris.

339
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,780
Ohh.

340
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,680
What? WHAT!?

341
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,880
N-N-No way!

342
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,520
Really. So Kin-chan will finally propose to Chris!

343
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Chris will be so happy! They'll be a happy happy couple!

344
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,000
Like us!

345
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,840
I can't stay like this.

346
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,240
I knew it'll be here.

347
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,120
What do you think, Chris?

348
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
I..

349
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,860
I won't marry you.

350
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,500
Huh?

351
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,700
Just now…did you say you won't?

352
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,440
Yes.

353
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,560
You…You won't marry me.

354
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:01,100
I'm sorry, Kinnosuke.

355
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,860
Me...

356
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,080
Forget about me.

357
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,400
Chris!!

358
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
Why did you reject it? Kin-chan's proposal.

359
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,560
Kotoko.

360
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,700
You liked him so much! You were waiting for it!

361
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,820
Kotoko, I have a favor ...

362
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,520
What is it?

363
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,220
Kotoko, do you not have any plans on separating
with Irie?

364
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,000
What? No! Of course not!

365
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,160
Won't you leave Irie and marry Kinnosuke?

366
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Kinnosuke cooks better than Irie and is kind.

367
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,930
No matter what, he's a hunk.

368
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,450
You should remarry to Kinnosuke!

369
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,590
Hey.

370
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,930
Kinnosuke has liked you since a long time ago, too, right?

371
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,970
Chris!

372
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,010
You can't?

373
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:38,170
I can't handle him marrying anyone else.

374
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,610
If that's the case, then I thought if it's you, it'd be nice.

375
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,800
Chris..

376
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,860
That's an unexpected outcome.

377
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,520
Right. In the end, she wouldn't tell me why she
turned down the proposal.

378
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,960
I really can't understand...

379
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,610
He's probably the one who can't accept it the most, right?

380
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,250
Chris is definitely hiding something...

381
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,630
- Aihara -

382
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,400
Hey, Kinnosuke, make preparations for ...

383
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,440
You're still doing that?

384
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,610
It's no good, Chef.

385
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,130
He's been totally listless since he visited Chris-chan yesterday.

386
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,670
Huh?

387
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,960
See?

388
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,760
Huh? What in the world happened, Kinnosuke?

389
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,740
Probably got dumped by Chris-chan, right?

390
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,860
Was he dumped by Chris-chan?

391
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,360
I'm not really sure though.

392
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,800
I think you guessed right.

393
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,680
Huh? Chris-chan was head-over-heels over him.

394
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,500
Well, I think I know Chris-chan's feelings.

395
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:17,000
It is kind of a miracle such a cute girl
has been sticking with this guy.

396
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,330
You might be right ...

397
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,110
On top of that, Kinnosuke is kind of cold.

398
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:25,110
He's taken Chris's feelings for granted.

399
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:25,990
That's right...

400
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,970
At times like this, if there was a guy who is
even slightly nicer to her...

401
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,590
A guy who's nice to her?

402
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,770
If she meets a kind-hearted guy who can close the gap in her heart...

403
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:40,890
Well, Chris-chan will have a change of heart too.

404
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,110
A change of heart? Chris-chan?

405
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:44,960
Shh!!

406
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,840
Ah...

407
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,920
Don't take it to heart, Kinnosuke... He tends to
get carried away and exaggerates things.

408
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,500
That's right, Kinnosuke. Chris-chan wouldn't dare...

409
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,220
Kinnosuke?

410
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,540
Hey, Kinnosuke!
-Kinnosuke!

411
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:03,110
Seriously...Chef!

412
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,870
Huh, me?

413
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:20,270
Would you like to eat momiji manju (maple-shaped bun filled with sweet bean paste)?

414
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,770
Thank you very much, but I'm not that hungry.

415
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,290
Don't say that and eat with me!

416
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:31,670
I can't eat all of this on my own.

417
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,090
Then just one...

418
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,290
Delicious!

419
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:44,510
Right? Eating sweet things when you're down is the best!

420
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,200
Abe-san....

421
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,560
Mother.

422
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,360
Oh, Yuichi!

423
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,040
I came nearby so...

424
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,900
Nearby? Aren't you supposed to be working right now?

425
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,150
Yes, yes. I thought I'd go after seeing you...

426
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,680
Hey, Yuichi! What are you spacing out for?

427
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,520
Nah... what do you mean "spacing out"?

428
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,640
Cute isn't she, Chris-chan.

429
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,980
She came from England. Right?

430
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,020
Nice to meet you. I'm called Christine Robins.

431
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,260
Your mother's been so nice to me.

432
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,160
Well ...

433
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,400
Ah, that's right, Yuichi. Won't you buy some candy at the shop before you go?

434
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,340
Ah, sure that's fine. Was it the first floor?

435
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,170
If you'd like I can accompany you there.

436
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,960
Really?

437
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,700
I was just thinking about buying a tissue box anyway.

438
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:46,900
Wow...I was surpised just now.

439
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,290
I came to visit my mom, and there was this...

440
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,210
Were you surprised there was this blonde girl?

441
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,660
Ah, no...well, there was a little of that.

442
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,160
But to be able to meet such a cute girl...

443
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,230
Thank you very much.

444
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm happy to hear that from a Japanese guy.

445
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,970
Do you have a boyfriend?

446
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,690
Boyfriend?

447
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,300
You'd have one after all right? Of course.

448
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,400
Boyfriend…

449
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,320
What's wrong?

450
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,430
I'm sorry, I just suddenly felt sad.

451
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,540
Um, are you alri-

452
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,920
How dare you!!

453
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,930
How dare you make my Chris cry!?

454
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,090
Hold on...w-what did I...?

455
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,450
With such a trendy looks of yours,

456
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,850
you've been seeing my Chris!

457
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,020
And you made her cry!

458
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,940
Kinnosuke!

459
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,090
Chris!!!

460
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,880
Excuse me, Kin-chan!

461
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,900
I...

462
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm really sorry about just now.

463
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,780
I'm really sorry.

464
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,140
Kin-chan, what were you doing?

465
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,910
It's ok, it's my stupid son's fault.

466
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,660
"Stupid son"?

467
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,940
Kin-san acted like that for Chris-chan,

468
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,770
we all know that!

469
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,200
That's right! You always visit everyday.

470
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,030
You must be busy, too. It's not an easy thing to do.

471
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,140
It's a huge difference from my idiot of a son.

472
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,740
Well, Mom, I'm going to get into trouble if I don't go back soon.

473
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,960
-Work hard, alright?
-Yeah...

474
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,340
I'm really sorry.

475
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,980
I totally misunderstood.

476
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,520
And thought that your son was...

477
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,110
Chris's new guy.

478
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,570
I thought...if Chris found a new guy,

479
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,550
I should give up and wish her happiness.

480
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,410
But...no matter what,

481
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,930
I was curious about what kind of guy it was.

482
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,170
"A new guy"?

483
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,950
You found a new guy, and that's why
you rejected my proposal, didn't you?

484
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,060
Proposal?!

485
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,800
You're wrong! There is no other person I like.

486
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,880
Then why? What about me do you not like?

487
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,650
I've liked you.

488
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,960
I used to always dream about being proposed to by you.

489
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,770
When I got burned, you took good care of me.

490
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,600
Of course, I would!

491
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,740
To this body that's now scarred,

492
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,730
you still proposed. I was so happy.

493
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,730
Then why?

494
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,270
Yeah! Why turn down his proposal then?

495
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:05,390
Because…because you were felt bad for me.

496
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,380
Because you're kind.

497
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,750
Because there is no guy who will take a bride with this body.

498
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,350
You thought you should take care of me.

499
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,700
I didn't!

500
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,360
And...you didn't truly like me but proposed out of pity...

501
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,000
Idiot!

502
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,430
Who said it was pity!?

503
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,710
Your burn...

504
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,280
I don't think anything of it!

505
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,400
No matter how severe the injury. Does it matter!?

506
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,570
But…you just suddenly proposed to me!

507
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:41,900
Okay, I understand. If that's the case,

508
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,710
then will you believe me if I become like you?

509
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,930
Kin-chan!

510
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,480
In Kotoko's place, I'll bring some tea to Dr.Irie.

511
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,230
Where is the kitchenette?

512
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,000
What is that!?

513
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,990
Let me borrow this!

514
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,440
What are you trying to do!

515
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,080
-There he is!
-Kotoko!

516
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,170
What are you doing, Kin-chan?!

517
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,740
I'm going to pour it on my leg!

518
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,400
You can't! You'll burn yourself!

519
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,560
Don't barge in, Kotoko!

520
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,920
I'll become like Chris!

521
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,180
Stop!

522
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,940
It's been so hard for me ...

523
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,250
You finally proposed to me...

524
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,340
But I rejected it ... I'm sorry ..

525
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,310
Chris,

526
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,510
do you think it's possible to live together out of pity?

527
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,020
The fact that Kin-chan likes Chris,

528
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,390
everyone apart from Chris is clear of that, right?

529
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,400
Hey, Kinnosuke...

530
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
What?

531
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,490
Propose one more time.

532
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:30,420
Not that, I would like to answer properly.

533
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,310
Wow-wow-wow...

534
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,040
He's going to propose!

535
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,900
That's right, do it!

536
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:40,610
What?! How can I do it around with so many obahan.
(obahan: middle aged woman in Kansai dialect)

537
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,580
Obahan?

538
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,740
What are you being shy, Kin-san?
If you are a man, then just do it!

539
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,770
Do it!

540
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:49,490
Kinnosuke.

541
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,290
No choice.

542
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,940
MARRY ME, CHRIS!!

543
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,510
Yes, Kinnosuke.

544
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,540
I love you so much!

545
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,080
I'm so blessed!

546
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,770
Wow!!

547
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:30,020
He succeeded at the proposal!!

548
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:32,570
My blood pressure went up.

549
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,020
Proposing in Osaka dialect is nice.

550
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,540
Kin-chan, Chris... Congratulations!

551
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,630
Congratulations!

552
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,070
Congratulations!

553
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,430
Thank you.

554
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:10,390
Later, I learned from Irie, that

555
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,900
it was Chris' misunderstanding that she will be scarred.

556
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,650
She will heal completely soon.

557
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,220
And just like that,

558
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Kin-chan and Chris's wedding won't be too far away.

559
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:29,620
And finally, the day we've been waiting for.

560
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,000
Irie-kun, congratulations on being discharged!

561
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,470
Congratulations!

562
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:45,280
What are you doing?

563
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,520
I've always wanted to try this, feels like
you're a celebrity, doesn't it?

564
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,150
It's great, isn't it?

565
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,680
You can finally feel at ease now.

566
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,880
It's the power of your love!

567
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,390
It's nothing~

568
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,720
Like this, the relationship between us, husband and wife, was strengthened because of his hospitalization.

569
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,730
And it seems like Irie-kun has gotten much better.

570
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,790
We should visit the hot springs together,

571
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,540
and spend some romantic time, just the two of us~

572
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,660
Kotoko! Irie-san..

573
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,350
Irie-kun, wait!

574
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,430
There's lots of work waiting for me,

575
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,710
I will hurry home because I have to come back here to examine patients.

576
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,230
Thanks for coming all the way down.

577
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,940
It's nothing.

578
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,550
Irie-kun..

579
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,530
It seems we'll have our usual busy lifestyle again.

580
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:48,850
♫Just hearing that one phrase "Good Morning"♫

581
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:54,260
♫ I stay happy for a long time♫
