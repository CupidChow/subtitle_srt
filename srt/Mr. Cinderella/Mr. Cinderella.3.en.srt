(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,816
(Episode 3)

17
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:40,726
Are you doing something sketchy at the crack of dawn?

18
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,021
I'm doing nothing.

19
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,736
Are you watching porn?

20
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:51,654
Are you nuts?

21
00:02:52,112 --> 00:02:54,782
If it is porn, I've gotta find a hidden corner to watch.
No way I'm gonna watch it in broad daylight.

22
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:56,867
Is that so?

23
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,412
Hey.

24
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,206
Drop that smirk off your face.

25
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,999
If I'm pissed off, I'm gonna knock you out.

26
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:06,627
Oh.

27
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:20,182
Why do you shoot semi-nudes?

28
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,601
None of your business.

29
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:24,520
I'm a big fan of nude photo shoots.

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,437
Then what?

31
00:03:26,647 --> 00:03:28,023
I'm not judging at all.

32
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,318
But

33
00:03:31,944 --> 00:03:33,988
you'd better pick a proper profile.

34
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:37,825
On the Internet, there are a bunch of multi-level marketers.

35
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:41,412
What a nosy doctor.

36
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,580
You'd better go to work now.

37
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:45,499
All right.

38
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:48,919
I need to get going.

39
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:50,838
Mark my words.

40
00:03:51,589 --> 00:03:52,673
Go yourself.

41
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,731
Mrs. Hai Dan.

42
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,737
Mrs Hai Dan.

43
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,364
What on Earth's going on?

44
00:04:17,364 --> 00:04:19,033
I'm reciting the Buddhist scriptures,
but you keep calling me out.

45
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:21,118
What's going on out here?

46
00:04:21,577 --> 00:04:22,244
What?

47
00:04:22,536 --> 00:04:23,996
Did Dung stop by a few days ago?

48
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:26,081
Dung's not here. Don't try in vain to look for him.

49
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,791
I'm looking for him, too.

50
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:29,460
Go somewhere else to find him.

51
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,755
If you may run into him, please send him my regards.

52
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:36,926
If he doesn't come back to pay my rent in 3 days,

53
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:38,844
I will collect all of his stuff to burn.

54
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:41,847
Where on Earth has he been?

55
00:04:42,473 --> 00:04:44,725
I have no clue where he has been, but he's not here.

56
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,519
My house is for rent and worth every penny.

57
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,773
It's not a deserted house. If he's happy,
he stays. If not, he leaves..

58
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:51,649
You got it?

59
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:54,818
I'm so kind-hearted that I let all of you walk over me.

60
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,154
Are you listening to my words?

61
00:04:57,613 --> 00:04:58,614
I got it.

62
00:04:58,781 --> 00:04:59,949
If so, why don't you answer me?

63
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,911
What a bitch-resting face.

64
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:06,664
So annoying as hell.

65
00:05:07,915 --> 00:05:09,166
Oh my Buddha. Let's keep reciting the scriptures.

66
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,753
God, I've been constantly doing it.
When will I reach the peak?

67
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:16,840
Ah.

68
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,927
Your condition is improving.

69
00:05:20,177 --> 00:05:22,012
Remember to take some more meds.

70
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:23,681
Thank you, doctor.

71
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,183
By the way,

72
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,686
Ah, nothing.

73
00:05:29,895 --> 00:05:31,563
Remember your follow-up examination in 7 days.

74
00:05:38,946 --> 00:05:40,197
Ah, Thao.

75
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,036
Thao, are you okay?

76
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:46,662
Ah.

77
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:48,747
Yes, I'm all right.

78
00:05:48,872 --> 00:05:49,790
What've you just said?

79
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:51,875
Nothing.

80
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,712
Ah, Mr. Khoa.

81
00:05:56,797 --> 00:05:58,424
I have something to ask you.

82
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:00,509
Go ahead. We still have a long list of patients.

83
00:06:01,635 --> 00:06:02,594
Ah.

84
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:05,472
What I wanna ask is...

85
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:07,224
Hey.

86
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,226
Are you asking for leave to travel to Da Lat again?

87
00:06:10,728 --> 00:06:12,271
Our exam room still has a bunch of patients.

88
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,230
I won't approve it.

89
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,565
I think I'm gonna be on edge with you.

90
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:17,109
Am I always a sucker for pleasure in your eyes?

91
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,529
I just wanna ask you

92
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,324
what you think about same-sex love.

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,623
Hey hey.

94
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:35,169
I'm a straight girl. I'm into men, not women.

95
00:06:36,545 --> 00:06:37,713
I haven't said anything.

96
00:06:41,925 --> 00:06:43,010
Same-sex love?

97
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:46,013
If you sincerely love someone,

98
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:49,349
will you take his or her sex seriously?

99
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,521
What is your point?

100
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,483
If you love someone sincerely enough,

101
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,277
you will love him or her from the bottom of your heart.

102
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:04,406
Not from one sex to another.

103
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,033
Got it?

104
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:06,992
Yes.

105
00:07:08,368 --> 00:07:09,078
All right. Go back to your work.

106
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,251
I hit on the nail of the road.

107
00:07:17,294 --> 00:07:18,712
After the question, it's too obvious to me.

108
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:23,092
Dung and he are really in love.

109
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,513
What a poser. It's not that love from the bottom of the heart.

110
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:30,808
From gender to gender instead.

111
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:32,893
Such a trap boy. I hate you.

112
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:35,521
I hate you.

113
00:07:50,452 --> 00:07:51,203
Shaking your head?

114
00:07:52,162 --> 00:07:53,288
My arm is done?

115
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,041
The other day, it was just a slight pain.

116
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,417
How come it turns serious?

117
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,295
I'm not saying anything.

118
00:08:00,754 --> 00:08:02,005
Your arm is still in good condition.

119
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:04,341
Why do you shake your head?

120
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:09,346
I have a long list of patients today.
My neck feels a little tired.

121
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:10,347
Can't I do that?

122
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:17,104
Your examination's done.

123
00:08:17,104 --> 00:08:17,855
You can go.

124
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:19,648
Ah.

125
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,279
Ah.

126
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:27,072
Who's in that photo?

127
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,240
How cute!

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,325
What photo?

129
00:08:32,369 --> 00:08:32,953
That photo?

130
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:35,956
It's just an old photo.

131
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:40,836
Thao must have put it in the frame while clearing up my table.

132
00:08:42,296 --> 00:08:43,213
Ah.

133
00:08:44,298 --> 00:08:45,465
How cute!

134
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:47,718
I thought she was your younger sister.

135
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,013
I don't have any sister.

136
00:08:51,388 --> 00:08:52,347
I'm an only child.

137
00:08:54,808 --> 00:08:55,726
You're an only child,

138
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:56,977
aren't you?

139
00:08:57,769 --> 00:08:58,478
Yes.

140
00:08:58,812 --> 00:08:59,813
What do I lie to you for?

141
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:09,740
What's wrong with you?

142
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:11,783
You look pale and spaced out.

143
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,410
Your arm gets hurt again?

144
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:14,703
It's not that.

145
00:09:14,912 --> 00:09:15,537
Not at all.

146
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,207
I've gotta go.

147
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,437
Hello, Huynh?

148
00:09:40,437 --> 00:09:41,230
Yes, I'm listening.

149
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,565
Please prepare some meds for my patient.

150
00:09:43,732 --> 00:09:44,274
Yes.

151
00:09:44,274 --> 00:09:45,776
As for the fee, just deduct it from my money.

152
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:46,652
Yes, it's okay.

153
00:09:46,902 --> 00:09:47,486
Uhm.

154
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:03,293
[Ms. Hoang Danh: I stopped by.
I bought some fruits for you and everyone.]

155
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,348
Dung.

156
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,226
Where are you going?

157
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:24,106
I have some urgent issues.

158
00:10:24,731 --> 00:10:25,607
Where are you going?

159
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:27,693
I'm buying some meds for my brother.

160
00:10:29,361 --> 00:10:30,195
Ah.

161
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,449
Thanks for helping me last time.

162
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:39,705
You're welcome. There's no need for thanks between us.

163
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:47,045
Excuse me.

164
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,009
Please come back.

165
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,181
I know it's my fault. I won't repeat it next time.

166
00:10:59,099 --> 00:10:59,933
My arm hurts.

167
00:11:03,186 --> 00:11:03,937
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,856
Currently I don't want to see anyone.

169
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,941
Please wait for our next conversation.

170
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,067
Today I'm a little tired.

171
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:11,820
Don't you love me anymore?

172
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:17,576
Too bad.

173
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,494
I have a new girl.

174
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:20,912
Can you stop bothering me?

175
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:23,832
You...

176
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:25,792
Stay that way. I need to bottle-feed my baby.

177
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:26,626
Bye.

178
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:28,337
Oh. Dung.

179
00:11:36,553 --> 00:11:37,888
You think I will buy it easily?

180
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,973
Let's see.

181
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,225
You will come back to me eventually.

182
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,173
He's an only child.

183
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,218
Why can he have this photo?

184
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,805
Maybe

185
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,015
he's a transgender.

186
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,866
Mr. Dung.

187
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,108
You don't remember who I am, do you?

188
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,589
I'm your Cinderella.

189
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:34,872
No. Not like this.

190
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:35,716
What's wrong?

191
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:37,541
Don't you miss me?

192
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,375
Are you nuts?

193
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,826
Oh. Please come here with me.

194
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,236
It can't be that.

195
00:12:56,247 --> 00:12:57,394
He must be a cousin.

196
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,510
This dish can't taste good if it's too cold.

197
00:13:24,609 --> 00:13:25,589
Dang it.

198
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,445
Hey, I'm sorry.

199
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,249
It's okay.

200
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:30,479
What are you waiting for?

201
00:13:30,771 --> 00:13:31,804
I'm waiting for you.

202
00:13:32,273 --> 00:13:33,044
Waiting for me?

203
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,889
Oh.

204
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:34,942
Hey.

205
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,509
What are these?

206
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,157
They're Hai Tien fried buns.

207
00:13:41,157 --> 00:13:42,564
Out of this world.

208
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:45,234
Ah I also know that food outlet.

209
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:47,184
But whenever I wanna grab a bite,
I've gotta wait long enough,

210
00:13:47,184 --> 00:13:48,518
for 2 hours on end.

211
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,561
Way too hard to buy it there.

212
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:50,843
Abso-bloody-exactly.

213
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:53,513
Just eat it. It won't taste good anymore if it turns cold.

214
00:13:54,503 --> 00:13:55,630
Thank you.

215
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:57,715
You're welcome.

216
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,687
That outlet is way far from here.

217
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,356
How can you keep it warm until now?

218
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:05,984
I keep it in my heart.

219
00:14:09,164 --> 00:14:10,321
If you like it,

220
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:12,584
I will buy it for you every day. Sounds okay?

221
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,107
No need.

222
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:17,234
I don't want to put you to any bother.

223
00:14:17,704 --> 00:14:18,788
It is no bother.

224
00:14:18,788 --> 00:14:19,841
As long as you like it!

225
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,541
It won't be any bother to me.

226
00:14:22,938 --> 00:14:25,034
Hey, hey, hey.

227
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:26,879
I'm gonna call the Police.

228
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:30,665
How can you two say pickup lines while on duty?

229
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,303
Is there anyone feeling for my emotions?

230
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,358
My heart is grieving.

231
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:39,882
Take a look around this exam room.

232
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:41,967
Is there any single lady left like me?

233
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,241
It's not that.

234
00:14:44,355 --> 00:14:46,003
We've just got to know each other.

235
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:48,453
All right, is that true?

236
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,413
Is something the matter with you?

237
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:51,581
Yes.

238
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,720
A patient was waiting for the endoscopy.

239
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,149
But it took him so long, so he grabbed a bite.

240
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,672
He didn't listen to my advice at all.

241
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:00,507
Is that so? Let me see the situation.

242
00:15:00,507 --> 00:15:02,728
Stop. You haven't eaten anything yet.

243
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:03,718
Just eat it.

244
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,804
Those kinds of problems are a piece of cake to me.

245
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,440
But...

246
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:08,536
Right. She's so right.

247
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,912
You're a doctor.

248
00:15:09,912 --> 00:15:12,925
Skipping meals won't do you any good.
Especially it's breakfast.

249
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:15,751
You've gotta stay healthy to
take good care of your patients.

250
00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:18,838
I know you can handle it all. You got this.

251
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:20,933
I can handle it all here.

252
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,196
In this exam room. I can handle it all.

253
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:23,853
Go wherever you want.

254
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:24,312
Let's go.

255
00:15:26,877 --> 00:15:27,701
You go for real?

256
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:30,558
You haven't left me any bun.

257
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:32,643
How weird he is.

258
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:49,160
Have you found out Mr. Dung yet?

259
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,245
He's still nowhere to be found.

260
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,643
He must have traveled to the past.

261
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:56,083
He hides himself too well.

262
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,462
I'm a little curious.

263
00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,163
What is he like? Why do you really care about him?

264
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:05,488
He?

265
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:09,148
He's kind of a skank, but he's kind-hearted.

266
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:10,368
Ah, by the way,

267
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:12,548
let me tell you something.

268
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:16,343
He seems like a tough person on the outside,
but he has a daydreaming soul.

269
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:20,118
Though already 26 years old,
he's been looking for the Cinderella of his own.

270
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,525
Cinderella?

271
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:22,151
Uhm.

272
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,726
It's his little girl back then.

273
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,960
Too bad.

274
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,942
I have a new girl. Could you stop bothering me?

275
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,695
You...

276
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,780
Stay that way. I need to bottle-feed my baby.

277
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,367
You even know his love story like the back of your hand.

278
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,724
He did tell me all.

279
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,821
As little children, they were close to each other.

280
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,346
And they promised to marry each other as adults.

281
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:52,181
But that little girl's been long gone.

282
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:53,787
He's still waiting in vain.

283
00:17:00,742 --> 00:17:01,388
Ah.

284
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,693
There's nothing between the two of us.

285
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,111
Don't worry.

286
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,020
I just see him as my family member.

287
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:22,096
Okay.

288
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:27,424
Your arm is getting much better.

289
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:30,177
Your bandage can be unwrapped in a few days.

290
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:32,753
Ah, thank you, doctor!

291
00:17:36,267 --> 00:17:37,080
What's wrong with you?

292
00:17:37,653 --> 00:17:40,396
I'm getting a cramp in my leg.
Please massage it, doctor.

293
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:41,793
Hurry up.

294
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:43,388
Hurry up.

295
00:17:46,683 --> 00:17:47,590
Get any better?

296
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:50,708
What're you doing?

297
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,678
Just sit still.

298
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:53,211
The mole is really on your neck.

299
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:55,619
What are you doing?

300
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,944
Did you draw it on?

301
00:18:00,854 --> 00:18:01,531
I don't believe it.

302
00:18:01,761 --> 00:18:02,386
Come here.

303
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,023
I've gotta rub it off your neck.

304
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,110
It hurts. What're you doing?

305
00:18:07,444 --> 00:18:08,080
Ouch.

306
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,634
I'm not that free to draw the mole on.

307
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:11,448
Hah?

308
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,710
Why are you on edge today?

309
00:18:14,743 --> 00:18:17,631
This mole's been there since birth.

310
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:20,477
I'm not insane enough to draw the mole on my neck.

311
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:25,983
You are that guy, aren't you?

312
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:28,558
Who?

313
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,873
Cinderella.

314
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,201
Are you insane?

315
00:18:36,973 --> 00:18:39,465
My name is Khoa, not Cinderella.

316
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,669
Where're you going?

317
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:51,884
I'm in shock. Don't talk to me.

318
00:19:10,037 --> 00:19:10,872
You go first.

319
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,019
I have something to talk to you.

320
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,752
I also have something to ask you.

321
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:18,035
Does Khoa have any sister?

322
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:20,996
No, he's an only child.

323
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:24,646
Is that so? Thank you.

324
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,555
Uh uh. Hey.

325
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:29,265
How disrespectful and rude you are!

326
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:31,632
It doesn't make any sense why Khoa's into you.

327
00:19:31,632 --> 00:19:35,365
If Khoa weren't into you,
I'd have stolen him from you ages ago.

328
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,256
What've you just said?

329
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:44,739
I said a bunch of things. How can I remember?

330
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:46,115
Take in whatever you hear.

331
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,681
You said Khoa was into me.

332
00:19:52,142 --> 00:19:53,310
Hey.

333
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:56,584
This nurse has been so easy-going to you.

334
00:19:56,865 --> 00:19:58,669
(PDA: pubic display of affection)
Are you gonna show me PDA again?

335
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,363
Hello.

336
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:37,145
Hello.

337
00:20:37,489 --> 00:20:39,001
Do you know what time it is now?

338
00:20:40,357 --> 00:20:42,911
I'm sorry. Tonight I have a surgery. I can't go home.

339
00:20:42,911 --> 00:20:43,829
You'd better go to sleep first.

340
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:45,508
Remember to lock the door carefully.

341
00:20:45,508 --> 00:20:46,092
Hey.

342
00:20:49,074 --> 00:20:50,054
Dang it.

343
00:20:50,554 --> 00:20:51,701
How dare you hang up suddenly?

344
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,298
He's into me for real?

345
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:14,036
Annoying as fudge.

346
00:21:16,215 --> 00:21:17,873
Why does Cinderella turn out to be him?

347
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:22,440
How come Cinderella is a prince?

348
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:28,363
But.

349
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:34,119
Should I find a new one?

350
00:21:34,828 --> 00:21:35,495
Certainly.

351
00:21:36,308 --> 00:21:38,217
I can't stay on target.

352
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:44,786
But he's crushing on me.

353
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,445
Ouch.

354
00:21:58,862 --> 00:21:59,717
My arm.

355
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,136
Ha ha ha, it serves you right.

356
00:22:02,512 --> 00:22:05,765
Ha ha ha, your salary will be docked.

357
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,976
Ha ha ha, I'm on duty.

358
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,563
What a sharp tongue.

359
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:17,840
Hey.

360
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:20,123
How can you fall down to the ground during sleep?

361
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,617
Ah, how is my arm?

362
00:22:28,892 --> 00:22:31,728
You should have had your bandage unwrapped in 3 days.

363
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:35,076
But this way,

364
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:36,577
in 3 weeks.

365
00:22:36,577 --> 00:22:37,307
Hah?

366
00:22:37,307 --> 00:22:38,287
Hah, what?

367
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,520
All right, it's already late.
Just stay here to get some sleep.

368
00:22:58,203 --> 00:22:59,318
Lie down.

369
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:16,836
Do you want me to look out for you during sleep?

370
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:19,860
All right. No need.

371
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:22,571
Good night.

372
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,698
Excuse me.

373
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:49,733
What is this?

374
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:51,204
It's my gift for you.

375
00:23:52,653 --> 00:23:53,310
For me?

376
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,165
Uhm.

377
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:55,218
On what occasion?

378
00:23:56,188 --> 00:23:57,627
Don't you remember what day today is?

379
00:23:57,908 --> 00:23:58,993
It's so important.

380
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:01,808
What day?

381
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:03,633
The day I went to the supermarket.

382
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:07,022
By the way, I noticed that your hair was way too greasy.

383
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,356
I bought it for you.

384
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:12,517
It's so caring of you.

385
00:24:12,767 --> 00:24:14,414
I'm always a caring person to you.

386
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:16,031
It is you that don't care about me.

387
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:18,429
All right. Keep it for yourself.

388
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:20,681
Uh. Just give it a try.

389
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:22,110
I bought it for you.

390
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:24,174
This is the Japanese brand. It's really good.

391
00:24:24,174 --> 00:24:26,760
A good remedy for itchy scalps and tandrum.

392
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,865
It's way too cool.

393
00:24:27,865 --> 00:24:29,273
On top of that, it won't leave your hair greasy.

394
00:24:29,273 --> 00:24:31,734
Surely it'll get you K-drama actor-like bouncy hair.

395
00:24:33,757 --> 00:24:35,978
Whoa, such a shampoo buff.

396
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:39,314
Recently you've become a K-drama junkie.

397
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,474
That's it. Please use it to my liking.

398
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,654
All right.

399
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:48,021
By the way, I also use this set at home.

400
00:24:48,438 --> 00:24:49,919
It's about to run out, too. Thank you.

401
00:24:50,242 --> 00:24:52,202
You see? I'm right on time.

402
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:53,328
I've gotta go.

403
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:54,673
Uhm.

404
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:18,530
If he is Cinderella, how am I supposed to do?

405
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:23,327
♪ The puff of chill soothes my eyes, ♪

406
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:26,465

415
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,566
You're awake?

416
00:26:47,557 --> 00:26:50,727
Please don't eat breakfast in a moment.
I have to examine you again.

417
00:26:51,717 --> 00:26:54,397
Uh? Last night I didn't have this stuff on me.

418
00:26:54,793 --> 00:26:57,181
And where is he?

419
00:26:57,181 --> 00:26:58,484
Already gone home.

420
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:00,987
Why did he go home?

421
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:04,146
He said he'd watch out for me.

422
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:06,086
It's true no good deed goes unpunished.

423
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:09,568
Thanks to you, he pulled an all-nighter last night.

424
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:22,217
Thao, please give me a hand.

425
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:24,677
Help me get him up.

426
00:27:26,294 --> 00:27:27,149
Slow down.

427
00:27:29,401 --> 00:27:31,236
He's running a high fever. Go get some meds.

428
00:27:31,236 --> 00:27:32,289
All right.

429
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:34,375
Hang in there.

430
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:36,460
It's okay.

431
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:43,331
He may be experiencing delirium.
Help me give him a dose.

432
00:27:47,242 --> 00:27:48,232
Are you okay?

433
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:50,318
It's okay.

434
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:52,445
It's all fine.

435
00:27:53,644 --> 00:27:55,708
Totally fine.

436
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,316
You can go out and get back to work.

437
00:28:01,402 --> 00:28:02,538
I will keep an eye on him.

438
00:28:04,446 --> 00:28:05,395
It's okay.

439
00:28:07,804 --> 00:28:08,773
It's okay.

440
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:12,214
You're just as clueless. Turn it on.

441
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:13,831
Hah?

442
00:28:14,112 --> 00:28:15,186
You have a phone?

443
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:18,137
The phone. Turn it on, okay.

444
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:19,951
Ah, here it is.

445
00:28:21,964 --> 00:28:23,194
Quickly.

446
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:26,718
Done.

447
00:28:29,857 --> 00:28:37,980
♪ What is love? How come my heart can be shattered into pieces? ♪

448
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:45,998

451
00:29:18,635 --> 00:29:20,658
A caring sweetheart stayed up all night to take care of you.

452
00:29:20,845 --> 00:29:22,118
How lucky!

453
00:29:22,118 --> 00:29:24,005
I'm single as fudge.

454
00:29:25,579 --> 00:29:26,883
I'm about to cry at the thought of it.

455
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,283
Ah, ah, ah.

456
00:29:32,388 --> 00:29:33,410
- Ah.
- Hah?

457
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:36,559
Are you listening? You've gotta listen in a conversation, all right.

458
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:40,386
I mean you can go home after I check up on you.

459
00:29:40,386 --> 00:29:43,618
Listen. Remember to follow my advice.

460
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:46,434
At home, please try to walk like a normal human being.

461
00:29:46,434 --> 00:29:48,582
Learn how to stand, walk and sit like a real human being.

462
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:50,271
Please open your eyes widely.

463
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:52,554
Look around with your eyes widely open.

464
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:54,191
Don't let yourself trip and fall during walking.

465
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:56,850
If you fell down again, you'd have your arm broken and amputated.

466
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,218
Think about it. A handsome man with the amputated arm is so ugly.

467
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:01,292
Okay, got it?

468
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,586
Ah. Thank you.

469
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,004
Thank what?

470
00:30:05,004 --> 00:30:06,203
I have done nothing for you.

471
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:07,882
This is Mr. Khoa's exam room.

472
00:30:07,955 --> 00:30:09,811
Mr. Khoa has already paid your hospital fees.

473
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:13,189
All right. I've gotta go.

474
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:10,611
After adding chopped meat, cook this pot until it's well done.

475
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:17,045
And you can season it to taste. I will add a little salt.

476
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,324
Why is he so kind to me?

477
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:51,777
Is he into me?

478
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,874
But he's a man. And I'm...

479
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,057
Cinderella.

480
00:32:00,682 --> 00:32:02,424
Why do you turn out to be a man?

481
00:32:05,906 --> 00:32:07,992
[Perverted Doctor: Where are you? You're in sick.
Why don't you take some rest?]

482
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,247
[Perverted Doctor: Go home, please.
I have something interesting for you.]

483
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:28,794
I'm listening.

484
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:30,107
Where are you?

485
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:33,684
I'm on my way home.

486
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:36,395
Why don't you stay at the exam room to take some rest?

487
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:40,649
I find it hard to sleep on a strange bed.

488
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:43,527
Uhm, just go home. I'm waiting.
