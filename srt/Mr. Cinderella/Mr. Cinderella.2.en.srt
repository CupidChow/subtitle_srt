(Episode 2)

17
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:29,924
F*ck!

18
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,992
Hey, bumping into us, aren't you going to say hello?
Where are you going?

19
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:38,078
Hey, catch him.

20
00:02:16,408 --> 00:02:17,294
Are you nuts?

21
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,171
I've just saved you a life.

22
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,339
I don't need it.

23
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:21,715
You...

24
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,156
We broke up, Nguyen.

25
00:02:26,053 --> 00:02:27,148
But I don't want it.

26
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:28,608
Like it or not, it's the truth already.

27
00:02:37,043 --> 00:02:38,753
Thanks for giving me a hand.

28
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:40,734
Our relationship is all over.

29
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,319
Don't say another word about it.

30
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:44,300
You...

31
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:50,797
Brother!

32
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:53,820
Shut your mouth.

33
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,344
I'll handle you later.

34
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,230
Go home.

35
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,294
But...
Go.

36
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:07,709
What?

37
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:09,868
If you can, just give it a go.

38
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:11,286
Let's see who's gonna help you.

39
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:11,828
Hah?

40
00:03:11,828 --> 00:03:12,819
You. F*ck you.

41
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,435
Get off me.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,460
What?

43
00:03:18,783 --> 00:03:20,493
A little bird told me you're a bad-ass.

44
00:03:20,493 --> 00:03:22,464
This morning you still wanted to choke me to death.

45
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:24,466
Why are you so weak now?

46
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,499
Big Brother, please don't mess with him.

47
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:30,055
He is infamous for being a mad dog,
always barking "Woof, woof!"

48
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,329
You're all mistaken.

49
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:35,988
He's not Dung Mad Dog anymore,

50
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,302
but Dung Lame Dog instead.

51
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:38,897
Hah?

52
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:39,919
What's wrong?

53
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:42,609
This morning you seemed overbearing.

54
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:43,724
Son of a b*tch.

55
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:45,674
Kneel quickly.

56
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,885
What the f*ck is that "huh"?

57
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:48,802
Kneel quickly.

58
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,127
F*cking nope.

59
00:03:51,284 --> 00:03:52,786
Kneel quickly.

60
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,090
Lick it.

61
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,029
Then I'll forgive you.

62
00:03:59,188 --> 00:03:59,970
You, f*ck!

63
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:02,848
Hey.

64
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,852
You already got a disabled arm.
Do you really wanna have all four limbs disabled?

65
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,937
I'll give you the last chance.

66
00:04:21,992 --> 00:04:25,673
Uh? Where are you going?

67
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:29,969
I'm about to go to the orphanage
and help Ms. Danh with the orphan examination.

68
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,866
Let me join you, please.

69
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:32,659
Let me join you.

70
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:33,555
No need.

71
00:04:33,555 --> 00:04:34,859
You'd better stay here and fulfill your duties.

72
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:36,225
Yes.

73
00:04:36,225 --> 00:04:38,070
Ah, by the way,

74
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,876
I have something to tell you.

75
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,670
But I'm way too embarrassed.

76
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:47,246
I am wondering if

77
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,020
you have time tonight.

78
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,116
Because I...

79
00:04:52,116 --> 00:04:53,471
I have all the time in the world.

80
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:56,141
What? You want me to go grab a bite with you?

81
00:04:56,735 --> 00:04:57,892
Or go to the movies?

82
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:00,238
Or be your honey?

83
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,751
No way you're gonna be my honey.

84
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:22,177
Yes, I'm listening.

85
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,253
Today is the examination date, but why didn't you stop by?

86
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,068
I got an unexpected issue, so I forgot to tell you in advance.

87
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:28,652
Yes.

88
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,468
Please try to arrange your time for the follow-up examination.

89
00:05:32,468 --> 00:05:33,887
My lungs are still in good shape.

90
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:35,263
I've gotta call to notify you.

91
00:05:35,263 --> 00:05:36,222
How early your call is.

92
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,932
I've been waiting for you for the whole afternoon.

93
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,455
Please stay healthy.

94
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,810
You, too.

95
00:05:58,547 --> 00:05:59,944
Don't you dare keep talking a ton of crap?

96
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:01,967
If I were in good shape,
all of you're gonna f*cking dead to me.

97
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:03,708
Dang it! F*ck you!

98
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:04,792
Knock the hell out of him.

99
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,309
You. F*ck.

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,238
Hey.

101
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:46,939
What are you doing here?

102
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:47,919
Go away.

103
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:49,848
What the hell are you doing here?

104
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,476
Hello, guys!

105
00:06:53,476 --> 00:06:55,823
I'm new to town. I'm not familiar with the roads.

106
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,720
So I'm about to ask you.

107
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,421
Do you know where the address of No. 168B is?

108
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:01,547
Ask for what?

109
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,299
F*ck that!

110
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:04,310
F*ck off!

111
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,948
Oh you guys.

112
00:07:09,253 --> 00:07:11,880
Well then I will ask other people.

113
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,194
Thank you guys so much.

114
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,571
Are you really ditching me?

115
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,896
Don't be such a chickenshit.

116
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,482
Hey. Do you know each other?

117
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:23,736
What's your point? How on Earth can I know him?

118
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,239
All right. I need to get going.

119
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:27,886
Hey.

120
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:28,970
Ridiculous.

121
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:39,189
Hey, watchmen! Let's get the hell out of here.

122
00:07:39,616 --> 00:07:40,398
Get them to the Police Station.

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,925
Are you okay?

124
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,199
I thought you'd ditch me for good.

125
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:04,318
The laws are made to be abided by and not challenged.

126
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,686
And don't waste your breath with those gangsters.

127
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,772
Go back to the exam room. I'll check it for you.

128
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:12,253
No need.

129
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,015
I have no money to pay you.

130
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:16,299
Why are you so headstrong?

131
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:19,010
Let's go.

132
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,867
Why are you as stubborn as a mule?

133
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:23,712
You want your money back?

134
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:24,964
F*ck!

135
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,009
Are you happy now?

136
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,761
You're in so much pain.
Why don't you go back to the exam room?

137
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,232
Don't be so stubborn.

138
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,827
Today thanks for helping me

139
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,433
with the arm.

140
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,237
But...

141
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:00,791
I have no money to pay you.

142
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:05,098
I haven't said a word that I want to get your money.

143
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:06,818
You gave it to me by yourself.

144
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:10,196
Working in the exam room but collecting no money,
what can you get by on?

145
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:12,407
Hey.

146
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,004
None of your business. Don't care about it.

147
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,215
What you need to care about is

148
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:20,603
if your arm doesn't receive timely treatment,

149
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,302
it has to be cut off.

150
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,753
Do you wanna be Yang Guo?

151
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:29,268
Let's go.

152
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,999
I can go by myself.

153
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,294
You've been stubborn until now.

154
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:40,435
Come in.

155
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,929
Take a seat there.

156
00:10:20,965 --> 00:10:22,268
Try to bear the pain for a while.

157
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:33,749
This feeling

158
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:35,438
sounds familiar.

159
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:38,618
What's wrong?

160
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:40,881
Ah, nothing.

161
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,763
If it's all done, I'll go home now.

162
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:48,816
Hold on.

163
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,224
Please for for the meds.

164
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,351
No need.

165
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,332
Just consider the meds as my gift.

166
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,417
No need, really.

167
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,229
Huynh, please help me prepare the meds for this patient.

168
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,579
Why are loaded people like you such a pain in the neck?

169
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,070
I told you I didn't need it.

170
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:19,159
What's wrong?

171
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,015
Ah, nothing.

172
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:25,227
Hey.

173
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:27,782
Your arm

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,846
is still in bad shape.

175
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:32,224
I strictly advise you not to move it too hard at home.

176
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,475
Got it?

177
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:35,977
As for the ointment,

178
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:38,428
if it is inconvenient to put it on,
you can have your family member do it for you.

179
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,066
The ointment for my face.

180
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:43,746
No need. It means a sum of savings for you.

181
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:45,153
What's wrong?

182
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,750
Because of the disabled arm, it's way too inconvenient.

183
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:52,254
If it is way too inconvenient,
you can have your family member do it for you.

184
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:55,591
I don't have anyone.

185
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:00,940
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:04,694 --> 00:12:07,050
No biggie. I'm used to it.

187
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,076
If you're all on your own,

188
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,984
as for your personal life,

189
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:15,246
let alone the household chores,

190
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,707
can you do them all by yourself?

191
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:21,794
I don't have a home to come back.

192
00:12:21,971 --> 00:12:24,140
There isn't any housing for me, either. No worries.

193
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,768
What do you mean by "no housing"?

194
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:28,280
You find it surprising?

195
00:12:39,614 --> 00:12:40,511
Here are your meds.

196
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,054
Thank you.

197
00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:52,147
Your meds.

198
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:54,379
How about money?

199
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,517
Just take them.

200
00:13:03,878 --> 00:13:06,047
Thanks for helping me today.

201
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:09,571
I owe you one.

202
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,177
Next time I'll pay you in full.

203
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:13,617
Hey.

204
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:16,693
Why don't you stay to take some rest?

205
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,278
You can leave when you get better.

206
00:13:20,196 --> 00:13:20,936
Rest assured.

207
00:13:21,687 --> 00:13:24,878
There are always beds for patients
to stay overnight in the exam room.

208
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:26,776
Even if I count you in,

209
00:13:27,537 --> 00:13:29,049
no way our exam room will go bankrupt.

210
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:11,487
Ah, I'm sorry.

211
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:13,656
You got injuries on your face.

212
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:15,856
It's all right. They're just minor injuries.

213
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,838
Nope. Just go inside. I'll check on them for you.

214
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,345
Is this month for bad blood

215
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:26,940
that anyone can shed blood?

216
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:28,733
Uh?

217
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,632
Someone that suffers more miserably than me?

218
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:34,854
Ouch!

219
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,294
Does that hurt much?

220
00:14:38,191 --> 00:14:39,213
Please be gentle a bit.

221
00:14:40,766 --> 00:14:42,320
Even if it hurts, try to bear it,

222
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,010
You're a strong man,
but you shout it out just because of rubbing alcohol.

223
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,389
It's all done.

224
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:58,722
You're still hurt?

225
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:01,255
Ah, by the way, what's your name?

226
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,403
Thanks for bandaging the wound for me.

227
00:15:03,998 --> 00:15:05,061
I'm Huynh.

228
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:06,719
Huynh?

229
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,210
What a gorgeous name.

230
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,406
You still get hurt somewhere?

231
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:18,679
Ah, no, no.

232
00:15:19,576 --> 00:15:20,900
May I ask you a question?

233
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,496
Since this morning, have you seen anyone

234
00:15:23,496 --> 00:15:27,156
handsome, healthy and strong, with a bright face.

235
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,367
Going in here for the examination?

236
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:32,516
There have been a bunch of patients
going in and out this exam room.

237
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,517
What's his name?

238
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:35,717
His name is Dung.

239
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:39,481
He's been nowhere to be found since yesterday.
I have to wait 24 hours

240
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:41,202
to call the Police.

241
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:45,685
Since this morning,
there isn't any patient the name "Dung" at all.

242
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:50,346
All right, just don't care about him.

243
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,151
He's already a grown-up.
He must know how to take care of himself.

244
00:15:57,249 --> 00:15:57,979
Ah.

245
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,507
How much is it?

246
00:16:06,811 --> 00:16:09,751
This is my personal stuff, so you don't have to pay money.

247
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:11,743
I'm way too embarrassed.

248
00:16:12,295 --> 00:16:13,494
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

249
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,644
Thank you so much.

250
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,621
Mr. Khoa, give it a try for this brand.

251
00:16:25,621 --> 00:16:28,478
Men like you are afraid of greasy micellar water, right?

252
00:16:28,478 --> 00:16:32,044
If you use this brand, I can make sure
it will leave your skin smooth without any greasy feeling.

253
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,201
What are you trying to do?

254
00:17:36,963 --> 00:17:38,162
What am I trying to do?

255
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:40,404
You'll know it soon.

256
00:17:42,802 --> 00:17:43,772
I'm gonna shout it out.

257
00:17:47,943 --> 00:17:48,714
Just shout it.

258
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:50,800
No one's gonna hear you out.

259
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,082
Just shout it.

260
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:54,262
No.

261
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:57,640
Please help me.

262
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,759
Shout it out.

263
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,538
Hey.

264
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,512
You have a mouth, why don't you call anybody for help?

265
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:52,536
Don't tell me that all you have eaten
since this morning is just a loaf of bread.

266
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:05,828
Why don't you crash into my house?

267
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:07,913
What are you up to?

268
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,220
Are you nuts?

269
00:21:29,862 --> 00:21:30,561
Come in.

270
00:21:41,478 --> 00:21:42,615
Please take a seat.

271
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,920
Ah actually

272
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:51,624
all I have is 1 million Dong.

273
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:55,190
Later when I have a job, I'll try to give you back.

274
00:22:02,301 --> 00:22:03,844
Just consider this 1 million Dong

275
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:06,034
as your rent.

276
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:09,016
When your arm fully recovers, we'll figure it out.

277
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,103
Thank you.

278
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:18,307
What a beautiful house!

279
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,341
There must be a woman behind you.

280
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,510
I'm not married.

281
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,878
I don't mention a word of your wife.

282
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:29,453
How about your younger sister?

283
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,034
She must be pretty and caring.

284
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:39,912
Hey.

285
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,551
The left room is the storage room,
but I don't have enough time to clear it up.

286
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,125
Temporarily

287
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:46,762
just stay in my room.

288
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,359
Thank you.

289
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:53,102
You should take a shower first.

290
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,573
You'd better shower first.

291
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,527
You're too trusting of people, aren't you?

292
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:05,541
Aren't you afraid that.

293
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,357
I will steal your stuff while you are showering?

294
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:14,759
Are you gonna take my stuff away from me with a disabled arm?

295
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:18,262
I choose to trust you.

296
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,275
If you are a bad guy,

297
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:24,863
you will never risk your life to get it back for me.

298
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,584
All right, I'll take a shower first.

299
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:09,154
Oh dang!

300
00:25:09,822 --> 00:25:11,521
Even a doctor uses the dating app.

301
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:27,954
What have you seen?

302
00:25:29,174 --> 00:25:31,739
Just dating app stuff.

303
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:37,151
It turns out you're straight.

304
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:45,753
Curiosity killed the cat.

305
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,644
Hey, here you are.

306
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:54,950
They've just been washed.

307
00:25:59,611 --> 00:26:00,581
Thank you.

308
00:26:52,664 --> 00:26:55,052
Hey. You got a minute?

309
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,147
What's wrong?

310
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:58,785
Come here and give me a hand.

311
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,031
What's wrong?

312
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:07,950
I have a disabled arm.

313
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,712
I can't pull down my pants at all.

314
00:27:18,325 --> 00:27:20,066
Are you a girl disguising as a boy?

315
00:27:20,066 --> 00:27:20,911
Why do you have to cover it?

316
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,204
Well.

317
00:27:22,882 --> 00:27:24,925
Because you pull down my pants right away,

318
00:27:25,238 --> 00:27:26,604
I have the right to doubt it.

319
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:30,650
It is you that have me pull it down for you.

320
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:31,870
If you don't need my help, I'll go out.

321
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,871
Hey, I need it.

322
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:00,753
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

323
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:05,174
To doctors, it's totally normal.

324
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:09,032
I'm about to say I'm not embarrassed at all.

325
00:28:09,251 --> 00:28:11,368
But after hearing your words, I did feel totally embarrassed.

326
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,256
What a showy color.

327
00:28:14,256 --> 00:28:15,351
How cute!

328
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:18,698
Who told you men can't wear colorful underwear?

329
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,031
All right. Just take a shower.

330
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:35,611
What's your attitude?

331
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:39,031
Nothing.

332
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:50,751
One day I'm gonna take a close look at yours.

333
00:28:55,891 --> 00:28:57,528
What a huge bunch of stuff you bought!

334
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,426
Gosh, that bunch of stuff is not a big deal.

335
00:28:59,426 --> 00:29:02,325
I see you just eat out, which won't do you any good.

336
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:04,911
You buy it for me.

337
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:07,382
Uhm, who else am I gonna buy for?

338
00:29:07,382 --> 00:29:09,269
If I don't buy it for you, who else am I gonna buy for?

339
00:29:10,635 --> 00:29:11,855
But...

340
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:13,638
I have no idea how to cook.

341
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:15,484
Gosh, you don't need to cook at all.

342
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:18,487
Whenever you want to eat, get your phone and give me a call.

343
00:29:18,487 --> 00:29:21,406
"Hello, Thao." I come right here away to warm up the food.

344
00:29:21,406 --> 00:29:22,710
Together we can have a meal.

345
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:25,859
I'm afraid it will bother you.

346
00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:28,101
Don't ever say that again.

347
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,186
I can cook for you my whole life.

348
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,647
Which bottle is the shampoo?

349
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:34,263
I don't know a single word of English.

350
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:37,527
It is the white bottle right next to the sink.

351
00:29:37,725 --> 00:29:39,779
A bunch of bottles, all white.

352
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,313
Pick any bottle you like.

353
00:29:44,753 --> 00:29:46,682
Uh, excuse me.

354
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:48,892
I thought you lived alone.

355
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,800
That...

356
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,728
Who's that?

357
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,564
You know this guy, too.

358
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,388
I know him too.

359
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,661
Huynh, right?

360
00:29:57,661 --> 00:29:59,163
No no no. It's not Huynh.

361
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,081
Mr. Quan, security guard, right?

362
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:03,167
I'm so damn right. It is him.

363
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:05,920
That's why every single time I go past him

364
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,578
he will surely give me either a glance or a stare.

365
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:11,394
He must be jealous of my inborn beauty.

366
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,980
It's not him. It is the patient with the fracture today.

367
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,472
Remember?

368
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:22,551
I have prepared myself a beautiful soul and a garden full of ripen fruits.

369
00:30:23,312 --> 00:30:26,482
I also prepared a casting machine to make you straight again.

370
00:30:26,972 --> 00:30:28,567
It turns out that

371
00:30:28,567 --> 00:30:30,017
you're not only curved

372
00:30:30,017 --> 00:30:32,665
but also round like the moon on the 30th night of the month.

373
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,596
They're all shaving foam. You told...

374
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:50,975
What's wrong with you, Thao?

375
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,353
I'm okay.

376
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:55,970
I'm fine.

377
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,534
Totally fine.

378
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:00,902
All right, I need to go home.

379
00:31:01,475 --> 00:31:04,989
Next time I'll come back to warm up the food.

380
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:05,834
Later.

381
00:31:08,795 --> 00:31:10,588
Soap? Where's the soap?

382
00:31:11,892 --> 00:31:13,591
Hold on a sec. I'm coming in.

383
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,491
Hey.

384
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:20,838
Give this to me for what?

385
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,257
Give it a try.

386
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,033
I see you go out the streets all day.

387
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:30,535
You don't use micellar water at all.
How can your skin suffer it?

388
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:33,862
Men don't need this stuff.

389
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,126
Just use it. This brand is really good.

390
00:31:39,117 --> 00:31:42,266
It can remove fine dust, prevent acne
and even have antibacterial effects.

391
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,029
Looking at your skin, I know you're not taking good care of it.

392
00:31:46,218 --> 00:31:48,908
I'm telling you.

393
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:51,473
There are 3 important elements of people's appearance.
They are hair, teeth and skin.

394
00:31:51,723 --> 00:31:53,089
Try to take good care of them.

395
00:31:55,341 --> 00:31:56,874
What a know-it-all man!

396
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,649
Skincare is part of body care.

397
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:04,184
You've gotta know how to protect and love your skin.

398
00:32:06,206 --> 00:32:07,218
Just use it.

399
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:10,315
How can I use it with one disabled arm?

400
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,247
Let me help you.

401
00:32:18,802 --> 00:32:19,783
Just wash your face.

402
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:13,628
Wash again with water.

403
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:26,651
What?

404
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,530
Don't dare lie next to me?

405
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:33,387
Who told you I don't dare?

406
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:38,006
I'm afraid this bed can't support the weight of two men.

407
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,468
Don't worry about the weight.

408
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:45,556
Even a rough banging can't make this bed collapse at all.

409
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:50,759
Just lie down and get some sleep.

410
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,950
I've gotta go to work early tomorrow.

411
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,471
What are you looking at?

412
00:34:08,474 --> 00:34:09,893
Why are you so shy?

413
00:34:11,623 --> 00:34:13,146
Afraid that I'm gonna eat you alive?

414
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:18,026
Not at all.

415
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:22,217
I find it hard to sleep on a strange bed.

416
00:34:24,678 --> 00:34:25,627
Uhm.

417
00:34:36,377 --> 00:34:37,608
By the way, let me ask you a question.

418
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:40,183
Do you have any bad habits during your sleep?

419
00:34:40,183 --> 00:34:40,965
For example,

420
00:34:41,195 --> 00:34:42,644
gnashing your teeth, or snoring.

421
00:34:44,229 --> 00:34:45,199
I have trouble sleeping.

422
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,461
If you have any, just tell me.
I can sleep in the living room.

423
00:34:48,994 --> 00:34:49,818
Nope.

424
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:52,174
Hey.

425
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:55,136
You talk too much.

426
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,356
Do you believe

427
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:57,982
I'm gonna eat you alive right away?

428
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,774
He is lying upright, isn't he?

429
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:43,017
How can he touch me?

430
00:35:46,927 --> 00:35:47,657
Khoa.

431
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:50,045
Khoa.

432
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,632
It seems your house has a ghost.

433
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,082
Khoa.

434
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:33,870
Do you agree to stay with me your whole life?

435
00:36:34,641 --> 00:36:35,851
Yes.

436
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:40,428
No. I don't agree.

437
00:36:46,716 --> 00:36:48,749
What time is it now? Why don't you focus on your duty?

438
00:36:49,114 --> 00:36:51,512
Khoa's coming in no time. He'll surely give you a telling-off.

439
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,026
I don't give a damn about duty.

440
00:36:55,026 --> 00:36:58,916
Now my heart is grieving, I don't want to do anything.

441
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,221
Your sister

442
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,849
is suffering an unrequited love, Huynh.

443
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:06,892
Hah?

444
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:11,418
When on Earth did you have a lover?
How can I have no idea about it?

445
00:37:12,168 --> 00:37:14,640
Who is the unlucky guy that has a crush on you?

446
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,975
An unrequited love doesn't grieve me,
but your word does.

447
00:37:16,975 --> 00:37:18,143
So grief-stricken.

448
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:20,708
Why don't you care about me
after I suffer a unrequited love?

449
00:37:22,251 --> 00:37:24,952
You just care about strangers out there.

450
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,905
I haven't expressed my feelings for him yet.

451
00:37:30,593 --> 00:37:32,856
But he's already had a lover.

452
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:35,129
Who's that?

453
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,308
That is Mr. Khoa.

454
00:37:37,308 --> 00:37:40,822
It comes as a shock to me
he's seeing the patient with the fracture.

455
00:37:41,135 --> 00:37:44,169
That's why I'm so on edge.

456
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:47,464
Impossible.

457
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,195
Nothing is impossible.

458
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:51,009
I saw it with my own eyes.

459
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:53,345
They were living under one roof
and sharing a bottle of soap.
