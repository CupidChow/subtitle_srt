(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,980
(Episode 8)

17
00:01:44,177 --> 00:01:45,282
You know what?

18
00:01:47,138 --> 00:01:48,285
My friends.

19
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:53,123
They all ditched me.

20
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,869
Even the research team of community health project

21
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:01,455
all shunned me.

22
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:08,993
You know who is to blame in this mess?

23
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:11,340
I...

24
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,947
It's all because of your selfishness and possessiveness.

25
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:16,814
You...

26
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,873
You kept track of everything I did.

27
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:27,210
When I was at work, you constantly called me.

28
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:29,566
You called even when I was having a meeting.

29
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,589
Even when I visited my friend's funeral,

30
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,476
you called.

31
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:38,752
You called me. It was fine.

32
00:02:39,461 --> 00:02:41,265
But you called my friend's family,

33
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,414
talked crap,

34
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:47,605
and hung up suddenly without a word of encouragement.

35
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:52,130
I...

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,404
Who checked my text?

37
00:02:58,856 --> 00:03:01,421
Who checked my Facebook account?

38
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:05,394
Even my laptop,

39
00:03:07,124 --> 00:03:08,689
you infected it with the virus.

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,650
I had known it all.

41
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,331
I didn't want to argue with you.

42
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,158
But when it comes to Dung,

43
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,234
if something bad happens to him,

44
00:03:24,308 --> 00:03:26,112
I will never let you off that easy.

45
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,261
Keep in mind that

46
00:03:31,732 --> 00:03:33,630
it's you that gave up on me.

47
00:03:36,226 --> 00:03:37,113
And now

48
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:41,607
get out.

49
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:48,343
I said: Get out.

50
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,315
Wow. The fortune teller told me that

51
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:15,109
the odds were very much in my favor.

52
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:16,621
Hang in there.

53
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:51,135
What's wrong with you?

54
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:53,679
What happened to you?

55
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:56,296
You are under work stress, right?

56
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,794
If you're under a lot of stress,

57
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:07,390
you should call in sick for a few days.

58
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,747
You can go to the movies.

59
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:11,655
Or you can go traveling.

60
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:13,741
You're annoying as fudge.

61
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,664
I feel under stress for what you've just said.

62
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:24,439
Why suddenly do you yell at me?

63
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,983
I have done nothing wrong.

64
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,778
If so, I was wrong. I'm sorry, okay?

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,667
Huynh.

66
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,210
Huynh.

67
00:05:58,452 --> 00:06:01,486
The first that you have called is not available at the moment,

68
00:06:01,841 --> 00:06:04,489
please try again later.

69
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:10,036
The first that you have called is not available at the moment,

70
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,111
please try again later.

71
00:06:14,395 --> 00:06:17,273
The first that you have called is not available at the moment,

72
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:22,987
You've gotta be that mad at me?

73
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:36,187
It's not midnight yet.

74
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,086
The Princess is still here,

75
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,871
but where is the Prince now?

76
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:53,924
Hello, Dung?

77
00:06:53,924 --> 00:06:55,040
Hello, Mr. Khoa?

78
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:58,564
It's me, Thao. We have a new case.
Please come here now.

79
00:06:59,085 --> 00:06:59,992
I got it.

80
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,265
I'm on my way.

81
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:03,350
Yes. We'll get her prepped.

82
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:36,519
Why are you home late?

83
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:37,812
I'm starving.

84
00:08:02,326 --> 00:08:03,181
Come in.

85
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:40,165
Finally I came back to life.

86
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,473
Leave for good if you can.

87
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,256
I was leaving for good, but.

88
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,727
I'm afraid to hurt someone's heart.
I've gotta come back.

89
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,046
Why ain't you come home for a few days?

90
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,856
I had the key lost.

91
00:09:05,524 --> 00:09:06,702
And where have you been?

92
00:09:27,077 --> 00:09:28,558
When I left,

93
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:31,237
I had an unexpected matter.

94
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,646
I couldn't tell you in time.

95
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:37,650
I'm sorry

96
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,548
to keep you worried.

97
00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,613
You know I'm worried?

98
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,528
I was wrong.

99
00:09:54,187 --> 00:09:55,720
Alright, sorry.

100
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:58,942
Next time I'll tell you earlier.

101
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,028
I won't let you worry like that again.

102
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,093
Let me tell you.

103
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:08,368
Even if you got beaten the crap out of you,

104
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:10,673
at least you'd better call me.

105
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:13,905
Even if it were your corpse,
I could sigh with relief.

106
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:15,959
Don't you know that you had me so worried?

107
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,140
What a brutally frank doctor.

108
00:10:41,255 --> 00:10:42,225
Then what?

109
00:10:42,913 --> 00:10:43,904
That's my style.

110
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,582
Like it or not, I don't care.

111
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:55,530
Oh.

112
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,054
I got it.

113
00:11:02,672 --> 00:11:03,694
Eat some more.

114
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,073
My arm is injured again.

115
00:11:07,448 --> 00:11:08,574
Does it have to be bandaged up?

116
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,630
You're into being bandaged, right?

117
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,330
It's injured. I can't lift it up.

118
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:17,051
I've already checked it. It's okay.

119
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:18,751
Hey.

120
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,111
You're not allowed to move it hard.

121
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:27,468
Let me do the cooking and housework.

122
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:30,805
No.

123
00:11:31,305 --> 00:11:32,463
What will I live on to survive?

124
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:35,904
I'll feed you.

125
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,884
Okay?

126
00:11:37,468 --> 00:11:38,281
You'll feed me?

127
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:42,921
Handsome.

128
00:11:43,943 --> 00:11:44,850
Fit.

129
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:46,372
Rolling in money.

130
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,323
The idea of you feeding me is not bad.

131
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:52,775
But I have nothing to thank you except my body, babe.

132
00:12:00,376 --> 00:12:02,201
Your body is worth it.

133
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:03,963
Of course.

134
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,184
I can rock it.

135
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:07,623
You don't believe me?

136
00:12:08,217 --> 00:12:09,354
Give me a booty call. You'll see.

137
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:12,649
Who is your babe?

138
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:13,837
Hah?

139
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,027
Who answers is my babe.

140
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:20,803
How stubborn you are.

141
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:28,957
Now it's time to check on my patients.

142
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,387
Stay here. I'll be back at noon.

143
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:36,203
By the way, Thao will bring your meds later.

144
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,080
Eat something before taking the meds.

145
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,332
Okay.

146
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,066
Hold on.

147
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,006
Do you forget something?

148
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,269
Forget what?

149
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,231
You pervert.

150
00:12:53,387 --> 00:12:54,055
Get out of my way.

151
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:15,795
Hello.

152
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,109
Huh?

153
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:18,954
Now?

154
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,166
Okay. I'm coming.

155
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:26,107
Ah. Huynh.

156
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,309
Gosh. It's lucky that I have you here.

157
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,477
It's time for the girl to take the meds.

158
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,949
But it sucks that she insists on having me around.

159
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,846
Or can you take the meds?

160
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:36,899
Hey hey hey.

161
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,320
Please take the meds to Dung on the rooftop, will you?

162
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,270
Please.

163
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,596
That's why I'm way too miserable.

164
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:48,244
It all comes down to the fact that I'm a likeable

165
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,683
and loveable person.

166
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:52,227
Even the little girl needs me by her side, too.

167
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:52,853
Please.

168
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:53,541
Alright, just go.

169
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:54,970
Thank you.

170
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:27,857
Hey.

171
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,130
It's time to take the meds.

172
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:32,622
Thank you.

173
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,575
Did you put anything in this?

174
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,620
Don't think everyone is a jerk like you.

175
00:14:44,123 --> 00:14:45,635
Only when Khoa checks it will I drink it.

176
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,835
What if you poisoned it with something?

177
00:14:54,195 --> 00:14:56,291
Please treat others the way you want to be treated.

178
00:14:57,261 --> 00:14:59,690
You think if you have Khoa's heart,
you'll have everything, right?

179
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,340
Who got out of line first?

180
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,051
Don't think I was kept in the dark about what you did.

181
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,074
Don't ever mess with me.

182
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,909
If I say the truth, you'll will be ashamed.

183
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:11,504
Is that so?

184
00:15:13,725 --> 00:15:15,550
In this day and age, both audio

185
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,282
and visual files are needed.

186
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,380
I have not only evidence

187
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:24,622
but also witnesses.

188
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,040
If you wanna take a look,

189
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:27,406
I can show you.

190
00:15:41,878 --> 00:15:43,098
What're you doing?

191
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,195
Mr. Khoa.

192
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:56,831
Thao.

193
00:15:57,071 --> 00:15:58,478
Please sign this paper.

194
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,045
Here?

195
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,629
Yes.

196
00:16:09,489 --> 00:16:11,846
By the way, have you seen Dung?

197
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,931
Ah, he's on the rooftop.

198
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,683
I asked Huynh to bring the meds there.

199
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,414
Oh, thank you.

200
00:16:17,414 --> 00:16:17,967
Yes.

201
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,441
After all I'm no longer needed.

202
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,370
It's okay. I'm still fine.

203
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:28,779
Why?

204
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,469
Why is that you?

205
00:16:31,678 --> 00:16:33,315
What are you better than me at?

206
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,808
There are plenty of men out there.
Why does it have to be Khoa?

207
00:16:38,487 --> 00:16:40,291
Do you know why Khoa didn't choose you?

208
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,398
It's because of your selfishness and possessiveness.

209
00:16:43,993 --> 00:16:45,838
Love is understanding, having empathy for each other,

210
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:47,381
and enjoying company on the same path.

211
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:49,832
You ain't his parents to decide his life.

212
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:50,614
Shut your mouth.

213
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,948
What the hell do you know?

214
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,567
What're you doing?

215
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:58,507
Do you know what this is?

216
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,103
Polonium.

217
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:04,305
You won't die right away.

218
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:07,579
Huynh.

219
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:10,759
Get off him.

220
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,031
What're you doing?

221
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:13,480
Are you insane?

222
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,055
What are you both doing?

223
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,338
I don't wanna be gone that soon, just because of him.

224
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:20,977
You're always caring for him.

225
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,556
What is he better than me?

226
00:17:28,808 --> 00:17:29,882
He's jobless.

227
00:17:30,987 --> 00:17:32,770
His dignity sucks.

228
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:35,012
He's such a foul-mouthed jerk.

229
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:37,702
After all,

230
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,497
what do you like about him?

231
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:42,144
You want to know it that bad?

232
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,597
Huh?

233
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,070
At least,

234
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,063
he's way more thoughtful than you.

235
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,047
Why?

236
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,248
Why didn't you care about me for once?

237
00:18:03,593 --> 00:18:05,887
You're always a caring person to him only.

238
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:06,971
Enough.

239
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,767
We broke up so long ago.

240
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:13,864
Stop caring about my life.

241
00:18:19,442 --> 00:18:20,871
You yell at me.

242
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:27,012
You have never yelled at me before.

243
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:31,381
But since that jerk showed up,

244
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:34,342
you have yelled at me over and over again.

245
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:35,750
Do you have the right to blame it on me?

246
00:18:37,053 --> 00:18:37,877
Huh?

247
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:41,600
Why don't you think about what you have done?

248
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,010
You think you're right and the whole world is wrong,

249
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,564
don't you?

250
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:49,827
Think about it.

251
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:52,329
Let's go.

252
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,003
Stop meddling in my business.

253
00:20:01,356 --> 00:20:02,295
It's me.

254
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,735
What's wrong with you?

255
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,820
Are you crying?

256
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:09,375
Who bullied you?

257
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:12,148
No one.

258
00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:14,807
I just want to be left alone.

259
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:21,011
Don't say that.

260
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,097
I'm so worried about you.

261
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:28,509
How stubborn you are!

262
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,813
Aren't you listening to me?

263
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:38,810
Tell me what you've been through.
Please share it with me.

264
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,418
If you just keep it to yourself...

265
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,961
Keep your mouth shut.

266
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,047
What do you really know?

267
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,509
Alright, you don't go.

268
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:51,167
If you don't go, I will.

269
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,345
Huynh.

270
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,286
Do you hate me that much?

271
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:00,937
Yes.

272
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,147
I hate you.

273
00:21:03,856 --> 00:21:06,974
I hate your brother, too. I hate all of you, okay.

274
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,960
For all this time,

275
00:21:14,846 --> 00:21:16,567
have you ever had any feeling for me?

276
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,258
For all this time,

277
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:23,616
I have never had any feeling for you.

278
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,549
Please don't ever show up in front of my face again.

279
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,687
I'm dead tired.

280
00:21:34,303 --> 00:21:35,315
I'm begging you.

281
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,814
Go easy on him.

282
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,326
It's okay to break his legs.

283
00:21:58,244 --> 00:21:59,068
No big deal.

284
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:04,354
Half now and half when the job's done.

285
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:07,086
Okay.

286
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,475
There's no outlet in this neck of the woods.

287
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:21,841
Are you setting me up?

288
00:22:22,101 --> 00:22:24,447
It's not that. I've already checked the address.

289
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:27,137
But why is there no food outlet? How weird.

290
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:30,307
You found it out yourself or someone recommended it to you?

291
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,652
My friend recommended it to me.

292
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,615
How weird it is.

293
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:39,765
It'll take us ages to find it.

294
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:51,005
Slow down.

295
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm dead tired.

296
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,462
Stand here a bit.

297
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,058
I'm sorry.

298
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:15,686
You got hit because of me.

299
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,771
Let's go to the hospital, shall we?

300
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,565
We're not going there. We have no money.

301
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:23,600
What else can we do? They brutally hit you.

302
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,721
Get me a bottle of water.

303
00:23:31,546 --> 00:23:32,307
Quickly.

304
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,996
Hey. Drink some water.

305
00:23:54,715 --> 00:23:55,632
Let me take a look.

306
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:00,095
Mr. Dung.

307
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:02,796
Have I done something wrong to you?

308
00:24:03,035 --> 00:24:04,620
How dare you set me up?

309
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:12,190
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:12,774 --> 00:24:14,547
I don't mean it on purpose.

311
00:24:15,517 --> 00:24:19,020
I have no idea why they knew
where we were going and set us up beforehand.

312
00:24:20,219 --> 00:24:22,378
Obviously, only Huynh and I know about it.

313
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,080
What've you just said?

314
00:24:28,488 --> 00:24:29,604
Huynh knows about it, too?

315
00:24:30,824 --> 00:24:31,533
Yes.

316
00:24:31,877 --> 00:24:34,160
Huynh recommended it to me.

317
00:24:37,153 --> 00:24:38,550
You're such a dumb-*ss, Thinh.

318
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,635
You let him set you up.

319
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:43,607
Set me up?

320
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:47,340
What's your point? I don't understand.

321
00:24:50,791 --> 00:24:52,627
It's your fault to fall into love at first sight.

322
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:54,493
You're just a pawn in his game.

323
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:04,534
I will stay at your place for a few days.

324
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:06,150
Better take good care of me.

325
00:25:09,602 --> 00:25:10,874
What about Mr. Khoa?

326
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:12,751
The exam room?

327
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,414
We'll be blocked in the way if we come back.

328
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:22,292
The exam room shouldn't have anything to do with gangsters.

329
00:25:24,763 --> 00:25:26,077
When it's fine, I'll be back.

330
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:29,100
And Khoa...

331
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:34,794
Let's go.

332
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,016
Or else they'll come again.

333
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,268
How are you?

334
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:52,551
It hurts a little.

335
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,711
I've already checked it. It's all fine.

336
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,132
You'd better stay at home.

337
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:02,644
Don't go out and about.

338
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,543
You've gotta treasure your body.

339
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,536
You want me to spend more on your meds?

340
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:13,749
Mr. Khoa.

341
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:16,064
Huynh submitted his resignation letter.

342
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:19,234
I knew it.

343
00:26:19,557 --> 00:26:20,934
Why didn't you stop him?

344
00:26:20,934 --> 00:26:21,517
Anyway he...

345
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:22,769
Huynh's excellent, isn't he?

346
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,283
Wherever he wanna work, he'll be accepted.

347
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,701
But...

348
00:26:27,701 --> 00:26:28,806
Do you wanna go with him?

349
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:29,932
I'll approve.

350
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:31,371
No.

351
00:26:31,642 --> 00:26:33,227
I'm just wondering.

352
00:26:42,465 --> 00:26:43,185
Tell me if

353
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:44,697
you wanna know why Huynh resigned?

354
00:26:44,916 --> 00:26:45,302
Huh?

355
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:50,265
A little bird told me
Huynh didn't want to be under the curse of being single till the rest of his life.

356
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,318
That's why he's gotta leave.

357
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:54,436
Oh my gosh. Who on Earth spit venom like that?

358
00:26:54,436 --> 00:26:55,885
This is the examination room,

359
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:57,574
not the witch's house.

360
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,660
What curse?

361
00:27:00,692 --> 00:27:01,568
Who says?

362
00:27:01,568 --> 00:27:02,767
The witch is right in front of me.

363
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:03,476
Where?

364
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:04,581
Where?

365
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:07,668
What a flat joke.

366
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:09,534
Hit you hard.

367
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,579
Hit you again.

368
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,468
If Dung didn't show up,

369
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:01,722
would we have a chance to get back together?

370
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:05,528
Not a chance. I'm sorry.

371
00:28:08,572 --> 00:28:10,168
Dung's really better than me, isn't he?

372
00:28:13,337 --> 00:28:14,380
To me,

373
00:28:16,049 --> 00:28:18,259
I don't need a head turner.

374
00:28:20,042 --> 00:28:23,327
I just need a person who always turns to me for my whole life.

375
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:27,393
Am I that bad?

376
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:30,261
I don't even have a chance, right?

377
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,012
Huynh.

378
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,319
Trying to

379
00:28:36,986 --> 00:28:39,061
earn back what is mine

380
00:28:39,562 --> 00:28:40,667
is wrong?

381
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,726
The underlying cause of misery

382
00:28:47,872 --> 00:28:50,823
comes from the fact that you don't accept the truth,

383
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:53,847
and you don't appreciate what you have at present.

384
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,811
Why do you keep trying to earn back what doesn't belong to you?

385
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,212
You can't even keep our friendship.

386
00:29:12,605 --> 00:29:13,710
Since the beginning,

387
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,275
you have known it all, haven't you?

388
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:18,361
I know it all.

389
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,656
I just don't want to talk about it.

390
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,671
I want to let you save face,

391
00:29:27,818 --> 00:29:29,747
realize your own mistakes,

392
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:31,415
and change.

393
00:29:36,118 --> 00:29:36,629
Huynh.

394
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:42,062
Please don't spend your time hating someone.

395
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,429
Spend that time loving someone else instead.

396
00:29:47,087 --> 00:29:50,799
Because you and I can only live once.

397
00:30:25,751 --> 00:30:26,366
For you.

398
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,452
What is this?

399
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,567
A talisman.

400
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,488
This is the necklace my mom asked for me when I was a child.

401
00:30:35,594 --> 00:30:37,263
You're still alive regardless of your bad fate.

402
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:38,993
Are you scared?

403
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:42,403
If you're scared, just drop it.

404
00:30:43,362 --> 00:30:44,488
I'll wear it.

405
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:47,679
Did you drop your sense of humor today?

406
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:55,802
Let me put it on for you.

407
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:49,835
It's true a gangster

408
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:52,285
would make it rough whatever it is.

409
00:31:54,006 --> 00:31:55,111
You like it?

410
00:32:11,242 --> 00:32:15,663
[I'm sorry. I wish you two happiness.]

411
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:22,649
What's wrong?

412
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,319
Ah, it's just work.

413
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,587
Dung,

414
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:38,905
are you afraid my fate would be against yours?

415
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,482
I'd rather keep it short but happy,

416
00:32:45,536 --> 00:32:47,372
than live my whole life without you.

417
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:49,728
It'll make me feel flat.

418
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:11,698
Ah.

419
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:14,857
Are you and Danh okay?

420
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:21,552
My whole life, I owe you a debt of gratitude.

421
00:33:25,347 --> 00:33:26,859
But if you need it,

422
00:33:28,162 --> 00:33:29,497
I can repay you right now.

423
00:33:35,566 --> 00:33:36,191
A house,

424
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,485
a car,

425
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,154
and a steady job.

426
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,749
Then what?

427
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:45,127
In exchange for no one who could understand me,

428
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:47,213
and no one who really loves me.

429
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:50,966
Do you really see I'm happy?

430
00:33:59,027 --> 00:33:59,892
Do you know

431
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:04,178
since my parents passed away,

432
00:34:06,472 --> 00:34:07,994
what people have talked about me?

433
00:34:12,947 --> 00:34:14,156
People said.

434
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:17,243
I was bad luck,

435
00:34:18,046 --> 00:34:19,328
and was such a jinx.

436
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,905
What's the point of living in a big house like this?

437
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:37,127
In exchange for

438
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:41,725
no one who really loves me,

439
00:34:42,299 --> 00:34:43,623
and could understand me.

440
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:46,512
Do you see I'm glad?

441
00:34:47,314 --> 00:34:47,836
Hah?

442
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:50,255
Do you see I'm happy?

443
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:52,434
That is why

444
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,927
you let a jerk step into your life, right?

445
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:58,544
Are you sure he loves you?

446
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:01,193
Are you sure you can change him?

447
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:02,173
Are you sure?

448
00:35:02,173 --> 00:35:04,238
Nothing in this life is flawless.

449
00:35:05,989 --> 00:35:07,626
What is sure and ain't sure?

450
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,247
The same goes for you.

451
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,009
What do you mean?

452
00:35:15,436 --> 00:35:17,094
I already remembered what

453
00:35:18,064 --> 00:35:18,783
had happened on that day.

454
00:35:19,732 --> 00:35:20,358
What're you doing?

455
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:22,985
As long as you go blind, you'll be like me.

456
00:35:23,225 --> 00:35:26,207
I can take your place and step in that house.

457
00:35:26,781 --> 00:35:27,792
Are you crazy?

458
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,377
We are sister and brother.

459
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,649
Sister and brother?

460
00:35:30,649 --> 00:35:33,715
While you can enjoy a fancy life in that house,

461
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:37,145
I've gotta live a miserable life in this poor orphanage.

462
00:35:37,145 --> 00:35:38,564
-Get off me.
Sister and brother what?

463
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,294
Knock him out.

464
00:35:40,294 --> 00:35:41,671
Break his legs.

465
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:42,682
What're you doing?

466
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:45,539
Get off me.

467
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:55,591
Since when did you remember it?

468
00:35:57,812 --> 00:35:59,428
It doesn't matter anymore.

469
00:36:04,944 --> 00:36:06,915
Do you really want me to stay happy?

470
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,076
I'm begging you.

471
00:36:15,892 --> 00:36:19,563
Please let me stay by the person who loves me, will you?

472
00:36:24,776 --> 00:36:26,528
If Ms. Danh hadn't recommended me

473
00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:30,167
to adoptive parents and persuaded them,

474
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:33,233
surely.

475
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,006
I couldn't be who I am today.

476
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:42,575
Whatever mistake she may have made,

477
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:45,818
I would forgive her.

478
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:49,353
I know she isn't a bad person.

479
00:36:51,011 --> 00:36:53,294
No wonder you let her insult me,

480
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:55,140
and didn't stand up for me once.

481
00:36:58,675 --> 00:36:59,728
I'm sorry.

482
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,272
Sorry what?

483
00:37:02,606 --> 00:37:04,107
