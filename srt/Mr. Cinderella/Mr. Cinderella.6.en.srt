(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,980
(Episode 6)

17
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:25,022
Get off.

18
00:01:25,022 --> 00:01:25,940
Get off. What're you doing?

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,587
Get off me.

20
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,297
Are you insane?

21
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:30,643
How dare you get the gangsters to hit my Khoa?

22
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,758
I...

23
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,344
It's lucky he's still fine. Or else...

24
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,951
Hey. Who is to blame for this mess?

25
00:01:37,076 --> 00:01:39,600
It's your doctor who dragged my Dung into...

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,340
Into what?

27
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,448
I thought you were a real bad-ass.

28
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:47,180
You turn out to be a useless p*ssy.

29
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:48,504
You don't know sh*t about me.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,414
If you don't have the guts, don't love other people.

31
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,552
You only hurt their feelings.

32
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:55,574
You...

33
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:57,680
What?

34
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,244
You're gonna hit me?

35
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:01,715
Go ahead.

36
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:03,717
Let me tell you.

37
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:06,335
I'm not as gentle as those men hooking up with you.

38
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,589
You're no better than me.

39
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:13,321
We're just junkies clinging to so-called love.

40
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,471
Let's see.

41
00:02:18,242 --> 00:02:20,859
I won't go easy on your ex.

42
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:24,426
Loser.

43
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,491
Are you okay?

44
00:03:36,706 --> 00:03:37,895
I'm fine.

45
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:39,772
Thanks.

46
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,422
Let me take you home.

47
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,029
It's okay.

48
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,219
I can go by myself.

49
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:01,908
By the way,

50
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,485
have you loved me as much as I did?

51
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:11,022
Later

52
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:13,785
can we still be friends?

53
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,238
Whenever you're in need, call me.

54
00:04:38,893 --> 00:04:39,738
How's your feelings?

55
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,064
Your arm is okay now.

56
00:04:44,305 --> 00:04:45,723
But it's not in total good shape.

57
00:04:46,974 --> 00:04:50,248
So don't get into any more fights.

58
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,128
My arm heals d*mn quick.

59
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,247
What a bad thing to say.

60
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:02,458
Why do you want a disabled arm instead of a healthy one?

61
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:07,390
My arm heals up, so I can't freeload on you.

62
00:05:28,109 --> 00:05:29,204
Okay, I've gotta go.

63
00:05:29,684 --> 00:05:30,653
Thank you.

64
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:32,916
Uhm.

65
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:35,001
Be careful.

66
00:05:40,945 --> 00:05:42,582
Ah, I got it.

67
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:29,566
Dung.

68
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:36,260
Dung.

69
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,716
Where have you been?

70
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,781
Ah, I bought some stuff

71
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,523
to celebrate my healthy arm.

72
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:52,391
Ah.

73
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,226
Do you need a hand?

74
00:07:06,906 --> 00:07:08,053
Just go upstairs.

75
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,170
Why did you prepare a fancy meal?

76
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,662
They're all my favorite dishes.

77
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,029
I bought them for you.

78
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:27,405
Give it a try.

79
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,262
How lucky I am.

80
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,724
Let me see.

81
00:07:41,816 --> 00:07:42,796
Does it taste good?

82
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,600
It tastes good.

83
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:55,871
Let's make a toast.

84
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:03,973
Cheers.

85
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:09,051
Thanks for taking care of me for the last time.

86
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,654
It sounds like parting words.

87
00:08:22,064 --> 00:08:23,920
You're gonna leave me alone, aren't you?

88
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,748
My arm has completely healed.

89
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,857
I've gotta know the manners.
No way I'll let you kick me out.

90
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,538
I didn't say I would kick you out of here.

91
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,419
It's you who allows me to stay.

92
00:08:45,254 --> 00:08:46,432
Don't be a lying piece of sh*t.

93
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:47,777
Uh.

94
00:08:48,716 --> 00:08:49,863
I won't be a lying piece of sh*t.

95
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:52,344
Yes.

96
00:08:58,726 --> 00:08:59,581
Well.

97
00:09:00,895 --> 00:09:02,094
To avoid rumors

98
00:09:02,094 --> 00:09:04,836
and in order for you not have any reason to kick me out,

99
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,577
I'll pay the rent.

100
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,455
Don't you dare kick me out?

101
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:11,770
Hey.

102
00:09:12,573 --> 00:09:14,283
This is my house.

103
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:16,400
It's not a room for rent.

104
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:18,787
Let me pay part of the bills.

105
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,477
Will you?

106
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,609
You must want me to stay so bad.

107
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:30,956
Alright, I'll take the loss.

108
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,252
You're that confident, are you?

109
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,630
I see great sincerity on your face,

110
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,550
I don't have the guts to leave.

111
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,633
Isn't it that

112
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,220
you don't wanna leave me?

113
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,991
What?

114
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:57,055
Are you crazy?

115
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,333
Dung.

116
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:04,979
Huh?

117
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,430
Are you jealous of me and Huynh?

118
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:10,766
Jealous my *ss.

119
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:13,540
Oh, you're not jealous.

120
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:19,077
Someone called me at lunchtime,

121
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:25,031
and he said if I didn't come out there,
he would have his brother knock the hell out of me.

122
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,818
I'm not married.

123
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,812
You're still available.

124
00:10:37,877 --> 00:10:41,359
You can see that I'm a handsome doctor

125
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,111
with a kind heart.

126
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:45,958
And you're

127
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,022
a gangster

128
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,389
with incredible generosity.

129
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,331
We match so perfectly.

130
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:57,313
Why don't we give each other a chance?

131
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,119
Maybe we will find something in common

132
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,183
to be a couple.

133
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,351
How stubborn you are.

134
00:11:15,446 --> 00:11:17,948
Oh, I like it that way.

135
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:19,147
Will you say Yes?

136
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,682
We have plenty of time.

137
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:26,477
It's long enough to learn about each other from head to toe.

138
00:11:38,104 --> 00:11:39,376
But.

139
00:11:43,818 --> 00:11:49,500
I am not Cinderella that you have been dreaming of.

140
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:54,662
I know.

141
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,185
Cinderella has turned into a prince.

142
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,198
Then what?

143
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:01,283
I've gotta accept it.

144
00:12:18,728 --> 00:12:20,302
You picked up a piece of bone.

145
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,272
Mrs. Hai Vang.

146
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,463
Mrs. Hai Vang, are you there?

147
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:39,394
What?

148
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:41,261
What's going on out there?

149
00:12:41,584 --> 00:12:42,991
Who? Who?

150
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:45,536
Ah, a d*mn debtor.

151
00:12:45,536 --> 00:12:46,578
What's up?

152
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,528
Why did you lock my door?

153
00:12:48,528 --> 00:12:49,884
I like it.

154
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,835
Now pay the rent. If you pay the rent, I'll unlock the door.

155
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,159
Take it easy. I'll pay you later.

156
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,984
I have never owed you a debt.

157
00:12:56,077 --> 00:12:56,922
Why so serious?

158
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,799
Take it easy? Until when?

159
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,552
How about my son's tuition fees?

160
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,908
How about my husband's gym fees?

161
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,464
How about my grandpa's bouncy animal hopper?
No one takes it easy for me.

162
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:10,508
If you don't have money, bounce.

163
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,364
Let me tell you.

164
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:16,671
Back then when you still had money,
you were a daddy shark du du du.

165
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,738
And now when you don't have money,
you're just a dump-dump-dump baby shark.

166
00:13:21,738 --> 00:13:22,593
Swerve.

167
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:24,345
F*ck.

168
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,524
Where's my stuff?

169
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,800
The other day, a new tenant moved in.

170
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,646
I packed your stuff

171
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,452
and left it at the alley out there.
I saw that Thinh had got it for you.

172
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:38,265
You're...

173
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:40,518
I'm what?

174
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:42,165
Let me tell you.

175
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,876
If I weren't a veggie and a Buddhist,

176
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:47,108
if I didn't recite the Buddhist scriptures every day,

177
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:50,017
I would never let Thinh take your stuff away.

178
00:13:50,267 --> 00:13:52,404
Oh my gosh. Look at me.

179
00:13:52,404 --> 00:13:54,928
I'm so kind-hearted and helpful.

180
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:58,275
There's always a magical aura radiating from me.

181
00:13:58,431 --> 00:13:59,620
No way you can see it.

182
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,727
No way you can see it with the eyes of a gangster.

183
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:05,532
Only people with the yin yang eyes can see it.

184
00:14:05,699 --> 00:14:07,347
Go. Go away.

185
00:14:07,524 --> 00:14:10,078
D*mn it. Let me recite the Buddhist scriptures.

186
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,477
Get the hell out of here.

187
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,572
Go away.

188
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:16,491
You're making such a noise.

189
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,286
Don't make me bitch about it at the crack of dawn.

190
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:21,392
Oh my Buddha. I'll recite your scriptures.

191
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:24,530
Dang it. Such a bitchy fat-*ss.

192
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,116
Never seen a bitchy fat-*ss like that.

193
00:14:30,046 --> 00:14:32,695
Excuse me, please buy some roses.

194
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:35,531
They're way too cheap. 50k a bunch.

195
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:49,501
Why're you so late?

196
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,119
What?

197
00:16:12,086 --> 00:16:13,306
Huynh's leg gets hurt.

198
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:17,331
His house is under repair, so I'll let him stay for few days.

199
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,971
Your house is no different from a rescue station.

200
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:26,141
Well you fired the first shot.

201
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,824
Do you hate me that much to give me attitude?

202
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:39,822
Alright.

203
00:16:40,864 --> 00:16:42,283
Let me bring your luggage in.

204
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:44,076
Yes.

205
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:48,998
I wanna go inside to take some rest.

206
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:50,666
My leg hurts.

207
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:01,750
Khoa.

208
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:04,513
Can you take me in?

209
00:17:05,253 --> 00:17:06,578
My leg hurts.

210
00:17:10,582 --> 00:17:11,687
Let me take you in.

211
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,837
Be careful.

212
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,417
Huynh.

213
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,795
What are you doing?

214
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,893
I can do it by myself.

215
00:18:01,893 --> 00:18:03,822
Your leg still hurts. Don't move it too much.

216
00:18:05,021 --> 00:18:06,367
I used to help you.

217
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:08,660
It's okay. Let me.

218
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,416
Don't say another word about our old story.

219
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:17,753
Too embarrassed.

220
00:18:17,753 --> 00:18:19,838
These are my clothes. I can hang them myself.

221
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:24,541
I didn't thought you were so kind-hearted
that you'd hand clothes for me.

222
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,826
I didn't mean to hang your clothes.

223
00:18:29,077 --> 00:18:30,891
I just wanna hang clothes for Khoa.

224
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,967
It's such a talent to become a helper.

225
00:18:34,384 --> 00:18:35,270
Dung.

226
00:18:35,886 --> 00:18:37,179
That's horse crap.

227
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:41,068
We used to date each other.

228
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,508
I know him inside out.

229
00:18:44,342 --> 00:18:46,886
Washing clothes and hanging them are no big deal at all.

230
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,004
It's a secondhand item anyway.

231
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,547
No need to be proud of it.

232
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:51,943
You...

233
00:18:51,943 --> 00:18:52,694
Me what?

234
00:18:52,694 --> 00:18:53,695
Hey.

235
00:18:54,748 --> 00:18:55,572
Can you drop it?

236
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,928
The owner is still alive and standing here.

237
00:18:58,492 --> 00:18:59,545
Stop fighting.

238
00:19:01,912 --> 00:19:02,485
Dung.

239
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,830
Go hang your clothes.

240
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:07,761
And you. Just get in your room.

241
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,659
Please go.

242
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,948
Hello. Ms. Thao?

243
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:20,889
I'm getting a bit better.

244
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,047
Uhm.

245
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:24,194
Such a bitchy pig.

246
00:19:25,717 --> 00:19:26,384
You sly devil.

247
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:29,408
Hey.

248
00:19:30,138 --> 00:19:31,076
Who's the bitchy pig?

249
00:19:33,954 --> 00:19:35,289
Who answers is the bitchy pig.

250
00:19:39,157 --> 00:19:40,513
Such a brat.

251
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:41,368
Then what?

252
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:43,453
I thought a brat was your type.

253
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,115
Hey.

254
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,232
I can do it.

255
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:07,091
Are you getting back together?

256
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,637
No.

257
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:17,560
So.

258
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:20,751
Do you have any special feelings left for him?

259
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,128
No.

260
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,187
That's good.

261
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,060
What're you looking at?

262
00:21:21,853 --> 00:21:25,691
On my way to work, I saw a fresh flower shop,
so I picked a bunch of flowers for you.

263
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,934
I wonder if you're into flowers or not.

264
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:32,030
Yes.

265
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,325
Let me buy flowers to give you every day, will you?

266
00:21:35,763 --> 00:21:36,743
Oh shoot.

267
00:21:37,306 --> 00:21:38,829
It will cost a fortune,

268
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:40,132
but I like it.

269
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,915
Keep it that way, will you?

270
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,386
Uh?

271
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:45,815
Thao?

272
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:47,170
Of course.

273
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,547
Today Huynh's off, isn't he?

274
00:21:48,547 --> 00:21:51,644
You have no idea? Huynh called in sick.

275
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:55,408
Ah. This turns out to be for Huynh.

276
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:56,920
Ah. No.

277
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,162
Alright. This is for Huynh, not for me. Take it back.

278
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:00,611
I bought it for you, really.

279
00:22:01,393 --> 00:22:02,311
Please take it.

280
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:02,936
It's for you.

281
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,573
Alright alright, please don't.

282
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:07,347
I mean it. I want to give it to you. Today is the 8th of March.

283
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:10,225
You're a girl. It's totally right to give you flowers.

284
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:11,580
Please take it.

285
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,521
I'm gonna take it, okay.

286
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:16,137
Hey. Here you are.

287
00:22:16,137 --> 00:22:17,784
I'm not that shy.

288
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:18,473
Oh.

289
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:19,953
Thank you.

290
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,278
I will take a photo and post it on Facebook.

291
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,780
Happy Women's Day.

292
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,875
Thank you.

293
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,143
Hey. What're you doing?

294
00:22:55,343 --> 00:22:57,272
Why did you throw flowers away? They're still fresh.

295
00:22:58,189 --> 00:23:00,139
It turns out you bought these flowers.

296
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:01,505
Then what?

297
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,508
Khoa is allergic to rose pollen.

298
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:06,594
How could you buy roses?

299
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:09,336
You wanna kill your landlord, don't you?

300
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,421
Ah, I forgot.

301
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,060
You're just a freeloading piece of sh*t.

302
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,584
You never care about your landlord.

303
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:20,910
Don't you dare say that again?

304
00:23:22,328 --> 00:23:24,695
You freeloading piece of sh*t.

305
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,572
D*mn it.

306
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:30,597
What're you doing?

307
00:23:30,597 --> 00:23:31,556
Are you okay?

308
00:23:32,265 --> 00:23:33,579
He pushed me.

309
00:23:33,975 --> 00:23:35,112
My leg hurts.

310
00:23:35,112 --> 00:23:36,217
What're you doing?

311
00:23:36,613 --> 00:23:38,208
You wanna act as a gangster?

312
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:39,887
He picked a quarrel first.

313
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,232
He said I was a freeloading piece of sh*t.

314
00:23:41,535 --> 00:23:42,869
I just pushed him slightly.

315
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,955
But you could have a talk instead.

316
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,082
No need to lay hands on him.

317
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,375
Hah?

318
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:49,126
Because...

319
00:23:49,126 --> 00:23:50,325
I'll talk to you later.

320
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:53,693
Ouch. It hurts, Khoa.

321
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,383
Please check the wound for me.

322
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,407
Let me take you to the hospital.

323
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:03,494
I don't know when my leg will heel.

324
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:05,955
It hurts.

325
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,821
I'm gonna have my leg broken.

326
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,179
It hurts.

327
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:12,086
I'm so pissed off.

328
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,035
Ouch.

329
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:15,287
Only you would believe him.

330
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,768
Such a fake acting.

331
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:18,561
F*ck.

332
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,140
Go screw yourself.

333
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,892
I caught you red-handed breaking into the Princess's castle.

334
00:25:11,354 --> 00:25:12,188
Mad at me?

335
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,507
Oh. The Prince is mad at you.

336
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,740
Alright. Don't be mad at me.

337
00:25:28,298 --> 00:25:29,278
I'm sorry.

338
00:25:32,552 --> 00:25:34,888
What happened this afternoon? Please tell me.

339
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,452
Nothing.

340
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,530
It took me more than 100k to buy a bunch of flowers.
After all, it was thrown away.

341
00:25:43,354 --> 00:25:45,137
He told me you were allergic to rose pollen.

342
00:25:45,607 --> 00:25:47,046
Why didn't you tell me that?

343
00:25:48,568 --> 00:25:50,007
I've been on the meds.

344
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:54,490
On top of that, it's just a little pollen. It's not a big deal.

345
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,004
I didn't have face swelling or shortness of breath.

346
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:00,163
It's okay.

347
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,915
What else?

348
00:26:05,793 --> 00:26:07,420
He said I was a freeloading piece of sh*t.

349
00:26:08,838 --> 00:26:10,069
That's right.

350
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:11,945
You bitchy pig.

351
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,082
I'll move out. Are you happy now?

352
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:14,364
Hold on.

353
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,450
It's late. It's so dangerous to go out now.

354
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,108
I ain't scared of a damn thing.

355
00:26:20,642 --> 00:26:21,236
Hey.

356
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,309
You sure you ain't scared?

357
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,605
But with the eyes of a doctor,

358
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,963
well,

359
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,434
I know for sure there's one thing you don't dare do it.

360
00:26:44,499 --> 00:26:45,062
What thing?

361
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:46,688
Just say it.

362
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:58,096
You never know who's gonna be better.

363
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:00,181
Is that so?

364
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:02,798
So let's give it a try.

365
00:27:04,175 --> 00:27:05,728
I've already lost my first kiss.

366
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,064
Let's see

367
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,192
how much topnotch your skills are.

368
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:14,518
Dang it.

369
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,322
What a lustful doctor.

370
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,501
Khoa.

371
00:27:29,043 --> 00:27:30,586
Can I sleep here tonight?

372
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:43,631
Don't say that you're gonna let me sleep in the kitchen.

373
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,904
Don't you dare sleep with Khoa on the same bed?

374
00:27:46,571 --> 00:27:48,698
Sorry. The bed doesn't have any space left.

375
00:27:48,907 --> 00:27:51,753
If you want, you can wait till your next life, hah.

376
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,423
Who are you to sleep with Khoa?

377
00:27:54,683 --> 00:27:56,529
And who are you to sleep with him?

378
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,136
At least I'm his ex.

379
00:28:00,272 --> 00:28:02,890
It's a secondhand item. No need to brag about it.

380
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,453
You...

381
00:28:03,453 --> 00:28:04,766
Alright.

382
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,237
Please stop fighting.

383
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:12,138
Khoa.

384
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:14,411
Are you gonna let me stay with him?

385
00:28:14,891 --> 00:28:15,663
Uh.

386
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:21,783
You two, sleep here.

387
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,421
I'll get some sleep at the exam room.
Tomorrow I'll be back.

388
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,298
I'll come with you.

389
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:27,091
Alright.

390
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:29,176
You two, good night.

391
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:35,516
Poor you.

392
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:37,737
Your plan ended up failing.

393
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,666
How dare you do that to me?

394
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:42,304
Why can you have no sense of shame?

395
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,712
I like it. Okay?

396
00:28:43,712 --> 00:28:44,473
You...

397
00:28:59,342 --> 00:29:00,864
If you don't sleep, go to the living room.

398
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,272
Stop bothering me.

399
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,171
I've never seen a thick-skinned person like you.

400
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,444
You keep freeloading on him and don't wanna leave.

401
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:08,591
Then what?

402
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:10,676
It's not your turn to diss me or kick me out.

403
00:29:16,849 --> 00:29:17,850
What're you doing?

404
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:20,384
You're so extra.

405
00:29:20,853 --> 00:29:21,979
I have no interest in you.

406
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,464
After breaking up, don't cling to your ex.

407
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:28,871
Shameless.

408
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:30,936
I cling to my ex, then what?

409
00:29:31,551 --> 00:29:33,397
If you have what it takes, conquer Khoa.

410
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:36,692
No need to conquer him.

411
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,278
We've been close knit since our childhood.

412
00:29:39,976 --> 00:29:42,718
You're just the spice to make dish tastier.

413
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,555
What've you just said?

414
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:47,108
Don't you dare say that again?

415
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,450
You are just the spice.

416
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,266
The kids received clothes and books from Khoa.
They were so happy.

417
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:01,821
They also drew a picture for you.

418
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,990
I will give it to you when we meet.

419
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:05,345
Yes.

420
00:30:05,783 --> 00:30:07,556
If the kids are happy, I'll be happy, too.

421
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:11,351
By the way, don't spend too much time with the kids.

422
00:30:11,487 --> 00:30:13,332
Please pay attention to your health as well.

423
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:16,200
Oh gosh, you're still awake now. How can you care for me?

424
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,410
I'm on duty.

425
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,423
Alright. You should sleep early.

426
00:30:20,423 --> 00:30:22,039
Let's meet together later.

427
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,270
Suddenly you tell me to sleep. I feel sleepy now.

428
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,335
Okay. Keep up your good work. Bye.

429
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:27,816
Yes, bye.

430
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,011
Mr. Khoa.

431
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:48,096
What's wrong, Thao?

432
00:30:48,607 --> 00:30:49,900
Nothing.

433
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:52,914
Do you see if

434
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:56,219
the weather today is perfect for a date?

435
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,598
I remember that you're single.

436
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:05,113
Hey, don't make up an excuse to avoid your duty.

437
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:06,365
I won't.

438
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,993
I just wanna grab a bite to eat with you.

439
00:31:13,924 --> 00:31:15,071
Alright. I won't eat it.

440
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:17,563
Please, go with me.

441
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:19,086
You're always saying no when I tell you so.

442
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,181
Please. Please. Only this time.

443
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:22,599
Please go grab a bite with me.

444
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,167
Alright, you'd better eat on your own.

445
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,793
I have to read documents.

446
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:31,942
You can end your shift early.

447
00:31:32,078 --> 00:31:34,017
What do I end my shift early for?

448
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:35,831
Thank you.

449
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:59,282
Cinderella.

450
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:01,753
The Prince is riding to pick you up.

451
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,073
Why do you come here at this time?

452
00:32:11,044 --> 00:32:12,389
I can't sleep because of missing you.

453
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:14,724
I get my *ss here to see if you would feel the same.

454
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,727
Or you just bury yourself in work without missing me.

455
00:32:18,343 --> 00:32:21,022
Ouch. My heart hurts.

456
00:32:27,518 --> 00:32:29,739
What do you want the doctor to do

457
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:32,680
to make up for your pain?

458
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:38,477
What about a kiss?

459
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,323
Do you dare?

460
00:32:58,497 --> 00:32:59,676
You can kiss many parts.

461
00:33:00,197 --> 00:33:01,490
But you only kiss my forehead.

462
00:33:05,421 --> 00:33:06,213
By the way,

463
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,237
let me ask you a question.

464
00:33:09,978 --> 00:33:11,323
Pleas answer me honestly.

465
00:33:12,188 --> 00:33:13,001
Go ahead.

466
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,683
Why do you hate Huynh that much?

467
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,364
You feel me?

468
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,214
Even if he were a God from the heaven,

469
00:33:27,412 --> 00:33:28,673
I could never stand him.

470
00:33:29,706 --> 00:33:32,656
All the same he wanna take you away from me.

471
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,370
But

472
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,508
if you still have feelings for him, I've gotta lose you.

473
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,158
But I will earn you back anyway.

474
00:33:48,996 --> 00:33:49,840
Come here.

475
00:33:55,304 --> 00:33:56,201
You sure?

476
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,217
What a childish gangster.

477
00:34:03,239 --> 00:34:04,084
Then what?

478
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:05,502
You like it?

479
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:08,557
Yes.

You leg hasn't healed yet.
Where're you going?

489
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:04,915
It's been better.

490
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:08,262
I can work at the reception.
I don't wanna lose attendance bonus.

491
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:11,610
That's right.

492
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:12,913
Are you okay?

493
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,049
Huynh.

494
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:17,960
How is your leg?

495
00:35:18,252 --> 00:35:20,045
I bought some meds and food for you.

496
00:35:20,045 --> 00:35:20,921
Hold on.

497
00:35:21,192 --> 00:35:23,298
I mean this is the examination room.

498
00:35:23,298 --> 00:35:24,883
It has plenty of meds.

499
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:26,166
Why did you buy meds?

500
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:29,763
You're wrong. You're so wrong.

501
00:35:29,763 --> 00:35:30,660
I forgot.

502
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,548
Anyway you'd better take the meds.

503
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:35,779
Thank you.

504
00:35:36,082 --> 00:35:37,260
Today you're off?

505
00:35:37,854 --> 00:35:38,637
Oh shoot.

506
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:41,149
I'm late. Alright I've gotta go to work.

507
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:41,619
Ah.

508
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,026
I will pick you up when I'm done.

509
00:35:44,465 --> 00:35:45,216
Bye.

510
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,607
You want it so bad.

511
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:53,766
Even every pill and food, the boy cares for you,

512
00:35:53,766 --> 00:35:55,726
You're way too lucky.

513
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:57,416
But let me tell you.

514
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,376
He drops by to see you every day.

515
00:35:59,376 --> 00:36:03,161
Use your body to pay him back.
Or else you'll get a taste of your own medicine.

516
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:09,261
No no no. You're too grown-up.

517
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:11,638
You have your own hands to feed yourself.

518
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:12,775
What?

519
00:36:12,775 --> 00:36:13,526
Take it, please.

520
00:36:13,974 --> 00:36:15,507
But I have my own food.

521
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,582
If you don't eat it, get rid of it.

522
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,506
Khoa.

523
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,176
Please check this file for me.

524
00:37:17,923 --> 00:37:20,394
Your leg hasn't healed yet. Why do you go to work?

525
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,301
Huynh, Huynh.

526
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,782
Take a seat.

527
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:33,918
Slow down.

528
00:37:37,391 --> 00:37:38,339
What's wrong?

529
00:37:39,372 --> 00:37:39,956
Hah?

530
00:37:44,158 --> 00:37:46,149
Your forehead is hot. You must have a fever.

531
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:48,078
I'm okay.

532
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:54,908
You've come down with a fever after one night at my house.

533
00:37:57,515 --> 00:37:59,360
Don't you dare say that again?

534
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,814
You got ditched. Don't act if you were the main lover.

535
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:09,339
At least I'm better than you.

536
00:38:10,257 --> 00:38:12,081
If he didn't have any feelings for me,

537
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:14,167
I would never take me here.

538
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,036
There're plenty of men out there.

539
00:38:19,453 --> 00:38:21,122
Why do you just cling to your ex?

540
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:23,593
Then what?

541
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:27,388
I'm gonna ruin whatever I can't have.

542
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:27,972
You...

543
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,401
What?

544
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:30,746
You're gonna hit me?

545
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:33,248
Go ahead. Let's see who Khoa will take sides with.

546
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,532
Khoa, you're home?

547
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,570
Hey. Stop pretending.

548
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,397
Hey.

549
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:53,602
Keep bragging about it. Such a loud-mouthed jerk.

550
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,357
Hey.

551
00:39:07,418 --> 00:39:08,919
One punch knocked the sh*t out of you.

552
00:39:09,326 --> 00:39:10,160
Suck a weak jerk.

553
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:17,303
I'm okay.

554
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:19,493
I forgot to cover myself with the blanket.

555
00:39:19,712 --> 00:39:20,911
And the window was left open.

556
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,611
So I caught a light cold.

557
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,854
How could you be so careless?

558
00:39:28,168 --> 00:39:29,690
You haven't acted like that before.

559
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:33,465
Because I had you back then.

560
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,748
Alright, let me examine you.

561
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,277
I say I'm okay.

562
00:39:55,383 --> 00:39:56,769
Don't do that again.

563
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:00,846
What's wrong with you? I'm examining you.

564
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:03,464
Khoa.

565
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,436
We no longer have each other after a breakup.

566
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,982
You don't need to care for me like that.

567
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,489
I've gotta learn not to rely on you.

568
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,878
If you keep doing that,

569
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:24,537
it'll be awkward for me.

570
00:40:26,497 --> 00:40:27,102
Uhm.

571
00:40:29,709 --> 00:40:31,940
But you'd better take care of yourself.

572
00:40:34,703 --> 00:40:35,965
Are you caring for me?

573
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,050
Of course, I care for you.

574
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:44,776
I'm nothing to you. You don't need to care for me.

575
00:40:47,601 --> 00:40:48,759
You matter to me.

576
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:53,722
I matter to you?

577
00:41:05,098 --> 00:41:05,567
Hey.

578
00:41:06,443 --> 00:41:09,415
It turns out that I matter to you.

579
00:41:09,415 --> 00:41:10,259
Ah.

580
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:11,678
Huynh.

581
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:13,262
Ah.

582
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,348
- Oh.
- I mean...

583
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,654
It seems like I'm bothering the world of your own.

584
00:41:22,282 --> 00:41:23,325
Get off me, Huynh.

585
00:41:27,422 --> 00:41:28,747
It's not like what you think.

586
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:31,187
Huynh has a fever. So I'm examining him.

587
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:32,469
Is that so?

588
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,245
If you have a fever,
why don't you stay at home instead of going out and about?

589
00:41:38,934 --> 00:41:39,737
Then what?

590
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:41,489
It's none of your business.

591
00:41:41,489 --> 00:41:42,417
I don't that much time.

592
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,764
But what do you come here for?

593
00:41:52,072 --> 00:41:53,542
It turns out to be late.

594
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,464
If I don't come, you will skip your meal, won't you?

595
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,513
I leave it here. Remember to eat it later.

596
00:42:07,744 --> 00:42:09,183
Oh. I got it.

597
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:10,580
Thank you.

598
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:13,896
I've gotta go.

599
00:42:21,768 --> 00:42:23,301
