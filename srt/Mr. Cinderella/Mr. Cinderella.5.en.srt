(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,980
(Episode 5)

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,987
This is just a warning.

18
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:42,936
Are you insane?

19
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:44,365
I'm insane.

20
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:46,085
This one never wanna be outdone.

21
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:48,191
Don't you dare steal my lover?

22
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:49,881
Who's your lover?

23
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:50,965
Dung.

24
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,697
What?

25
00:01:54,437 --> 00:01:56,366
Don't say you have no clue who is Dung.

26
00:01:56,762 --> 00:01:57,899
Let me tell you.

27
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:00,141
If you're gay, be gay to yourself.

28
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,788
Don't drag my Dung into your shit.

29
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,635
Who's your Dung?

30
00:02:05,897 --> 00:02:07,836
Hah? You're insane.

31
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:11,632
Hey. You're not leaving.

32
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,706
Everyone, please.

33
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:17,179
He stole my husband. What a perverted faggot.

34
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,076
He stole my family.

35
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,620
Get off me. Enough.

36
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,539
If you love him sincerely,

37
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:26,355
figure out a way to make him love you back.

38
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,098
No need to keep him. Nobody's gonna steal him from you.

39
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:34,373
Given that you're a girl,

40
00:02:35,186 --> 00:02:37,668
I don't wanna pick a quarrel with you.

41
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:38,961
Just go.

42
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,421
Hey. Stop.

43
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,997
Are you sure you and Dung are really in love?

44
00:02:46,135 --> 00:02:47,052
If yes,

45
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,993
do you have what it takes to earn him back?

46
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,038
Hey.

47
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,167
Whether gay or straight,

48
00:02:58,022 --> 00:02:59,669
when they love someone, they'll love

49
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,370
from the bottom of their heart.

50
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:06,728
They won't pick a random quarrel like you.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,657
Go.

52
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,066
Or else I'll call the security guards.

53
00:03:14,121 --> 00:03:15,508
Knock the hell out of him for me.

54
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,383
Sit down here.

55
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,394
What have you done to get this?

56
00:04:00,052 --> 00:04:01,408
I stole her husband.

57
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:04,473
She cut you some slack.

58
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:05,527
If I were...

59
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:06,580
Were what?

60
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,959
Would you give me a knockout?

61
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:13,628
Stay still. Let me put it on.

62
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,051
It hurts.

63
00:04:23,503 --> 00:04:24,441
It breaks your heart?

64
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,256
Of course.

65
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:27,350
By the way, you're...

66
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,039
I'm what?

67
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:30,791
Say it.

68
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,355
I wanna hear it.

69
00:04:34,576 --> 00:04:36,902
Why didn't they hit you in the mouth?

70
00:04:37,308 --> 00:04:38,862
You'd better shut up for a better world.

71
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:47,172
But

72
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:51,312
you and I, are we together?

73
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,197
If she really wants to get back with me,

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,138
will you earn me back?

75
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:06,734
Hold on.

76
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:08,172
Hah?

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,216
How long had you been there?

78
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,542
Ah. Well.

79
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:15,075
Why didn't you show up to help me?

80
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:17,442
You wanted them to beat me to death?

81
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,371
What?

82
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:21,498
Everyone, please.

83
00:05:21,498 --> 00:05:23,062
He stole my husband.

84
00:05:23,062 --> 00:05:26,670
What a perverted faggot. He stole my family.

85
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,371
Enough.

86
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:34,866
If you love him sincerely...

87
00:05:38,109 --> 00:05:39,579
That's right.

88
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,677
To you, I'm more of a doctor

89
00:05:45,366 --> 00:05:47,138
than

90
00:05:49,818 --> 00:05:51,351
a landlord of yours, aren't I?

91
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,324
You couldn't fight back,
now you shift the blame onto me?

92
00:05:55,324 --> 00:05:56,554
What a smart move.

93
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:57,420
Of course.

94
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,765
Of course what?

95
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,851
Who said violence couldn't solve any problem

96
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:03,227
and there had to be law involved?

97
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,752
I thought you'd ditch me for good.

98
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,902
The laws are made to be abided by and not challenged.

99
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,957
And don't waste your breath with those gangsters.

100
00:06:17,763 --> 00:06:20,693
So I called out the watchmen.

101
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:28,763
All right. I'm sorry.

102
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,142
Next time I'll go out of my way to rescue you, okay?

103
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,322
You wanna see me get whupped?

104
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,179
What can I say to please you?

105
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:42,882
All right. Sit down, and put it on for me.

106
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,499
What's wrong?

107
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:47,355
Nothing.

108
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,807
Are you sure?

109
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,362
I told you it was nothing.

110
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,447
Let me put it on.

111
00:06:58,241 --> 00:06:59,388
Please be gentle.

112
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,770
You're a strong and healthy man,
why don't you care for your life?

113
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,584
You're always freeloading on other people.

114
00:07:11,087 --> 00:07:12,651
If it is too hard,

115
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,582
act as a disabled victim,
drag yourself to the sidewalk and ask for money.

116
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,158
I think some people will give you money.

117
00:07:20,471 --> 00:07:21,368
Then what?

118
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:24,767
I thought both of you broke up.

119
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,499
Now you act if you both were official?

120
00:07:28,354 --> 00:07:29,585
Who told you we broke up?

121
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:33,213
We're just having a temporary separation.

122
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,675
Are you a drama junkie?

123
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:38,218
You think I'll believe it?

124
00:07:39,438 --> 00:07:41,847
It's clear that Khoa hasn't changed the lock.

125
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:44,537
And I still keep the key.

126
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,223
Look back on yourself.

127
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:56,820
The high you climb, the harder you fall.

128
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,629
Who said falling was no pain?

129
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:17,007
Such a pain in my golden *ss.

130
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:35,046
Please tell Phuc to submit health certificate
to complete labor export procedures.

131
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:36,964
Labor export?

132
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:39,415
You don't know, do you?

133
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,387
If you don't know, how can I know?

134
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:48,883
It seems you two aren't that close.

135
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:56,129
I told you to call me if there was any problem, didn't I?

136
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,928
What? Just Boy Love Drama.

137
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,575
Nothing to be embarrassed about.

138
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:09,413
Seems like you're so curious.

139
00:09:11,478 --> 00:09:14,742
Do you think I'm watching p*rn?

140
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:18,631
It's your house. Whatever you like watching is up to you.

141
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,759
Even when you watch p*rn, it's no big deal to me.

142
00:09:24,126 --> 00:09:25,106
Sounds right.

143
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,192
What kind of film are you into?

144
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,538
Let's watch together.

145
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:34,626
Huh?

146
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,367
What film?

147
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,623
How about p*rn?

148
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:43,228
We watch together.

149
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,620
What's the point of watching p*rn?

150
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,856
To learn more experience.

151
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:02,977
Experience what?

152
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:07,972
What's on your mind now

153
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,203
is what I mean.

154
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:13,592
Hey.

155
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,740
I don't think you'll be so thick-skinned.

156
00:10:17,294 --> 00:10:20,255
I'm not your lover

157
00:10:20,255 --> 00:10:21,746
to do that thing.

158
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:28,732
Don't say that

159
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:31,986
you and your ex did the same.

160
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,365
Of course.

161
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:39,910
Why're you so curious?

162
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:43,591
Don't tell me that

163
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:46,573
you have "turned" from straight to gay.

164
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:49,336
Let me tell you.

165
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:52,840
This sexual orientation needs more experience.

166
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:55,217
You've gotta learn more experience.

167
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,542
If you don't know, let me show you.

168
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,778
It's totally different from man-and-woman sex.

169
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,924
You'd better watch out. My s*x skills will outdo yours.

170
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,144
But he says it's not gonna happen without preparation.

171
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,422
Dang it.

172
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,330
Tons of steps.

173
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,617
Don't they get hurt?

174
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,715
If I bang him so hard,

175
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:28,508
he will walk side to side.

176
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,368
Let's see the clip.

177
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:57,996
Why didn't you tell me your laptop
was connected to the speakers?

178
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,009
You didn't tell me

179
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:04,085
you borrowed my laptop to watch p*rn, either.

180
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:04,701
You...

181
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:11,113
When I told you to watch it together, why did you say no?

182
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,751
Now you're secretly watching it alone.

183
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:18,475
Uh Isn't that you watch p*rn and shift the blame onto me?

184
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,095
Alright, if you don't, I will.

185
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:29,590
You...

186
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:31,811
Hey.

187
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,294
Sit down.

188
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,005
Let's watch it together.

189
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:40,862
If there is something you don't know, I'll show you.

190
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:42,947
What a lustful doctor.

191
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,356
It doesn't make sense
what uni granted you the qualification.

192
00:13:45,877 --> 00:13:47,316
University of Medicine and Pharmacy.

193
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,401
I used to be an oversea student in France.

194
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:51,695
Real qualification, real price.

195
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:07,482
Huynh.

196
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:12,842
Uh? What're you doing here?

197
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:15,219
I'm applying for a job nearby.

198
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:18,128
From afar, I see someone like you.
And it turns out to be you.

199
00:14:19,296 --> 00:14:22,247
We have such good luck.
We run into each other even on weekend.

200
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,166
Where are you going now?

201
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:28,586
I'm going to the market,
and buying some veg to cook with ramen.

202
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:30,776
Eating ramen a lot won't do you any good.

203
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,112
Let's go out for a meal. My treat.

204
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,592
Don't try to one-up me.

205
00:14:36,094 --> 00:14:37,251
No problem.

206
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,149
I'll treat you to lunch.

207
00:14:39,535 --> 00:14:41,787
It never hurts to have a fancy meal once in a while.

208
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,936
Alright. Whatcha in the mood for?

209
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,450
I don't wanna eat out. Dead boring.

210
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:50,129
If you don't wanna eat out,

211
00:14:50,869 --> 00:14:53,111
I'll cook for you.

212
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,724
Uhm, I'm sorry.

213
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,404
I have some food at home, so I plan...

214
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,457
You know how to cook?

215
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:08,543
Not much, but enough to use.

216
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:11,244
If so, you can stop by my house.

217
00:15:13,141 --> 00:15:14,632
Stop by your house?

218
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:15,759
Uhm.

219
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,671
Wait for me.

220
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:29,574
This is my house.

221
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:30,628
Come in.

222
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,084
I have some stuff in the fridge.

223
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:41,618
If it doesn't bother you, please help me.

224
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:44,193
Let me cook for you.

225
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:45,590
Are you sure?

226
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,448
I can cook. Just go out and wait for me.

227
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:49,636
It's my forte.

228
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:02,201
May Nu Oa...

229
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:05,131
May Wealth God, and Earth God bless me,
and help me get over this challenge.

230
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,864
Only this time.
I'm running out of chance to conquer Crush.

231
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,450
Please bless me. Please bless me.

232
00:16:27,622 --> 00:16:29,801
Alright, how does it taste?

233
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,146
Tastes good.

234
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,815
How can you cook it?

235
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:36,506
There's a little left of everything.

236
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:39,467
I don't know what dish I should cook.
I just choose to cook this dish randomly.

237
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:44,702
It tastes good, really?

238
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,903
Except Dung, you're the second to give me the compliment.

239
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:06,765
What is Dung like?

240
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:10,446
Mr. Dung?

241
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:12,604
He's a good person.

242
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,898
He has tons of good points.

243
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:19,830
But as for his weaknesses,
he has a damn long list of things.

244
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,052
But he's the only family member I have.

245
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,888
I can accept his weaknesses.

246
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:27,494
He's the only family member of you, isn't he?

247
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:28,276
Uhm.

248
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:41,029
What about me?

249
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,034
Can I become your family member?

250
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:47,358
Yes.

251
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:49,016
Of course.

252
00:17:50,997 --> 00:17:52,697
Alright. Just drop it.

253
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,991
Uh, what's wrong, Huynh?

254
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,076
Are you mad at me for something?

255
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,892
You're always talking about Dung, Dung, and Dung.

256
00:18:01,653 --> 00:18:04,511
To you, Dung is the only one.

257
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,805
Whatever may happen, you'll be the first to help him.

258
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:12,028
Later if I may turn to you,

259
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,677
I'm not sure you will do the same.

260
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,836
It won't happen.

261
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,026
You're the most important person to me.

262
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:21,548
More important than Dung.

263
00:18:21,882 --> 00:18:24,781
As long as that's what you want.

264
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:26,147
You serious?

265
00:18:27,262 --> 00:18:28,024
Yes.

266
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:32,539
As long as you don't ask me to do illegal things.

267
00:18:40,984 --> 00:18:44,842
I see your house's been left uncleaned for a while.

268
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,880
Uhm, nearly 2 weeks.

269
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,862
I've been up to ears in work, so I don't have time.

270
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,218
Let me clean it for you.

271
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,096
All right. I can't let my customer do that.

272
00:18:59,378 --> 00:19:01,495
It's okay. I have tons of free time.

273
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:02,860
Sit there and enjoy your meal.

274
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:07,219
Enjoy.

275
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,741
Huynh, Huynh.

276
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,263
Please let me explain.

277
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:53,067
How dare you touch my private stuff?

278
00:19:53,807 --> 00:19:55,872
I'm sorry.

279
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:56,873
Get out.

280
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:58,843
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:58,843 --> 00:19:59,469
Just go.

282
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,268
♪ Though for sure ♪

283
00:20:17,268 --> 00:20:21,230

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:29,405

289
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,750
Ah, it's okay. Totally okay.

290
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,637
Just don't be mad at me.

291
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,404
I've gotta go.

292
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:09,550
But can I come back here one more time?

293
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:12,646
Yes.

294
00:21:15,253 --> 00:21:16,671
See you.

295
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:04,250
The first step to conquer Crush.

296
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:06,106
Delete dating apps.

297
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,319
You think I don't know your password?

298
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,990
I see what I want, I go after it no matter what.

299
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:37,502
Way to go!

300
00:22:38,795 --> 00:22:40,495
How dare you sneakily see my phone?

301
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,572
The text pops up in front of my eyes.

302
00:22:46,104 --> 00:22:48,044
I don't understand why you're so into these apps.

303
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:49,764
All boys,

304
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,453
but no sexy girl there.

305
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:54,185
What? Already downloaded the app?

306
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:59,023
Do you like it?

307
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:02,558
Watch live stream?

308
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:08,773
You picked up any six-packed guy?

309
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,618
I picked up another guy.

310
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:11,672
Who?

311
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:14,049
Me?

312
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:15,206
Me?

313
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:19,878
I don't have six packs at all.

314
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,027
I don't need six packs.

315
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,486
I prefer a fat belly like this.

316
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:30,326
Alright. I've gotta burn some incense.

317
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:40,638
Dang it. I haven't deleted it yet.

318
00:24:28,144 --> 00:24:30,646
Uh, how long have you been standing there?

319
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,252
Just for a while.

320
00:24:32,992 --> 00:24:34,452
Why do you make offerings late today?

321
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:36,308
I'm a little swamped.

322
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:37,966
But it's okay if it's a bit late..

323
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,325
Grab a beer?

324
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,782
Dung.

325
00:25:15,524 --> 00:25:18,204
I saw that you gave me a pitying look.

326
00:25:19,841 --> 00:25:21,395
Don't ever look at me like that again.

327
00:25:22,344 --> 00:25:23,480
Got it?

328
00:25:26,588 --> 00:25:27,995
Pitying what?

329
00:25:31,895 --> 00:25:33,584
I don't have any right to take a pity on anyone.

330
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:37,223
You still have your parents.

331
00:25:37,609 --> 00:25:39,694
I have no clue who my parents are.

332
00:25:41,404 --> 00:25:42,656
I've gotta say.

333
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:45,690
I really admire you.

334
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,798
Admire me?

335
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,158
What do you admire me for?

336
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,809
Let me tell you.

337
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:06,283
Don't judge the arrival of spring by the blooming flowers.

338
00:26:09,328 --> 00:26:13,499
Only a money understands a monkey.

339
00:26:14,104 --> 00:26:15,094
Got it?

340
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:23,519
At least you look happy on the outside.

341
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:26,762
Unlike you,

342
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:30,547
from the inside out, I'm a low life piece of sh*t.

343
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:33,936
That's the pity.

344
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:41,725
Pity.

345
00:26:46,741 --> 00:26:47,888
Let me ask you this question.

346
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,425
Have you ever

347
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,502
lost someone who matters to you the most?

348
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:04,154
Twice?

349
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:10,994
I've been through that sh*t twice.

350
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,953
How can you understand that feeling?

351
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,835
People had my fate predicted that

352
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:43,495
it would go against my parents' lives.

353
00:27:46,988 --> 00:27:50,002
Even foster parents, innocent people,

354
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:51,493
passed away because of me.

355
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:54,746
Do you really believe that?

356
00:27:58,562 --> 00:28:00,877
Believe it or not, nothing's gonna change.

357
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:10,512
It's true

358
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,192
while we feel worse off looking up,

359
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:16,247
we will feel better off looking down.

360
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,805
Is there anyone else who's in greater misery than me?

361
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:34,213
Yes.

362
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,110
Me.

363
00:28:38,946 --> 00:28:41,564
If you once lived under the bridge at 5,

364
00:28:42,658 --> 00:28:45,933
without enough food or safety, you'd understand.

365
00:28:49,613 --> 00:28:50,760
On rainy days,

366
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,565
there were tons of trash under the bridge.

367
00:28:55,713 --> 00:28:58,841
After one sleeping night,
you'd never know where they had gone.

368
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:04,618
Looking at those kids with their parents

369
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,390
going to school,

370
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:10,509
I just wanna go to Hell to get reincarnated.

371
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:24,930
But at least.

372
00:29:28,152 --> 00:29:29,528
I have one blessing left.

373
00:29:31,384 --> 00:29:32,416
What blessing?

374
00:29:47,765 --> 00:29:49,454
I have met Cinderella of mine.

375
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,375
Cinderella fed me,

376
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,160
and gave me a tent to sleep in.

377
00:30:00,309 --> 00:30:01,831
When Cinderella's parents went to work,

378
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:06,972
she let me in to shower and have a full meal.

379
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:14,563
Your story is like Green Fairy Story.

380
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:25,887
Don't you remember?

381
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:28,420
Remember what?

382
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,026
What's wrong?

383
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:07,564
Dung.

384
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:12,986
You're drunk?

385
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,072
Dung.

386
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,460
Hey.

387
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,119
You haven't answered me.

388
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:22,506
Dung.

389
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:26,948
Did we meet each other as children?

390
00:31:28,397 --> 00:31:29,242
Dung.

391
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:36,415
Get up.

392
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,841
What a weak gangster.

393
00:31:49,418 --> 00:31:50,721
Slow down.

394
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:58,969
You're such a dead weight.

395
00:32:02,681 --> 00:32:03,807
Slow down.

396
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,008
We're there.

397
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,957
Oh God.

398
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,787
But what did he mean?

399
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:41,564
Did we meet each other as children?

400
00:32:49,728 --> 00:32:52,001
How am I supposed to remember childhood memories?

401
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,768
How long have you been looking at me?

402
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,854
Did we meet each other as children?

403
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,528
How can you have this photo?

404
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:43,897
The boy is me.

405
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:52,697
I already knew you were Cinderella.

406
00:33:54,418 --> 00:33:57,608
It came as a big shock to me
Cinderella turned into a prince.

407
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,442
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:12,363
I didn't mean to lie to you.

409
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:15,147
Hey.

410
00:34:19,662 --> 00:34:21,153
As a child, I was difficult to bring up.

411
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:26,877
I had almost all the usual illnesses.
My parents went to the fortune-teller.

412
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:31,319
He predicted my fate would go against my parents'.

413
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:36,210
That's why I had to wear dresses and have long hair until I was 6.

414
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:42,090
Thanks to that, my parents reaped a huge windfall.

415
00:34:45,761 --> 00:34:48,774
But in the end, they all passed away.

416
00:34:54,707 --> 00:34:58,075
It was too embarrassing to let other people know.

417
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,036
But you totally forgot me.

418
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,695
It hurts so bad.

419
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:06,542
Hey.

420
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,665
I had an accident when I was in high school,

421
00:35:15,103 --> 00:35:17,470
so I had some memories lost.

422
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:32,766
I'm sorry.

423
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,261
You forgot me,

424
00:35:38,876 --> 00:35:40,795
and forgot our own promises.

425
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,131
You said you would care for me as an adult,

426
00:35:43,777 --> 00:35:45,216
and marry me.

427
00:35:46,717 --> 00:35:48,021
You and I are men.

428
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:50,138
How are we supposed to get married?

429
00:35:53,141 --> 00:35:56,759
Instead, you should find a better one.

430
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,263
Way to go.

431
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,320
You promised me the Earth, and left without a word.

432
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,189
I've looking all over for you all those years.

433
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,618
I've been crushing on you all those years, too.

434
00:36:13,692 --> 00:36:15,121
How can you tell me to drop it?

435
00:36:16,602 --> 00:36:18,510
If we fail to get married, at least care for me.

436
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:21,794
You heartless sh*t.

437
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,658
So...

438
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,662
are you crushing on Cinderella

439
00:36:36,225 --> 00:36:37,007
or me?

440
00:37:06,818 --> 00:37:08,841
My little bird, what's on your mind?

441
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,168
Get off me.

442
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,035
What if someone saw us?

443
00:37:27,381 --> 00:37:28,267
For you.

444
00:37:31,218 --> 00:37:32,667
You have something on your mind?

445
00:37:33,637 --> 00:37:34,753
Can you tell me?

446
00:37:37,776 --> 00:37:38,621
No.

447
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,984
Actually, yes.

448
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,118
It's ages since you last had a lot on your mind.

449
00:37:58,391 --> 00:38:01,289
If only what you have on your mind were something about me.

450
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,482
For example, you would wanna come back to me.

451
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,110
Impossible.

452
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,896
I'm just kidding.

453
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:16,179
What's the matter with you?

454
00:38:16,784 --> 00:38:17,868
Anything to do with work?

455
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:24,271
Not really.

456
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:30,099
I'm just thinking about something.

457
00:38:33,457 --> 00:38:35,501
Have you ever seen anyone,

458
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,235
for the sake of a childhood promise,

459
00:38:42,748 --> 00:38:43,665
that

460
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,381
has taken it as the guideline in action for years?

461
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:55,688
But

462
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,473
the one who made the promise can't keep it.

463
00:39:03,164 --> 00:39:04,571
In this life,

464
00:39:05,781 --> 00:39:07,658
is there anyone so naive like that?

465
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:13,382
Gosh.

466
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:18,804
Alright.

467
00:39:18,992 --> 00:39:20,160
It's Dung, right?

468
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:25,582
You both used to know each other?

469
00:39:27,636 --> 00:39:29,065
What promise did you make him?

470
00:39:31,213 --> 00:39:32,891
Don't act if you were smart.

471
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,738
Didn't you say you were into someone smart?

472
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,823
A word is enough for the smart.

473
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,661
Hello.

474
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,102
Uhm.

475
00:40:00,711 --> 00:40:02,421
It's time to go check on patients.

476
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:03,933
I've gotta work.

477
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,471
You should cut down on sugary drinks.

478
00:40:10,471 --> 00:40:11,930
It won't do you any good.

479
00:40:27,988 --> 00:40:29,855
Even if your ex gave you the drink,

480
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:32,128
you didn't take a sip.

481
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,924
This is the sign you're having a new one.

482
00:40:40,302 --> 00:40:41,502
It's Dung, isn't it?

483
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:49,437
There's no chance we can get back together.

484
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:12,126
What? Get off.

485
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,004
Get off. What're you doing?

486
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:15,974
Get off me.

487
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:17,517
Are you insane?

488
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:20,082
How dare you get the gangsters to hit my Khoa?

489
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:21,083
I...

490
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,793
It's lucky he's still fine.

491
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:23,502
Or else...

492
00:41:23,502 --> 00:41:26,109
Hey. Who is to blame for this mess?

493
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,580
It's your doctor who dragged my Dung into...

494
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,372
Into what?

495
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:33,574
I thought you were a real bad-ass.

496
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:36,296
You turn out to be a useless p*ssy.

497
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:37,797
You don't know sh*t about me.

498
00:41:38,861 --> 00:41:41,436
If you don't have the guts, don't love other people.

499
00:41:41,885 --> 00:41:43,459
You only hurt their feelings.

500
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,172
What? You're gonna hit me?

501
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,821
Go ahead.

502
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:52,896
Let me tell you.

503
00:41:53,282 --> 00:41:55,346
I'm not as gentle as those men hooking up with you.

504
00:41:58,297 --> 00:41:59,726
You're no better than me.

505
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:02,530
We're just junkies clinging to so-called love.

506
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:06,576
Let's see.

507
00:42:07,285 --> 00:42:10,246
I won't go easy on your ex.

508
00:42:12,259 --> 00:42:13,427
