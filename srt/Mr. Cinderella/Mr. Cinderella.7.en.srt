(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:23,938
(Episode 7)

17
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,504
Ringing the bell? What a poser.

18
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,749
Annoying as fudge.

19
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:25,030
Who are you?

20
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:27,804
I'm Danh, Khoa's sister.

21
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:29,034
Can I come in?

22
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:31,443
Yes.

23
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,161
Hey.

24
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:55,967
Are you mad at me

25
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,970
about lunchtime stuff?

26
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:03,558
He and I aren't...

27
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,154
I'm not that childish to be mad.

28
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,406
So you're jealous?

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,033
For what?

30
00:03:12,088 --> 00:03:14,173
It's no big deal. If you're jealous, just say it.

31
00:03:14,455 --> 00:03:15,487
No biggie. I won't tease you.

32
00:03:16,217 --> 00:03:17,520
You've just teased me.

33
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,106
Are you happy now?

34
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:23,797
I'm not mad at all.

35
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:25,685
It's just that.

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,427
I find his childish nature so funny.

37
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:31,263
He's gonna ruin whatever he can't have.

38
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,241
That's why he and I had to stop.

39
00:03:41,774 --> 00:03:43,046
We're not perfectly matched.

40
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,008
Stop doing that childish thing.

41
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:48,603
Men won't like that about you.

42
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:52,524
What're you saying?

43
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:54,286
I don't understand.

44
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:57,894
You're a smart boy.

45
00:03:58,394 --> 00:04:00,042
You will get what I'm saying.

46
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,722
You have never dated anyone.
How can you say that to me?

47
00:04:04,015 --> 00:04:05,485
Are you lecturing me?

48
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:07,028
I'm not lecturing you at all.

49
00:04:07,393 --> 00:04:08,728
But what you're doing

50
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,761
makes an outsider like me so pissed off,

51
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,388
let alone Khoa.

52
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:13,868
You...

53
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:16,277
He was too possessive,

54
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,186
and wanted to control me 24/7.

55
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:22,596
I didn't have time to work,

56
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,681
let alone time to rest.

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,645
There were times I thought this house was no different from the hell.

58
00:04:31,386 --> 00:04:32,731
I didn't want to go home, either.

59
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,713
Why didn't you tell him at those times?

60
00:04:36,286 --> 00:04:39,164
I think he would change for you.

61
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:44,732
Only a money understands a monkey.

62
00:04:49,477 --> 00:04:50,509
If I don't earn him back,

63
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,594
someone will take him away from me.

64
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,461
No way I'm gonna wait like you.

65
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,234
You and Khoa have known each other for all those years.

66
00:04:57,234 --> 00:04:59,153
You still don't know why you both broke up?

67
00:04:59,872 --> 00:05:00,936
I don't understand anything.

68
00:05:02,062 --> 00:05:04,950
All I know is what is mine will be mine after all.

69
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:06,984
It's too obvious if I earn him back.

70
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,875
Ah, is that the way you are?

71
00:05:14,825 --> 00:05:16,201
That's not my nature at all.

72
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:18,287
I just like freeloading on you.

73
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,550
My exam room can feed both of us.

74
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:26,336
What are we together?
How dare you insist on feeding me?

75
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,339
What?

76
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,040
We are family members.

77
00:05:32,155 --> 00:05:32,864
Since when?

78
00:05:33,906 --> 00:05:35,241
How can I have no idea?

79
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:41,550
I'm sorry for being mistaken.

80
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,297
Don't you think the cucumber is my "little boy"?

81
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:54,198
Get your head out of the clouds.

82
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:56,252
Why do you chop it so hard?

83
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,065
I like it.

84
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,014
Okay.

85
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,112
Hey.

86
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,176
I'm sorry.

87
00:06:04,552 --> 00:06:05,772
Why so serious?

88
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:09,046
If that's what you say, we're family members.

89
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,278
Oh, I'm sorry.

90
00:06:12,508 --> 00:06:15,490
This house's way too small. There's no space left for you.

91
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,160
I don't wanna stay here that bad.

92
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,871
I already stay here.

93
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,106
But

94
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,192
you're just saying?

95
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:36,156
Uh, sister?

96
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:37,616
I've been here since this morning.

97
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:40,306
Can I stay here for one night?
I can easily have a checkup tomorrow.

98
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,646
Yes.

99
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:48,742
Aren't you tired?

100
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:49,618
I'm not.

101
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:52,683
Until when I earn back what is mine,

102
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:54,351
I will stop.

103
00:06:55,186 --> 00:06:56,625
I don't take sides with anyone.

104
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:59,513
You and Khoa are my beloved ones.

105
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:01,786
I'm telling you.

106
00:07:02,474 --> 00:07:04,341
A smart person like you should know when to stop.

107
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,615
Once you lose it all, it will be too late to regret it.

108
00:07:07,615 --> 00:07:08,595
Don't give a damn about me.

109
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,293
Are you gonna eat together with me?

110
00:07:33,724 --> 00:07:35,601
Sorry. I won't bother you two.

111
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:37,301
Take a seat.

112
00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:41,179
I'm not used to eating with strangers.

113
00:07:41,325 --> 00:07:43,359
Especially a jerk like him,

114
00:07:44,276 --> 00:07:44,996
Sister.

115
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,623
Have I done something to offend you?

116
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,690
Do you think you deserve to eat with me?

117
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:52,555
You...

118
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:53,525
Sister.

119
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:55,704
You're getting out of line.

120
00:07:56,987 --> 00:07:58,426
What are you doing, Khoa?

121
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,470
You can date anyone.

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,618
But why do you date an *sshole like him?

123
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,851
What *sshole am I?

124
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:08,936
Say it.

125
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,076
You see that?

126
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,916
That's the way you are?

127
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,294
You just let her insult me, don't you?

128
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,206
How the hell am I supposed to calm down?

129
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:36,693
I'm asking you.

130
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,478
What *sshole am I? Why do you insult me over and over again?

131
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,127
What do you think you can take away from this house?

132
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,713
You bandit piece of sh*t.

133
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,664
How dare you step in this house?

134
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,906
Do you have a mirror? Look at yourself again, please.

135
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,232
F*ck with that.

136
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,556
What've you just said?

137
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,661
Dung.

138
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:58,183
Don't be mad, okay?

139
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:02,803
Who's mad?

140
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:08,204
She insulted me. How can you tell me to stand it?

141
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,125
Listen to me. Get in your room. We'll talk later, okay?

142
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,191
Way to go, Khoa.

143
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:19,841
She insulted me, but you didn't stand up for me once.

144
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,041
How can you say that I'm mad?

145
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,130
Dung.

146
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,540
Listen to me.

147
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,291
Get off me.

148
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,359
Get off.

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,180
Let me tell you.

150
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:50,027
Though I'm poor, I have my self-respect.

151
00:09:50,027 --> 00:09:52,102
I'm not a damn jack*ss for you to insult.

152
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,303
Though you're loaded,

153
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,680
I don't give a sh*t about your charity.

154
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:58,661
Sc*mbag.

155
00:09:59,046 --> 00:09:59,839
Dung.

156
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:01,351
Listen to me.

157
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:02,758
Calm down.

158
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,625
Get in your room. We'll talk later, okay?

159
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:06,095
Except that,

160
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,931
what else can you say?

161
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,189
I'm simply a tenant, aren't I?

162
00:10:21,423 --> 00:10:22,361
For all this time,

163
00:10:25,646 --> 00:10:27,773
have you ever thought I'm an *sshole like her words?

164
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:36,261
Until now

165
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,194
you can't stand up for me once, can you?

166
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,972
This is what I deserve?

167
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,219
This is the way you treat me?

168
00:11:04,654 --> 00:11:05,529
It's not that.

169
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,532
Listen to me, please.

170
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:14,163
It's your room, not mine.

171
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,157
I don't give a sh*t.

172
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:19,012
Dung.

173
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,180
Dung.

174
00:11:21,076 --> 00:11:21,963
Dung.

175
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,609
Huynh.

176
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:54,349
Have you waited long for me?

177
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:55,725
I've just come.

178
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,164
Let's go, shall we?

179
00:11:57,373 --> 00:11:58,186
Where's your bike?

180
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:00,272
I parked it in front of the building.

181
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:01,575
Let's go.

182
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,059
Are you in debt? Why do you to hide yourself?

183
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:18,686
Something like that.

184
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:21,439
You're really in debt?

185
00:12:22,773 --> 00:12:23,712
It's not that.

186
00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:25,630
They bear a grudge against Dung.

187
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,945
Last time they saw me with Dung.
They bear me a grudge, too.

188
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:29,739
Whenever they see me, they will knock me out.

189
00:12:29,739 --> 00:12:30,938
Poor me.

190
00:12:32,888 --> 00:12:34,254
How deep grudge they bear.

191
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,225
They wanna beat the sh*t out of me.

192
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,967
I don't wanna be a gangster.

193
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:40,812
I've gotta live it up to fate.

194
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:45,452
Alright.

195
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,966
What's wrong with you?

196
00:12:49,164 --> 00:12:51,145
Since when did you lower your "standard"?

197
00:12:53,137 --> 00:12:54,190
I'm begging you.

198
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,588
Let me decide what I want to do with my life.

199
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,154
Don't forget who helped you to get this life.

200
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:03,355
I don't care if your lover is a boy or a girl.

201
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,410
But at least, pick a decent person.

202
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:07,923
Not everyone is allowed to step in this house.

203
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:14,648
So who should deserve me?

204
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,901
Huynh?

205
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:22,302
At least Huynh is a well-educated person.

206
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,043
He's not like...

207
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,104
To you,

208
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,546
birds of a feather flock together?

209
00:13:38,724 --> 00:13:39,381
Uh.

210
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,657
If so, I've gotta say sorry.

211
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,113
I can't live a life like yours.

212
00:13:53,948 --> 00:13:54,938
Stop.

213
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:59,411
How dare you stand up for a strange jerk?

214
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:03,645
If back then I hadn't sacrificed myself,
could you have a better life now, Khoa?

215
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:10,151
Yes.

216
00:14:11,653 --> 00:14:14,552
My whole life, I owe you a debt of gratitude.

217
00:14:16,574 --> 00:14:17,888
But if

218
00:14:19,598 --> 00:14:21,037
you want me to answer,

219
00:14:22,591 --> 00:14:23,790
I will answer right now.

Mr. Dung.

233
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:13,608
Have you waited long?

234
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,693
What the heck takes you so long?

235
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,278
I got stuck in traffic.

236
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,135
Let's go. It's gonna be late.

237
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,060
But are you sure they will offer me the job?

238
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:28,644
Sure.

239
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,895
I've asked them carefully.

240
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:32,158
They need two more people, so I want you in.

241
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,038
Please don't take me to the heartless sh*t like last time.

242
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,759
It's okay.

243
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,887
I've have learned about two shops.
If the first shop doesn't say yes, we'll go to the other.

244
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:44,702
Let's go.

245
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:48,674
You're so kind to me.

246
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:51,114
What are you saying?

247
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,846
We're brothers. Don't stand on ceremony.

248
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,556
If there's something good, I'll always think about you.

249
00:16:56,088 --> 00:16:56,724
Let's go.

250
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:11,572
Ready?

251
00:17:12,594 --> 00:17:13,011
Okay.

252
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,471
Let's go.

253
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,465
Your lungs are in good shape,

254
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,573
But during this time, please stay on your meds.

255
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,409
I got it.

256
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,399
Yes.

257
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:38,881
Thao.

258
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:41,143
Yes?

259
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:43,740
Please help me prepare 10-day meds for Ms. Danh.

260
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,626
Ah yes.

261
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:59,672
Please try to stay on your meds at home.

262
00:18:00,256 --> 00:18:01,309
Don't be off the meds.

263
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:02,592
I got it.

264
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,969
Alright. I've gotta go. There're tons of things I need to do.

265
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:09,297
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:29,525
I'm sorry.

267
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,308
My bike suddenly broke down.

268
00:18:33,467 --> 00:18:34,582
Way to go.

269
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:35,708
And this bike

270
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:39,191
was still fine until the interview session.

271
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:42,006
It's too late. They hired someone else.

272
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,602
Sorry, I was wrong.

273
00:18:43,841 --> 00:18:45,687
I didn't want it to break down, either.

274
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,710
How about going to the second shop?

275
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,441
You'd better call them first.

276
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,027
It's late. I'm afraid they may have hired someone else.

277
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:52,632
Oh.

278
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:53,883
Let me call them.

279
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:04,393
Yes, hello.

280
00:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,667
May I ask if you are the manager of Bird Love coffee shop?

281
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,878
Yes, yes.

282
00:19:10,097 --> 00:19:12,193
I'm the one that asked for the interview session.

283
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:14,904
I wonder if you still want to hire staff.

284
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:17,896
You still want that.

285
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:21,431
By the way, I have a friend.

286
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,768
He's a bartender and used to work for a few shops.

287
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:26,822
Do you still want to hire one more bartender?

288
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,626
His skills are pretty good.

289
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,033
He's hard-working.

290
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:33,954
Yes, you still want to hire staff?

291
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,644
Yes, we're coming in a moment.

292
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,771
Yes. Thank you.

293
00:19:39,835 --> 00:19:41,399
Let's go.

294
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,692
Uh?

295
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,631
You didn't say about my problem, did you?

296
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,050
Ah, I forgot.

297
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,208
I'm in a hurry.

298
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:52,712
I thought they would accept us,
so I didn't ask more about it.

299
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,923
Are you sure they will hire us?

300
00:19:55,715 --> 00:19:57,780
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

301
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,534
If they didn't hire you, it would be their loss.

302
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:28,811
Uh? Why isn't Dung home yet?

303
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,585
He has gone to somewhere esle?

304
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:16,700
It's fine.

305
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,263
Uh.

306
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:18,817
Can you still run?

307
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,214
Yes.

308
00:23:04,195 --> 00:23:07,365
The first that you have called is not available at the moment,

309
00:23:07,657 --> 00:23:10,201
please try again later.

310
00:23:13,455 --> 00:23:15,081
Where has he been after all?

311
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,069
You haven't gone home?

312
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:45,987
Oh my gosh!

313
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,615
It's late at night, where're you going?

314
00:23:49,491 --> 00:23:50,325
-I'm on duty.

315
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:51,951
Uh?

316
00:23:52,285 --> 00:23:54,996
But I've already checked that your schedule is clear.

317
00:23:55,705 --> 00:23:58,249
You come here for me, don't you?

318
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:00,418
It's not that.

319
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:02,754
I'm reading some more papers.

320
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,219
Papers, papers. Why aren't you reading me?

321
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,513
Should I change my name into "Papers"?

322
00:24:13,723 --> 00:24:17,373
Hey, by the way, whatever you do, don't work too hard.

323
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,436
I'm worried about you.

324
00:24:19,437 --> 00:24:20,313
I got it.

325
00:24:20,647 --> 00:24:21,648
You'd better go home now.

326
00:24:21,731 --> 00:24:23,358
Tomorrow you've still gotta work.

327
00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:24,484
Alright I've gotta go.

328
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:26,444
Bye.

329
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:29,322
Be careful.

330
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:30,907
Yes.

331
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,741
Why are you home late?

332
00:25:17,704 --> 00:25:18,705
Why are you home late?

333
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,604
I have prepared the meal.
Go change your clothes and have the meal.

334
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:27,839
Dung isn't home yet?

335
00:25:29,976 --> 00:25:30,925
Not yet.

336
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:36,973
If you're hungry, just eat first.

337
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,059
But.

338
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:44,230
This afternoon,
I heard that your house had been repaired, right?

339
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:45,148
It's not done yet.

340
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:47,317
Just the exterior part is done.

341
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:49,736
I've gotta have water pipes installed.

342
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,494
But you need to check if your plumbers are doing well or not.

343
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:00,288
Don't totally rely on them.

344
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:02,373
I got it.

345
00:26:25,897 --> 00:26:29,859
You're doing good. Next week you...

346
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:50,463
Hello.

347
00:26:57,261 --> 00:26:59,389
Yes. I got it.

348
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,341
3 days passed.

349
00:28:18,092 --> 00:28:19,719
He will never come back.

350
00:28:29,937 --> 00:28:31,981
How can you know what I'm waiting for?

351
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:33,733
I...

352
00:28:38,321 --> 00:28:39,697
You know something, don't you?

353
00:28:46,162 --> 00:28:47,205
It's an easy guess.

354
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:49,707
He's already a gangster.

355
00:28:50,124 --> 00:28:52,335
He'll be up to his old tricks soon.

356
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:57,090
Don't ever think about other people like that.

357
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:00,510
Have I said something wrong?

358
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,763
He ditched you, so you should feel lucky instead.

359
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:05,807
If he kills someone someday,

360
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:07,934
you'll get involved for covering him.

361
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:10,144
Get out.

362
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:15,233
You're always covering for him.

363
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:18,111
He's no better than me.

364
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,781
An *sshole like should go to Hell instead.

365
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:28,204
What're you saying?

366
00:29:33,709 --> 00:29:35,795
You know something about Dung, don't you?

367
00:29:36,994 --> 00:29:38,131
Tell me.

368
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:40,716
Tell me.

369
00:29:41,342 --> 00:29:43,824
I have no idea. Don't shift the blame onto me.

370
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:51,394
You have no idea

371
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:54,856
as always.

372
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:57,733
You know what?

373
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:00,820
My friends.

374
00:30:03,573 --> 00:30:05,158
They all ditched me.

375
00:30:07,618 --> 00:30:09,245
Even the research team

376
00:30:09,787 --> 00:30:11,330
of community health project

377
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:13,749
all shunned me.

378
00:30:22,998 --> 00:30:23,843
I...

379
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:27,180
It's all because of your selfishness and possessiveness.

380
00:30:28,472 --> 00:30:29,223
You...

381
00:30:34,729 --> 00:30:36,355
You kept track of everything I did.

382
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:38,191
When I was at work,

383
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:39,734
you constantly called me.

384
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:41,861
You called even when I was having a meeting.

385
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:44,197
Even when I visited my friend's funeral,

386
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:45,948
you called.

387
00:30:49,744 --> 00:30:51,370
You called me. It was fine.

388
00:30:51,996 --> 00:30:53,706
But you called my friend's family,

389
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,544
talked crap, and hung up suddenly

390
00:30:58,544 --> 00:31:00,213
without a word of encouragement.

391
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:04,717
I...

392
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,054
Who checked my text?

393
00:31:11,057 --> 00:31:13,935
Who checked my Facebook account?

394
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:17,980
Even my laptop,

395
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:21,202
you infected it with the virus.

396
00:31:23,236 --> 00:31:24,195
I had known it all.

397
00:31:26,416 --> 00:31:27,907
I didn't want to argue with you.

398
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:32,453
But to Dung,

399
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:36,019
if something bad happens to Dung,

400
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:38,709
I will never let you off that easy.

401
00:31:40,836 --> 00:31:42,046
Keep in mind that

402
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,841
it's you that gave up on me.

403
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:49,804
And now

404
00:31:53,307 --> 00:31:54,225
get out.

405
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,898
I said: Get out.

406
00:32:29,593 --> 00:32:30,469
Ms. Danh.

407
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:36,892
Thank you for helping me.

408
00:32:36,892 --> 00:32:38,477
I have done nothing for you.

409
00:32:38,477 --> 00:32:41,188
But thanks to you, I realized some problems.

410
00:32:41,188 --> 00:32:41,814
Danh.

411
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,654
You left your coat.

412
00:32:49,613 --> 00:32:50,531
Thank you. I've gotta go.

413
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,207
What's wrong with you?

414
00:33:00,624 --> 00:33:02,001
You sweat a lot.

415
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:04,253
I'm fine.

416
00:33:06,422 --> 00:33:09,508
Your leg hasn't healed yet. Don't go out and about.

417
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,178
