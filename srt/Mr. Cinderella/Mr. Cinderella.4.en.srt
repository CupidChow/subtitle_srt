(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:23,980
(Episode 4)

17
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,000
Where're you going?

18
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,877
What?

19
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:21,026
A swift kiss only?

20
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:25,249
Ouch. My stomach is rumbling.

21
00:02:26,949 --> 00:02:28,315
I've gotta go number 2.

22
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:31,797
My stomach's rumbling.

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:33,831
I'm gonna sh*t my pants.

24
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:52,787
Will you let me eat?

25
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:54,445
I can't eat with you staring at me.

26
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,698
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,848
Why did you cook a hearty meal today?

28
00:03:01,984 --> 00:03:03,360
You have money to burn, don't you?

29
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,468
Because I have no clue what dish you're specially into.

30
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:08,303
That's why I cooked some more dishes.

31
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,388
I can eat these dishes later by the way.

32
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:18,480
Hey.

33
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,942
What did you eat a while ago?
Your lips smelled so sweet.

34
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:26,811
Sorry, sorry.

35
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:31,232
Is it hard to answer me?

36
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:35,997
What?

37
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:39,146
It's just an occupational habit.

38
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:40,971
An occupational habit?

39
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,382
So your occupation is to steal a kiss from someone?

40
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:47,946
You...

41
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:53,775
What's wrong?

42
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,215
Why is your heart pounding so fast?

43
00:03:57,508 --> 00:03:59,322
Your cheeks are flushing red as well.

44
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,838
Do you need my examination?

45
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,216
Are you nuts?

46
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,404
No need.

47
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,547
Don't make my train of thought come true.

48
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,667
Hey. Do you believe I'm gonna give you a knockout?

49
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,704
Your gangster style is really growing on me.

50
00:04:29,332 --> 00:04:31,073
The food is about to turn cold.

51
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,783
Let me eat.

52
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:06,827
Hello, I'm listening.

53
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:09,705
Yes.

54
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,123
Just drop by.

55
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,088
Yes.

56
00:05:58,264 --> 00:05:59,557
Another year just flew by.

57
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,040
Mom and Dad, are you really happy there?

58
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,015
Uh?

59
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,008
What're you looking for?

60
00:07:14,236 --> 00:07:15,331
I'm looking for nothing.

61
00:07:16,707 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm afraid of waking you up.

62
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:22,859
I can't get to sleep at a not-too-early hour.

63
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,629
What are these?

64
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,904
These items?

65
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,523
Just old books and clothes.

66
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:42,608
Getting rid of them?

67
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,235
No.

68
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,861
Giving them away to charity.

69
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,980
Though old, they're not torn at all.

70
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,295
On top of that, I already washed them.

71
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,380
Someone may need them.

72
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,321
But

73
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,208
where are you bringing these items?

74
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,878
I'll put them in my car first.

75
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,933
Later I can give them away to charity.

76
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,439
The names on this box ain't yours.

77
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:22,523
They're my parents' names.

78
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,892
But they passed away ages ago.

79
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,614
Every year,

80
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:32,700
on their death anniversary,

81
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:36,412
I will give away some stuff under their names.

82
00:08:39,008 --> 00:08:42,209
So, today is their death anniversary?

83
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:48,674
But, why is your surname Nguyen?

84
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:55,994
I'm an orphan.

85
00:09:00,363 --> 00:09:02,010
At the age of 12,

86
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,513
they adopted me.

87
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,944
But when I was a sophomore,

88
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:12,969
they passed away because of a traffic accident.

89
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:23,073
All right, I've gotta burn incense on the altar.

90
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,163
At least he knows who his parents are,

91
00:09:51,873 --> 00:09:53,572
and has an altar to make offerings.

92
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,595
He know his parents' names to call.

93
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,452
But I...

94
00:09:58,994 --> 00:10:01,288
have no idea who my parents are.

95
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,042
Please take a seat.

96
00:10:21,131 --> 00:10:23,477
Try to suffer the pain, once and for all.

97
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,036
Excuse me.

98
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:44,832
Why don't you get some sleep on the bed?

99
00:10:48,502 --> 00:10:49,732
You should take some more rest.

100
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:53,987
I wanna get up to clear my head.

101
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,342
It's way too cramped.

102
00:10:57,542 --> 00:10:59,440
How are you? Still feel lightheaded?

103
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,026
I've been a lot better.

104
00:11:06,384 --> 00:11:07,396
Thank you.

105
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,482
Thanks to you, I still have a life to live.

106
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,423
I don't know how to express my gratitude.

107
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:16,123
Running into each other is a luck.

108
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,042
No need to be grateful to me.

109
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:20,378
I can't turn a blind eye to a matter of life and death.

110
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:26,801
I still have a life to live thanks to you.

111
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:29,355
Please let me follow you, will you?

112
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,254
Take me as your subordinate.

113
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,903
Subordinate, my *ss.

114
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,353
Where do you live?
Why do you insist on following me?

115
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,148
I don't have a home,

116
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,015
or family members.

117
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:48,875
Can I?

118
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:50,960
Please let me follow you.

119
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,257
I'm no different.

120
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:57,832
Penniless and homeless.

121
00:11:58,416 --> 00:11:59,688
You'll be starved to death if you follow me.

122
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:01,356
On top of that,

123
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,891
I'm not a gangster. I don't need any superior or subordinate.

124
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,792
So let's become brothers with each other.

125
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,877
Whatever ups and downs, we'll face together.

126
00:12:11,877 --> 00:12:13,326
I can go to work.

127
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,068
I'm not freeloading on you.

128
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,142
Don't worry about it.

129
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,292
Oh.

130
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,981
It's up to you.

131
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,474
You made me a promise.

132
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:32,512
At least I still have Thinh,

133
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,077
as my family member.

134
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:01,385
Can I burn incense for your parents?

135
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:04,294
Yes.

136
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,870
I believe you won't live alone any longer like this.

137
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,664
So who will I live with?

138
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:53,343
With me? Is that okay?

139
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,533
You will know by then.

140
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:11,966
Dung.

141
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:16,011
Mrs. Hai will come to clean the house in a moment.
Please open the door for her.

142
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:19,390
Why do you have to hire a helper?

143
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,641
Let me clean it for you.

144
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,894
What're you looking at?

145
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,896
Just do what you're told.

146
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,419
I just help you save money.

147
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,098
Don't look down on me just because of my arm.

148
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:31,172
All right.

149
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:33,101
Just do whatever you want.

150
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,749
As long as you're happy.

151
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,502
Why are you late for work today?

152
00:14:38,565 --> 00:14:39,806
Today I'm not going to work.

153
00:14:40,244 --> 00:14:41,537
I'm going to the conference.

154
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:45,280
Your button is undone. Let do it up.

155
00:14:58,783 --> 00:14:59,899
What?

156
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,224
Is your heart pounding just because I'm way too handsome?

157
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,343
No.

158
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,441
I mean I want to remind you that

159
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,455
you're having eye boogers.

160
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:16,541
Ah.

161
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,568
I'm just kidding.

162
00:15:24,142 --> 00:15:26,238
All right. I'm late. I've gotta get going.

163
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:28,073
Ah.

164
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:31,900
The first step to conquer Cinderella.

165
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,122
Uh? Cinderella or Prince.

166
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:35,925
Just screw it.

167
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,802
I've gotta get my hands dirty to clean the house.

168
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,294
After that...

169
00:15:47,676 --> 00:15:49,782
Hey. Do you see where this is?

170
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:54,672
This is the examination room.
It's not the disco for you to perform cha cha cha dance.

171
00:15:55,382 --> 00:15:56,257
I know I'm gorgeous.

172
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,343
Don't express your feelings for me.

173
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,879
Hey. Where're you going?

174
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:05,381
I'll go buy you a mirror.

175
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,875
How rude you are.

176
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,098
I'm sorry, okay?

177
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,423
Okay. I accept your apology.

178
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,926
I have something to ask you.

179
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,688
Go ahead.

180
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,463
Do you know what Khoa's into and not.

181
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:28,081
You know how to pick the right person.

182
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,822
You go to the right person.

183
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,002
Khoa's into everything.

184
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,681
But he's not into me.

185
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,749
I'm kidding.

186
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,178
Mr. Khoa, my Khoa.

187
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:44,576
Ah, not mine.

188
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:46,954
But Khoa's a fan of floral shirts.

189
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,226
A action-movie buff.

190
00:16:48,226 --> 00:16:50,718
A sucker for earning money,
giving examination and reaping a fortune.

191
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,043
That's it. Way too simple.

192
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:55,754
Something less materialistic?

193
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,538
I got it, got it, got it.

194
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:00,738
He's into eating.

195
00:17:00,738 --> 00:17:02,115
I know Khoa too well.

196
00:17:02,115 --> 00:17:03,846
How can you know him better than me?

197
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:05,639
Do you know why I know him too well?

198
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:09,768
From morning to night, he's been ordering food.

199
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:12,490
The shippers know his face too well.

200
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,191
Is that so? Thank you.

201
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:18,037
Thank you?

202
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,315
Hello, Thinh.

203
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,547
Today, our examination room has a patient named Dung.

204
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:43,813
All right, let me send you his number and personal information.

205
00:17:44,136 --> 00:17:46,274
Check again whether he's the right person you're looking for.

206
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:42,694
Hello.

207
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,488
Hello, it's me, brother.

208
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,250
Thinh?

209
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,231
Yes, it's me.

210
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:49,764
How can you know my number?

211
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:52,068
This little trick is such a piece of cake.

212
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,623
Let's meet. I miss you so bad.

213
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,273
Okay. Send me your address. I'll stop by.

214
00:18:58,273 --> 00:19:00,191
Okay, I'll send you in no time.

215
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:00,712
Give me a sec.

216
00:19:00,712 --> 00:19:02,339
Oh. Long time no see.

217
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,861
Yes. I'll send you right away.

218
00:19:03,861 --> 00:19:04,435
Okay.

219
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,020
Why are you home late?

220
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:38,823
I've been waiting for you the whole time.

221
00:19:39,689 --> 00:19:42,045
The meal I've prepared is about to turn cold.

222
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,555
How can you step in my house?

223
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:54,318
You haven't changed the lock.

224
00:19:55,423 --> 00:19:57,415
And I still keep the key.

225
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,940
What're you standing there for?

226
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:03,588
Please take a seat and eat it.

227
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:26,851
Try this dish to see if it suits your taste.

228
00:20:31,876 --> 00:20:32,700
Huynh.

229
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,161
Don't do this anymore, please.

230
00:20:37,997 --> 00:20:40,270
You and I broke up a long time ago.

231
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,064
Stop caring about me.

232
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,910
You should find a new one instead.

233
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:47,465
I don't deserve for your care.

234
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,355
My happiness is none other than you.

235
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,779
Can we get back together?

236
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,325
Don't spend your time caring about me.

237
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:07,443
Spend your time finding a better one for you.

238
00:21:11,124 --> 00:21:11,979
Listen to me.

239
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:13,408
I...

240
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,032
Oh, Dung.

241
00:21:23,928 --> 00:21:25,107
Why are you home late?

242
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,744
Take a seat and eat some.

243
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:30,883
I'll go get you a bowl.

244
00:21:45,148 --> 00:21:46,399
Here you are.

245
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,661
Thank you.

246
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:53,625
Does it suit your taste?

247
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,171
Uhm, it does.

248
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,591
Try to eat some more.

249
00:22:06,753 --> 00:22:08,004
Eat this one.

250
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,382
Khoa can't eat pineapple.

251
00:22:12,727 --> 00:22:15,532
If you have no clue, don't pick up crappy food for others.

252
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,923
You say as if you knew Khoa too well.

253
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,488
Abso-bloody-exactly.

254
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,419
I know Khoa too well from head to toe.

255
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,407
I'm so worn out working at the examination room.

256
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,077
All I want is to have a decent meal at home.

257
00:22:41,996 --> 00:22:43,174
It's impossible, isn't it?

258
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:00,358
You're into Khoa, aren't you?

259
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:09,252
Let me give a lesson.

260
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:12,109
Birds of a feather flock together.

261
00:23:13,215 --> 00:23:15,217
He's way out of your league.

262
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:18,293
After eating, just go home, kid.

263
00:23:18,991 --> 00:23:20,722
I'm sick of hearing your lesson.

264
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,601
A street rat is still a street rat.

265
00:23:34,382 --> 00:23:37,708
Hey, don't see I'm kind and you can say whatever you want.

266
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,669
Then what?

267
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,386
I don't give a damn about what you say.

268
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,733
But I know for sure every Jack has his Jill.

269
00:23:53,203 --> 00:23:54,402
And this Jill

270
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:56,060
is absolutely mine.

271
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,019
You...

272
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,365
You're damn smart. You've gotta know when to stop.

273
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,138
Running the lights

274
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:02,827
will have your car confiscated.

275
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,507
You're having butterflies in your stomach.

276
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:38,696
You're in love?

277
00:24:38,925 --> 00:24:40,083
In love what?

278
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:41,741
What're you saying?

279
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,201
What? Admit it. Boy or girl?

280
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:45,547
Let on to me.

281
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,103
As we're brothers, I'll tell you only.

282
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,262
Boy.

283
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:53,513
Dang it.

284
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:56,266
Why are you flushing?

285
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,883
Don't say that you're...

286
00:24:58,883 --> 00:24:59,853
I'm what?

287
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,698
Does the gender matter here?

288
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:04,889
It matters who I love.

289
00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:06,620
Don't say that you're gonna discriminate against me.

290
00:25:07,412 --> 00:25:08,987
People will spread the rumor
that you're gay. Ain't scared?

291
00:25:09,654 --> 00:25:10,676
Scared what?

292
00:25:10,916 --> 00:25:12,417
They didn't feed me a day.

293
00:25:12,793 --> 00:25:13,981
As long as I'm happy.

294
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:16,943
Ah.

295
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:21,760
What a weird life.

296
00:25:23,251 --> 00:25:24,033
Weird?

297
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:25,847
How weird?

298
00:25:26,212 --> 00:25:27,578
It's super normal to me.

299
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:30,654
Haven't you heard of the sentence that

300
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,615
only men can bring happiness to each other.

301
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,833
Hey.

302
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:47,755
Here.

303
00:25:53,823 --> 00:25:56,691
Why the long face as if you were just mugged?

304
00:25:58,109 --> 00:25:59,016
Nothing.

305
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,045
Let me ask you a question.

306
00:26:08,504 --> 00:26:09,224
Uhm.

307
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:11,601
Feel free.

308
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:13,916
What?

309
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:19,599
The matter with Huynh?

310
00:26:21,716 --> 00:26:22,571
Uh.

311
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,885
Huynh and I

312
00:26:25,323 --> 00:26:27,409
have been colleagues for more than 4 years.

313
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:31,235
Just colleagues?

314
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,769
Uhm. Just that.

315
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:40,213
Why do I see that you both used to be in a relationship?

316
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:45,687
Uhm.

317
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:48,544
But we broke up.

318
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:54,738
I have yet to conquer him,
but I have already faced the enemy.

319
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,961
This game's way too hard.

320
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,350
What're you saying?

321
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,163
Hah?

322
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:05,780
What're you mumbling to yourself?

323
00:27:23,423 --> 00:27:26,989
It is said that girls are hard to understand.

324
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:31,337
But I see

325
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,725
boys as a gangster

326
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,967
are way harder to understand.

327
00:27:52,775 --> 00:27:55,194
Is there anyone who wants to eat with me and Huynh?

328
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:57,499
No, you two, feel free.

329
00:27:58,187 --> 00:27:59,094
I'm not hungry yet.

330
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:04,631
I thought you would be hungry at the sight of me.

331
00:28:09,511 --> 00:28:10,272
Hey.

332
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:13,285
Don't talk to me that way.
It may cause misunderstanding.

333
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,372
Misunderstanding what?

334
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:18,165
I'm just kidding a bit.

335
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,375
So you wanna join us?

336
00:28:21,627 --> 00:28:23,202
I'll go grab a bite after completing the documents.

337
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,317
You two, go first.

338
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:25,360
Are you sure?

339
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:26,371
Sure.

340
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,758
You'll have to eat alone later.

341
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:28,092
Uhm.

342
00:28:28,092 --> 00:28:29,353
Way too sad.

343
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:29,750
Uhm.

344
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,855
All right. I've gotta go.

345
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:32,044
Bye.

346
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:33,608
Bye.

347
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:47,111
I said I wasn't hungry yet. You'd better go first.

348
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:50,583
Uh, not hungry?

349
00:28:57,965 --> 00:28:59,655
Uh? Why do you stop by?

350
00:28:59,936 --> 00:29:01,406
Your follow-up exam date isn't today.

351
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,669
It means I can't stop by, doesn't it?

352
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:07,027
No.

353
00:29:09,195 --> 00:29:10,144
Go find somewhere to grab a bite.

354
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,877
Suddenly I feel hungry.

355
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,953
Uh, a while ago why did you say you weren't hungry?

356
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:19,852
I like it.

357
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:32,427
Hey.

358
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,940
Your arm isn't in full recovery.

359
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,410
Don't move it too hard.

360
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,644
If I stop moving it, someone will skip his meal.

361
00:29:44,397 --> 00:29:45,888
Why do you care about me?

362
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:48,005
You're crushing on me?

363
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:49,423
Oh ho.

364
00:29:53,302 --> 00:29:54,564
With one arm only

365
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,326
your culinary skills are topnotch,

366
00:29:56,701 --> 00:29:57,786
like restaurant chefs.

367
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:00,027
As long as my right arm's still good, I'll do well for myself.

368
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:02,082
It's just that.

369
00:30:02,728 --> 00:30:05,658
I don't have enough money.
Or else I'd have been a restaurant owner ages ago.

370
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,713
Serious?

371
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:28,556
Hey.

372
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:31,830
Is my head a vase for you to arrange followers?

373
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,522
You're way too stubborn.

374
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:39,556
Dang it. You touched my injured arm.

375
00:30:39,556 --> 00:30:40,818
My bone's dislocated.

376
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,737
I touched right here,

377
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,468
not your arm.

378
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,146
Do you have your nerves dislocated?

379
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,284
But it hurts, really.

380
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,369
You get hurt for real.

381
00:30:51,746 --> 00:30:52,392
Is that true?

382
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:56,865
Be gentle, please.

383
00:30:56,865 --> 00:30:57,929
What a violent doctor.

384
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:00,577
Ain't you such a violent gangster?

385
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:01,453
Hah?

386
00:31:01,453 --> 00:31:03,268
All right, all right, just eat it.

387
00:31:03,268 --> 00:31:03,872
All right.

388
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,294
You wanna play?

389
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:30,503
Damn it.

390
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,935
Who in the hell spilled milk tea on the floor?

391
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:37,677
What if an elder person went by and tripped over?

392
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:47,051
Please get me up.

393
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:48,667
My back gets hurt.

394
00:31:50,054 --> 00:31:51,962
When on Earth will you leave Khoa's house?

395
00:31:59,094 --> 00:32:00,419
I'll leave only when he kicks me out.

396
00:32:01,534 --> 00:32:02,525
What a thick face.

397
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,932
This is just a warning.

398
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:25,058
Are you insane?

399
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:26,445
I'm insane.

400
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,269
This one never wanna be outdone.

401
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:30,198
Don't you dare steal my lover?

402
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,929
Who's your lover?

403
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:32,972
Dung.

404
00:32:34,901 --> 00:32:35,662
What?

405
00:32:36,444 --> 00:32:38,436
Don't say you have no clue who is Dung.

406
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:40,021
Let me tell you.

407
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:42,179
If you're gay, be gay to yourself.

408
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:43,680
Don't drag my Dung into your shit.

409
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,788
Who's your Dung?

410
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,394
Hah?

411
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:50,041
You're insane.

412
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:53,784
Hey. You're not leaving.

413
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,828
Everyone, please.

414
00:32:55,828 --> 00:32:59,144
He stole my husband. What a perverted faggot.

415
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,229
He stole my family.

416
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,637
Get off me. Enough.

417
00:33:03,784 --> 00:33:05,661
If you love him sincerely,

418
00:33:06,474 --> 00:33:08,288
figure out a way to make him love you back.

419
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:12,240
No need to keep him. Nobody's gonna steal him from you.

420
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,442
Given that you're a girl,

421
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,508
I don't wanna pick a quarrel with you.

422
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:20,895
Just go.

423
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:22,521
Hey. Stop.

424
00:33:23,147 --> 00:33:25,962
Are you sure you and Dung are really in love?

425
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,351
If yes,

426
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,906
do you have what it takes to earn him back?

427
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,212
Hey.

428
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:39,309
Whether gay or straight,

429
00:33:40,154 --> 00:33:41,874
when they love someone, they'll love

430
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:44,314
from the bottom of their heart.

431
00:33:46,545 --> 00:33:48,839
They won't pick a random quarrel like you.

432
00:33:49,872 --> 00:33:50,789
Go.

433
00:33:51,717 --> 00:33:53,041
Or else I'll call the security guards.
