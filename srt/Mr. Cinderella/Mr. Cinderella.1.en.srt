(Mr. Cinderella)

16
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:24,094
(Episode 1)

17
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,669
Thien, go get the drinks to the customers.

18
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:56,389
Hey, where the hell have you been?

19
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,520
Brother, please take it easy.

20
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:05,607
You're always in a hurry,
which is why you're single AF.

21
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,816
Who tells you I'm single AF?

22
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:08,776
I just tell the truth.

23
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:15,450
Here are your drinks.

24
00:05:24,834 --> 00:05:25,960
Yes, hello.

25
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:26,596
You.

26
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:27,795
Let's beat the shit out of him.

27
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:28,379
Ouch! Ow!

28
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,131
Ugh! Ah!

29
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,343
Hey.

30
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:43,144
Hello, young boy!

31
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:44,896
Long time no see.

32
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,731
Are you dying right in the pandemic?

33
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,400
Assholes like you are still alive and well.

34
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:50,860
How can he die right away?

35
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,194
Hey.

36
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:55,073
Good.

37
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:57,200
Out of respect for...
Who are you gonna respect?

38
00:06:00,453 --> 00:06:03,498
Take it easy and let's have a talk.
Don't you dare pick a fight here?

39
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,876
I don't wanna take it easy.

40
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:09,545
If you wanna do it quick, splurge your money.

41
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,381
Three of you ruined my shop.

42
00:06:11,673 --> 00:06:12,966
How dare you ask me for money?

43
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:15,551
Okay. If you ask for trouble yourself,
I'll treat you well.

44
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:27,605
I'm telling you.

45
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,774
Wherever shop you ruin, go ahead.

46
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,944
But if you pick mine, you're f*cking dead to me.

47
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:38,574
Don't think we're so gentle,

48
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:40,660
and then you do whatever you want.

49
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,627
Way to go! I won't let you get away with this.

50
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:50,670
You'd better watch out.

51
00:07:00,013 --> 00:07:03,224
Why is our shop totally deserted with messy tables and chairs?

52
00:07:04,726 --> 00:07:05,435
And you?

53
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,728
What happened to you?

54
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:10,773
You guys have just picked a fight with each other, haven't you?

55
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:14,277
Those gangsters wanna pick a quarrel and ask for money.

56
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,238
Who told you to do that?

57
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,449
You knocked them out right here, didn't you?

58
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,536
You're always picking a fight whenever possible.

59
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,289
How dare you knock the shit out of them?

60
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:30,376
If I didn't give three of them a lesson,
no way they were gonna leave.

61
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,919
If you knocked them out,

62
00:07:32,295 --> 00:07:38,342
are you sure they would be scared of you
and would not come back to ruin my shop?

63
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,180
You couldn't pay them enough to come back.

64
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:45,183
If they come back, I'll knock the hell out of them.

65
00:07:47,226 --> 00:07:50,646
You will knock the hell out of them, or the opposite?

66
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:53,566
Now you can knock out 1 guy.

67
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,777
But if they have 100 guys,

68
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,113
can you fight them back all on your own?

69
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,991
You're gonna let them do whatever they want?

70
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:04,035
Those bastards knocked Thien out to the ground.

71
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:05,787
If I couldn't butt in in time,
he'll die and who's gonna bury him?

72
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,164
My shop is way too small.

73
00:08:09,123 --> 00:08:10,333
There's not enough room

74
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,754
to keep a street hero like you.

75
00:08:15,338 --> 00:08:17,590
Get the hell out of my shop. Go away.

76
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,050
Boss, boss.

77
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,676
Please let me explain.

78
00:08:20,676 --> 00:08:21,761
Explain what?

79
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:23,096
Shut your mouth.

80
00:08:23,638 --> 00:08:25,181
I haven't asked you yet.

81
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,601
Where on Earth did you find such a jack-ass?

82
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:30,895
He has a way-too-bad serving attitude.

83
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,314
No different from a cold-blooded gangster.

84
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:36,275
He's always picking a fight whenever possible.

85
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,152
Oh my God.

86
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,863
Hey, Boss. Please don't go out of line.

87
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:42,406
Out of line, what's your point?

88
00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:45,910
You guys are the one that went out of line first.

89
00:08:46,244 --> 00:08:48,621
Now you've gotta learn how to respect me first.

90
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,122
Hey.

91
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,039
You...

92
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,917
Stop wasting your breath.

93
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:56,587
Go back to your work. I don't give a shit.

94
00:08:57,171 --> 00:08:57,880
Thank you.

95
00:08:58,131 --> 00:08:59,298
Get the hell out of my shop.

96
00:09:05,555 --> 00:09:06,013
What else?

97
00:09:07,223 --> 00:09:08,307
You wanna knock me out, too?

98
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:11,686
Pay him his wage, boss.

99
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,658
Take it. Get the hell out of here.

100
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:40,882
And you. Go clean it yourself.

101
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,724
So pissed off.

102
00:09:53,394 --> 00:09:54,812
Don't you mind your step? Are you blind?

103
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:57,565
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,859
Damn it. What a f*cking bad day!

105
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,935
Mr. Khoa.

106
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,437
Oh shoot! Your shirt gets dirt.

107
00:10:36,562 --> 00:10:40,274
How about taking it off? Then let me wash it for you.

108
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:42,568
It's okay. I'll go get a change.

109
00:10:43,027 --> 00:10:44,195
Ah...

110
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:01,337
What did you eat a while ago?

111
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,340
This morning, I ate Pho. It tasted way too good.

112
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,218
I thought you already ate your sense of shame.

113
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:12,682
Can't I get my head in the clouds once in a while?

114
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:15,643
You know what time it is now?

115
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:17,478
Go out and get back to work.

116
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:19,397
Or else I'll dock your wages.

117
00:11:19,397 --> 00:11:20,815
That's it. He's gonna dock your wages.

118
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:22,817
All right, all right...

119
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:25,903
Today I made some pastries for both of you.
You wanna have some?

120
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,489
I'll go inside to get a change.

121
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:29,740
You won't eat it, right?

122
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,409
Huynh, you wanna eat it?

123
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,077
If Khoa doesn't eat it, we'll eat together.

124
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:34,996
You better get your shit together.

125
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,747
Whenever you see a man, you have no sense of shame.

126
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,082
No sense of shame, what?

127
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:39,875
The man and the woman here are all single.

128
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:42,461
He's my type. So I'm gonna chase after him.

129
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:43,504
But he is...

130
00:11:43,546 --> 00:11:45,881
Whatever he is, I don't give a damn.

131
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,843
Even if he's not straight, I'll make him straight again.

132
00:11:53,306 --> 00:11:55,016
You're not gonna eat pastries. You just go like that?

133
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:57,560
I'll eat all by myself.

134
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,896
Where did I leave it?

135
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:08,422
Haizz.

136
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:10,591
Is someone trying to look for me?

137
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:12,760
Just stop looking for me. I'm already here.

138
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:14,178
I'm looking for something else.

139
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:18,682
All right, if you miss me and wanna look for me,
just admit it. It's not a big deal at all.

140
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:21,227
That's why there's nothing more important than me to look for.

141
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,229
I'm looking for my phone.

142
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,272
Such a big deal.

143
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:28,150
But it's all right. I'm already here, aren't I?

144
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,111
Now I'll get my phone to give you a call.

145
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,114
Uhm...

146
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,081
It seems like you left your phone at home.
Nobody answers my call.

147
00:13:42,456 --> 00:13:43,332
It's not just right.

148
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,711
This morning when I was buying a drink,
I still had it in my hand to discuss my business.

149
00:13:47,962 --> 00:13:49,422
Where on Earth is it now?

150
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:51,799
All right.

151
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:53,592
Go back to your work. I need to go out a bit.

152
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:55,469
No. You've just come here. Where are you going now?

153
00:13:55,469 --> 00:13:57,096
Your phone is nowhere to be found.

154
00:13:57,096 --> 00:14:01,809
You dropped your phone on your way to work.
If someone saw it, they would pick it up and take it.

155
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,144
I'm going out to buy a new phone.

156
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,521
Buying a new phone? It's all right.

157
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:08,774
You've gotta buy a new phone. A posh and nice one.

158
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,068
Oh hold on. Give me a second.

159
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,449
Here it is. By the way, please help buy this item.

160
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,369
Please buy it for me, will you?

161
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,913
Please stop making faces at me.

162
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:27,293
You know what? I ran out of cleanser and micellar water.
So what will happen to my skin next?

163
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,044
It will turn rough and ugly.

164
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:30,421
If the patients bump into me,

165
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:33,382
my way-too-ugly face will make them jump and run away.

166
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:37,178
In the end, there will be no patients left,
which is a great risk. So please buy it for me.

167
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,597
Now you have become a fan of this brand?

168
00:14:39,597 --> 00:14:43,934
Of course. I'm a fan of this brand and you as well.

169
00:14:45,644 --> 00:14:46,479
Just kidding.

170
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:49,482
You see. Recently our city has been full of fine dust, right?

171
00:14:49,482 --> 00:14:54,028
Way too much fine dust. You've gotta use this item, Perfect Whip.
Only then can you completely remove fine dust.

172
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:58,449
Give it a shot. This brand is paraben-free, mineral oil-free and silicone-free.

173
00:14:58,449 --> 00:14:59,742
All right.

174
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,203
My skin is highly sensitive. I can't use it.

175
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,204
I knew it.

176
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:08,042
I hit the nail on the head. I know your skin is sensitive,
which is why I pick this brand.

177
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,045
This brand is really good and suitable for all skin types.

178
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:14,757
It can unclog your pores. You get what I'm saying?

179
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,842
It can unclog your pores.

180
00:15:16,842 --> 00:15:19,845
It doesn't cause irritation to any skin type. You can use it.

181
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:20,471
You've gotta believe me.

182
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,555
Hey, girl.

183
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:27,102
After all, I have no idea whether you get paid
by the examination room or some sales department.

184
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,313
You're way better at sales than nursing care.

185
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:31,023
It's not that.

186
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:35,486
It's not that I'm only good at either sales or nursing care.
In fact, I'm a know-it-all. I can be good at everything.

187
00:15:37,071 --> 00:15:37,613
You're so serious.

188
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,323
Hold on. I'm not finished yet.

189
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:42,493
By the way, please buy cleansing oil for me.

190
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:44,578
Pick a Fresh Blue type.

191
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,497
Fresh Blue.

192
00:15:46,497 --> 00:15:49,291
Because other types aren't suitable for my oily skin.

193
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:51,835
I mean this bottle. Please buy this bottle.

194
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:52,670
Where's the money?

195
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,965
It means I'll dock your wages.

196
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,466
Dock my wages?

197
00:15:57,758 --> 00:15:59,301
You mean you will dock my wages, don't you?

198
00:16:02,304 --> 00:16:02,763
Dock wages.

199
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,158
Give it to me.

200
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:24,410
Quickly.

201
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,619
Give you what?

202
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:27,746
Who the hell are you to keep your nose in my business?

203
00:16:29,248 --> 00:16:31,083
He's my pal, okay?

204
00:16:32,793 --> 00:16:33,836
You lying piece of shit.

205
00:16:34,503 --> 00:16:35,796
Do you think I have no clue about you?

206
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:38,799
If you do know about me, give it back quickly.

207
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,010
No need for a bunch of crap.

208
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,221
We're all gangsters and brothers,
but how can you treat me like that?

209
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:45,431
Don't you dare.

210
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:46,181
F*ck!

211
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,225
Who is the brother to you here?

212
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:51,645
None of my brothers steal or scam people's money like you.

213
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:53,439
Give me.

214
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:02,948
F*ck off.

215
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:04,783
No need to kick me out.

216
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,042
- You.
- You're f*cking dead to me.

217
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:20,591
I told you.

218
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:23,636
No way I'm gonna let you get away with this. Son of a b*tch.

219
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:24,678
Hey.

220
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:26,889
A while ago, you were so arrogant, weren't you?

221
00:17:26,889 --> 00:17:28,349
You wanna beat the shit out of us.

222
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,476
If you can, go knock us out, son of a b*tch.

223
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:33,270
You ask for it.

224
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:35,022
Let's beat the shit out of him.

225
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:39,568
You, f*ck you...

226
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:40,986
Hey.

227
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:42,529
Watchmen! Let's get the hell out of here.

228
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:51,914
Are you okay?

229
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:54,500
Stand up.

230
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:56,043
Take it easy.

231
00:17:59,296 --> 00:17:59,880
Let's go.

232
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:16,605
It's all done. Please have some water.

233
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:29,660
It doesn't make sense how long-standing
and deep grudges they bear against him!

234
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,622
He looks like a gangster with this outfit.

235
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:34,915
How about his face?

236
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:38,502
Good. This face looks way too good, no less than my Khoa.

237
00:18:39,712 --> 00:18:40,713
Who is your Khoa?

238
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,048
So your Khoa, I bet?

239
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:44,758
All right. Stop.

240
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:47,136
Don't you see the patient is lying in front of you?

241
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:50,973
Huynh!

242
00:18:52,182 --> 00:18:53,600
Please take this stuff out of here for me.

243
00:18:56,228 --> 00:18:58,480
Haizz, but his appearance looks familiar.

244
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,733
His visual looks familiar, way too familiar.

245
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:04,069
Is there any possibility that he picked a fight with other gangsters

246
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:06,363
to gain areas like exactly in the movie?

247
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:07,573
Please don't shoot me.

248
00:19:07,781 --> 00:19:09,658
Don't shoot me. Don't shoot me.

249
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,034
Don't shoot me, please.

250
00:19:13,412 --> 00:19:15,330
Oh shoot. I hit the nail on the head.

251
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,666
There is a likelihood that

252
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,626
this guy got arrested

253
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:20,627
and wanted.

254
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,840
Then if we have anything to do with him, we'll get involved.

255
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,758
All right. Stop.

256
00:19:27,092 --> 00:19:28,802
This is not the Martial Arts Congress.

257
00:19:29,762 --> 00:19:31,346
If you keep binge-watching movies, you'll get addicted.

258
00:19:32,264 --> 00:19:33,432
Go out and get back to work.

259
00:19:33,432 --> 00:19:34,892
Let the patient take some rest.

260
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:36,435
May I go out?

261
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:38,479
Please take some rest.

262
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:49,693
It's him.

263
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:52,321
Ah, the phone.

264
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:54,031
Gotta give it back to him.

265
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:19,514
Why can he have this photo?

266
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,146
Put it down.

267
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:29,024
Are you trying to steal stuff?

268
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,776
Steal what?

269
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,070
This place is full of meds. Steal them for what?

270
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,364
The evidence is right in front of my eyes.
You still deny it, don't you?

271
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:36,949
Do you believe I'm gonna call the Police?

272
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,953
In this day and age, the stealing style must have changed.

273
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,663
Even if it's just a photo, you still wanna take it.

274
00:22:43,121 --> 00:22:43,872
Hey.

275
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:46,333
As a doctor and a nurse, watch your mouth.

276
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,501
Who do you say stole stuff?

277
00:22:48,543 --> 00:22:49,628
Do you believe I'm gonna sue you?

278
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:51,922
Then what? Go ahead.

279
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:54,841
Don't forget that you haven't paid your hospital fees.

280
00:23:00,514 --> 00:23:01,181
What?

281
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,724
You're flat broke, aren't you?

282
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:06,311
Who says I'm broke?

283
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:08,981
Other people still keep my money.
I haven't got it back yet.

284
00:23:09,231 --> 00:23:09,982
All right.

285
00:23:10,315 --> 00:23:11,775
Given that you're under difficult circumstance,

286
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:14,027
we will give you a free examination this time.

287
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,737
Now you should go.

288
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,031
I will shut my eyes to your theft.

289
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,409
I didn't steal anything. Don't slander me.

290
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,953
Al right. All right.

291
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:24,371
If you don't steal anything,

292
00:23:24,621 --> 00:23:26,164
I'm sorry, okay?

293
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,083
So please pay your hospital fees.

294
00:23:34,172 --> 00:23:35,465
Just consider I have no idea about it.

295
00:23:36,174 --> 00:23:36,842
Now you go.

296
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,928
Later if the doctor comes back and asks for money,
you'll get what you deserve.

297
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,305
He's not as easy-going as me.

298
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:47,394
Thank you.

299
00:24:00,866 --> 00:24:02,409
What a strange coincidence!

300
00:24:07,998 --> 00:24:11,376
We all have a piece of flip-flops left,
we throw it right in the can.

301
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:11,918
Goal! Ouch!

302
00:24:14,504 --> 00:24:16,673
Hello, hello. 1, 2, 3, 4...

303
00:24:16,673 --> 00:24:18,383
Bah, bah...

304
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,969
Again...

305
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:24,931
Is there any possibility that

306
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:27,017
he's a brother?

307
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,525
He never mentioned a word of this.

308
00:24:36,818 --> 00:24:37,778
A cousin?

309
00:24:42,783 --> 00:24:45,077
How can you hide for way too long?

310
00:24:50,207 --> 00:24:52,584
Damn it. I'm always bumping into you.

311
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:11,186
Uh, Khoa?

312
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:14,523
The patient's just been bandaged.
Why did you let him leave the hospital so early?

313
00:25:16,733 --> 00:25:17,984
I haven't let him leave the hospital.

314
00:25:19,069 --> 00:25:21,363
Uh? Where on Earth is the patient?

315
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:22,864
Today who's on duty?

316
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:24,366
Uh, yes...

317
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:25,408
What is going on?

318
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:28,787
Huynh, do you see the patient on bed number 2?

319
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:30,288
The patient with the bandage?

320
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:36,461
I have no idea.

321
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:38,505
I've just checked the patient's blood pressure in Room 18.

322
00:25:38,964 --> 00:25:41,550
Uh, where on Earth is he?

323
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:43,176
Who's on duty today?

324
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,303
Yes...

325
00:25:46,805 --> 00:25:48,014
I'm so sorry.

326
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:51,101
I should have kept an eye on the patient better.

327
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:53,895
What's wrong with you guys?

328
00:25:55,147 --> 00:25:57,023
The patient's just been bandaged.
He's still in bad shape.

329
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,693
How can you let him leave the hospital?

330
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:01,444
He hasn't taken any meds.

331
00:26:04,197 --> 00:26:05,699
That is Mr. Khoa indeed.

332
00:26:06,658 --> 00:26:07,868
He cares about nothing else but patients.

333
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:11,621
I'm a doctor. If I don't care about the patients,
who am I gonna care about?

334
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:12,289
Care about me.

335
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:16,334
Go out and get back to your work.

336
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:18,628
May I go out?

337
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,672
Why are you so pissed off today?

338
00:26:34,186 --> 00:26:35,270
F*ck!

339
00:26:36,855 --> 00:26:40,317
Hey, bumping into us, aren't you going to say hello?
Where are you going?

340
00:26:41,651 --> 00:26:43,403
Catch him.
