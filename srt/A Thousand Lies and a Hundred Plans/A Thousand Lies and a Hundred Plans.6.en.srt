Hello, who's that?

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,950
It's me. Get on the car.

32
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,150
Please.

33
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
You got here fast.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,150
Because I'm eager to see you.

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,860
(Edit who can see: Ning Yang)

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120

Let's hang out.

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,590
Stop there.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,750
You'd better hear me out.

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:37,870
Ning Yang,

41
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,150
what do you want?

42
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,190
You'll make a fortune

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,680
if you work with me.

44
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
A huge fortune.

45
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,520
Now it's up to you.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,360
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,240
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,800
Good.

49
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,430
Thank you, sir.

50
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,600
It's easy to make mistakes.

51
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,070
But it's hard to correct them!

52
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,360
Get lost!

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,000
You're correcting your mistake, right?

54
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,920
If you can handle Li Youyou,

55
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,190
I'll give you another 1% shares.

56
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,750
Give me five million

57
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,160
and 5% shares.

58
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,560
I may consider your proposal.

59
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,600
Smart girl.

60
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,070
You know exactly how to bargain.

61
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,830
Lu.

62
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,000
As your sister, I'll make Ning Yang,
the scumbag,

63
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,160
to pay the price.

64
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,120
Mr. Li,

(Equity Transfer Agreement)

66
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,630
the only way Youyou will leave Ning Yang

67
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,240
is to shift her focus

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,560
to me.

69
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,240
She may come around.

70
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,920
Xin Ran.

71
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,390
I finally get hold of you.

72
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,750
Mr. Li, I'm glad you still remember me.

73
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,630
What are you talking about?

74
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,680
I would never achieve anything

75
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:05,100
if your grandpa didn't save my life.

76
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,070
Silly girl.

77
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm so happy to see you.

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,160
You can stay in my house today.

79
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,800
I'll ask someone to clean up

80
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
the apartment near here.

81
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:13,980
You can move in when you want.

82
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,720
Settle down first.

83
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,120
And I'll find you a job later.

84
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:17,800
Sounds good?

85
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,430
Thank you, Mr. Li.

86
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
Young man, tell you what.

87
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,480
I never take you seriously!

88
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,160
Get out!

89
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,040
Now!

90
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,870
Go away!

91
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,480
Have some water.

92
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,750
Who made you so angry?

93
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,390
My gosh!

94
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,720
Youyou isn't sophisticated enough.

95
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,120
If one day,

96
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,680
the jerk betrays her,

97
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,950
she'll never know what happened!

100
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,630

101
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,120
It's me, Li Youyou.

102
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,960
Miss Li,

103
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,390
what can I do for you?

104
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,750
I won't hurt you.

105
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,120
Please open the door.

106
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,870
I thought you would marry my dad.

107
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,150
But you're actually after Ning Yang.

108
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,510
He gets the position because of me.

109
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,200
I think you overestimate him.

110
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,910
Miss Li, don't get it wrong.

111
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm capable enough, so I got the job.

112
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,510
And I'm not targeting anyone.

113
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,910
Ning Yang is a jerk.

114
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,960
You'll regret your decision.

115
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,480
You know he's a jerk.

116
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,870
Why didn't you leave?

117
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I need to fix something with him.

118
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,790
I'm warning you to stay away.

119
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,120
Or I may hurt innocent people.

120
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,120
Innocent?

121
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,670
Aren't you innocent?

122
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,910
What did you mean?

123

Every snowflake pleads
non guilty in an avalanche.

124
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,840
I don't think you should

125
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,150
shift your focus on me.

126
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,910
Ning Yang had complicated relationships
with his ex-girlfriends.

127
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,390
You may find clues from them.
