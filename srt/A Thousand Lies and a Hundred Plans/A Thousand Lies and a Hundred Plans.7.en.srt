What's wrong?

32
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,230
I didn't see you when I woke up.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,150
I thought you left me.

34
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,350
I won't do it.

35
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,350
Everything is fine.

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,480
You lost your shoes.

37
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,710
I'll take you home, OK?

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,560
Let's go.

39
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,920
Honey, I'm sorry.

40
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,950
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm OK.

42
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,150
It doesn't hurt.

43
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,310
Shall we go home?

Silly girl.

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,190
Why are you crying again?

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,750
Come on.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,190
Remember that

51
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,710
you're pregnant now.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,240
You need to control the mood swings.

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,150
Could you do it?

54
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,520
You forgot to take the medicine?

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,080
Yes?

56
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,400
I'll get it for you.

57
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,630
Lie down.

58
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,000
Here.

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,470
Come on.

60
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,910
Open your mouth.

61
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,710
Good girl.

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,710
Honey,

63
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,470
let's go to bed

64
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,840
after you take the medicine.

65
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
I'll tuck you in.

66
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,870
Lie down.

67
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,710
Be careful.

68
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,560

who is lying to me.

73
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,920
Hi, honey.

74
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,870
Why are you up so early?

75
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,480
I can't sleep well after being pregnant.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,750
Drink the milk.

77
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,240
It's 25 degrees Celsius.

78
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,720
I measured.

79
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,240
(Why is she being so nice?)

80
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,680
(Has she smelt a rat?)

81
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,630
Thank you.

82
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,750
Yang, where are our marriage certificates?

83
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,240
I can't find them.

84
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,120
What do you need them for?

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,630
No big deal.

86
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
Before dad's accident,

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,240
he wanted to transfer ownership
of some houses to me.

88
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,040
Since he's in a coma,

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
his lawyer says he can do it for me.

90
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,160
He needs to notarize
the marriage certificates.

91
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,560
It's easy.

92
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,720
I'll handle it.

93
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,720
You don't need to worry.

94
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,750
I'll do it.

95
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,560
I'll have time

96
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,390
after visiting Dad in the hospital.

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,390
What's on your mind, Yang?

98
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,870
Well, where did I

99
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,310
put the certificates?

100
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,040
I'll go check.

101
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,160
OK, take your time.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,920
The pill didn't work?

103
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,630
She found out something?

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,970
Am I reading too much into it?

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,390
Why am I feeling uneasy?

106
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,830
Here's the file you need.

107
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,120
Close the door.

108
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,190
I need to talk to you.

109
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,310
No.

110
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,800
Your wife was suspicious of me
since the door was closed.

111
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:41,510
Now I won't do it.

112
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,510
I'll give you the money you asked.

113
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,070
When will you do what I want?

114
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,920
To be the other woman? Fine.

115
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,800
It sucks.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,240
I don't know what else I can do.

117
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,240
You want me to marry you?

118
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,830
I overestimated you.

119
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,480
Get out.

120
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:23,950
Fine.

121
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,950
If Li Youyou comes to me again,

122
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,160
I'll tell her the truth.

123
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm not interested in you, right?

124
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,360
Li Youyou talked to you?

125
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,080
What did she say?

126
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:34,840
Wait!

127
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,480
(Transferred three million yuan)

128
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,720
Mr. Jia, what happened?

129
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,200
Why didn't you tell me on the phone?

130
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,240
Miss Li, here is the thing.

131
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,480
You asked me

132
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,750
to register your marriage overseas.

133
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:04,200
But I can't have it notarized now.

134
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,750
Have a look.

135
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,370
(Ning Yang's Marriage Certificate)

136
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,030
Is it...?

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,870
It means that Mr. Ning

138
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,750
has committed the crime of bigamy.

139
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,630
Seriously?

140
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,630
Yes, he has.

141
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,999
(Ning Yang had complicated relationships
with his ex-girlfriends.)

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,240
(You may find clues from them.)

143
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,910
Great!

144
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,510
Love Shot Cocktail.

145
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,550
Cheers!

146
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
One more drink.

147
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I can drink more.

148
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,630
Can you?

149
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,270
I gotta go.

150
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,750
Bye, guys!

151
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,510
See you!

152
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,440
Watch your step.

153
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,510
Am I the best?

154
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,150
Yes. I know you're the best.

155
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:49,670
Go home.

156
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,390
Take care.

157
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't want to!

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,600
I won't go home!

159
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,150
Let's go.

160
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,030
Why did you come here?

161
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,320
You didn't answer my calls.

162
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,320
Let's go, OK?

163
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
Don't be mad. I didn't mean to bust you.

164
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,840
You did it on purpose!

165
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,360
Stop looking. It's raining. Let's go.

166
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,030

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,200
