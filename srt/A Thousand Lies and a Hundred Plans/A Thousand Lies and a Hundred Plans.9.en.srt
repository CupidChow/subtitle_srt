Hello.

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:35,760
He left.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,640
Remember what you promised.

33
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,920
You know my bank account.

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,870
Yang,

35
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,470
you fixed the problem?

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,080
Rest assured.

37
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,080
It's fixed.

38
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,800
Honey, good night.

39
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,310
Night.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,120
(Culture and Museum Center)

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,840
Sorry, Mrs. Wang.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,560
You think you can fool me?

43
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,310
How dare you do that?

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Mrs. Wang,

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,470
chill out, please.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,470
I know you'll be here today.

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,630
So I made pour-over coffee

48
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,240
that you always love.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,360
Who knows

50
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,280
I'm the one who enjoyed it?

51
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,590
Mr. Ning,

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,630
your company intends

53
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,190
to ride roughshod over the clients.

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,430
You're my Black Gold VIP guest.

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,000
I would never do such a thing

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,190
to someone like you.

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:42,870
Humph.

58
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,750
You remember I'm a VIP guest?

59
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,960
Good. Then tell me

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,470
why Xu Xiaoxiao double charged me.

61
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:54,030
I paid twice as much as Mrs. Zhang did!

62
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,430
Tell Xu Xiaoxiao to come here.

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,240
Mrs. Wang.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:04,910
Hands off me.

65
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,080
My employee made a mistake.

66
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
I will compensate you

67
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,900
no matter how much it costs.

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,800
Look.

69
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,560
I'll go apologize to you in person.

70
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,470
Is it OK?

71
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,120
Mr. Ning,

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,830
Xu Xiaoxiao didn't show up today.

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,750
Humph.

74
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,040
Ning Yang, don't give me that!

75
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,950
Xin Ran,

76
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,430
watch your attitude.

77
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,360
Apologize to Mrs. Wang.

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,920
You heard me.

79
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,720
Mr. Ning,

80
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,560
it looks like you're in a pickle.

81
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,160
No one listens to you.

82
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,120
Mrs. Wang, you've seen it.

83
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,950
Marrying out of my league
is not a good thing.

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,920
Please, don't be mad.

85
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,360
OK?

86
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,720
Ning Yang, listen carefully.

87
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,480
I'm not done with it.

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,680
Don't treat me like a fool.

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll send you a lawyer's letter!

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,310
Hello.

91
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
Where are you?

92
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,560
Why are you absent without reason?

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,390
Show up now!

94
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,600
You offended a big client of mine!

95
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,870
Ning Yang,

96
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,040
my tummy hurts.

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,360
I may have a food poisoning.

98
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,430
Could you please come back?

99
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Stop acting!

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,120
Show up immediately!

101
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,630
Or you'll be fired!

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,950
Why are you so angry?

103
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,000
Honey,

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,310
Mrs. Wang

105
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,270
confronted me earlier in the morning.

106
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,390
Isn't Mrs. Zhang her sworn enemy?

107
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,270
Why did they contact each other

108
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,550
and talk about the package price?

109
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,750
I have no idea.

110
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,870
However, Yang,

111
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,430
Mrs. Wang is the most valuable client.

112
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
You know it, right?

113
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,270
Yes, I do.

114
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,160
She'll send us a lawyer's letter

115
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,630
for what happened.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,630
It becomes serious.

117
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,120
But I've got

118
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
some good news to tell you.

119
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,720
What is it?

120
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,040
Mr. Lee told me

121
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,360
the listing procedures are approved.

122
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Really?

123
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,510
Yes.

124
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,390
Honey, thank you for your hard work.

125
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,510
You've really done a great job

126
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,190
when Dad is still in hospital.

127
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,560
We're family, right?

128
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,750
It's just something I should do.

129
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,560
I've been quite busy,

130
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,270
so I didn't visit Dad.

131
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
How is he?

132
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,310
He's in a stable condition.

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,270
Don't worry, OK?

134
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,240
OK.

135
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm happy to hear it.

136
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,800
Honey, by the way,

137
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Dad wanted to transfer

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,270
his shares to us when we get married,

139
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,510
in case other shareholders
went against him.

140
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,630
Is everything going well?

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,240
I forgot to tell you.

142
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,040
What?

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,800
His lawyer said Dad had transferred
the shares to me before the accident.

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,560
What?

145
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,360
You look surprised.

146
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,190
We saved a lot of money by doing it.

147
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,360
You are happy to hear it,

148
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,630
right?

149
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,240
Yes, I am.

150
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,360
I'm really happy.

151
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,480
You should thank me.

152
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,870
Why?

153
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,270
Just tell me why I should

154
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,950
say "thank you."

155
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,040
I keep you away from the jerk.

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,430
You believe he's a jerk, right?

157
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,750
I don't need to look for confirmation.

158
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,190
But I'm curious about

159
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,680
why you go against me

160
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,750
when you know you can't win.

161
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,750
Li Youyou,

162
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,510
it's my honor to be your foe.

163
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
Ning Yang is a jerk,

164
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
but he's my husband.

165
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,430
I'll deal with him.

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,270
You had an affair with Ning Yang.

167
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,720
You threatened him, too.

168
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,920
How would you explain it to the cops?

169
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,160
Li Youyou,

170
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,120
you're much more stupid than I thought.

171
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,750
Follow me.

172
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,480
What do you want?

173
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:03,950
Are you insane?

174
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,800
Does it hurt?

175
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,480
You've gone nuts.

176
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,390
I'll call the cops.

177
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,070
Do it.

178
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,160
Will the cops

179
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
arrest me or Ning Yang?

180
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,680
What do you mean?

181
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,560
I will show you today

182
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,630
how nasty Ning Yang is!

183
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,870
Morning, sir.

184
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,720
Hi, morning!

185
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
(Noodles)

186
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,550
Allow me.

187
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,870
Thank you for your work.

188
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,550
Hi, Bai Lu.

189
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,790
Morning, sir.

190
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,120
You two are a perfect match.

191
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,550
Why didn't you wake me up?

192
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,480
I would come with you.

193
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,600
I wanted you to get more sleep.

194
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,550
You came home late

195
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,120
after finishing the part-time job.

196
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,080
But you work hard, too.

197
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,000
OK. I know you wanna help me.

198
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,030
By the way,

199
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,750
customers will show up soon.

200
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,440
Let's get to work.

201
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:04,910
OK.

202
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,440
Make a wish.

203
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,120
Happy birthday!

204
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,120
The cake is beautiful.

205
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,840
I'm sorry.

206
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,840
It's what I can afford now.

207
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,790
I promise.

208
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,150
I'll give you

209
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
a much better life.

210
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:39,120
And I'll throw you a big party!

211
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,840
You'll get everything you want.

212
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,480
Honey, I don't want anything else.

213
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,200
I just wanna be with you forever.

214
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,750
Don't say it.

215
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,670
Otherwise, your wish won't come true.

216
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,750
I don't buy it.

217
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,510
I think

218
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,120
we should hang in there.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,360
I'll get scholarships when passing
the postgraduate exam.

220
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,000
Then you won't worry about money.

221
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,200
I enjoy what I do.

222
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,960
You focus on study.

223
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,960
I'll take care of the rest.

224
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,150
I'll try my best.

225
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
And I'll make you happy.

226
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,320
OK.

227
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,790
Trust me.

228
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:23,840
OK.

229
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,870
You can count on me.

230
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
OK.

231
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,200
Youyou, are you in love with Ning Yang?

232
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,960
I don't know.

233
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,840
He's not a rich guy.

234
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,960
But he's generous to me.

235
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,910
Wow! Seriously?

236
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,870
It's not the limited edition.

237
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,250
But it costs more than ten thousand.

238
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,720
Ning Yang has given you everything

239
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,150
to show his ardent love for you.

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,630
OK. I shouldn't have bias against him.

241
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,030
But my dad doesn't approve.

242
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,510
I'm out of his league,

243
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,120
so my dad won't accept Ning Yang.

244
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,030
He told me

245
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,270
Ning Yang will only marry for money,

246
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,030
so I won't be happy with him.

247
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,120
I'm so upset.

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,120
I think you dad is right.

249
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,480
Wait,

250
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,200
you're my best friend.

251
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,240
Which side are you on?

252
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,080
Listen to yourself.

253
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,670
You said you didn't know
if you were in love.

254
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,870
But you've already fallen for him.

255
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,200
Stop it.

256
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,790
Stop it.

257
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:29,720
Don't run!

258
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,910
Tell us something about Ning Yang.

259
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,840
