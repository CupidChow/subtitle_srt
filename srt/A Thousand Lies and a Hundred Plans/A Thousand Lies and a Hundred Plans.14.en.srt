Youyou!

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,190
What happened to your forehead?

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,200
It's OK.

34
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:31,950
Come on in.

35
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,350
Why did you dress like this?

36
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,120
Where did you go?

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,560
I saw your message.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,400
But I couldn't get hold of you.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Where did Ning Yang take you?

40
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,480
Were you safe?

41
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,400
He...

42
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,590
He sent me to a Mental Health Center.

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,150
What?

44
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't worry. I'm OK.

45
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,840
He wants me to get sick.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,760
Fine. I'll play along.

47
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,230
And it's safer for me.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,870
But there are many people.

49
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,520
You have to plant someone there.

50
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,680
What's wrong, Xin Ran?

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,240
Nothing.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
Now I feel everything I've done

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,150
is all worth it.

54
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,710
Have a seat.

55
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,190
Youyou, don't worry.

56
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,470
I'll send someone to the center.

57
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,080
Is everything going well?

58
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,120
How is the company?

59
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,120
Ning Yang believes

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
your dad and I are a team.

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,910
I thought the shareholders

62
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,240
would be on Mr. Li's side.

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,190
But they got cold feet.

64
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,630
And a stranger showed up.

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,520
Guys, sorry.

66
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm late.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,870
Mr. Ning is Xinyan's biggest shareholder.

68
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,840
I'll transfer all my shares to him.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,470
She must be Ning Yang's mistress.

70
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,400
Her name is Lin Meng.

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
Lin Meng?

72
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,910
I've never heard of the name.

73
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Ning Yang has too many mistresses.

74
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,680
But Ning Yang

75
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,520
never takes most of them seriously.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,520
No.

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,190
This woman must be

78
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,560
very important to Ning Yang.

79
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,910
A woman showed up

80
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,000
at the Mental Health Center,

81
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,050
saying she was his true love.

82
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:26,240
I am

83
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,840
Ning Yang's true love.

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,080
She injured me on the forehead.

85
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,470
Could she be Lin Meng?

86
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,710
She hit you?

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,630
Does it hurt?

88
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,520
It's OK. Just a scratch.

89
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,750
She didn't hit me hard.

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,080
She left when I pretended to pass out.

91
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,630
And she showed up

92
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,280
right after Ning Yang left?

93
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,630
Yes.

94
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,630
I guess it was Lin Meng.

95
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,910
When I fell on the floor,

96
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,750
I heard her saying

97
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,240
"I'll never set foot in the place again."

98
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,280
I'll never set foot in the place again.

99
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,150
What did she mean?

100
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,430
If she just got there,

101
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,150
why would she say "again"?

102
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,870
And things were fine in the center.

103
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,000
Maybe she sent someone else there?

104
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,310
Or she stayed there for a while?

105
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,680
I can't figure it out.

106
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,680
I just think it's weird.

107
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,390
I believe you are right.

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,000
The way she reacted
may lead us to more clues.

109
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,720
I'll go investigate her tomorrow.

110
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,460
(Week Schedule)

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,040
Is this your handwriting?

112
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,630
Yes. Why did you ask?

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,070
I got a note before.

114
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,720
Someone wrote
"be careful with Ning Yang"

115
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,000
and warned me he might kill me.

116
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,310
I thought you wrote it.

117
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,830
But the handwriting is different.

118
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,000
It wasn't me.

119
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,600
Who could it be?

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,750
Hello, who is that?

121
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,870
This is Lin Meng.

122
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm downstairs now.

123
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,800
I need to talk to you.

124
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
It's Lin Meng.

125
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,720
Really?

126
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,270
OK. I'll be there soon.

127
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,830
I'll go.

128
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,160
What do you need?

129
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,270
Nothing.

130
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,720
I just want to see

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,040
why you've got guts

132
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,750
to go against Ning Yang and me.

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,560
Now we've met.

134
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
You are pretty.

135
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,720
But I pity you.

136
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,720
You only sleep with old men.

137
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,920
You're just trash to me.

138
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,950
How dare you say that?

139
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,160
You're pissed off?

140
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,560
Ning Yang will never marry you.

141
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,000
Listen carefully.

142
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,920
If you dare to hurt Ning Yang,

143
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,190
I will ruin your pretty face.

144
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,310
You're loyal to Ning Yang.

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,430
He'll only take advantage of you

146
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,000
and abandon you in the end.

147
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:58,870
You...

148
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,800
How was it?

149
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,190
Lin Meng is really insane.

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,270
Please be more careful with her.

151
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,800
I'm OK. And you should take care.

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,160
We can't be too far away from Lin Meng.

153
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
And I've found

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,270
Lin Meng has been

155
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,750
taking actions for Ning Yang.

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,390
Ning Yang

157
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,920
has total control on Lin Meng.

158
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,750
Let's wreck

159
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,430
Ning Yang's plan

160
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,390
with what he's good at.

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,000
No matter how hard it is,
we have to try.

162
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,120
Give him a taste of his own medicine.

163
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,600
By the way,

164
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,300
I know a person who may help you.

165
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:47,400
I'll give you the contact info.

166
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:47,830
OK.

167
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,380
(Mrs. Wang's Phone Number)

168
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,360
You're amazing.

169
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,680
You have connections with everyone.

170
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
You all think that

171
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,310
the rich second generation does nothing.

172
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,310
No.

173
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,430
You won't think that way.

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,510
But Ning Yang will.

175
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,800
Hello.

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
Hello, Mrs. Wang.

177
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:24,950
This is Youyou.

178
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,830
Youyou?

179
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Is that Youyou?

180
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,270
Youyou,

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,070
how are you?

182
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,160
Where are you?

183
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,040
Are you OK?

184
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,950
I'm really worried about you.

185
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,510
Mrs. Wang, I'm OK.

186
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,510
But I do need your help now.

187
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,510
Otherwise, I don't know what to do.

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,750
I'm listening.

189
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,750
If there is anything I can do,

190
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,040
I'll try my best.

191
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm OK, Mrs. Wang.

192
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,000
And I'm safe.

193
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,680
I'll go meet you when it is time.

194
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,310
I'm calling with my friend's phone.

195
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,000
She'll tell you everything.

196
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,240
OK.

197
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,630
Got it.

198
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,600
Stay safe and healthy.

199
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,070
OK.

200
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,620
(Wenbo Center)

201
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,020
(Washroom)
(Xin Ran)

202
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,510
Who did it?

203
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,120
Who put my desk here again?

204
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,950
Excuse me.

205
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,920
Let me introduce myself.

206
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,440
From now on,

207
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm the Assistant to the Chairman.

208
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,790
So, I'm your boss.

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,100
Who gave you the consent?

210
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,270
I'm one of the shareholders.

211
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,790
Go back home and wait for the bonus.

212
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,200
You can't tell me what to do.

213
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,270
Don't lose your temper.

214
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,670
It's bad for you.

215
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,080
Mrs. Wang,

216
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,120
I thought you'd send us
a lawyer's letter,

217
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,510
so I apologized to you every day.

218
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,240
Hope you can forgive us.

219
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,960
Mrs. Wang,

220
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,320
you finally showed up.

221
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,390
I am really sorry about it.

222
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,720
And I've told everyone

223
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,720
to make up for their mistakes sincerely.

224
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,960
Look.

225
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,150
You can

226
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,840
punish me in whatever ways you want

227
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,000
if it makes you happy.

228
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,390
Sincerely?

229
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,150
Yes.

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
I don't think so.

231
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,240
Only Xin Ran had been calling me

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,600
and apologizing to me all the time.

233
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,720
That's why I showed up.

234
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,630
Mrs. Wang, she apologized for me.

235
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,030
It's different.

236
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,270
She is just an employee.

237
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,120
She can't apologize for you.

238
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,270
Yes, you're right.

239
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,630
Well, you can do anything

240
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
if you feel happy.

241
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,240
It's up to you.

242
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,120
Dear Mr. Ning.

243
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,480
You can't be an armchair strategist.

244
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,670
You should take actions.

245
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,630
Tell me what you want.

246
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll do anything for you.

247
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,440
Well, I have a party tonight.

248
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,080
OK.

249
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,550
Mr. Ning,

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,320
you can show your sincerity there.

251
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,840
If I'm in a good mood,

252
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,790
I will forgive you.

253
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,600
Mrs. Wang,

254
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,440
thank you for the invitation.

255
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,630
My assistant will send you the location.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mrs. Wang, see you.

257
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,870
Mrs. Wang.

258
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,270
Take care.

259
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,390
Send me the location.

260
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,030
She doesn't deserve the coffee.

261
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,550
The witch!

262
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,750
Did she embarrass you again?

263
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,200
