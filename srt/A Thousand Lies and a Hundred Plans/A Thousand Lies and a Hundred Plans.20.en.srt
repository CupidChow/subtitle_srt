What's wrong?

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
What happened?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
Xiaoxiao, are you OK?

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,790
Xin Ran,

34
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,350
I almost...

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,680
I almost got killed today.

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,950
It's OK.

37
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,840
Stop crying.

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,480
Tell me what happened to you.

39
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,400
You've got guts.

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,070
Xin Ran told you to leave.

41
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,680
But you chose to risk your life.

42
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,680
I pretend to be a psycho.

43
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,790
But Lin Meng is a real one.

44
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,200
Youyou, stop.

45
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Don't blame her.

46
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,070
She was trying to help us.

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,280
I didn't know Lin Meng is a psycho.

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,190
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,120
Don't lock me up.

50
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,470
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,870
Let me out.

52
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,280
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,190
I don't want this.

54
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,310
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

55
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm not Lin Meng.

56
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm not her.

57
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,490
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

58
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,960
Wait. I am Lin Meng.

59
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,470
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

60
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,680
Ning Yang!

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,680
Ning Yang, help me out!

62
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,680
Please, help me out!

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,680
She is the most obsessed with Ning Yang

64
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,150
among all of us.

65
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,840
But Ning Yang

66
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,710
treats her the worst.

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
It's weird.

68
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,680
I think so, too.

69
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,080
Lin Meng is under Ning Yang's control,

70
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,850
and she can't fight back at all.

71
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,240
I guess

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,630
Ning Yang has got something on Lin Meng.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,240
She's a psycho.

74
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,500
You don't need to care about her.

75
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,680
Sooner or later,

76
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,750
Ning Yang will

77
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,000
break her heart.

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,840
Women should understand one another.

79
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,750
Why don't we give her a hand

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,310
when we see she is suffering?

81
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,560
I don't think

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,630
I can do it.

83
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,560
She almost killed me.

84
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:32,910
I won't, either.

85
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,100
She put me in this dangerous situation.

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:35,870
I know.

87
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,400
Ning Yang has hurt us

88
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,630
in many different ways,

89
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,870
either directly or indirectly.

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,750
But think about it.

91
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,400
We have our own issues, right?

92
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,870
If we can accept ourselves,

93
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,150
why can't we accept Lin Meng?

94
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,120
I think Xin Ran is right.

95
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,030
OK.

96
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,870
Actually, Lin Meng is miserable.

97
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,800
Maybe we should help her out.

98
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,150
But I'm afraid of her.

99
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,030
Can I quit?

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,240
OK. We won't force you to do it.

101
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,240
Youyou and I will handle everything.

102
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,800
Girls,

103
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,400
get some good rest tonight.

104
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,750
Keep up the good fight tomorrow.

105
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,040
Come on!

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,720
Way to go!

107
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,310
We can do it!

108
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:42,830
You...

109
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,070
You imprisoned me illegally!

110
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,040
I'll sue you!

111
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,920
The door is open. Just go.

112
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,630
Release all the videos

113
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,430
of him being naked.

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,680
If I show it to the cops,

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,430
whom will they investigate?

116
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,270
Shame on you!

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,680
What do you want?

118
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,560
We want to tell you something.

119
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,430
Listen, Lin Meng.

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,870
You'll be doomed

121
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,270
if you don't leave Ning Yang.

122
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,510
It's my decision.

123
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,680
None of your business.

124
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,360
I told you she's hopeless.

125
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,870
Why would you care about her?

126
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,510
Did you know

127
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:28,190
what Ning Yang did

128
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,190
to Li Youyou and Xu Xiaoxiao

129
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,190
after they got pregnant?

130
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,600
He killed the unborn babies.

131
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,480
He even wanted to kill the mothers.

132
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,310
Ning Yang doesn't deserve you

133
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,040
at all.

134
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,750
I won't believe a word!

135
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,310
All I know is...

136
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,120
I...

137
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,920
I am the biggest winner.

138
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,750
You're impossible!

139
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,430
Xin Ran, just let her go.

140
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,560
Let's go.

141
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
You stupid witches.

142
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,800
You don't love Ning Yang
as much as I do.

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
How ridiculous!

144
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,120
How dare you lecture me?

145
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,360
You don't deserve his love at all!

146
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,070
Doctor,

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,920
how is my baby?

148
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,600
You're still young.

149
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Take good care of yourself.

150
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,800
Doctor,

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,070
what happened to my baby?

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,800
It was an ectopic pregnancy.

153
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,000
And it'll be difficult for you
to get pregnant.

154
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,560
Please take care.

155
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,310
The baby

156
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,680
is gone...

157
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,750
Again?

158
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:23,630
Lin Meng, you miscarried
three times in one year!

159
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,480
What's wrong with you?

160
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,600
Could you just be a normal woman?

161
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
You're worse than a mule!

162
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,360
To be honest,

163
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,430
I pity you, so I am still with you.

164
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,680
Think about it.

165
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,710
Gotta go.

166
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,360
I've lost everything.

167
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
Now I only have you.

168
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,920
I'll do anything for you

169
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,510
if I can be around you.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,040
I've found

171
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,830
Li Youyou.

172
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,430
Let's go jogging on the beach.

173
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,040
OK.

174
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,030
Youyou,

175
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,720
I was looking for you everywhere.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You should tell me

177
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,600
you're staying with Mrs. Wang.

178
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,120
Mr. Ning,
a man doesn't kneel down easily.

179
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
You shouldn't come to my house

180
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,960
and make a scene like this.

181
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,240
Mrs. Wang, I know that

182
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,870
I made mistakes before.

183
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,270
But please forgive me.

184
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
Because I...

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,630
I can't live without Youyou.

186
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,840
If you insist on keeping her here,

187
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,960
I'll kill myself.

188
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,910
Mr. Ning, you're chewing the scenery.

189
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
Mrs. Wang, I don't have other choices.

190
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,790
I took her to the Mental Health Center

191
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,750
in order to cure her.

192
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,200
Fine.

193
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,870
You don't believe me.

194
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,910
What are you doing?

195
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,870
Mrs. Wang, I didn't wanna say anything.

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,320
But Youyou hits me
when she loses control.

197
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,630
I had enough.

198
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,320
I couldn't put up with it anymore.

199
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,630
Well, stand up.

200
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,720
You don't need to worry about Youyou.

201
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,360
I'll take her to the hospital.

202
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
Youyou, I know

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,920
you don't want to forgive me.

204
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,600
But you need to think about Dad.

205
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,270
I'll go with you.

206
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,080
Where did you hide my dad?

207
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,390
What else do you want?

208
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,790
What are you saying?

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,510
He's not only your dad.

210
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,150
He's my dad, too.

211
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,240
I know everyone thinks I'm a psycho.

212
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,270
I don't care.

213
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,240
But please tell me where my dad is.

214
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,360
Well.

215
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,720
I promise you I will.
