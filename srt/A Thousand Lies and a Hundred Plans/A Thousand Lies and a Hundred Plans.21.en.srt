Name your price.

31
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,120
The company,

32
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,840
the equities,

33
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,400
I'll give you anything you want.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,150
Are you offering me all your equities?

35
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,920
Are you serious?

36
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,150
After all these years,

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
do you really think
I'm targeting the money?

38
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,590
What else do you want?

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,710
Well.

40
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,710
Honey,

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,760
let me...

42
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,480
tell you a story.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,840
Let's talk about our dad.

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,760
Do you know which word
he used to describe me?

45
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,560
Loyal.

46
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,360
Ning Yang,

47
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,800
you're stepping out of line.

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
I know you've been through a lot,

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,280
and you've been the most loyal one.

50
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,000
But that doesn't mean

51
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,000
you can play tricks behind my back.

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,590
Don't get any ideas
of the family I love,

53
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,360
stop dreaming to replace her.

54
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,470
Understood.

55
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,630
You're still young,

56
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,280
don't be so ungrateful.

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,000
You know how you got

58
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,870
your postgraduate offer.

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,590
It's good for a man to have ambition.

60
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,680
But remember,

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,150
you need equivalent competence as well.

62
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,240
Yes, sir.

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,400
I have a question for you,

64
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,870
the word "loyal"

65
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,280
to whom would he use it?

66
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,030
It is a word used to describe...

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,630
a dog.

68
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,910
In his eyes,

69
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,150
I wasn't a living person,

70
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,190
I was a dog to him.

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,470
A watchdog.

72
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,190
That's impossible.

73
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,680
My father would never say that,

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,960
he would never think like that.

75
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,430
Would he?

76
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,520
I think it's up to you.

77
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,310
Princess,

78
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,680
tell me,

79
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,030
who should pay for

80
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,910
my days of humiliation?

81
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
There, there.

82
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
So...

83
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,000
you married me to revenge on me.

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,190
You never loved me, had you?

85
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,590
There, there.

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,840
There.

87
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,030
In my world,

88
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,710
I believe that

89
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,590
a monster's child

90
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,680
doesn't deserve to be loved.

91
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,510
So you're just trying to destroy

92
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,070
me and my father, aren't you?

93
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,310
Calm down.

94
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,160
If you can behave,

95
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,870
you and me

96
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,240
fake being a loving couple.

97
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,600
It would be much easier.

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,000
Problems will be solved.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,310
Do you understand me?

100
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,950
What about the others?

101
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,830
They didn't do anything wrong,

102
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,310
why can't you leave them alone?

103
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,750
Oh, you mean those women.

104
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,630
Our dad taught me well.

105
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,800
I learned something from him,

106
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,070
which is...

107
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,480
you can always abandon

108
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,920
a disloyal dog.

109
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,750
Leave them alone,

110
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,390
I'm all yours.

111
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
I wonder

112
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,270
what exactly is

113
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,800
in this woman's head?

114
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,680
What's in your head?

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,800
Honey,

116
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,870
what leverage do you have

117
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,040
to negotiate with me?

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,310
Do you have any?

119
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
Quit it.

120
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,510
Mrs. Wang, just a moment.
I'm turning on my laptop.

121
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,390
Let me check my e-mails.

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,190
Got it. One moment, please.

123
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,650
(Personal Information Lin Meng)

124
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
I received it. Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

125
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,870
Great.

126
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,840
(Now an entrepreneur,
treated in the Mental Health Center)

127
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,070
Honey,

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,720
we haven't held
our wedding ceremony yet,

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,630
our dad is still in a coma.

130
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,360
He'll be happy to see it done.

131
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,870
What if it can bring him back?

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,800
Please believe me.

133
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,310
I will...

134
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,270
I will prepare you

135
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,480
a splendid wedding ceremony.

136
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,310
Why do you look unhappy?

137
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,000
Are you upset?

138
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,360
Cheer up, honey.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Give me a smile.

140
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,390
Smile!

141
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
I told you to smile!

142
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,070
Do it.

143
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,920
Off me go.

144
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,920
A beauty like you

145
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,510
drinking in daylight alone.

146
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,800
Anything upsets you?

147
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,430
You can tell me about it.

148
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,040
Can you make me less upset?

149
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,630
Show me.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,800
Here's not a good place

151
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,830
where I can make you happy.

152
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,480
Who are you?

153
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,630
Thank you, sir.

154
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:02,790
She's a friend of mine.

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,440
Your friend?

156
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,670
I'll take her home.

157
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,550
You?

158
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,790
What a bummer!

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
What have you done to me?

160
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,360
Where is this place?

161
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,510
I didn't expect
you would belittle yourself.

162
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,320
You have no right to say that.

163
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,630
If you think I'm the one
who told Ning Yang

164
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,960
that thing about Li Youyou,

165
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,910
then I'd be the one in his arms,

166
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,790
not her.

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:46,720
And you,

168
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,630
end up with nothing.

169
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,600
You're right.

170
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm a pawn of Ning Yang.

171
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,960
So what?

172
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,550
You didn't even have
the chance to be his pawn.

173
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,510
Why do you insist on being a pawn?

174
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Stop persuading me.

175
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,750
I would never betray Ning Yang.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,910
I know,

177
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,750
you're closer to Ning Yang
than anyone else.

178
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,910
But there's no intimate relationship
that can last forever.

179
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,030
Largely a romantic one.

180
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:13,550
He can treat a rich girl like Li Youyou

181
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,510
in that way.

182
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,360
With the terms you have,

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,240
how far do you think you can be?

184
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,150
Right,

185
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,870
just a reminder.

186
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,790
You should always protect yourself,

187
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,750
especially when you're in a bar.

188
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,840
Can't you say it over the phone?

189
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,790
Asked me here in person.

190
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,200
What's your next move

191
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,750
to Li Youyou?

192
