(Xu Xiaoxiao)

31
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,560
Mr. Ning, don't...

32
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,920
What if I insist?

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,920
OK?

34
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,710
Why look at me?

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,560
I wanna surprise you, you know?

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,200
Did other men

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,710
leave marks on you?

38
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,510
What are you saying?

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,070
You're my only love.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,870
Really?

41
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,030
I learned to make this yesterday.

42
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,000
Taste it.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,080
Li Youyou ambushed Xin Ran again.

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,280
She made her sit beside the washroom.

45
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,240
Why are you not surprised?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,710
It tastes good.

47
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,750
She always acts like that.

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,430
It's almost her routine.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
I thought you had a crush on Xin Ran...

50
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,240
Miss Xu,

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,680
you should know who you are.

52
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,800
Don't ask any

53
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,870
inappropriate questions.

54
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,560
All right.

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,630
It's working hours.

56
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,190
We should go back to work.

57
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,400
I don't want anyone to talk about us.

58
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,190
Take the money.

59
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:10,800
Get up.

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,520
Take the money. Leave my daughter alone.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,400
No.

62
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,520
Mr. Li,

63
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,280
I don't want your money.

64
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,840
I love Youyou.

65
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,910
Trust me, please.

66
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,240
Why would I?

67
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,280
You're a conman.

68
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,960
I know what you are.

69
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,870
Dad!

70
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,800
Ning Yang. Ning Yang.

71
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,840
Are you OK?

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,750
Dad,

73
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,030
if you want to break us up today,

74
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,400
just kill me now.

75
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,120
Youyou...

76
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,150
I'm looking out for you.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,910
He lied to you.

78
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,710
He did!

79
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,240
Dad!

80
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,150
Doctor, how is my dad?

81
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,680
Will he wake up soon?

82
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,870
Mr. Li is in a stable condition.

83
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,630
I'm not sure when he will wake up,

84
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,470
but we're adjusting the treatment plan.

85
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
And Miss Li,

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,680
are you OK?

87
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,240
You can't be so emotional
during pregnancy.

88
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,080
I got it.

89
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,870
By the way, Miss Li,

90
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,840
are you taking any psychotropic drugs?

91
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,070
Generally speaking,

92
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,950
you can't take them during pregnancy.

93
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,190
I haven't taken them in a while.

94
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,270
Really?

95
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,920
I thought the pills I found just now

96
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
belonged to you.

97
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,190
They're mine.

98
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,390
But you got it wrong.

99
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,430
They are nutrition tablets.

100
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,750
My husband gets them from abroad.

101
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,040
Hi, there.

102
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,430
You don't wanna see me?

103
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,510
Or did you hide anyone in your room?

104
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,360
I wish I could hook up with another guy.

105
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,510
He might offer me a nicer condo.

106
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,870
What's going on, honey?

107
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,830
Why are you mad at me?

108
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm not mad at all.

109
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,190
But what were you doing?

110
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,240
Why were you angry with me this morning?

111
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,070
I came here

112
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,040
to talk about it with you.

113
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,430
What is it?

114
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,510
I'm not interested in your life.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,430
Come on.

116
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,190
I need your help.

117
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,000
You need something from me?

118
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,240
Li Youyou is very complacent now.

119
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,510
I'd better stay away from her.

120
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,040
She's pregnant.

121
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:45,800
What?

122
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,830
But I don't care.

123
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,560
You're so cold-blooded.

124
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,240
But I'm very nice to you.

125
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,040
Listen.

126
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,600
I'll rent a five-star hotel room for you

127
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,040
after I have dealt with it.

128
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,390
Really?

129
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,120
Just remember.

130
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,920
I won't lie to my love.

131
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,070
What do you want me to do?

132
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,800
Keep an eye on Xin Ran.

133
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,390
Ning Yang is really a natural liar.

134
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,120
But it's not the last minute.

135
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,070
No one knows who will win.

136
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,360
You think it's appropriate?

137
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,190
You're enamored with her.

138
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,360
Why should I spy for you?

139
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,560
I won't do it.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,950
(Mom is calling)

141
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Hello, Mom.

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,190
Xiaoxiao, you wired money again?

143
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,240
We don't need the money.

144
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,800
Take good care of yourself.

145
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,870
Mom, I just got some bonus.

146
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,070
The festival is around the corner.

147
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,270
Buy some nice food for you and Dad.

148
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,560
I've got some money left.

149
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,480
Mom, I'm in the middle of something.

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,390
I gotta go.

151
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,270
Talk to you later.

152
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,510
Take care, please.

153
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,270
I will.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,830
My honey is the best.

155
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
You wired your money back home.

156
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,390
You don't have much for yourself.

157
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,800
Well,

158
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,920
check your text message.

159
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,440
(Transferred 52,000 yuan)

160
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,800
I know you favor me.

161
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,480
Since my graduation,

162
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,510
you've been the one who cares for me.

163
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,320
Yang.

164
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,480
What's wrong?

165
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,840
I'll apologize to you in person.

166
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,720
I'm sorry I don't remember you.

167
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,480
Yang, we only part to meet again.

168
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,600
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.

169
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,480
What a beautiful night!

170
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,670
He left before you had fun?

171
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,150
Seems he treats you

172
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,840
just like a streetwalker.

173
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,510
Don't go too far!

174
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,870
I haven't gone far enough!

175
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,080
Who do you think you are?

176
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,670
Mr. Ning...

177
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,870
Mr. Ning doesn't love you anymore.

178
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,960
He's in love with me!

179
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,840
Really?

180
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,910
He took you to the motel.

181
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,910
He bought you cheap bottled water.

182
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,320
He didn't even pay for the condoms.

183
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,960
Xu,

184
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,320
men always look for excitement.

185
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,630
But women should never fall for them.

186
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,670
Or you'll be in big trouble.

187
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you want?

188
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,550
You want to know it?

189
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,550
Crawl on the floor.

190
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,910
Kneel down and beg me.

191
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,960
