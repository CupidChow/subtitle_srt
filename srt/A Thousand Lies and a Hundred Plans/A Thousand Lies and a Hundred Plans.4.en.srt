00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,820
Believe me, I'll destroy you.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,840
I don't think you can do it.

48
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,030
Hello.

49
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,060
Yang, when will you get home?

50
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,210
I need to talk to you.

51
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,740
I'm having dinner with a client.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,620
I'll get home pretty late.

53
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,240
Go to bed. Don't wait for me.

54
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,800
It's OK. I'll wait.

55
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,630
I'll be right here waiting for you.

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,730
OK. See you later.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:16,920
Gotta go.

58
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm your client today.

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,460
What will I be tomorrow?

60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,010
Mr. Ning, you're a puppet

61
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,740
in the hands of others.

62
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,910
I'll have a chance to prove

63
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,030
you're in the hands of me.

64
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,460
Are you mad at me?

65
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,800
You'll force yourself on me, right?

66
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,560
Yes.

67
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,710
Everyone should listen to me.

68
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,680
I won't listen to you

69
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,120
unless you're really good in bed.

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,020
Next time.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,120
I'll show you how good I am.

72

From now on,

73
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,200
I'll look forward to the next time.

74
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:38,270
Honey, why did you sleep in couch?

75
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,390
I want you to sleep well.

76
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,890
Let's go back to our bedroom.

77
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,970
Who did you meet tonight?

78
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,520
A female client?

79
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,710
Zhang took me to the KTV.

80
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,510
The perfume got on me there.

81
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,290
Yang,

82
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,310
you've changed.

83
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,750
Let me guess.

84
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,080
You think I love you more, right?

85
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,210
How much?

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,020
It's 30 yuan.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,530
Thank you.

88
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,570
You should be careful.

89
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

90
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,360
You can sit here.

91
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,690

93
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,670
I love you.

94
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,690
I know.

95
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,150
I love you very much.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,470
I know.

97
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,190
Yang,

98
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,410
do you know why I choose you

99
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,750
despite that my dad cuts me off?

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,940
Because you love me.

101
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,390
Yes, I do.

102
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,850
And I know how much effort you've paid

103
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,840
in order to be with me.

104
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,780
So, I love you with all my heart.

105
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,800
Then I hope you love me forever.

106
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Yang, I'll tell you something.

107
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,920
What is it?

108
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,110
I'm pregnant.

109
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,420
What?

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,020
You're not happy about it?

111
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
You've recovered.

112
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,590
Yang,

113
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,480
you'll be a dad soon.

114

115
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,560
I was just stunned.

116
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,160
Honey, by the way,

117
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,410
shall we go to the hospital to test it?

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,960
I don't think you're happy.

123
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,030
I am happy.

124
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,910
It's just I don't know

Yes.

132
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,670
I want the baby.

133
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,670
It's my own baby.

134
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,630
