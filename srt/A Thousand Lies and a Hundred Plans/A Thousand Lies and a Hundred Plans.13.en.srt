30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,230
How disgusting it is!

31
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,149
(The Kept Woman was Behind the Murder)
Ridiculous!

32
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,400
What a horrendous scandal!

33
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:19,430
Many investors called today.

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,640
They said our estimated value
went down drastically.

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,400
They worry our stock
will fall on debut tomorrow.

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,310
It has become more serious!

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,430
Did you hear him?

38
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,710
What should we do?

39
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,840
I got many calls like that.

40
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,790
I can't imagine what will happen.

41
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,120
It's unbelievable!

42
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,430
So, Mr. Ning,

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,560
you need to figure something out.

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,350
Everyone will go bankrupt

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,430
if our company is not able to be listed.

46
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,790
You?

47
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,510
How dare you show up?

48
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,590
Tell us.

49
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,590
Did you contact the newspaper?

50
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,200
You should be ashamed of yourself!

51
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,750
Could you just use your head?

52
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,590
What would I get by revealing a scandal

53
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,030
right before the company went public?

54
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,960
Maybe you don't

55
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,680
have enough confidence in it.

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,100
So, you use the scandal to back out?

57
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,240
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

58
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,430
Mr. Li must be blinded,

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,360
so he hooked up with...

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,560
Enough is enough.

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,120
Guys, calm down.

62
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,150
Xin Ran,

63
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,470
you scared us by exaggerating things.

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,960
You must have ill-intention.

65
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,360
Mr. Li

66
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,750
is my most respectable father-in-law.

67
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,430
It's true

68
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,630
he made a mistake.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,120
But I need

70
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,910
to protect his achievements.

71
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,240
I'll never allow anyone

72
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,630
to stir things up!

73
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,400
I should resent myself.

74
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,150
I'm just the Acting Chairman

75
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,470
who doesn't have shares.

76
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,080
Mr. Ning, we had an agreement.

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,870
If we want the company to be listed,

78
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,590
we'll have to remove

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,590
Mr. Li from the Board of Directors.

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,870
You can't do it!

81
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,910
Mr. Li didn't do anything wrong!

82
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,470
I need to ask you something.

83
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,280
Fire away.

84
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,360
(Public to Private Transactions)

85
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,750
Mr. Li

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,870
embezzled a huge amount of money

87
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,280
and wired it to you.

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't tell me you knew nothing.

89
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,560
It explains why we're in this situation.

90
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,720
(Transfer Agreement)

91
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,360
Mr. Li,

92
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,960
why are you doing this?

93
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,190
You know I don't need the money.

94
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Xin Ran,

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
you'll be doing me favor

96
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,240
by taking the money.

97
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,030
Mr. Li,

98
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,630
what did you mean?

99
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,840
I want to leave a way out for Youyou,

100
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,190
and keep her safe.

101
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,750
Ning Yang works hard.

102
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,350
But his intentions are not pure.

103
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,800
I'm afraid

104
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,680
he'll hurt Youyou

105
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,960
and the company

106
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,680
when I'm making the plan.

107
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,030
But it's just my speculation.

108
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,600
If he did nothing,

109
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,160
I'd be happy.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,830
Hope he'll pass the test.

111
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
If he does,

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,750
I'll let him inherit the whole company.

113
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,920
OK.

114
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,000
I understood.

115
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:29,990
I'll keep the money safe.

116
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,510
Why are you smiling?

117
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,950
Do you admit you took the money?

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,000
Mr. Li wired money to me.

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,310
But can you prove

120
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,600
he embezzled it from the company?

121
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,510
The Financial Department
keeps all the documents.

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,630
You should know clearly

123
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,390
how the department makes account.

124
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,070
Fine.

125
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,870
If you wanna argue with me,

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,390
we'll have a reconciliation process.

127
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,070
I wasn't going to say this.

128
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,510
But now I have to tell you

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,450
for the sake of our company's future.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,750
It's Youyou's test result.

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,750
She was diagnosed with manic depression.

132
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
She's a person who lacks capacity.

133
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,390
Well,

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,630
it means

135
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,390
all the shares she has got

136
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,920
belong to Mr. Ning unconditionally.

137
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,510
I never expected

138
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,950
an assistant could take everything away

139
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,240
when I worked my ass off.

140
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,600
Fine.

141
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,430
I have an announcement.

142
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,720
I've transferred all my shares

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
to Miss Lin from Dadong Technology.

144
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,630
She'll attend the meeting later.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Guys, sorry.

146
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,160
I'm late.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,560
The shareholding proportion says

148
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,390
Xin Ran is the biggest shareholder.

149
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,750
You get it wrong.

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,510
Mr. Ning is Xinyan's biggest shareholder.

151
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
I'll transfer all my shares to him.

152
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't wanna stay here.

153
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Let me out!

154
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,920
Let me out!

155
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
Let me out!

156
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,240
Let me out!

157
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,120
I don't wanna be here!

158
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,630
I can't stay here!

159
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,040
Yang!

160
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,310
Yang! You've got here finally!

161
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,270
Yang, take me home.

162
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,600
They are bad guys.

163
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
Take me home, now.

164
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,480
Yang, please take me home!

165
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,070
It's OK.

166
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,430
It's OK.

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,190
Honey,

168
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,630
come on.

169
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,360
Sit down.

170
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,480
Honey,

171
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,430
look around.

172
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,800
It is home.

173
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,430
OK?

174
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,070
Yang, I'm begging you.

175
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,560
Please take me home.

176
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,680
It's not home at all.

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,310
Yang, take me home.

178
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,560
Take me and your baby home.

179
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,120
The place is not home.

180
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
Yang, just send me back.

181
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,600
She's way too emotional.

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,390
You can't talk with her anymore.

183
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,720
No! No! Don't!

184
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
You're bad guys!

185
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
Stay away from me!

186
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,830
Yang! Yang!

187
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't leave me here! Yang!

188
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,750
Honey.

189
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,950
Be a good girl.

190
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,190
I'll visit you next time.

191
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,040
Don't go! Please!

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,390
I wanna get out!

193
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,240
Don't!

194
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,390
Let me out!

195
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,240
I don't wanna stay here!

196
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,560
What are you doing here?

197
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,480
I come to meet you.

198
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,390
And I wanna make sure

199
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
if Li Youyou really gets sick

200
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,560
or she just puts on an act.

201
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,190
Try your best to make sure

202
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,680
if Li Youyou is pretending.

203
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,870
You and I

204
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,510
can live happily ever after

205
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,950
when we're sure she has the disease.

206
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,630
Got it.

207
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,000
Consider it done.

208
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,240
Who are you?

209
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,790
You don't remember me?

210
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,240
I'm Ning Yang's true love.

211
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,200
You witch!

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,840
I'm gonna kill you!

213
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,390
Witch! I'll kill you!

214
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,750
Witch! I'll kill you!

215
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,240
She is sick.

216
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,240
Miss Li,

217
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,870
wish you enjoy the rest time

218
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,320
of your life here.

219
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,980
(Room Three)

220
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
No! Let go of me!

221
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,000
Let go of me!

222
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,630
Hands off!

223
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,510
Help!

224
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,630
I will never

225
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
set foot in the place again.

226
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,320
No lights.

227
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,240
Miss Li, how are you feeling?

228
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,720
I have a headache.

229
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I don't want any light.

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,080
Should I tell the doctor?

231
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:16,670
Nope.

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,870
What?

233
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,790
Come over here.

234
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,870
Could you check it?

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,790
Right here.

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,750
Here.

237
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Mr. Jia, you did a good job.

238
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Ning Yang

239
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,360
is about to give the show away.

240
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,390
Xin Ran,

241
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
I want to quit the plan.

242
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,750
Why?

243
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
Do you want more money?

244
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,080
No.

245
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,750
It's not about money.

246
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,870
I just think

247
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,960
Ning Yang is a horrible person.

248
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm afraid he may kill me.

249
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Don't worry. He won't.

250
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,030
He'll weigh his options
before taking actions.

251
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
He still needs you now.

252
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,960
But do you know

253
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,870
how scary he can be?

254
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:08,600
He's always overconfident,

255
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,550
which will trap him in it.

256
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,240
He will dig a grave for himself.

257
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,900
Proud troops will certainly be beaten.

258
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,510
Everything is under our control.

259
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,270
Well, OK.

260
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,480
OK. I gotta go.
