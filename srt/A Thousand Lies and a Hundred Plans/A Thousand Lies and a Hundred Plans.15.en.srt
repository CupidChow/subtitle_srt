How could he humiliate himself?

37
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,680
I didn't approve of his promotion.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
Did you see?

39
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,310

41

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,680
He's the guy in yesterday's news.

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,000
Sir.

46
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,840
Sir, wake up.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
Are you OK?

48
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,970
Stop taking pictures.

49
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,400
Stop it.

50
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,430

I'm at Plaza Park.

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,800

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,630
OK. Got it.

56
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,400
Don't take pictures!

57
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:15,870
Stop it!

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,190

59
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,560

60
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,080
What happened?

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,120
Who did it to you?

62
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,520
(A male social butterfly.)

63
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,910

to promote his career.)

(drank and danced with rich women in KTV)

67
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,430
(in order to apple-polish one of them.)

68
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,310
Hi, Mr. Ning.

69
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,400
Hi, Mrs. Wang.

70
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,870
Is it a duel?

71
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,470
Mr. Ning,

72
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,310
if you can drink

73
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:59,280
all liquor on the table,

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,910
I'll wipe out the past and forgive you.

75
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,430
Really?

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,310
Mrs. Wang, you must be kidding.

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,400
I...

78
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
I can't drink all liquor.

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,960
You promised
you would make me happy.

80
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,360
Now what?

81
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,270
You will not

82
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,040
show your sincerity in this way?

83
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,120
I won't eat my words.

84
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,120
Look.

85
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,920
I'll make a toast to everyone.

86
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:28,680
Bottom up.

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,480
Mrs. Wang, my buddies are next to us.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,040
They are all dashing guys.

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
I'll go say hello.

90
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,390
Be right back.

91
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,040
Mr. Ning,

92
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,190
why are you in a rush?

93
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,000
I haven't finished my words.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,720
I told you just now

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,750
you must drink all the liquor here.

96
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,630
And my girlfriends

97
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,680
will apply for your VIP membership,

98
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,950
which costs one million yuan for each.

99
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
Furthermore,

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,680
we'll sign a five-year contract with you.

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,430
OK.

102
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,800
I'll take turns toasting all of you here.

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,270
Ma'am.

104
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,600
Bottom up.

105
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,870
Do a great job, OK?

106
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,800
Good!

107
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,360
I'll have a beer this time.

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,040
Ning Yang,

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,310
don't drink beers.

110
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,310
I've paid

111
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,800
for all the imported liquors here.

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,630
What was I thinking?

113
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,560
No beers!

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,830
In order to make you all happy,

115
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll bust my gut!

116
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,190
Show me your sincerity.

117
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,720
Great!

118
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,950
You're a good boy!

119
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
Great!

120
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,160
Good. What a good drinker!

121
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,750
Wait a sec.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,390
Hold on. Just a sec.

123
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,830
Come on. Cheers.

124
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,270
Cheers!

125
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,630
Yang, how could you do it?

126
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,270
You can't walk out alive today!

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,440
(The other person recalled a message)

128
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,160
What did you say?

129
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,600
Who are you?

130
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,630
Mr. Ning,

131
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
are you done?

132
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,750
Coming.

133
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm here.

134
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,000
Listen to me.

135
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,720
Drink all of it.

136
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,240
It's worth more than one million.

137
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,160
Lingling.

138
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll pay another one million.

139
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,070
Love ya.

140
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,070
One more million.

141
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,270
Me, too.

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,070
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

143
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,240
Just show me how sincere you are.

144
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,750
Bottom up.

145
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,870
Me, too.

146
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,510
What a great night!

147
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,070
I'll dance

148
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,120
to entertain you.

149
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,070
Sounds good?

150
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,070
Yes!

151
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,630
Good. Dance to the music!

152
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,600

159
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,630
Enjoy as much as you can.

160
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,200
Go ahead.

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,440
Ning Yang.

162
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,510
Drink more.

164
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,720

165
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,440
Good!

166
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,550
Are you crazy?

167
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
You witch!

168
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,390
I warned you.

169
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,840
If you dare to hurt Ning Yang,

170
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll make your life hell.

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,030
Did you hear yourself?

172
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll call the cops if you don't stop!

173
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,960
What?

174
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,360
You wanna call the cops?

175
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,510
You're insane!

176
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,390
I'll kill you!

177
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,750
Hello.

178
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,840
Where did you go?

179
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,550
Come back to work! Now!

180
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:41,720
Be patient.

181
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,600
I told someone to delete the videos.

182
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
I'll be back soon.

183
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,440
Wait and see!

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,270

186

187
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,440
Mrs. Wang,

188
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,030
thank you.

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,270
Don't mention it.

190
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,840
Let me know if you need me again.

191
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,240
OK. See you.

192
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,120

00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,480
Ning Yang, calm down.

195
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,440
I've arranged an interview for you.

196
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:45,030
What? Are you kidding me?

197
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,240
You want me to take an interview?

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,030
Instead of avoiding rumors,

199
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,080
we should tell people
the story on our side.

200
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,550
It makes sense.

201
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,600
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,240
I've been under great pressure.

203
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,960
Forgive me, OK?

204
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,510
As you know,

205
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
you're my only true love.

206
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,150
Hold on.

207
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,750
Hello.

208
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,750
Mr. Ning,

209
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,550
Mrs. Wang dropped the lawsuit.

210
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,550
Really?

211
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,150
She dropped the lawsuit.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,960
She did.

213
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,600
Mrs. Wang dropped the lawsuit.

214
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,600
I know

215
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,910
I'll feel at ease

216
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,390
when you're around me.
