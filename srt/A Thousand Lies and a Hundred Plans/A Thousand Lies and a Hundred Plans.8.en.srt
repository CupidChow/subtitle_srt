30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,000
Honey.

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,200
Are you OK?

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,070
It's fine.

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,280
Don't make breakfast anymore.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,790
You should get more rest.

35
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,710
OK?

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,120
Everything is fine.

37
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:54,150
Honey,

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,200
the company is going public.

39
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,150
So, I won't eat breakfast at home.

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,640
And don't stay up for me, OK?

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,710
After I have done it,

42
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,640
I'll spend more time with you.

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:08,910
OK.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,120
I gotta go.

45
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,120
Get more rest.

46
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:12,910
OK.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,560
Hello,

48
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,030
you got the files for Li Youyou?

49
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,870
Don't play tricks. You know it clearly.

50
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,710
Good.

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,310
Wanna investigate me?

52
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,630
Hello, Xin Ran.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,150
Did you have breakfast?

54
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,030
Stop it.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,150
I've been thinking of you.

56
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,280
Wanna have fun with me?

57
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,400
I wanna poison you.

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,680
Wait.

59
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,560
If a woman wants to kill a guy,

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,190
she'll poison him secretly?

61
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,590
No, I won't.

62
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,750
I'll kill him above board.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
I'd be happy to have a try.

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,280
The purest cyanide.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,750
Enjoy it.

Since you pick up a fight again,

71
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,430
I'll give you a hard lesson!

72
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,680
Honey.

73
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,190
Enjoying your coffee?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,480
What are you doing?

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,680
Nothing at all.

76
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,870
You told me you were busy?

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,750
Well,

78
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
you've been busy with her.

79
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,750
You stalked me?

80
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,750
What?

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,950
I would never do it.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,310
Someone ill-intentioned sent me these.

83
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,950
Should I believe what I saw?

84
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,510
(Could it be Xin Ran?)

85
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,600
(No, she's not stupid.)

86
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,190
Honey,

87
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:36,040
if the pictures were emailed

88
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,040
to our shareholders tomorrow,

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
what would happen?

90
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,360
Honey, Xin Ran seduced me.

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
She's heartless.

92
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,150
She said I should leave you

93
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,750
and marry her.

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,040
I said no.

95
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:52,720
By the way,

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,240
she blackmailed me.

97
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,510
She wants a huge amount of money.

98
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,190
Honey, trust me.

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,430
I've been through a lot for you!

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,720
You know how much I love you.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,870
Honey, what are you saying?

102
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll always trust you.

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,190
You're a dashing guy.

104
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,750
I believe it was the other woman

105
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,430
who seduced you first.

106
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,270
Exactly! It was not my fault.

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
The witch seduced me.

108
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,160
Honey,

109
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,680
she did it because she's jealous of you.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,420
You know it, right?

111
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,270
I am your wife.

112
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,480
I do trust you.

113
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,190
I'm just afraid she will

114
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,510
send the pictures to the shareholders.

115
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,390
You'll be removed from office.

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,480
Youyou,

117
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,510
I need your help.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,870
We're in a difficult situation.

119
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,160
Dad...

120
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
Dad is in a coma.

121
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,920
If someone else steals the company,

122
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,630
we will be in big trouble.

123
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,360
I know.

124
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,270
Now the person

125
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,040
wants to challenge me,

126
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,720
what should I do?

127
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,270
I will...

128
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,190
I will take care of her.

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,950
I promise I'll play safe.

130
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,430
Are you crazy?

131
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,950
Psycho!

132
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,510
You framed me?

133
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,070
I told you to work with me.
Not sabotage me.

134
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,310
What did I do?

135
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,720
You haven't given me

136
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,749
any money or company shares.

137
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,600
Who took the pictures?

138
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,160
What did you mean?

139
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,600
I'm way smarter than you imagine.

140
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
If it wasn't you,

141
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,630
who could it be?

142
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,240
How many times have I told you

143
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,920
to cover your traces after cheating?

144
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,720
Who knows how she finds out?

145
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:11,600
You'll be suspended from tomorrow.

146
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't come back to work

147
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,070
unless I figure out

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,390
who took the pictures.

149
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,750
Mr. Ning,

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,040
you can just fire me.

151
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I won't.

152
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll keep you around me.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,080
I'm on my period.

154
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,200
What? You play that card again?

155
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't care.

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,240
I told you to keep an eye on Xin Ran.

157
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,440
But you took my pictures for Li Youyou?

158
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,670
What...? What are you talking about?

159
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Ouch!

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,670
Look at yourself!

161
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,030
How ugly!

162
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,870
Listen.

163
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,550
Other guys

164
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,270
won't look at you if you leave me.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,200
You should be grateful.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,390
The pictures you sent to Li Youyou

167
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,720
can't pose a threat for me.

168
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,670
You should use your head.

169
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,870
If I sent our videos

170
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,200
to others...

171
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,870
I took the pictures.

173
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,670
It was because I got jealous.

174
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,670
It was my fault.

175
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,790
I won't do it again.

176
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,840
Never ever.

177
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,840
Really?

178
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,440
Yes.

179
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,360
Good.

180
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,150
Be a good girl.

181
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,320
I'll give you anything you want.

182
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,440
Don't be jealous again.

183
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,840
You're the only woman I want.

184
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,630
OK. Got it.

185
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,790
Who is it?

186
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:58,600
Hi, Miss.

187
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,870
It's our anniversary celebration.

188
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,960
We are giving our guests wines as gifts.

189
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,440
OK. Thank you.

190
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,840
The shabby hotel
won't give you good wines.

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,960
There is no free lunch in the world.

192
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,080
There must be traps behind it.

193
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,720
You know it's a shabby hotel?

194
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,480
OK.

195
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,670
Enjoy the wine.

00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,840
I gotta go.

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,690
One more thing.

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,960
Keep an eye on Xin Ran.

And,

200
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,910
stay away from Li Youyou.

201
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,270
She's a lunatic.

202
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know what she will do.

203
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,790
Just a heads-up for you.

204
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,200
