=Episode 2=

30
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,590
Why are you staring at her?

31
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,700
You think she's more attractive?

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,460
Honey,

33
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,170
don't get it wrong.

34
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,290
I... I don't know her at all.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,530
You swear to Dad now.

36
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,220
Promise you'll never cheat on me.

37
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,230
Or I'll kill myself right now!

38
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,170
Honey, wait.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,700
Calm down.

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,870
Don't be mad.

41
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,320
Our happiness has just started.

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,280
Am I right?

43
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,120
Mr. Ning. Miss Li.

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,700
The hospitalization procedure is done.

45
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,139
His security personnel got here, too.

46
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:45,980
I'll be outside.

47
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,090
Let me know if you need me.

48
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:48,490
OK.

49
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,410
Hold on.

50
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:50,900
By the way...

51
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,020
Honey,

52
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,920
Xin Ran will drive you home, OK?

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,890
Get some good rest.

54
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,050
I'll be here looking after Dad.

55
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:56,680
OK?

56
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,260
No.

57
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,700
I'll stay here with Dad.

58
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,680
Mr. Ning,

59
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,360
all the shareholders know
Mr. Li had an accident.

60
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,550
There's an emergency meeting
in the afternoon.

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,180
We'll elect an Acting Chairman.

62
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,050
You and Miss. Li
are invited to the meeting.

63
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,490
My dad is still breathing.

64
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,590
Why are they in rush?

65
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,630
Honey, it's OK.

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,600
Don't be mad.

67
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,840
Should I tell them to reschedule?

68
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,720
No. We'll be there.

69
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,170
Honey.

70
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,920
We should be strong-minded in adversity.

71
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,790
But we can't watch others

72
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,950
stealing the company from Dad.

73
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,640
Yang, I'm sorry.

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,230
I shouldn't burden you with this.

75
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,990
What are you talking about?

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,710
We'll share burdens together

77
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,400
because we're family.

78
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,810
I'll attend

79
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,740
the shareholder meeting,

80
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,450
and handle everything in the company.

81
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,520
You stay here and look after Dad.

82
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,060
I'll be the one

83
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,600
who's in a pickle.

84
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,300
(Meeting Room 1)

85
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,150
Our Chairman is still in a coma.

86
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,990
In order to stabilize the situation,

87
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,370
we'll elect someone
as the Acting Chairman.

88
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,250
I'll vote for Mr. Ning.

89
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,190
Mr. Ning is familiar
with the company's practices.

90
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,450
But he doesn't have any shares.

91
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,220
If he became the Acting Chairman,

92
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,110
I'm afraid...

93
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,310
I understand.

94
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:23,500
But shares don't mean everything.

95
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,850
Mr. Ning has become

96
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,630
Mr. Li's son-in-law.

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,180
I know. And nothing can go wrong

98
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,690
with our stock-listing plan this year.

99
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,100
Yep.

100
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,590
That is why

101
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,950
we need an Acting Chairman now.

102
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,380
So, let's vote.

103
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,210
If you agree on Mr. Ning's promotion,

104
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,520
raise your hand.

105
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,580
Thanks.

106
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,030
I'll live up to your trust,

107
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,000
and do a great job.

108
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:50,800
Thank you.

109
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,990
Why are you staring at me?

110
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,140
Listen.

111
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,080
Who is better in bed,

112
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,060
the old man or me?

113
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,620
We're adults.

114
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,830
I don't think it's an appropriate topic.

115
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,470
No wonder the old man favors you.

116
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,470
Very interesting.

117
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,820
Mr. Ning, I'm sorry.

118
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,200
But I don't know what you're saying.

119
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,000
I've got work to do.

120
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,650
See you later.

121
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,440
You didn't answer my question.

122
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
Don't think you can get away.

123
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,220
You wanna

124
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,210
play hard to get?

125
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,460
Wanna mess with me? Your timing sucks.

126
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,080
Or you'll be in trouble.

127
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,770
Don't forget I've warned you.

128
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:07,800
Hi, Miss Li.

129
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,530
Honey.

130
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,810
Honey.

131
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,380
What brings you here?

132
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,480
I thought you would sleep in.

133
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,940
You didn't eat the soup

134
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,880
Ms. Wang cooked.

135
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,430
So, I brought it here.

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,880
I'm such a lucky guy

137
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:37,900
to have you as my wife.

138
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,640
Miss Li, do you need anything?

139
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,830
Nope.

140
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,830
I just wanna look at you

141
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,660
from here.

142
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,510
I know you're worried about Mr. Li.

143
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,220
But you should be calm and strong.

144
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,480
You're really attractive

145
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,510
and considerate.

146
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,460
No wonder my dad was into you.

147
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:11,990
However,

148
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,850
there's no way for you to marry my dad

149
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
and be a younger version of my mom.

150
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,490
You're reading too much into it.

151
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,000
I'd be extremely embarrassed

152
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,250
if I had a daughter in your age.

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,650
Watch your mouth!

154
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,380
You're insane!

155
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,860
Yang, I'm so sorry.

156
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,980
I didn't mean to hurt you.

157
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,050
Don't worry. It's fine.

158
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,940
No big deal, OK?

159
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,930
I finally get hold of you.

160
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,309
Did you forget to take the pills?

162
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:05,600
Yes.

163
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,080
Remember it next time.

164
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,200
I didn't know you're sick.

165
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,290
So, I'll forgive you

166
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,310
for what you did today.

167
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,440
You witch! Stop there!

168
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,310
I'm gonna fire you!

169
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,190
Stop!

170
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,880
You hit me! I'll fire you!

171
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,190
Everything is fine now.

172
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
I'm by your side. No one can hurt you.

173
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,480
Ning Yang,

174
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,750
you must be upset

175
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,570
after I hit her.

176
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,890
Mr. Ning, it's the ladies room.

177
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,870
I know it.

178
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,060
I said I'd forgive her.

179
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:42,810
What now?

180
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:44,320
You'll be after me?

181
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,240
You should be careful.

182
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,170
What are you doing?

183
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,130
It hurts.

184
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:08,910
It hurts!

185
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Xin Ran, you're fired.

186
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,760
I did nothing wrong!

187
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,260
Why will you fire me?

188
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,300
Xin Ran, I think you know why.

189
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,490
Li Youyou is Mr. Li's daughter,

190
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,610
don't you know it?

191
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,110
All I know is I've done nothing

192
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,390
that hurts the company.

193
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
You need a valid reason to fire me.

194
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,930
Listen to me.

195
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
Here is the reason:

196
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,600
you seduced your boss,

197
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,160
which will damage
the company's reputation,

198
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,420
and our corporate culture.

199
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,780
Does it sound good to you?

200
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,790
Miss Li, show me the evidence.

201
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,660
Seriously?

202
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,240
I'm the evidence.

203
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:56,550
Don't you think so?

204
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,770
I'll forgive a raving lunatic.

205
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,040
So, I won't sue you

206
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,230
for what you just said.

207
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,990
Don't stand there.

208
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,130
Pack her stuff and throw her out!

209
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,600
Miss Li...

210
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,460
Did you hear me?

211
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,800
You dare to question my decision?

212
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,470
Hi, there.

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,870
What's going on?

214
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:17,800
Anything I need to know?

215
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,110
Yang,

216
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,870
I told Xin Ran

217
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,630
to resign from the company

218
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,150
and go look after Dad.

219
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,980
It's what an assistant should do, right?

220
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,440
Yes.

221
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,750
Xin Ran,

222
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,870
let's talk about it later.

223
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,310
We'll have a meeting now.

224
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,950
You got the document I need?

225
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,730
Honey,

226
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,250
chill out.

227
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,960
I'll go to the meeting now.

228
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,330
Don't worry about her.

229
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,270
I'll talk to you later, OK?

230
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,760
But...

231
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,060
Just stay cool.

232
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's talk it over when I get home,

233
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,110
OK?

234
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:58,310
But...

235
00:10:59,400 --> 00:10:59,990
Yang!

236
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,840
Are you going to betray me

237
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:08,790
