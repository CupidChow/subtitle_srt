30
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:12,840
Li Youyou,

31
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,430
you couldn't protect your baby.

32
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,950
How could you protect yourself

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,870
if you didn't work with me?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,790
The baby never existed.

35
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,070
I wasn't pregnant.

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,040
What did you mean?

37
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,040
Be careful.

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,280
(Color Doppler Report)
Don't let him know.

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,440
Don't let him know.

40
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,790
Don't worry.

41
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,350
I'll put on an act before my husband

42
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,840
with all I learned from my acting class.

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,590
How sad!

44
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,640
Although we haven't been

45
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,430
in touch with each other
since your mom died,

46
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,950
I am still your family.

47
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,640
I'll help you out as your aunt.

48
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,710
Please do what I said

49
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,680
in the coming days.

50
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,750
The world is peaceful when you sleep.

51
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,750
How I wish you could

52
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,630
always sleep sound like this.

53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,240
He left.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,750
Do you

55
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,710
have any plans?

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,240
He doesn't want the baby.

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,150
Since he plans to kill us,

58
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,120
I'll give him what he wants.

59
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,150
Just tell him I have a miscarriage.

60
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,190
Why would you put yourself in danger?

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Youyou,

62
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,150
you can't put your life at risk.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,400
He won't believe me if I'm unscathed.

64
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,710
Don't worry. I know what to do.

65
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,360
Youyou,

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,870
you can't handle him by yourself.

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,150
You'll be in great danger.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,030
Youyou!

69
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,399
What did you say to her?

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
What are you doing here?

71
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,590
Follow me.

72
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,150
Why did you come to the hospital?

73
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,590
You tried to kill her?

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,470
Are you insane?

75
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,630
Why can't I come here?

76
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,030
Others will gossip about us, got it?

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,240
I couldn't care less.

78
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm just visiting my boss's wife here.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,190
I'm suspended, remember?

80
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,800
You can't show up in the hospital

81
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,560
because you are suspended.

82
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,310
What are you talking about?

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,960
Were you behind Li Youyou's accident?

84
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,310
You suspect me?

85
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,840
I'm warning you now.

86
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,030
If you don't have faith in me,

87
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,990
our alliance won't exist anymore.

88
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,240
I can't put Li Youyou at risk.

89
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,190
Now I have to play my trump card.

90
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,190
Hi.

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,870
I'm sorry. I'm late.

92
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,120
All of you know that my family

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
is in a messy situation.

94
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:21,630
Thanks for understanding.

95
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:22,270
Sorry again.

96
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,310
Mr. Ning,

97
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,600
how are Mr. Li and Miss Li?

98
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,360
We've been worried about them.

99
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,120
Thank you for your kind words.

100
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,190
Both of them are getting better.

101
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,120
I went to the hospital earlier.

102
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,270
The doctor said
Mr. Li may come to himself.

103
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,310
Wow, it's great news.

104
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,070
I hope

105
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,070
he can wake up before we go public.

106
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:42,720
I know.

107
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,000
If Mr. Li can wake up by then,

108
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,630
we'll be happy about it.

109
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,920
But right now,

110
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
we really need to focus

111
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,560
on the nominee shareholding issue.

112
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,390
We don't mean to step into

113
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,830
what happens with Mr. Ning's family.

114
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,310
Right.

115
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,800
And we won't ask details.

116
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,680
Well,

117
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,600
that's right.

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,830
But Miss Li is in the hospital now.

119
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
It's necessary for us

120
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,430
to make clear that

121
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,040
who should be the nominee shareholder.

122
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,190
You're right about it.

123
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,160
Mr. Li founded the company.

124
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,560
And all of you

125
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,680
are the founding fathers

126
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,310
of the Li's Group.

127
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,720
As the saying goes,

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,000
"Even with your own brothers,
keep clear accounts."

129
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,750
We'll need to keep transparent

130
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,390
on the issue

131
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,720
of fund allocations.

132
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,680
Mr. Jia,

133
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,750
please show everyone

134
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,950
the Equity Transfer Agreement.

135
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:41,720
OK.

136
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,750
Mr. Li signed

137
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,920
on this agreement

138
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
before Youyou and I got married.

139
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,000
The entry-into-force condition says

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,390
Miss Li should be conscious

141
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,270
(Entry-into-Force Condition)
and sign the notarization

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,270
with Mr. Ning together.

143
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,920
So, Mr. Ning,

144
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,270
have you got the notarization?

145
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,240
Well...

146
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,630
Why are you here?

147
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,720
No big deal.

148
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,560
You're having a shareholders' meeting.

149
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,160
As one of the shareholders,

150
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,630
I can't be absent from it.

151
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,720
Are you kidding me?

152
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
When did you become a shareholder?

153
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,190
Mr. Jia,

154
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,360
please check it out.

155
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,920
It's real.

156
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,570
(Transferer Li Zhenhua)
(Transferee Xin Ran)

157
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,800
Forging documents is against the law!

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,680
What?

159
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,630
Your lawyer checked it.

160
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,870
Stop defaming me.

161
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,270
Otherwise, I'll sue you.

162
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,510
No way. The document is forged.

163
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,430
You can't just say it.

164
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,870
There are places to authenticate it.

165
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:55,830
Mr. Ning,

166
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,240
we should call it a day now.

167
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,600
When the lawyer figures out everything,

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,310
we'll have a meeting again.

169
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,040
Guys, let's go back.

170
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:05,920
OK.

171
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,360
Let's go.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,680
Turns out I got deceived by you.

173
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,630
We win some, and we lose some.

174
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,120
Mr. Ning, just suck it up.

175
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,720
I couldn't care less.

176
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,430
It is my honor

177
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,630
to have an opponent like you.

178
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,830
Are you sure we are enemies?

179
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,830
Maybe

180
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
I can help you out.

181
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,870
I need to tell you something.

182
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,920
I've never trusted any woman.

183
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,430
If you wanna join the game,

184
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,070
I'll take on you to the end.

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,630
But I need to remind you of something:

186
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,870
you should

187
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,560
be prepared to lose.

188
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,870
Wait,

189
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,360
the tattoo is good.

190
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,560
But it's a pity.

191
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,430
Mr. Ning, I can explain it!

192
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,430
Yes.

193
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,310
I need a good explanation.

194
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,510
Otherwise,

195
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,680
I'll give you a hard lesson!

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,560
Mr. Ning, I didn't do it.

197
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,390
Mr. Li never told me

198
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,480
he signed the agreement.

199
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,920
And I never knew

200
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,040
Xin Ran was part of the deal.

201
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,560
What you said doesn't make sense.

202
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,800
You didn't do your job.

203
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Do you understand?

204
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,560
You betrayed me.

205
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,800
I will punish you someday.

206
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,240
Now, get lost!

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,790
Hello, I need to see you.

208
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,320
Right now.

209
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,790
Ma'am.

210
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,150
Ｗe are not done yet.

211
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,150
Why did you get up?

212
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,320
I gotta go. Something came up.

213
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,440
Clean my face. I'm in a hurry.

214
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,270
Got it.

215
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,750
You're late.

216
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,270
There was a traffic jam.

217
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,440
What's up?

218
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,480
Why are you in a rush?

219
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,320
Take all money out
from my offshore account.

220
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,360
Call Zhang

221
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,200
and tell him

222
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,270
you'll buy his shares at a high price,

223
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,120
Miss Lin.

224
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,600
Something went wrong with Xin Ran?

225
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,870
Don't ask questions.

226
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,390
I won't answer.

227
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,320
Gotta go.

228
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,390
One day, you'll realize

229
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,320
I am the only option you have.

230
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,510
Did you get Li Youyou's test result?

231
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,870
Yes, Mr. Ning.

232
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,840
Do you need it now?

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440
Yes, I'll go meet you.

234
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
(Calling Xin Ran)

235
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,030
It's her.

236
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
What do you want?

237
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,360
What do you want?

238
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,080
Stay away!

239
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,870
Doctor!

240
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,840
Youyou, hang in there!

241
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,670
Stay away!

242
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,150
Stay away! Doctor, help!

243
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,360
Youyou!

244
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,270
Youyou!

245
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,360
Youyou!

246
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,550
What a coincidence!

247
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,870
You care about her more than I do.

248
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,360
Where did you hide her?

249
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,550
Hands off me!

250
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,510
Hands off!

251
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't forget

252
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,870
you can only
get your shares after I sign.

253
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,720
Didn't I tell you

254
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,550
I hate to bargain with women?

255
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,150
I gave you many chances.

256
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,320
What will tomorrow's headline be?

257
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,720
Devious woman failed
to marry the rich old man.

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,510
So she seduced the son-in-law, right?

259
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,150
Ning Yang, you're a scumbag!

260
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,390
What do you want?

261
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,670
You had your chance.

262
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,630
