1
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,260
If you could meet him again,

2
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,760
would you make the same decision?

3
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,830
I bet she may say "no."

4
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,960
But back then, she would accept it.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,370
The brutal truth is that
there is no "what-ifs."

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,260
I always believe man can conquer nature.

7
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,730
Once a person tells a lie,

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,990
they'll have to patch it up
with more lies.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,920
There are many jerks

10
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,480
just like Ning Yang.

12
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,930
But it's OK.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,640
Hundreds of plans are ready
for a thousand lies.

Everyone,

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,110
attention, please.

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,720
Let's welcome the son-in-law

45
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,790
of the Li's Group.

46
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,420
He's Mr. Ning Yang,

47
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,240
the only successor of the group!

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,450
Music, please!

49
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,240
May his love burn brightly forever!

50
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,240
Tonight,

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,150
Mr. Ning will pay the bills

52
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,620
for all of us!

53
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,880
Mr. Li's son-in-law is amazing!

54
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,690
Not only has he won over the daughter,

55
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,050
but also he has gained Mr. Li's trust.

56
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,300
What did you mean?

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,320
The daughter has manic depression.

58
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,910
No one could be with her

59
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,640
for over three days.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,990
What are you doing?

61
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Stop messing with me.

62
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,499
You kept the flash marriage top secret.

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,669
None of the girls knew about it.

64
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,520
Exactly.

65
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,980
Aren't we your best friends?

66
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,890
Listen,

67
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,160
did you sleep together first
and get married after it?

68
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,920
What are you saying?

69
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,040
I'd never do it.

70
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,840
And it's not a flash marriage.

71
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,330
We reunited after a long separation.

72
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,100
There is no such a thing!

73
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,810
All the reunions
are long premeditated plots!

74
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,780
Have you heard of it?

75
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,470
Even if he plotted everything,

76
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,490
I'll marry him.

77
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,340
You're just being jealous!

78
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,220
(Washroom)

79
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,960
Stay here for longer.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,460
Mr. Zhang...

81
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,890
Will you?

82
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,420
Mr. Zhang.

83
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,570
Mr. Zhang, you promised

84
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:36,000
you'd sign the contract
if I hang out with you tonight.

85
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,850
No rush, OK?

86
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,950
Come on!

87
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:41,840
Just keep me company.

88
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,350
I'll call the cops if you do it again!

89
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,190
Who the heck are you?

90
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,630
Mr. Ning...

91
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,500
Mr. Ning!

92
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,750
Mr. Ning. I'm sorry.

93
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,730
Mr. Ning, please forgive me.

94
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,170
Get lost!

95
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,050
It won't happen again!

96
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,940
You're the only guy
who dared to ruin my plan.

97
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,590
You're the only woman
who dared to slap me.

98
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:18,040
Youyou, tell us.

99
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,870
Why do you wanna marry Ning Yang?

100
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,430
Does it hurt?

101
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,240
Come on.

102
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,950
He's dashing.

103
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,400
What? Seriously?

104
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,380
It's more than that.

105
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,320
Tell us more, please.

106
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,830
I value him because he is tender,

107
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,010
honest, and thoughtful.

108
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,760
He surprises me every day.

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,720
Besides,

110
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,740
he always tells me he loves me.

111
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,340
You're showing off.

112
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,310
Your bride will be eager
to see you in the next room.

113
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,920
Are you worrying about me

114
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,550
or about yourself?

115
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,430
Youyou, we're happy for you.

116
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,250
It's getting late now.

117
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,870
We'll give you two some privacy.

118
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:21,800
Wait here.

119
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,680
(Youyou is calling)

120
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,340
The number you dialed doesn't respond.

121
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,360
Ning Yang,

122
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,200
your prey could be your hunter.

123
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,710
Now I'm the one

124
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,650
who will make the call.

125
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,040
The number you dialed doesn't respond.

126
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,180
Where did Yang go?

127
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,450
Is he OK?

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,560
Hello,

129
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,750
this is Li Youyou.

130
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,410
What? Come again?

131
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,620
A car accident?

132
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,400
How is my dad?

133
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,440
OK. I'm on my way.

134
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,510
(Youyou is calling)

135
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,030
Hello.

136
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,990
Yang, where are you?

137
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,850
I'm sorry, honey.

138
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,220
I'm drunk.

139
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,820
Dad had an accident.

140
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,620
What?

141
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,150
I feel scared and lonely
in the hospital.

142
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't worry. I'll be there.

143
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,540
Take the money.

144
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,790
And leave my daughter alone.

145
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,730
Dad!

146
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,440
Please wake up.

147
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,590
Youyou!

148
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,420
Yang, I'm sorry.

149
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,170
I didn't mean to hurt you.

150
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,180
I can't live without you.

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,190
What should I do if you left me?

152
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,790
Yang...

153
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,940
It's OK, honey.

154
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,550
It's OK.

155
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,370
I'll be here. Don't be afraid.

156
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,420
What did the doctor say?

157
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,300
The doctor...

158
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,630
He said Dad might never wake up...

159
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,260
Yang, what should I do?

160
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,300
Yang...

161
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,000
It's fine.

162
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,810
Everything is OK.

163
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't worry.

164
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,530
You've got me.

165
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,710
I'll handle it, OK?

166
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,340
You?

167
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,450
Mr. Ning. Miss Li.

168
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,280
She's Dad's new assistant,

169
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,990
Xin Ran.

170
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,340
When did Dad have a new assistant?

171
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:39,130
No one ever told me.

172
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,750
Why are you staring at her?

173
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,850
You think she's more attractive?

174
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:48,760
Honey,

175
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,410
don't get it wrong.

176
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,510
I... I don't know her at all.

177
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,840
You swear to Dad now.

178
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,540
Promise you'll never cheat on me.

179
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,740
