30
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,480
What about me?

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,430
When will you marry me?

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,590
Marry you?

33
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,640
That's total nonsense.

34
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:21,560
So...

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,870
I was never a part

36
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,200
of your plans for the future, am I?

37
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,480
You women

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,870
are being too insatiable.

39
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,070
I'm treating you well enough.

40
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,350
If it's not because of me,

41
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,100
you'll still be in
that Mental Health Center,

42
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,400
lying there dead.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,070
Stop acting up like this!

44
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,120
I have enough trouble, OK?

45
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
You shouldn't even bring it up.

46
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:43,920
You know that?

47
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,120
Li Youyou is your leverage

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
for you to trade the Li's assets.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,070
What else do you want?

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,560
Li Youyou's return

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,230
is not that simple.

52
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,040
Besides, I don't have her father.

53
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,000
What did you say?

54
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,230
Li Youyou's father

55
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,280
is like a ticking bomb.

56
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,760
If we don't have this leverage, then...

57
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,350
Now you know it,
why are you still repeating it?

58
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,190
Isn't it inappropriate?

59
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,400
A man making a promise to a women,

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,870
means that he lacks
confidence and planning.

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,150
You're with me for so long,

62
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,840
can't you understand that?

63
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,400
I was being too anxious.

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,470
I'm so sorry.

65
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,190
I'm thinking of having

66
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,520
another wedding ceremony with Youyou.

67
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,870
I want to provoke her father.

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,910
I wonder what's the old man

69
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,120
and Xin Ran's conspiracy.

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,190
Xin Ran, are you suspecting her?

71
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,240
But you cooperated with her.

72
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,240
Seems like you really don't know me.

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Youyou!

74
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,630
Youyou!

75
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,630
Youyou, what happened?

76
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,699
Why you didn't answer my calls?

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did Ning Yang hit you?

78
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,910
Youyou,

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,240
it's dangerous here.

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,080
Come with me.

81
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,750
You can leave now.

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
It's my business, not yours.

83
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,310
Youyou, what happened?

84
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,680
Did Ning Yang brainwash you again?

85
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,630
Youyou, Youyou.

86
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Ning Yang.

87
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,310
Well.

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,120
What good news do you have?

89
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,800
Why are you so sure it's a good one?

90
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,360
I had too many bad ones today.

91
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,000
I know where Mr. Li is.

92
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,150
Do you?

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,800
I know that

94
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,000
you're always the one

95
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,190
who brings me good news.

96
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,400
So what are your following plans?

97
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,750
Mr. Li has signs of waking up.

98
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,400
That's not good to hear.

99
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,430
Will you take care of it?

100
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,560
Wu,

101
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,000
do you have a second?

102
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,160
Coming.

103
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Lu,

104
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,720
is it really you?

105
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,040
Lu,

106
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,800
can you hear me?

107
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,310
I finally found you.

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,160
I know you're still alive.

109
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,750
Should I say congrats to you?

110
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,870
Or to me?

111
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,720
It's a relief for both of us.

112
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,680
Isn't it?

113
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,950
Are you kin to Xin Delu?

114
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,270
I am.

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,560
This is the letter from your father.

116
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,390
Thank you.

117
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,480
You're welcome.

118
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,920
(Ran, I'm so sorry.)

119
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,560
(I know you hate dad.)

120
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
(I owe you too much.)

121
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,270
(I was thinking to make you up)

122
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,070
(in my last days.)

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
(But I didn't expect my illness)

124
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,830
(leaves me too few.)

125
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,430
(There's something I didn't tell you,)

126
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,070
(in fact, you have a little sister.)

127
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,240
(Her name is Bai Lu.)

128
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,000
(If you can find her,)

129
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,270
(you still have a family)

130
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,310
(in this world.)

131
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,310
(You two girls can support each other.)

132
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,040
(I wish you a safe and happy life,)

133
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,790
(and find someone who loves you.)

134
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,800
I finally knew,

135
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,240
the reason we would hit it off.

136
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,120
I finally knew,

137
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,950
why my heart burnt when you were gone,

138
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,160
why it hurt so bad
when you disappeared.

139
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,050
Their debts will be paid.

140
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,070
I believe that they'll soon

141
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,270
see their punishment.

142
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Have a try.

143
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

144
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,950
I didn't put poison in it.

145
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,870
It's tasty.

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,950
When can I meet with my father?

147
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,360
Xin Ran.

148
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,240
When did you know her?

149
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,600
A couple of days before our engagement.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,270
In my father's study.

151
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,630
Nothing special.

152
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,720
Have you considered that...

153
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:56,120
why would a cautious man
like your father

154
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,680
introduce Xin Ran
out of a sudden?

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,750
Think it over.

156
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:09,750
Me,

157
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,070
to you,

158
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,830
to dad,

159
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,510
to the company and our family.

160
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,830
Do I have any betrayal?

161
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,510
I'll make it short.

162
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,510
Ning Yang won't completely trust you.

163
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,150
This...

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,550
is the recording between me and him.

165
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,200
That's rare.

166
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,320
I have terms, though.

167
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,390
I want ten million Yuan.

168
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,270
For this recording?

169
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,150
Of course not.

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
It has more information

171
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,480
that you want.

172
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,390
Why are you so sure I would pay for it?

173
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,150
You said that

174
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,270
I should always protect myself.

175
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,240
Money is a strong protection.

176
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,600
You're a strange lady.

177
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,270
You can't be persuaded earlier,

178
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,080
now you're standing by my side.

179
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,080
Because I had a second thought,

180
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,750
with the terms I have,

181
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,480
I can't go far

182
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,750
with Ning Yang.

183
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Therefore,

184
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,550
I prefer to cash it out right now.

185
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,870
There's one thing I want to know.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,030
Who are you exactly?

187
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,320
It's just a name.

188
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,910
Do you really want to know?

189
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,270
Miss Li, you're in a perfect shape.

190
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,670
You look stunning

191
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:50,790
in every dress we have.

192
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,360
It's common for a bride

193
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,750
to feel nervous before the wedding.

194
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,150
(I wasn't going to ask you about it.)

195
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,550
(It's just women's affairs,)

196
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,600
(you don't know if it's true.)

197
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,510
Find somewhere to relax.

198
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,000
(But...)

199
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
(it goes so far,)

200
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,600
(I hope you can think twice...)

201
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,150
Stop.

202
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,440
(Youyou.)

203
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,030
Stop it.

204
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,910
(Ning Yang is a jerk.)

205
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:06,250
(You'll be dead if you stay with him.)

206
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:06,910
Stop it.

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,870
(He's very dangerous.)

208
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,510
Stop.

209
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,650
(You must keep your mind clear.)

210
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,550
Stop it.

211
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,600
I told you to stop!

212
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,080
Stop!
