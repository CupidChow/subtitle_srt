Li Youyou?

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,920
Li Youyou!

34
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,230
You couldn't even

35
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,280
keep an eye on her?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,310
The nurse said she injured herself

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,870
and sneaked out when getting treatment.

38
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,350
I don't want to hear it!

39
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,230
Go find her!

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,590
You know how important she is

41
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,040
at the crucial moment!

42
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,840
Got it.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,870
I'll find her.

44
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,710
Did you go to V Restaurant?

45
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,470
What?

46
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,630
V Restaurant!

47
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,280
I didn't.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,840
Keep a close watch on the old man.

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,710
She might go visit her dad.

50
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,870
Got it.

51
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,360
Get lost!

52
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,240
It's done. Get some rest.

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,680
You don't know

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,080
you're allergic to it?

55
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,710
Luckily, you got the treatment in time.

56
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,630
Thank you.

57
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,120
Salad.

58
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,310
The same. No peanuts, please.

59
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,310
OK.

60
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,120
I'll go to the washroom.

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,870
You woke up.

62
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Everything is fine?

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Are you insane?

64
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,590
I'm allergic to peanuts.

65
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,430
You heard me when ordering.

66
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,350
You let the waiter
put peanuts in the salad, right?

67
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,960
Explain it.

68
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,360
You're crazy.

69
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,470
Youyou, what happened?

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,999
I came here
as soon as Mrs. Wang called me.

71
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Your arm is injured?

72
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,960
Don't worry.

73
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm OK.

74
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,680
But I heard you went
to the emergency room last night.

75
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,750
What happened?

76
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,590
I'm fine.

77
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,000
I had a peanut allergy

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,430
when eating out with Ning Yang.

79
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,839
I recovered after getting the treatment.

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
You must be careful.

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,630
Ning Yang is a trapped beast now.

82
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,910
I don't think it was him.

83
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,360
Ning Yang didn't do it?

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,310
Could it be Lin Meng?

85
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,280
She's such a dreadful person.

86
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,000
She injured me in the arm.

87
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,310
Youyou, I'm worried about you.

88
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,030
I'm OK.

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,470
No big deal.

90
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,470
Ning Yang would hurt me

91
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,750
in more horrible ways.

92
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,030
By the way,

93
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,190
I found a clue in the health center.

94
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:16,830
What is it?

95
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,240
I assume

96
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,270
the name "Lin Meng"

97
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,950
is just a pseudonym.

98
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,680
She could be

99
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,630
an impostor of the real Lin Meng.

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,560
Why do you think so?

101
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,600
The lady who paid the fees for Li Youyou

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,920
looked really familiar.

103
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,800
She looked like the patient in Room 3.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
Exactly. I think so, too.

105
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,800
Especially her facial expressions.

106
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,120
Though she wore sunglasses,

107
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,040
the way she signed
the signature was familiar.

108
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,700
And Lin Meng in Room 3
had the same condition

109
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,680
with Li Youyou.

110
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,390
Really?

111
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,390
You're saying another Lin Meng

112
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
is staying in the Mental Health Center?

113
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,160
Yes.

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,070
Could it be a coincidence?

115
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,830
I thought so, too.

116
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,040
But later, I peeked into Room 3.

117
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,310
A woman with a disfigured face

118
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,750
was in there.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,560
I couldn't tell how she looked before.

120
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,310
The nurse said Lin Meng paid the fees.

121
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,360
So, I got suspicious.

122
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,950
OK.

123
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,070
I'll investigate Lin Meng.

124
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,190
Stay with Mrs. Wang for now.

125
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
I can't come here often.

126
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,790
Otherwise, Ning Yang may suspect me.

127
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
I'll handle everything.

128
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,720
You take care.

129
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,310
Youyou will be safe here.

130
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,250
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

131
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,480
She's here.

132
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,600
Please take a look.

133
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,160
It's our facial care plan.

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,720
And this is our eye concentrate plan.

135
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,870
We have a special offer today.

136
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,480
Would you like to apply for membership?

137
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm here for a trial.

138
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,310
A friend of mine recommended you.

139
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Who is your friend?

140
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,390
Her last name is Lin.

141
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,630
You're Miss Lin's friend.

142
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,680
Sorry, I didn't know.

143
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,560
- It's OK.
- Miss Lin is a nice person.

144
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,270
The salon doesn't have a good location,

145
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,600
but we've been working here
for five or six years.

146
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,310
It's a long time.

147
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,830
Yes.

148
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,270
We only stopped doing business

149
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,920
when Miss Lin got sick.

150
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Now the salon is open twenty-four seven.

151
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,270
Did she get sick last winter?

152
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,070
Yes.

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,040
But Miss Lin's husband

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,160
gave us full pay

155
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,070
for the whole winter.

156
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,360
Miss Lin is married?

157
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,040
Yes.

158
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,390
Her husband is a well-known entrepreneur.

159
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,720
He's really wealthy.

160
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,560
I heard he's the general manager

161
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,310
of a listed group.

162
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,390
Is he Ning Yang from the Li's Group?

163
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,720
Yes. You know Mr. Ning?

164
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,680
How is it going?

165
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,070
Mr. Ning, there's a problem here.

166
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,390
So, I need to ask you something.

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,270
What is it about?

168
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,000
The 4th quarter of the year before last.

169
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,480
I can't find the reason why

170
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
we had the big-ticket expenditure.

171
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,720
Zhang said he didn't know, either.

172
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,830
I thought you may know it.

173
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,240
Zhang,

174
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,750
did you miss anything?

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,510
Go check again.

176
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
I will, Mr. Ning.

177
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,310
I've been generous to you.

178
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,560
Why did you trick me?

179
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,360
Mr. Ning, I didn't.

180
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,720
You said you'd pay it back soon.

181
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,310
And I asked you a few times.

182
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,390
But... But you never replied.

183
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,070
I have too much to do every day.

184
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,160
How could I remember the expenditure?

185
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,630
You asked Xu Xiaoxiao to get the money.

186
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,600
She said it was urgent.

187
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,510
Xu Xiaoxiao?

188
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,070
Why blame me for her mistake?

189
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,160
Go ask her!

190
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,510
I can't get hold of her.

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,510
Seems she has vanished.

192
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,720
Sorry, the subscriber
you dialed is power off.

193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,750
Hello.

194
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,750
Go find Xu Xiaoxiao.

195
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,950
She took my money.

196
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
OK. Got it.

197
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,790
Hide yourself from him.

198
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,910
I'll protect you.

199
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,000
Xiaoxiao, I...

200
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,080
If you reached me out earlier,

201
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,240
I might be able to help you out.

202
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,600
Go find a woman.

203
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,510
Her name is Xu Xiaoxiao.

204
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,200
I'll send you the address.

205
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,320
Excuse me.

206
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,750
I need to go to the ladies' room.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,550
OK.

208
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,240
Hello.

209
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
Xiaoxiao, where are you?

210
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,910
Run if you're at home.

211
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,720
Lin Meng sent someone to get you.

212
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm in the hotel lobby.

213
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,720
I didn't see her.

214
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,510
Xin Ran, I have an idea.

215
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,600
I could be the bait.

216
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,510
Maybe I could find out

217
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,120
how much Ning Yang trusts Lin Meng.

218
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
No, it could be dangerous.

219
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
It's OK. I'll share my location with you.

220
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,670
So, you'll see where I am.

221
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,150
No.

222
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,120
Hello.

223
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,200
I wanna check out,

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
and get the things I deposited.

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,200
The user you dialed does not respond.

226
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,440
(Xin Ran)

227
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:20,870
The user you dialed does not respond.

228
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
Witch.

229
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
Where did you

230
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,120
hide my money?

231
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,320
I helped you out

232
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,750
because I was being kind.

233
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,510
Why did you...?

234
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,600
Why did you play tricks

235
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
behind my back?

236
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,510
Why did you do it to me?

237
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:16,080
Why did you do it to me?

238
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,390
You'll get punished one day!
