00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,430
Xin Ran,

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,880
I am so impressed by you today.

32
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,990
You were amazing.

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:17,950
You know,

34
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,990
Li Youyou is a complete psycho.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,250
No one dares to mess with her.

36
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,910
Seriously?

37
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,390
I think she's just sensitive

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,400
and easy to get jealous.

39
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,230
No. Listen to me.

40
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,440
One day...

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,720
Morning, Miss Li.

42
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,550
You got here earlier, right?

43
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,180
Yes.

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,830
Mr. Ning had the meeting ahead of time.

45
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,070
How could I not know?

46
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,820
It's hard to get the snack you've got.

47
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,030
Yes. So, I got up very early.

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,680
Because...

49
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,700
Mr. Ning...

50
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,800
What did he say?

51
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,970
He said he wanna eat it when it's warm.

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,630
Keep it to yourself.

53
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,800
Li Youyou is a lunatic.

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,030
She is very harsh on everyone,

55
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,030
including Mr. Ning.

56
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,190
She hits him often

57
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,380
so he's always black and blue.

58
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,680
You know about his wounds?

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,670
I... I heard it from someone else.

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,910
Xin Ran,

61
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,470
what are you doing here?

62
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,940
I was looking for you.

63
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,260
Mr. Ning, what a small world!

64
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,690
You didn't get the coffee for me.

65
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,940
I had to do it in person.

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,030
Latte. Sugar free.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,190
I'll get it for you. Have a seat.

68
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,720
Mr. Ning, I'll go get the coffee first.

69
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,730
What do you mean?

70
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,090
It's on me. You're welcome.

71
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,590
Are you mad?

72
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,380
Or you got jealous?

73
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,870
Mr. Ning, don't cotton up with me.

74
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,410
You know what?

75
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,870
Pain is contagious.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,290
It kills me to see you like this.

77
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,570
Don't be.

78
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,000
Youyou will revenge on me.

79
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,040
I've heard she's a lunatic.

80
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,940
She won't.

81
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,730
You're my woman.

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,740
Mr. Ning, your coffee is here.

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,200
Thank you.

84
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,310
Enjoy the coffee.

85
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,280
I'll go back to work.

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,000
You don't love me anymore?

87
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,400
No.

88
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,040
You'll be my Venus forever.

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,360
Really?

90
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,360
Yes.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,460
(Someone hit your dad on purpose.
Ning Yang was behind it. He may hurt you.)

92
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,280
No. It's not true!

93
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,310
I don't believe it! I don't!

94
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,190
Who is it? Where are you?

95
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,210
Get out! Now!

96
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,200
I don't believe it! No!

97
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,600
Hello.

98
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,630
You didn't finish your job.

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,170
Don't ask me for money.

100
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,960
Find the Equity Transfer Agreement.

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,770
I'll give you one more million.

102
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,830
Otherwise,

103
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,750
there will be consequences.

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,000
Cut the crap.

105
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,560
Gotta go.

106
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,060
Look.

107
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,610
Who is here to despise me?

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,160
You committed a crime.

109
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,410
You should pay the price.

110
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,690
Ms. Wang.

111
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,560
Ms. Wang!

112
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,720
Miss Li.

113
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,490
Ms. Wang,

114
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,220
did you clean my dad's room

115
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,180
the other day?

116
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,780
I clean it every single day.

117
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,680
Are you about to disobey me?

118
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,360
You're not allowed to go in the room!

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,740
Something important is missing!
You can't afford the consequence!

120
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,290
Miss Li, I didn't take anything!

121
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,720
I've been working here for five years.

122
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,150
I never steal from you.

123
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,440
Otherwise, Mr. Li

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,030
would have fired me a long time ago.

125
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,710
But why are the documents missing?

126
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,190
If you didn't take it,

127
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,390
who else would do it?

128
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,320
Miss Li, it was not me!

129
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,230
I'm an illiteracy.

130
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,280
Why would I steal the documents?

131
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,000
Why?

132
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,550
Why?

133
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,910
Why you didn't do it?

134
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,870
Ms. Wang.

135
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,390
Ms. Wang.

136
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,840
Why you didn't do it?

137
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,080
How I wish it was you!

138
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,350
Then I wouldn't suspect him.

139
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,840
Miss Li, I remember something.

140
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,210
Before Mr. Li had the accident,

141
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,720
Mr. Ning was here.

142
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,000
They were talking in the study.

143
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,080
And the door was closed.

144
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,480
Stop.

145
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,700
I don't know anything else.

146
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,400
Stop.

147
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,480
Stop.

148
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,960
I told you to stop!

149
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,910
OK.

150
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,460
Get out.

151
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,630
Get out.

152
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,550
Get out! Vanish now!

153
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:04,690
Dad...

154
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,450
I should have listened to you.

155
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,570
I should never marry him.

156
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,860
What now?

157
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,300
I'm here with you.

158
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,000
Be patient.

159
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,530
I won't go anywhere.

160
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,650
I've had too much wine.

161
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,040
Now I can't remember how sexy you are.

162
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,950
