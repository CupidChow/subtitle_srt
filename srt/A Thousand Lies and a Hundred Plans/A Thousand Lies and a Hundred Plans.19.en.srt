00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
Why did you do it to me?

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,070
Why did you do it to me?

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,560
You'll get punished one day!

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,150
Yang,

34
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,240
you'll get punished one day.

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,000
you'll get punished one day.

36
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,400
Darn it!

37
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,840
You are messing with me?

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,230
You think she can scare me?

39
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,150
Good job!

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,680
Tell her to show up now!

41
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,280
I don't know what you're talking about.

42
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,840
I don't have the money.

43
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,910
If you wanna kill me,

44
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,000
just do it right here right now!

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,000
Otherwise, I would never

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
let you off the hook!

47
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,080
Seriously? Don't bluff.

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,840
It won't work.

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,190
Don't do it again.

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,430
It won't work.

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,400
Well.

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,960
How about this?

53
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
Just give me the money, OK?

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,310
Then I'll let you go.

55
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,520
Since you won't do it the easy way,

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,030
you'll have to do it the hard way.

57
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,960
It was her!

58
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,280
Lin Meng told me to do it.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,870
You know her?

60
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,560
She left a scar on my face.

61
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,870
She...

62
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,870
She wanted me to transfer
the money to her, I said no...

63
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,310
It's not true!

64
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,910
You're lying!

65
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,000
You cut her face?

66
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,590
No! She's lying!

67
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,360
I didn't do it.

68
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,910
Why are you nervous?

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,390
It's OK.

70
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,120
Just tell me the truth.

71
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,430
Did you leave the scar

72
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,040
on her face?

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,800
Why do you love

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
to make petty moves behind my back?

75
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,920
I've told you many times.

76
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,630
Mind your own business!

77
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,190
Why wouldn't you listen?

78
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,870
Why are you so stubborn?

79
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,430
Tell me why!

80
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,480
Are you deaf?

81
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,830
Transfer the money to my account.

82
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,190
And don't scare me by using her.

83
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,950
Or I'll send you back.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
No!

85
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,240
Don't do it!

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,870
Please! Don't do it!

87
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,360
You're begging me?

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,270
Do as I say.

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't leave me here!

90
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,680
You'll be safe.

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,040
She won't hurt you.

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,390
Hey!

93
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,920
Did you hear him?

94
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Let go of me!

95
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,750
I do pity you.

96
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
You're so pathetic!

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,390
How could you stand him
when he treats you like trash?

98
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,950
Are you brainless?

99
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,040
Shut up!

100
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,160
It's your fault!

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,920
It's all your fault!

102
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,630
You showed the scar
to Ning Yang on purpose?

103
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,000
Why is it the same as the old scar?

104
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,480
You wanna seduce Ning Yang

105
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,560
like she does?

106
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,480
Tell you what.

107
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,310
Ning Yang is mine.

108
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,870
All of you should get lost!

109
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,070
You're nuts.

110
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,430
What do you want?

111
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,270
Witch! What do you want?

112
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,430
You'll go to prison!

113
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,560
Stay away!

114
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,310
(Li Youyou mentioned another Lin Meng.
Could it be you?)

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,510
Hello, Youyou.

116
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,160
Did you go to bed?

117
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,270
Not yet.

118
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,070
I've found Xu Xiaoxiao.

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,430
I'll go meet her.

120
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,160
I remembered something.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,950
Ning Yang had a girlfriend

122
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,480
before he dated me.

123
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:30,630
Really?

124
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,160
Did you meet her?

125
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,190
I didn't.

126
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,600
I had a dream.

127
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,750
There was a girl in white dress.

128
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,240
She was with him.

129
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,040
Are you listening,

130
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,680
Xin Ran?

131
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
Yes, I am.

132
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,750
What wrong?

133
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,160
Nothing. Go to bed, OK?

134
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,390
I'll visit your dad tomorrow,

135
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,750
and let you know how he is.

136
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,120
OK.

137
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,100
It'll keep you warm.

138
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,120
Thank you.

139
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,150
You may catch a cold.

140
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,550
Here you are.

141
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,390
Thanks.

142
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm Xin Ran.

143
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:48,670
I'm Bai Lu.

144
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,840
Are you feeling cold?

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,630
Nope.

146
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,030
I'll do it myself.

147
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,240
It's pineapple.

148
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,600
Thank you, Xin Ran.

149
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,790
Wait.

150
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,750
Hold it for me.

151
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,790
I've got something for you.

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,750
Don't look.

153
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,510
Your jacket. Thank you.

154
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,360
You're welcome.

155
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,790
Let's go.

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,240
It's hot. Let's go.

157
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,200
Lu,

158
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll go to another city.

159
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,200
We won't see each other often.

160
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,030
It's OK.

161
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,550
We can write letters.

162
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
When we have a job and make money,

163
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,480
we can visit each other.

164
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,600
Remember to visit me.

165
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,600
OK.

166
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,440
Hello, Lu.

167
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,080
Hello, Xin Ran.

168
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,150
I'll tell you something.

169
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,150
I'm dating a guy.

170
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,030
Wow.

171
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,790
Really? I'm happy for you.

172
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,630
Send me your pictures.

173
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,480
I'll take him to see you
after we get serious.

174
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,750
Since you called me,
you're serious about him.

175
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,390
Hurry up.

176
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,550
Not really. Just be patient.

177
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,670
It's a deal.

178
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,630
I'll take him to see you
after we get serious.

179
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,150
Send me the pictures.

180
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
OK, I will.

181
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,720
I gotta go.

182
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
Xin Ran,

183
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,720
I've never done bad things.

184
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,600
Why did I get punished?

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,140
(Calling Bai Lu)

186
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,150
I just don't get it.

187
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,630
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

188
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,550
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

189
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,790
Lu,

190
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,720
I believe you're still alive.

191
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,000
A scumbag like Ning Yang is at large.

192
