30
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,560
Xu Xiaoxiao said she's pregnant.

31
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,200
It's a crucial moment.

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,680
We have to take care of her.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,710
Why do you look at me like that?

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,070
I won't do anything illegal for you.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,310
Will you betray me?

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,840
You should have more confidence in me.

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,760
The only thing I'm sure about

38
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,590
is that I've never

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,590
made a wrong decision before.

40
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,040
There are always false appearances

41
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,480
before I get to my destination.

42
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,150
Ning Yang, why did you do this to me?

43
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,080
What you said to me was all lies?

44
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
The subscriber you dialed is power off.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,470
Please dial it later.

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,000
You treated me like trash.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,960
(Voice Memos)

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,800

(All recordings)

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,520
for what I'm about to do.

51

(The recording is sent.)

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,750
(Li Youyou)

53
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,280
You're still young.

54
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,870
Take care. And you'll have babies.

55
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,310
But if you can't look after yourself,

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,840
you won't be able to get pregnant.

57
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:08,800
Get lost!

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,870
I know Li Youyou was behind it!

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,080
She killed my baby.

60
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
Li Youyou?

61
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,240
It was not her.

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,870
Please use your head.

63
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,800
Who doesn't want the baby?

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,120
No. No way.

65
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,390
I don't believe it.

66
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,070
How could he be so ruthless?

67
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,630
Well, fine.

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,340
(Calling Ning Yang)

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,310
The number you dialed does not exist.

70
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,240
Please check it.

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,100
(Calling Ning Yang)

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,920
Hello, honey.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Try it.

74
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,830
The number you dialed does not exist.

75
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,720
Please check it.

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,270
Ning Yang told me to investigate you.

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,870
But I didn't do it.

78
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,390
I thought we were the same

79
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,120
and we went through a hard time.

80
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,920
You know you're not happy.

81
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,680
Why didn't you leave him?

82
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,310
Because I needed money.

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,240
He gave me enough money
to support my family.

84
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,800
But you can make money by yourself.

85
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,190
Why did you ask him for it?

86
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,040
Listen.

87
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,360
By myself?

88
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,000
It's easier said than done.

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,390
You spent 100 grand

90
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,800
on Ning Yang's whereabouts.

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,480
And me?

92
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,430
I have to work my ass off

93
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,040
so that I can buy a coffee

94
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,390
in Starbucks.

95
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,950
I never spent

96
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,600
100 yuan on a piece of cake.

97
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,800
I couldn't afford it.

98
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,950
All my cakes were from Ning Yang.

99
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,920
It's OK.

100
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,630
Stop crying.

101
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,430
All gifts given by fate

102
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,040
have already been secretly priced.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,680
I hope you'll know better this time.

104
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,750
And I need a favor.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,190
Doctor, please save my wife!

106
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,240
Please!

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,390
Youyou,

108
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,480
hang in there.

109
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Please, hang in there!

110
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,510
I'm begging you, Youyou.

111
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,160
Thank you, doctor.

112
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,310
Doctor,

113
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,630
save her, please!

114
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,310
Doctor, please!

115
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,310
(In Operation)

116
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,040
(Li Youyou)

117
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,510
I hope you'll never get out from there.

118
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,150
What is he doing here?

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,030
No!

120
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,120
Xin Ran, anything wrong?

121
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,320
No. Go back to sleep.

122
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,630
I've paid for your treatment.

123
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:54,670
Remember.

124
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,120
Don't mention me to anyone.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
Especially Ning Yang.

126
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,480
Don't forget

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,550
what you promised.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Consider it done, Xin Ran.

129
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,320
Get some rest.

130
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Youyou, I can't live without you.

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
Please stay with me.

132
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,510
Hello, Mr. Ning.

133
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,150
Hello.

134
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,200
How is the old man?

135
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,790
Well,

136
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,150
he's in a coma.

137
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,960
But his figure moved a little

138
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:14,500
when Miss Li was in danger this morning.

139
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm not sure if...

140
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,680
It doesn't matter.

141
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:18,910
Listen.

142
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,670
Do you know that

143
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,840
he transferred his shares to Youyou

144
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,030
before the accident?

145
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:26,750
I...

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,870
You did nothing after I paid you?

147
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,390
Mr. Ning, I'm sorry.

148
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,600
I'll make up for my mistake.

149
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,510
You woke up.

150
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,670
So,

151
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,080
you're disappointed

152
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,270
to see I'm alive.

153
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,440
Li Youyou,

154
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,150
do you still believe

155
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,390
Ning Yang might love you?

156
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,790
What you should do is work with me

157
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:18,750
and get back all that belonged to you.

158
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,120
Only when he hits rock bottom...

159
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,960
Stop talking.

160
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,720
You won't get any chance

161
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,360
to steal him from me.

162
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,960
(Xin Ran, I appreciate what you've done.)

163
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,750
(But he changed because of me.)

164
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,910
(I should right my wrongs on my own.)

165
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,630
Li Youyou,

166
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
you couldn't protect your baby.

167
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
How could you protect yourself

168
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,630
if you didn't work with me?

169
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,440
