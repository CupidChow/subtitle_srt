You've got everything you want.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
I have no use for you.

32
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,920
What now?

33
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,590
Youyou,

34
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,760
how can you say that?

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,070
I love you so much.

36
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,960
You said you love me?

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,400
Do you love me?

38
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,430
Have you ever loved me?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,240
Stop pretending, Ning Yang.

40
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,030
I'm telling you,

41
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,910
the victory is not yours yet.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,630
Such a pity.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I was thinking of curing you,

44
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,470
but you turned me down.

45
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,000
I know,

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,560
you can never get away with

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,910
the sick gene in your blood.

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,190
You're the sick one.

49
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,840
You revenged on me

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,000
because you thought
my dad despised you.

51
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,190
Then what did you do to Bai Lu?

52
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,430
You discarded her and turned to me.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,910
You're a total monster!

54
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,630
Do you know about Bai Lu?

55
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,000
So all the obstacles

56
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,000
were made by you, my honey.

57
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,680
You knew about her!

58
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,430
Yet you were acting like a lamb.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,240
My hate is from being despised?

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,120
You underestimated it.

61
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,750
Do you know what it feels like

62
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,259
to be stepped down
like a piece of trash?

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,590
Why should I be a dog in your family?

64
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,910
No.

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,190
I'm lesser than a dog.

66
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,750
In that old man's eyes,

67
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,280
I was never his son-in-law,

68
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
I was just his watchdog!

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
I'm lesser than a dog.

70
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,280
How can he manipulate me

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,680
like I was a toy in his hands?

72
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,000
How can he trample on

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
my life and dignity?

74
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,100
He had never done such things

75
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,510
nor hurt anyone.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,600
You! You killed him!

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,190
He deserved to die!

78
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,830
It's a shame, though.

79
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,800
I didn't get the chance
to kill him myself.

80
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,510
Ning Yang,

81
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,270
at this point,

82
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,680
you're not willing to confess

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,270
all the filthy things you have done.

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,800
You don't deserve to be a man!

85
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,120
What did you do to me?

86
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,630
You drugged me?

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
What are you doing?

88
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,160
Stay away from me.

89
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,720
Stay away.

90
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,950
What are you doing?

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,950
What are you doing?

92
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,160
Honey,

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,950
you love me
taking pictures for you, right?

94
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,360
Look at the camera.

95
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,240
I said look at the camera!

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,830
Stay away from me.

97
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,390
Youyou.

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,390
Youyou.

99
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,600
Dad.

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,100
(One day ago)

101
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,480
Mr. Li, take some rest.

102
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,390
You have no time to hesitate.

103
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,480
Stop being so stubborn.

104
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,920
Will you clear your mind?

105
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:10,600
Can you just tell me
where is your uncle hiding?

106
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,750
I won't rat on you.

107
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,240
I don't know anything, Miss Li.

108
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,560
Please stop asking me.

109
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,240
We're both women with feelings,

110
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,600
I believe you have
a strong bond with your uncle.

111
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,920
You care for your uncle,

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,240
I care for my father as well.

113
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,870
Ever since the moment
I can't see my father again,

114
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,800
I took an oath.

115
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,390
I am going to find him,

116
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,240
I'm going to find out who harmed him.

117
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,920
So I'm begging you, please tell me.

118
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
Your uncle's testimony
means the world to me.

119
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,630
Alright.

120
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,530
Mrs. Wang.

121
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,350
Mrs. Wang, I'm so scared.

122
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,480
There, there.

123
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
It's alright now.

124
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,430
Everything's okay.

125
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,510
Ning Yang,

126
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,000
if you can turn yourself in
before the police arrive,

127
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,040
maybe you'll spend
a few years less behind the bars.

128
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,630
Turn myself in?

129
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,830
Why would I do that?

130
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,480
How hilarious!

131
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,550
You gathered so many people

132
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,840
just for performing a show for me.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,240
Guys,

134
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,270
do you have any evidence
to prove I committed crimes?

135
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,240
Save your words,

136
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,150
you can explain
however you want on the court.

137
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,750
Quit it.

138
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,510
Do you think
you claim you're witnesses,

139
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,550
so you can sue me?

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,510
How ridiculous!

141
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,030
Ridiculous?

142
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,790
Ning Yang,

143
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,270
do you still believe

144
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,720
me and my feelings are just a joke?

145
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,360
If you still believe in that,

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,600
you're the biggest joke in this world!

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,670
I'm not a joke!

148
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,150
I just don't understand

149
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,670
why do you all buy
the words of the foolish woman?

150
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,240
Xin Ran,

151
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,790
why you won't leave me alone?

152
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm just someone you met
on the way to your revenge.

153
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,030
Ning Yang,

154
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,080
never overestimate yourself,

155
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,510
you went too far.

156
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,750
I know that you don't trust anyone.

157
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,840
You're the one who's
playing with everyone's feelings.

158
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,390
You're the arrogant jerk

159
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,960
who has been trampling
others' feelings.

160
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,240
You have no right to say that!

161
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,390
Do you think you have no sins?

162
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,240
Li Youyou,

163
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,390
do you really think catching me

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,150
can make you safe?

165
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,150
You're wrong.

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,080
The one who destroyed
you and your father...

167
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,000
is her.

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,550
What are you doing?

169
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,750
You scumbag!

170
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,480
The things you've done to hurt me,

171
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,870
I'll pay them back worse!

172
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you talking about?

173
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,360
You're gibbering without evidence.

174
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:33,790
Come on!

175
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,630
I had their consent.

176
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,550
You know that?

177
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,550
You consented.

178
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,000
I wasn't breaking the law!

179
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,390
You monster!

180
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I wanted to give you another chance.

181
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,300
I didn't expect that
you would rob my property

182
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,960
and hurt so many girls.

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,670
Now you still won't confess.

184
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,200
You're such a shame!

185
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Shut up!

186
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,910
Old man,

187
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,960
do you know my life

188
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,000
was sabotaged by you?

189
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,240
Mr. Li didn't do or say

190
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,790
anything to insult you.

191
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,630
Mr. Li was planning

192
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,220
to offer you his company.

193
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,690
You can ask the lawyer,
Mr. Zhang about it,

194
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:19,270
whether you're in his will or not.

195
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,630
Non... nonsense.

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,670
You're still lying to trick me.

197
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,480
Ning Yang,

198
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,840
everyone will meet many unfair events

199
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,390
and disappointments in their life,

200
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,240
but they're not the excuse for you

201
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,630
to commit crimes.

202
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,360
Do you know what's your

203
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,960
biggest mistake?

204
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,270
Say it.

205
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,960
You underestimated
women's awakening and willpower.

206
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,550
Do you know why
I won't leave you alone?

207
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,840
Do you remember this girl?

208
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,960
Yeah?

209
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,120
Bai Lu.

210
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,670
She's my little sister.

211
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,440
Xin Ran.

212
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,550
She insists on meeting you in person.

213
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,120
Sure. Take a seat.
