30
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,310
Go back to the Mental Health Center.

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,120
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,920
I won't stalk you anymore.

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,150
Don't send me back there, please!

34
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,560
I'm begging you.

35
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,920
I'll give you a second chance.

36
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,480
Anything unusual with Li Youyou?

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,840
No.

38
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,760
The nurse keeps me updated every day.

39
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,230
I'll keep a close watch on her.

40
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,430
Excellent.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,590
Be a darling.

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,080
Do your job well.

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,470
And don't ask questions.

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,870
Control your emotions.

45
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,120
Got it?

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,240
In the future,

47
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,430
you will be my wife.

48
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,710
You know it, right?

49
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,680
You don't wanna go back

50
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,970
to the Mental Health Center
like Li Youyou did, do you?

51
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,840
No.

52
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,870
Be a doll.

53
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,360
Mr. Lin and Mr. Mu, thank you.

54
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:09,460
I've enjoyed working with you.

55
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,080
Cheers.

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,590
Hi, there.

57
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,560
You're celebrating.

58
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,590
But you should have invited me, right?

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,870
Hi, Mr. Ning.

60
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,800
Well, we're just...

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,120
We're discussing business.

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,590
Since Mr. Ning is here,

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,360
let's just talk turkey.

64
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,560
I'm all ears.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,750
I've bought Mu and Lin out.

66
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,080
Mr. Ning,

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,960
if you'll excuse us,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
we need to go now.

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,590
Have fun.

70
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,520
Be honest with me.

71
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,750
What's your next move?

72
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,080
You know I'm not interested in Xinyan.

73
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,280
All I want is money.

74
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,000
What's your plan?

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm thinking to buy you out.

76
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,680
And I'll give you shares at 50 times

77
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,310
of post-IPO leverage.

78
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,960
Well.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,240
It sounds like a great plan.

80
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,590
I was confident enough

81
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,150
to convince Lin and Mu.

82
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,590
Do you know why was that?

83
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,630
Because I don't need to be whipped

84
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,040
or kiss the ground.

85
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,270
Mr. Ning, you're a big picture thinker.

86
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,830
So, you're much more
open-minded than I am.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,120
Why would I believe you?

88
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,250
We'll sign a contract.

89
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,270
Good faith in contract law.

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,270
I don't believe you have enough cash.

91
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,680
Ask Lin and Mu if they got the money

92
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,560
before they left.

93
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,680
The greater you become as a person,

94
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,430
the more modest you become.

95
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,560
Xiaoxiao!

96
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,160
Xiaoxiao!

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,510
Xiaoxiao! It's Zhang Yi!

98
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,500
You got the wrong person.

99
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,360
I'm pretty sure you're Xiaoxiao.

100
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,070
Why did you suddenly cut me off?

101
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,120
You...

102
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,190
Xiaoxiao,

103
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,390
are you in trouble?

104
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,190
Xiaoxiao,

105
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:31,920
is there anything I can do?

106
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,680
I...

107
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,480
I can't put you in danger.

108
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,500
I don't deserve you.

109
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,920
Xiaoxiao...

110
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,830
If you reached me out earlier,

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I might be able to help you out.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,160
It's my proportion of shareholding.

113
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,870
Mr. Ning, what do you think?

114
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:57,680
I...

115
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,390
I think it's OK.

116
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,720
Since Xin Ran

117
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,600
is determined to be the chairman,

118
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,630
I'd love to help her.

119
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,560
What?

120
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,120
Ning Yang, what do you mean?

121
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,070
I mean

122
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,600
I will step down.

123
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,120
By the way,

124
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,310
I have one condition.

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,830
Xin Ran must

126
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,510
put the money into the company
within this month

127
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,950
according to the investment agreement.

128
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,750
You have my word.

129
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,310
I don't have other questions.

130
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,630
OK. Before I wire the money,

131
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,000
you need

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,920
to ask the Financial Department

133
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,720
to reconcile the accounts

134
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,920
with the Audit Department.

135
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
OK. Zhang from the Financial Department
will do it.

136
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,650
Miss Lin, what can I do for you?

137
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,920
How did you brainwash Ning Yang?

138
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,870
You witch!

139
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,190
I forgot to tell you

140
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,870
that Mr. Ning began to favor me

141
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,310
after I slapped him.

142
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
Xin Ran,

143
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,390
how shameless you are!

144
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,600
I have a suggestion for you.

145
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,000
If you want to steal a man's heart,

146
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,800
you should conquer him.

147
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,070
Or he will be bored.

148
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,680
By the way,

149
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,390
Mr. Ning invites me to V Restaurant

150
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,270
to eat fresh oysters tonight.

151
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,350
It's a block booking.

152
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,070
You can join us if you want.

153
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,630
Seize the opportunity.

154
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,920
Cheers for our cooperation.

155
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,430
To be frank,

156
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,430
I think

157
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,560
you're like

158
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
a vicious viper.

159
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,750
I don't know if I can trust you.

160
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,190
The viper doesn't want you.

161
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,270
I only want your money.

162
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm a lucky guy.

163
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,000
I always have a good eye.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,480
No, you don't.

165
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,510
What do you mean?

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,720
You don't have a taste for women.

167
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,120
It's your Achilles' heel.

168
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,240
How about this?

169
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,310
I'll ask for your advice

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,899
before I make a decision next time.

171
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,480
I'll charge you as your consultant.

172
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,680
You're a mysterious woman.

173
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,750
I can't see you through.

174
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,240
Well,

175
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,390
you can ask me.

176
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,430
OK.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,680
No. one,

178
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,360
how are you related to Mr. Li?

179
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,150
No. two,

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,510
why do you approach me?

181
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,510
Why do you think Mr. Li

182
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,120
would transfer his shares

183
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,750
to an outsider like me?

184
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,960
You wanna be

185
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,720
Li Youyou's stepmother?

186
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,670
I'm not old enough to do that.

187
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:58,630
OK.

188
00:08:59,150 --> 00:08:59,870
My second question:

189
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,720
why do you approach me?

190
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,360
I have voracious appetite

191
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,150
for money and something else.

192
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,150
Come over here.

193
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,000
You really love

194
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,480
to flirt with women.

195
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,030
I only flirt with you.

196
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,750
OK.

197
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,600
You've got your answers.
Now it's my turn.

198
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,200
You never told me you had questions.

199
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,080
Reciprocity and mutual benefit, right?

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,630
You married Li Youyou for her money?

201
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,600
You've been with me

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,960
for quite a long time.

203
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,320
You shouldn't ask me about it.

204
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,200
How could you be so heartless?

205
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,960
There must be a reason

206
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,720
why a heartful man

207
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,600
becomes heartless.

208
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,960
Why is that?

209
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,750
It doesn't matter.

210
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
What really matters is

211
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,510
we should celebrate together.

212
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,320
Forget the bad memories.

213
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,440
Let's just

214
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
relish the moment.

215
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,120
Toast to the moment.

216
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,750
I'll start eating.

217
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,480
What's wrong?

218
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:54,960
What's wrong?

219
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,670
(Ning Yang,)

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,670
(you wanna kill me after killing her.)

221
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,480
(You will get punished!)

222
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,750
Help!

223
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:04,720
Help!

224
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,240
Hello.

225
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240
