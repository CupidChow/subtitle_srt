=Episode 16=

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,390
Mr. Ning, here is the thing.

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,990
It was an unexpected incident.

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,400
So, we want to discuss it with you.

33
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,280
What's wrong?

34
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,570
Well, it's about

35
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,000
your dancing video.

36
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,230
Our investors saw that.

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,600
They suggested you should

38
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,520
take a vacation now.

39
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,840
What did you mean?

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,090
Mr. Ning, calm down.

41
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,200
Right now,

42
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,280
the public opinion is against us.

43
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,340
We don't have other options.

44
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,430
The spoof video of Mr. Ning

45
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,900
has been deleted on the Internet.

46
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,350
We should pull together

47
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,430
at this crucial moment.

48
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,560
I don't understand

49
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,200
why we're pointing fingers at Mr. Ning.

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,070
The new salon will open tomorrow.

51
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,010
There will be an interview.

52
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,640
Mr. Ning will explain everything.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,100
Please rest assured.

54
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,170
OK.

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,250
We'll wait for the explanation.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
I didn't know Ning Yang is so nasty.

57
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,429
My goddaughter, Youyou,

58
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,920
insisted on marrying him.

59
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,510
Cats hide their claws.

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,520
And men are masters of disguise.

61
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,180
I'm worried about how Youyou is doing.

62
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,290
Will she be in danger?

63
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,770
Youyou is a smart girl.

64
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,220
She'll be fine.

65
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,470
Don't worry, please.

66
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,880
What do you need me to do next?

67
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,240
I really need to ask you a favor.

68
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,289
I will pay you a visit

69
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,300
after I confirm something.

70
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,480
No problem. Call me.

71
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you, Mrs. Wang.

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,240
Mrs. Wang, I'll be right back.

73
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,920
Xiaoxiao!

74
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:02,610
Xu Xiaoxiao!

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,330
Why did you run away?

76
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,170
Who did it?

77
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,400
Was it Ning Yang?

78
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,190
Just tell me.

79
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,900
I'll get back at him.

80
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,280
It was not Ning Yang.

81
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm sorry.

82
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,110
The other night,

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,970
a woman showed up.

84
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,440
Excuse me.

85
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,630
Do I know you?

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,409
I think you're a streetwalker, right?

87
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,700
Watch your mouth!

88
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,320
Did I offend you?

89
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,840
Do I know you?

90
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,120
Offending me?

91
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,960
You're not capable enough.

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,719
Step aside. Or I'll call the cops.

93
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Go head.

94
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:00,200
Will the cops believe a streetwalker

95
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,240
or a decent lady like me?

96
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,110
Who are you?

97
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,740
What do you want?

98
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,620
I want to...

99
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,160
You're trash to me!

100
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,960
You don't deserve his love!

101
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,840
Watch your back!

102
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,730
Don't you ever steal him from me!

103
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,030
Xin Ran,

104
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,680
the woman was a monster.

105
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,370
She's way more horrible than Ning Yang.

106
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,950
Be careful with her.

107
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,670
No.

108
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,390
Ning Yang is the chief culprit.

109
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,800
Lin Meng

110
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,440
is just his puppet.

111
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,010
No.

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,420
No.

113
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,620
Xiaoxiao.

114
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,900
Xiaoxiao, don't worry.

115
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,970
I'll revenge for you.

116
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,190
Please remember

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,250
you said you'll help me.

118
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,970
Xin Ran, I'm so scared.

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,340
I don't know what to do.

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,560
Don't be afraid, OK?

121
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,650
Trust me.

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,360
Evil is always rewarded with evil.

123
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,030
We just have to be patient.

124
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,820
If we unite together,

125
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,160
we can make it.

126
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,500
But I don't have a plan.

127
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,320
What could I do?

128
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,300
Do you trust me?

129
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,150
Yes, I do.

130
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,040
The woman is so ruthless.

131
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,330
How could she cut her face?

132
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,760
However, Xin Ran,

133
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,290
I don't understand.

134
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,349
You covered the scar for Xiaoxiao.

135
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,300
Why did you make a fake one?

136
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,840
I'm sure about one thing.

137
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,730
Lin Meng loves Ning Yang in a crazy way.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,220
The more obsessed she is,

139
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,350
the faster will she show her flaw.

140
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,950
But Ning Yang should be the one

141
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,950
who discovers where the flaw is.

142
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,670
Did you mean...?

143
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,320
I think

144
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,060
she should love him more crazily.

(Xinyan's 15th Salon)
(Grand Opening)

146
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,610
(Xinyan Beauty Salon)

147
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,569
Mr. Ning!

148
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,400
Do you have any comments

149
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:00,640
on the indecent video of yourself?

150
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,990
You've seen the video, right?

151
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,480
I'll tell you

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,360
it was a well-planned incident.

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,680
Can you elaborate a little?

154
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,730
I'm so happy today.

155
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,330
Xinyan's 15th salon

156
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,130
opens on the beautiful day.

157
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,040
Our target customers

158
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,200
are males.

159
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,850
Especially those who often

160
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,730
socialize with clients and drink a lot.

161
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,849
Are you saying

162
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,649
it was you who planned everything?

163
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,730
But why did you
delete the video urgently?

164
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,960
It's a good question.

165
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,160
If we didn't delete it,

166
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,650
would you still come here together?

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,790
If you'll excuse me,

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,720
I need to go now.

169
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,259
Mr. Ning, do you think the plan...?

170
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,979
Excuse me.

171
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,389
Mr. Ning, more details, please.

172
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,289
Mr. Ning! Mr. Ning!

173
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,680
Please take our interview.

174
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,700
Thank you

175
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,530
for your good job.

(Xin Ran)

177
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,690
Listen.

178
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,400
Get off in a few minutes.

179
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,800
I'm in the middle of something.

180
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,110
Won't you stay with me?

181
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,340
You won't?

182
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,300
I'm in the middle of something.

183
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,350
Really?

184
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,340
You wanna make up with me
after losing the game?

185
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,350
You don't know who will win.

186
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,089
You're challenging me.

187
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,720
Fine.

188
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,450
There will be consequences.

189
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,960
You're such a pig,

190
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,070
always being rude.

191
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,490
Why are you here?

192
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,990
You stalked me?

193
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,160
Why are you being with her?

194
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,200
It's none of your business.

195
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,100
Listen carefully.

196
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,699
Don't be a control freak.

197
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,779
Mr. Ning, if you're busy,

198
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,890
let's take a rain check.

199
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,660
I'll be patient.

200
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,560
Ning Yang...

201
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,390
Let go of me!

202
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,470
Why?

203
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,969
Why do you still want

204
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,409
to fool around with that witch?

205
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,700
I've told you many times.

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,190
Don't ask too many questions.

207
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,750
But I want to know why!

208
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,600
Calm down.

209
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,270
Calm down.

210
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,910
Xin Ran is a tough woman.

211
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,560
She even captured Mr. Li's heart.

212
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,010
You think she asked me out

213
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,210
to seduce me?

214
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,680
Use your head!

215
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,810
I broke with her!
Why did I meet her again?

216
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,550
Who is the fool, you or me?

217
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,170
But...

218
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,659
I'm just worried about you.

219
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,689
I've told you many times.

220
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,990
No more questions!

221
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,640
Fine.

222
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,090
You still can't control your emotions.

223
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
Go back to the Mental Health Center.
