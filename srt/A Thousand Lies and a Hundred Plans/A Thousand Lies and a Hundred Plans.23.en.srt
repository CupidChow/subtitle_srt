=Episode 23=

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,150
Miss Li,

31
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,870
you're in a perfect shape.

32
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,280
You look stunning

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,710
in every dress we have.

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,949
It's common for a bride

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,150
to feel nervous before the wedding.

36
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,590
(I wasn't going to)

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,920
(ask you about it.)

38
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
(It's just women's affairs,)

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,560
(you don't know if it's true.)

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,390
Find somewhere to relax.

41
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:29,790
(But...)

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,000
(it goes so far,)

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,640
Stop.

44
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,200
(I hope you can think twice.)

45
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,950
Stop it.

46
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,590
(Youyou.)

47
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,640
(Ning Yang is a jerk.)

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,280
Stop it.

49
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,599
(You'll be dead if you stay with him.)

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,150
Stop it.

51
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,040
(He's very dangerous.)

52
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,920
Stop.

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,050
(You must keep your mind clear.)

54
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:42,200
I told you to stop!

55
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,040
Stop!

56
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,590
I told you to stop!

57
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Mr. Ning, I didn't do anything.

58
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,349
Please leave us alone.

59
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:49,950
Okay.

60
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,590
It's alright.

61
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,790
Deep breath.

62
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,230
Yang,

63
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,430
can I still trust you?

64
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,310
Of course, you can trust me.

65
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,360
It's okay.

66
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,430
How about this?

67
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's go home. Have some rest.

68
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,150
Take a good sleep.

69
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,710
We'll try the wedding dress

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
on another day.

71
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,000
Yeah.

72
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,310
Let's go home.

73
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,280
Okay?

74
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,870
No more tears.

75
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,120
Good girl.

76
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,240
Then...

77
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,590
go change the dress.

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,710
There's one thing I want to know.

79
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,840
Who are you exactly?

80
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,840
Hello?

81
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,360
How's everything going?

82
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,750
Don't worry.

83
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,030
I have given it to Xin Ran.

84
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,710
That's my best offer.

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,800
I will say no more,

86
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,680
if you're still in doubt.

87
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,190
The coffee is turning cold,

88
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,470
I don't have your answer yet.

89
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,870
It's just a name.

90
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,520
Do you really want to know?

91
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,560
It means more than just a name to me.

92
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,560
Fine.

93
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,150
Since you insisted.

94
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,000
Mr. Ning,
you're very caring to your wife.

95
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,920
Clean her body so carefully every day.

96
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,000
Thank you.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,800
(Women's Restroom)

98
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:37,680
Miss,

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,830
wake up.

100
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,270
Wake up.

101
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,160
Doctors!

102
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,750
I need doctors!

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,750
Thank you for saving my life.

104
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,630
It's the doctor's credit.

105
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,510
The lady in the ward, is she your wife?

106
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:11,680
No.

107
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,040
Then is she your sister?

108
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,000
It's none of your business.

109
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,560
(Room Three)

110
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,950
Lu.

111
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm so sorry.

113
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
From tomorrow on,

114
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,160
I can't be with you anymore.

115
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,510
You saved me, I want to repay you.

116
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,830
I'll do anything you ask.

117
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,560
Take me away with you.

118
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,999
She suffered
domestic violence since young.

119
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,830
Therefore,

120
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,950
she's diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

121
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,510
She has severe insecurity and distrust

122
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,600
to the surroundings.

123
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,950
She mistakenly treats you
as her life-savor,

124
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,630
and has an emotional attachment to you.

125
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,630
She believes
you're the only one who can save her.

126
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,270
Okay, I understand.

127
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,510
He was right.

128
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,480
You should be grateful
to the doctor, not him.

129
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,720
It doesn't matter now.

130
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,240
He saved your life,

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,750
so you became his lover in the shadow

132
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,560
for so many years.

133
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,390
If you ever felt...

134
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,600
how desperate I was
for being abandoned,

135
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,070
then you'll know.

136
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:55,510
It really doesn't matter.

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,510
He's leaving you behind now.

138
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,870
No.

139
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,680
I'm leaving him behind.

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll be leaving for the suburb

141
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,480
to spend the weekend with Ning Yang.

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,070
I'll give you an address later,

143
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,000
it's a beauty salon I own.

144
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,240
Go find someone called Mei,

145
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,000
she'll tell you the truth of

146
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,630
Li Youyou's father's car accident.

147
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,630
Stop.

148
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,000
Stop.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
Stop!

150
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,430
Stop it.

151
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,430
Stop it.

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,720
Stop it!

153
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,310
I said stop it!

154
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,000
Hello?

155
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,480
Hello, Youyou.

156
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,360
Can we talk?

157
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,070
Please stop calling me.

158
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,920
Let go of me and Ning Yang.

159
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,160
I don't know anything.

160
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,920
Don't you care about your father?

161
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,040
My father?

162
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,630
He has my father, I can't do anything.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,630
Ning Yang is not
controlling your father.

164
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,000
What did you say?

165
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,440
You should be grateful
to the doctor, not him.

166
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,550
He saved your life,

167
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,670
so you became his lover in the shadow

168
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,600
for so many years.

169
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,440
She believed in everything you said?

170
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,270
Once there's empathy in a woman,

171
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,240
it's easy to turn
an enemy into a friend.

172
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,910
What a shame!

173
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,320
I overestimated her.

174
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,150
A foolish woman.

175
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,960
But...

176
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,480
I still didn't find out the reason

177
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,390
she determines to destroy you.

178
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
It's easy.

179
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,440
She's just

180
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,790
being competitive.

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,870
Her final goal

182
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:20,870
is money.

183
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,200
None of these matters, though.

184
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,120
What really matters is that
if she gives you the money,

185
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,150
it proves my assumption right.

186
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,030
The old man did transfer

187
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,960
the money to Xin Ran.

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,910
Where did you ask her to meet up?

189
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,080
In Mr. Li's villa.

190
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,670
Xin Ran.

191
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,910
Are you in there?

192
