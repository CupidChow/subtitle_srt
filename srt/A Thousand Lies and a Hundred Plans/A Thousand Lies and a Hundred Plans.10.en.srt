Are you listening?

86
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
I can't hear you now.

Hello, are you listening?

Hello.

91
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,710
I tried the passwords

92
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,870
of the bank card many times.

93
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,070
Then the ATM swallowed the card.

94
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,480
Why did you use that card?

95
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,240
Let me know if you need money.

96
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,120
Got it?

97
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,830
It's hard to get a retained card back.

98
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,920
I just wanted to check the balance.

101

You owe them money?

107
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,070
What are you saying?

108
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,360
It's impossible.

109

I don't want your dad to see me
as a poor rural boy.

113
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,120
My dad won't do it.

114

115
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Enjoy it.

Doctor, how is my wife?

182
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,480
It was hormonal imbalance

183
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
that caused mood swings and faint.

184
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,320
She'll be OK after getting some rest.

185
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,320
No big deal.

Thank you, doctor.

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,630
There's one thing you need to know.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,030
As I told her earlier,

190
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,510
she can't take any psychotropic drugs,

191
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,750
which will be bad for the fetus.

192
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,510
OK. I'll be more careful.

00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,240
The world is peaceful when you sleep.

194
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,080
How I wish you could

195
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,910
always sleep sound like this.

196
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,750
He left.

197
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,360
Do you

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
have any plans?

199
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,630
I was the other woman.

200
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,510
My younger sister is missing.

201
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll make him pay the price.

202
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,960
I can't watch you become another victim.

203
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,630
Will you work with me

204
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,440
and reveal who he really is?

205
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,790
I like the smell of you.

206
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,630
It makes me feel at ease.

207
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,030
You're here to explain yourself?

208
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
I'm here to protect you.

209
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,030
You are doing a lousy job.

210
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,910
Li Youyou is a lunatic.

211
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,440
Xu Xiaoxiao is no pushover.

212
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,790
I'll never allow my beloved woman

213
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,080
to be embarrassed by the lunatics.

214
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,270
All right.

215
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,510
Honey, don't be mad.

216
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,480
I can control my anger.

217
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,270
I don't need another baby

218
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,600
at the moment.

219
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,480
You're not happy about it?

220
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,240
I should congratulate you.
