1
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:56,416
Morning.

2
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:39,333
How come you always wake
up just before my alarm goes off?

3
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,041
I'm your real alarm clock.

4
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:58,000
Can you take the morning off?

5
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,083
No… I have a meeting this
morning that I can't miss.

6
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,458
Come on, get up.

7
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,875
We have our trip next week anyway.

8
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:12,458
What?

9
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,958
We are going to Kenting.

10
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,666
Next... next week?

11
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,791
Didn't we talk about going
to Kenting next week?

12
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:24,541
Shit... shit...

13
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,250
Oh... I was gonna talk
to you about that today.

14
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,000
Barry wants me to help on a shoot.

15
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,333
When?

16
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:38,833
Next week.

17
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,041
They don’t know the date
yet. It depends on the weather.

18
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:50,041
Hey, it's a German ad agency

19
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,416
...and the money’s pretty good.

20
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:58,916
It wasn't easy for me to book the week off.

21
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:02,000
You know I only get 10
vacation days a year, right?

22
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,958
I'm sorry...

23
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,541
I just... kind of need this job.

24
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,250
I haven't been getting many
work opportunities these days.

25
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:18,833
When was the last time
we had a trip together?

26
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,500
I want to relax in the fresh
air... I want to get a tan.

27
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:27,166
Get a tan? ...The roof!
you can go to the roof!

28
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:50,583
Kat, I'm sorry.

29
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,833
I'm an idiot.

30
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,000
My client base is tiny, I
have to take what I can get.

31
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:01,500
I’ll talk to Barry and work it out, ok?

32
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,750
Do you wanna take the baozi
from last night for your lunch?

33
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,458
You can have it.

34
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,708
Thanks, babe.

35
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,833
Doctor, I really need to understand...

36
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,291
...and I'm sure I'm speaking
for everyone listening as well...

37
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,125
Why do you and the rest
of the medical community

38
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,333
continue to promote
fear of the Alvin virus.

39
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,166
OK, so the situation is like this:

40
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:16,333
Most the people believe
that the Alvin virus...

41
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,541
is no more serious than
a mild case of the flu.

42
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:19,000
Right.

43
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,375
...But experts are terrified of
the mutation potential of Alvin

44
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,416
for a very simple reason. Let me show you.

45
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:30,958
Take a look.

46
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,291
There are dormant protein chains in Alvin

47
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:37,625
that are very clearly from
the lyssa order of viruses.

48
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,125
That’s the same order
that rabies is a part of.

49
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:41,625
Doctor...

50
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,166
I...

51
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:42,833
Doctor!

52
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:43,791
I'm worried that maybe one day...

53
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,083
Doctor! Let me speak!

54
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,041
No!

55
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:46,875
I'm concerned...

56
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,000
You said that already!

57
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,708
And I've heard it.

58
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:54,000
There have been zero deaths,
so why the scare tactics?

59
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,916
And I find it very convenient that
Alvin just happened to show-up

60
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:01,000
during an election year.

61
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,416
I'll emphasize this again

62
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,333
Our society must take
this outbreak seriously.

63
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,083
To politicize a virus
is a terrible mistake!

64
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,333
Alvin continues to be a very
real threat to public health...

65
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:15,125
And it doesn't care who the president is.

66
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,291
Hey!

67
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,166
Are you alright?

68
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,916
You ready?

69
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,166
Did you see that?

70
00:07:58,583 --> 00:07:59,458
What?

71
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:02,541
Can't you put trash in the bin?

72
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,375
Hey, Jim. Good morning!

73
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:15,458
Good morning. Mr. Lin.

74
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,166
Hey, are you alright?

75
00:08:24,791 --> 00:08:25,625
Huh?

76
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,708
What's wrong? This is just a cold.

77
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,458
You should go to the hospital.

78
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:36,708
Hospital? Nah, I’m done
with waiting in hospitals.

79
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,958
Besides, doctors always say the same thing:

80
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,541
"Stay home, get some rest."

81
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,625
That's not a hard thing to say...

82
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,166
I could probably be a doctor.

83
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,166
And all that stuff on the news...

84
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:56,500
...the pandemic, the virus... it's a hoax.

85
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,916
All those low-lives that
own the media companies...

86
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,708
are blowing this out of proportion
to drive down stock prices.

87
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,833
...So they can buy low, and sell
high when the economy bounces back.

88
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,083
Is that true?

89
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,458
Sure is. Wanna bet?

90
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,083
Well... That’s what I
would do if I had the money.

91
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,541
Anyways, I have too
much of this Thai basil.

92
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,083
I’ll give you some later.

93
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,791
That's great. Thanks, Mr. Lin.

94
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,875
Don’t mention it.

95
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,291
Kat, what time is it?

96
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,458
Almost 8:30.

97
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:47,708
Mr. Lin.

98
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:50,791
Bye.

99
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,208
Bye bye.

100
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,333
Bye bye.

101
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm sorry you had to see that.

102
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,583
I shouldn't have slowed down.

103
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,166
Sorry.

104
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,791
It's alright.

105
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,541
I'll make dinner tonight, ok?

106
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,458
Yay! What are you making?

107
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:02,875
Dunno yet. ...Something with Thai basil.

108
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,083
I promise you'll love it.

109
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,208
Cool

110
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,291
See you later.

111
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,041
What would you like to have?

112
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:01,750
Hmm...

113
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:05,958
I want... an egg roll with fried pork

114
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:06,791
Got it.

115
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:07,375
OK.

116
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,541
And a large cup of milk tea.

117
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,125
So, pork egg roll, and
a large milk tea, right?

118
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:12,458
Right.

119
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:13,750
For here or to go?

120
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,250
For here.

121
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:14,916
OK.

122
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:15,958
Thanks.

123
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:17,458
Hey, good morning.

124
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,208
Good morning.

125
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,458
You want the usual?

126
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,458
No, I just ate...

127
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,583
I’m just gonna have a medium black coffee

128
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:25,250
To go.

129
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:25,958
Thanks.

130
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,375
You got it. I just need
to fill this lady’s order.

131
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:28,833
OK

132
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,750
(Valued apartments
recommended in Taipei City)

133
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:11,583
The pandemic is affecting
the real estate market...

134
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,916
Properties are cheaper
than they were last year.

135
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,416
Granny.

136
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,208
Are you alright?

137
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,000
Handsome boy!

138
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,041
That bitch came outta nowhere!

139
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,375
Civil Emergency.

140
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,791
Stay tuned for urgent information.

141
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,958
Good morning everyone.

142
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,416
Pay attention to the following message.

143
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,833
There are some new rules for everyone.

144
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,708
All men must report to the district office.

145
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,708
I'll cut all your dicks off
and feed them to stray dogs.

146
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:30,166
And for the ladies...

147
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,458
They'll be fucked by dogs in the street.

148
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,625
Is that clear? This is your new life...

149
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,000
"Baby, are you alright?"

150
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,000
”Where are you right now?"

151
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,333
“People are going
crazy. Hurting each other.”

152
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:12,583
"Don’t come back here... I’ll go to you."

153
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,666
Mr. Lin?

154
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,708
What the fuck?

155
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,916
Hi neighbor!

156
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,583
Nice morning isn't it?

157
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,458
Don't worry...

158
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,583
about your girl...

159
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,958
I'll finger her for you.

160
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,333
Good morning

161
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,208
Good morning

162
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,458
What are you reading?

163
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,333
Just... just a novel.

164
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:48,833
I can see that you're focused on that.

165
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:54,208
No one reads books on the train anymore

166
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:57,833
They all focus on their phones.

167
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:58,958
Yeah...

168
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:00,416
True.

169
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,083
What’s it about?

170
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:12,541
Sir, I appreciate you trying to be friendly

171
00:24:12,583 --> 00:24:15,583
but I really just want to
focus on my book right now.

172
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,583
Sure... sure... of course...

173
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,083
You would like to
focus on reading. I get it.

174
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:38,166
Hey...

175
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,291
I actually see you on
the train pretty often...

176
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,458
So...

177
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,916
I thought that today...

178
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:56,708
I'd... Finally tell you.

179
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,291
That...

180
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:03,458
I think you are... really beautiful.

181
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,083
Thanks.

182
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:25,916
Hey, where do you work?

183
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,666
Are you finished?

184
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:32,291
I already asked you to leave me alone.

185
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,583
Do you want me to charge
you with sexual harassment?

186
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:40,833
I'm going to bring this to
police if you don't shut up.

187
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:55,708
What's wrong with people nowadays?

188
00:25:57,083 --> 00:26:01,458
Having a conversation on
the train, is this a crime now?

189
00:26:05,708 --> 00:26:08,833
I'm only trying to
communicate, to be social

190
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,708
and now I'm accused for sexual harassment?

191
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:23,458
I was polite too!

192
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,125
And I gave compliments!

193
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,916
Sexual harassment?

194
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:31,500
Women these days are all the same.

195
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,125
Thinking they can be rude
just because they're pretty.

196
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,541
What has happened to this country?

197
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:40,333
I deserve better than this.

198
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,291
Please take my seat.

199
00:26:54,291 --> 00:26:55,041
Thank you.

200
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,083
What’s happening?

201
00:29:33,916 --> 00:29:36,916
Did I break the record?
Did I break the record?

202
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:46,458
Why? Why is he doing this?

203
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:49,958
It's over now. They caught him.

204
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,125
It's over.

205
00:30:57,583 --> 00:31:00,833
Shut up, you filthy cunt!

206
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,041
"Jim: Don't come back. I'll go to you."

207
00:33:57,708 --> 00:33:59,208
I feel...

208
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,291
I can’t breathe.

209
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,458
You should go, leave me.

210
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,541
No!

211
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,583
We can't stop here! Definitely not!

212
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,083
It's alright.

213
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,958
What’s your name?

214
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,416
I'm Molly.

215
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,541
Molly... I’m Kat.

216
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:26,333
Listen to me

217
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:30,041
We are very close to the
exit. Let's keep moving.

218
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:32,125
Once we're out. We’ll be at the hospital.

219
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:34,625
We can get your eye taken care of.

220
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,333
Let's go!

221
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:38,791
Hey, lady!

222
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:41,958
Where are you running to?

223
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,750
There you are.

224
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:05,541
Oh, there is another dirty slut.

225
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,416
Stand up!

226
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,791
Wasn't that the fat cunt
on the train? Wait for me!

227
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,125
What the fuck?

228
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:37,583
Are you blind?

229
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:42,791
Oh shit!

230
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,458
You ARE blind!

231
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:46,166
What happened to her?

232
00:35:46,458 --> 00:35:47,041
Help us!

233
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:47,625
What?

234
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:48,250
Help us!

235
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:48,875
What do you mean?

236
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:50,125
What ?

237
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,916
He wants to kill us! Please help us!

238
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:52,791
Who?

239
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:53,458
Help us!

240
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,583
Hey motherfucker! Did you hurt these women?

241
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,333
Let's see how tough you
are with me, old bastard!

242
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:18,916
Motherfucker!

243
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:13,458
Fuck!

244
00:37:18,958 --> 00:37:21,416
Molly please... stand up!

245
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,958
Don't give up!

246
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,166
Hey!

247
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:32,041
Help us!

248
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:33,750
Hey!

249
00:37:34,458 --> 00:37:35,666
Help us!

250
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,666
I‘ve never had a threesome before!

251
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:41,666
Go!

252
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:50,541
Go!

253
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:53,041
I haven't been this hard in years...

254
00:37:54,541 --> 00:37:56,750
You girls are real hot sluts!

255
00:38:16,458 --> 00:38:17,708
What the fuck is wrong with you?

256
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:19,708
Can’t you see this woman is hurt?

257
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,666
Why didn’t you help us?

258
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,833
What's wrong with her? Is she crazy too?

259
00:38:31,166 --> 00:38:32,166
Which way to the hospital?

260
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:36,583
The police told me to close the exit.

261
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,583
I saw you two, but I didn’t know...

262
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,458
I... I thought you were
crazy like the other ones.

263
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,041
Alright ! Alright!

264
00:38:42,083 --> 00:38:43,708
Which way to the hospital?

265
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:46,625
Are you ok?

266
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,083
Can you walk?

267
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,166
I can.

268
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,041
I'll see you later

269
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,166
Let's go!

270
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,125
I don't know who's out there right now.

271
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:43,791
But if anyone is listening to this

272
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:47,083
It seems like there's a real,
life-threatening crisis happening.

273
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,750
All I know right now is what I'm
seeing from my online contacts...

274
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,375
The city is experiencing
an outbreak of civil unrest.

275
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:58,625
whether it be some kind
of organized terrorist attack

276
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,375
or some sort of hallucinatory
drugs in the air or in the water...

277
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,750
or...or whatever.

278
00:40:09,916 --> 00:40:12,333
There are hostile people in
the streets... all over the place...

279
00:40:13,166 --> 00:40:16,750
and they seems to be going
on a homicidal rampage.

280
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,875
I don't know how the cops
are dealing with this shit.

281
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,208
I just hope...

282
00:40:21,458 --> 00:40:22,625
...it's with their guns.

283
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,791
and this is the really fucked up part...

284
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:27,875
Furthermore...

285
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,958
There has been many reports
of sexual violence as well...

286
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:34,000
directed toward both women...
and men... young and old.

287
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:38,833
It's hard for me to believe
what's going on out there...

288
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:42,333
no matter what happens,

289
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:44,750
I will keep broadcasting

290
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:28,500
If you encounter anyone who
is behaving in an unusual way

291
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,500
you should take it really seriously

292
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,416
Take whatever means are
necessary to protect yourself

293
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,625
It's not just strangers.

294
00:41:36,041 --> 00:41:38,125
Your own family members
may attempt to hurt you too.

295
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,750
Shit...

296
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,958
"...Don't come back. I'll go to you"

297
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:53,666
Please... Please stop...

298
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:56,375
Please... Please stop...

299
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,333
I’ll do anything.

300
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:05,875
Hey!

301
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:07,375
Hey!

302
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:08,458
Wake up!

303
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,041
Fuck! I told you don’t hit
him in the head anymore!

304
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:13,291
If he's unconscious, This won't be as fun?

305
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:16,916
I have an idea!

306
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,833
Let's do another round of "nutcracker"!

307
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:34,916
Ready...

308
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,000
1. 2. 3!

309
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:46,458
Take off his underwear.

310
00:46:00,041 --> 00:46:01,208
You wanna fuck him?

311
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,166
Get the fuck out of
here, you little bastards!

312
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:22,500
Fuck!

313
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,250
Why'd you stop them?

314
00:46:56,625 --> 00:46:57,958
I was about to shoot my load.

315
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,000
Don't leave! Stick around!
Let's have some fun!

316
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:19,583
Where are you going?
You think you got rid of us?

317
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:20,791
Don't leave!

318
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:23,958
It will be fun!

319
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,083
Civil Emergency.

320
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,125
Stay tuned for urgent information.

321
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,083
...That’s bullshit...

322
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:41,083
...Look, some areas are in big trouble...

323
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:42,666
Open up!

324
00:47:44,666 --> 00:47:46,333
She’s hurt! Open up!

325
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,250
OK, open the door.

326
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,583
Be careful! Are you alright?

327
00:47:56,708 --> 00:47:58,458
Sir, excuse me!

328
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,958
Can we have a nurse over here?

329
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,666
Let's make a space for the patient.

330
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:30,916
The ER has been closed.

331
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,083
You'll have to stay here for now.

332
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:34,416
Why?

333
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,583
It got overrun...

334
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:39,958
The police station is just a block away

335
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,208
We were able to react pretty quickly

336
00:48:44,458 --> 00:48:45,625
Some motherfucker...

337
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:49,666
set a little girl on fire...

338
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:51,958
It was...

339
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,125
Put pressure on this.

340
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,625
You likely have a concussion.

341
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,458
You'll need to have a CT scan.

342
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:14,875
Here. Watch your step. OK. Sit down.

343
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,958
Hey! What about me?

344
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:28,958
It’s not broken. You’ll be fine.

345
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,208
Miss, you can't come with us.

346
00:49:45,708 --> 00:49:47,416

It's okay. It's okay.

352
00:50:56,291 --> 00:50:57,291
Molly...

353
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,708
take care of yourself.

354
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:20,208
You're being such a drama queen.

355
00:51:21,208 --> 00:51:22,208
Let's go.

356
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,916
Stay tuned for urgent information.

357
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,083
Hey

358
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:05,625
May I use your phone?

359
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:09,250
Oh, OK.

360
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,125
Thank you.

361
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,208
Unlock it.

362
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,875
At ease!

363
00:52:43,416 --> 00:52:45,833
Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

364
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,750
It‘s 11:08 am.

365
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,000
We are broadcasting to you from

366
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,125
the central command room
at the Department of Defense.

367
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:58,583
The current situation is very serious

368
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,583
We've limited press involvement

369
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,208
Hey! What are you doing?

370
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:03,375
Signing into the Line app.

371
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:05,333
I thought you needed to make a call.

372
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,750
Yeah. On Line. Who memorizes phone numbers?

373
00:53:07,791 --> 00:53:09,000
I do. Is that hard for you?

374
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,041
Shut up!

375
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,625
You almost got me raped
and killed. I'm using this phone!

376
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,958
But, we have already arranged

377
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,458
to take reinforcements from
areas with a low infection rate

378
00:53:21,375 --> 00:53:24,875
Now I present our president, Guo-rong Xie.

379
00:53:39,791 --> 00:53:41,541
Good Morning everyone.

380
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:45,875
I’d like to apologize to you all

381
00:53:47,083 --> 00:53:49,125
for our lack of punctuality in
making this announcement.

382
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:53,708
Since the first reports of
this disturbance came in

383
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:59,250
our administration has
been working tirelessly.

384
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:01,750
At this time

385
00:54:02,541 --> 00:54:04,333
the nation’s scientific
community has not been able to

386
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:06,791
explain the cause of these
random acts of violence.

387
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,500
But we know this is NOT a hostile invasion.

388
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:14,666
It's NOT a chemical weapon nor
population destabilizing agent...

389
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,708
Many of you may be having
these kinds of cinematic theories.

390
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:21,125
But there is currently no evidence...

391
00:54:21,166 --> 00:54:23,458
...to make any conclusion about
the cause of this phenomenon.

392
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,541
But the critical factor is
how we confront this threat...

393
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:31,250
and we are confronting
it swiftly and efficiently.

394
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,375
Since the beginning of time, mankind has...

395
00:54:33,416 --> 00:54:34,708
What the fuck is this?

396
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:35,875
A history lesson?

397
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:40,666
Although there is no
evidence that the Alvin virus

398
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,500
is responsible for the current disturbances

399
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,625
it should not be ruled
out as a possibility.

400
00:54:47,458 --> 00:54:48,875
We must work together

401
00:54:49,708 --> 00:54:53,541
This is the biggest challenge
in the history of our country.

402
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,791
I promise you all

403
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,000
we will prevail!

404
00:54:59,208 --> 00:54:59,916
Thank you.

405
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:09,750
As President Xie has outlined

406
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:15,125
we are likely dealing
with a contagious disease

407
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,333
that essentially

408
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,750
transforms normal people

409
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:24,708
into homicidal sadistic maniacs.

410
00:55:27,041 --> 00:55:28,833
According to our big data resources

411
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:35,500
estimates of nation-wide infection
are between 15 to 20 percent.

412
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,916
Let me do the arithmetic for you...

413
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:46,916
that’s 4.5 million
infected people and rising.

414
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:50,500
These 4.5 million infected people...

415
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:54,458
are out there in the streets right now.

416
00:55:55,625 --> 00:56:00,041
Murder, rape and torture...

417
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,458
Is only the beginning of what
these people are capable of.

418
00:56:06,375 --> 00:56:08,541
We must come together as citizens...

419
00:56:09,708 --> 00:56:12,708
and follow the plan developed by
the Ministry of Homeland Security.

420
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:16,125
as President Xie has previously stated:

421
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:17,416
Full transparency...

422
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,958
...will serve best in
accomplishing our goals.

423
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,750
What the fuck do we do now?

424
00:57:17,416 --> 00:57:18,625
Just shut up, will you?

425
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,333
You have a big mouth for such a little man!

426
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:22,708
You have a problem, motherfucker?

427
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:23,750
I didn’t vote for that bastard!

428
00:57:23,791 --> 00:57:24,583
You're a coward, aren't you?

429
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:25,208
What the fuck did you say?

430
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,083
I'll teach you!

431
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:28,416
Don't fight here!

432
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:29,333
Hey!

433
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:30,791
Get out of my way!

434
00:57:33,583 --> 00:57:34,291
What the fuck?

435
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:38,458
What the fuck?

436
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:46,416
Everyone back off!

437
00:57:51,333 --> 00:57:53,625
Give me my phone!

438
00:57:55,791 --> 00:57:56,500
Everyone back off! Get back!

439
00:58:02,208 --> 00:58:02,916
Everyone back off!

440
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:38,291
You fucking cunt, Cock-sucking
whore! Give me my phone!

441
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:52,541
Hey...

442
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:59,291
I remember you.

443
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,750
Where’s your pretty friend?

444
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:27,125
You know what?

445
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:32,541
Oh boy...

446
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:36,333
I'm going to have a lot of fun with you.

447
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:41,250
No, no!

448
01:00:44,625 --> 01:00:48,125
No...No...

449
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:08,000
"Kat: I lost my phone."

450
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:10,333
"I'm at NTU hospital."

451
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:13,166
"I'm not hurt."

452
01:02:32,875 --> 01:02:33,583
Hello?

453
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,916
Are you ok? Where are you? What's going on?

454
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,291
Kat, are you ok?

455
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:45,541
I’m on my way, are you alright?

456
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,125
I’m not hurt. I’m at NTU hospital.

457
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:51,416
I think the cops are dead...

458
01:02:52,583 --> 01:02:55,666
And there are only crazy people here now

459
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:58,083
I don’t know where to go.

460
01:02:58,208 --> 01:02:59,916
I don’t know what to do...

461
01:02:59,958 --> 01:03:01,000
Can you help me?

462
01:03:01,041 --> 01:03:02,250
I really don’t know what to do...

463
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:02,916
I don’t know...

464
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:04,541
OK, Kat, listen to me,

465
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,708
Take a deep breath... try to calm down...

466
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,041
You need to try to keep
it together right now.

467
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:10,500
Ok...

468
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:13,375
The main road is blocked now.

469
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:14,583
I'm going to have to take the long way.

470
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:15,958
But I’ll be there. Okay?

471
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,708
I’m so scared...

472
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,583
Find a place to hide...
Right. Find a place to hide

473
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:23,958
Then you

474
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,625
Send me a Line message
to let me know where you are.

475
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:28,500
I can’t send you a
message... this isn' t my phone.

476
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:31,875
Okay...

477
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,666
You can call me. I can't call you.

478
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:35,041
You can call.

479
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:35,791
OK. I got it.

480
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,833
I’ll call you again when I’m there.

481
01:03:38,041 --> 01:03:39,458
I’ll let you know when I get there.

482
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,833
I’ll be there. Okay?

483
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,875
Okay, okay.

484
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:49,708
Just put the phone on silent.

485
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,875
Jim

486
01:03:56,333 --> 01:03:57,958
I love you

487
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,958
I need you to know...

488
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,166
You mean so much to me...

489
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,833
Jim?

490
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:42,750
Are you still there?

491
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:46,083
Say something.
Are you still there?

492
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:50,083
Are you all right?
Say something!

493
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:51,333
Yes

494
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:54,333
I was...

495
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:57,250
I got a little light-headed...

496
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,958
I really love you.

497
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:03,541
I love you too.

498
01:05:05,375 --> 01:05:06,500
I’ll be there soon.

499
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:42,750
Little worm...

500
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,041
I’m glad you’re here.

501
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:05,083
You know what? I always
had trouble making friends.

502
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:18,458
I guess...

503
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,500
I just needed to meet the right people.

504
01:08:57,125 --> 01:09:00,458
This is my kiss! I’m kissing you to death!

505
01:09:45,791 --> 01:09:48,875
Open the door! Whore! Open the door!

506
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:52,750
Hey!

507
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:01,250
I’m not going to stop until
I've fucked you to death.

508
01:10:22,708 --> 01:10:24,250
Fuck you!!! Open it!

509
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,583
Sorry, boys... this slut’s all mine.

510
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:07,458
You think that fat girl got away, huh?

511
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:14,083
Her eyeball fluid is drying on
my dick right now. How about that?

512
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:21,125
By the time I finished, she
was begging me to keep going.

513
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:34,375
And you're next...

514
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,333
Wait and see!

515
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:42,541
A dripping cunt, hungry for my dick.

516
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:50,375
I was able to fuck the fat girl
because of you. Thanks for that.

517
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,666
You are just like me...

518
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,541
Violent...

519
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,833
and depraved.

520
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,500
Are… are you?

521
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,000
Hey

522
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:22,041
Move to the shower.

523
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,083
There is a set of handcuffs. Cuff yourself.

524
01:14:28,958 --> 01:14:29,666
What?

525
01:14:30,416 --> 01:14:32,291
Cuff yourself to the pipe, now!

526
01:14:44,166 --> 01:14:44,875
No.

527
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:53,000
I don’t want to do this.
But I don’t know you,

528
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,291
and I don’t know if you are infected.

529
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:58,250
Please do as I say. I am
absolutely prepared to kill you.

530
01:15:01,166 --> 01:15:01,791
Move.

531
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:14,833
Cuff yourself.

532
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,458
Sorry.

533
01:15:50,541 --> 01:15:53,416
I know it’s cold. It’s a
chemical disinfecting solution.

534
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:56,708
I’m not sure if it will work.
But it’s better than nothing.

535
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:59,125
It stinks.

536
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:00,333
You’ll have to endure it.

537
01:16:04,791 --> 01:16:08,000
You don't seem infected.
You might be immune.

538
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:11,000
There's a small possibility.

539
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:13,458
What’s your blood type?

540
01:16:21,875 --> 01:16:23,125
Take off your clothes.

541
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,166
They are covered in contaminated tissue.

542
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,291
I’ll give you dry scrubs.

543
01:16:35,083 --> 01:16:36,583
How am I supposed to
undress myself like this?

544
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:41,916
You'll figure it out.

545
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:50,791
Are you a doctor?

546
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:52,958
Virologist.

547
01:16:55,166 --> 01:16:57,041
Why are you here in the maternity ward?

548
01:16:59,083 --> 01:17:02,000
They were renovating
this floor. It's been empty.

549
01:17:03,333 --> 01:17:06,875
This door is actually the
strongest door in the whole hospital.

550
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:10,666
Maternity wards have
these thick metal doors.

551
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:14,291
I guess its so parents feel
like their babies are safe.

552
01:17:15,166 --> 01:17:16,916
But who would ever want to steal a baby?

553
01:17:28,125 --> 01:17:29,000
Do you have children?

554
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:30,500
No.

555
01:17:34,041 --> 01:17:35,625
Can you turn around?

556
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,208
Oh.

557
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,791
No kids... You are lucky.

558
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,916
I feel sorry for those who have kids.

559
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:59,791
This Alvin virus has ruined our
lives and destroyed the future.

560
01:18:03,166 --> 01:18:04,083
Are you done?

561
01:18:54,708 --> 01:18:57,583
If you are infected, you should
be showing symptoms already.

562
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:03,375
I’ll take some blood samples
from you after you are dressed.

563
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:27,291
Sorry if I scared you with the gun.

564
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:29,291
It’s just for protection.

565
01:19:29,916 --> 01:19:30,625
A few months ago

566
01:19:30,875 --> 01:19:33,916
I realized I might need a
gun so I 3D-printed one.

567
01:19:34,416 --> 01:19:35,541
This is definitely not a toy.

568
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:38,166
And luckily, I kept a few rounds...

569
01:19:38,291 --> 01:19:40,500
as souvenirs from my
military service. Got it?

570
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,000
For a full year, I tried to tell
people this virus would mutate.

571
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,791
But no one trusts doctors anymore.

572
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:55,083
Everything must be politicized.
There can no longer be truth.

573
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,750
Politicians are the worst.

574
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:01,500
A nation-wide lockdown probably
felt like career suicide to them.

575
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,333
It’s an election year...
and they don’t want to risk...

576
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:08,666
driving the country into a recession.

577
01:20:10,875 --> 01:20:12,916
This virus... It's like being
possessed by an evil spirit.

578
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:16,166
It affects the limbic system in our brain.

579
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,666
It connects the area that
regulates aggression...

580
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,250
to the area that governs sexual drive.

581
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:24,416
These areas of the brain
aren’t terribly dissimilar.

582
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:27,500
This is quite academic, are you following?

583
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,041
But...

584
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,958
I believe this viral mutation
happened by natural processes.

585
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,916
The limbic system is no joke.

586
01:20:37,375 --> 01:20:41,666
We think humans are intelligent
organisms that can reason...

587
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,458
and make logical decisions.

588
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,041
But...

589
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:48,666
the reality is

590
01:20:49,166 --> 01:20:51,166
we are slaves to our limbic systems.

591
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,916
The higher brain exists only to serve it.

592
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:58,250
Incidentally, there are documented cases

593
01:20:58,416 --> 01:21:00,250
where patients with damaged limbic systems

594
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:03,833
are unable to escape
the feeling of intense thirst.

595
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,333
They would keep drinking and drinking

596
01:21:06,375 --> 01:21:07,708
until they drown themselves!

597
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,000
That’s the really unnerving part.

598
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:14,875
Those infected men, who
went after you in the hallway...

599
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:17,958
They likely understand
that the things they are doing

600
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,750
are vile and repugnant.

601
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:23,333
But the desire is too
strong for them to resist.

602
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:26,250
Asking them not to
indulge in those vile desires

603
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:30,416
is like asking you not to blink.

604
01:21:34,958 --> 01:21:37,500
It’s hard not to blink, right?

605
01:21:38,583 --> 01:21:44,125
Who knows, maybe they’re
crying because they feel guilty.

606
01:21:47,166 --> 01:21:50,708
The virus leaves virtually
every brain function intact.

607
01:21:50,875 --> 01:21:52,625
And it doesn't impede
the imagination at all.

608
01:21:52,750 --> 01:21:54,041
On the contrary...

609
01:21:54,916 --> 01:21:56,791
it makes you do the most
horrific things you can imagine.

610
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,541
I think this is why the
infected don't attack each other.

611
01:22:07,166 --> 01:22:11,791
For them to be satisfied,
their victims must suffer.

612
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:17,125
You can’t rape the willing, right?

613
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:17,958
Right?

614
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:22,041
How do you know if you never tried?

615
01:22:24,625 --> 01:22:25,916
Hey, are you done?

616
01:22:25,958 --> 01:22:27,458
Let’s run the blood test.

617
01:22:30,791 --> 01:22:31,500
Just a minute...

618
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,166
It didn't have to be this complicated...

619
01:24:00,166 --> 01:24:01,666
Forget about the blood test.

620
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:03,541
I just injected you with a
culture of the Alvin virus.

621
01:24:04,250 --> 01:24:07,125
If you are not immune, you
will exhibit symptoms very soon.

622
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:11,000
I’m going to check on you in 5 minutes.

623
01:24:12,375 --> 01:24:13,625
If you are not showing
any signs of infection...

624
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:15,916
We'll go to the roof.

625
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:17,958
There will be a helicopter for us.

626
01:24:19,291 --> 01:24:22,583
We might be able to use
you to develop a vaccine.

627
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:26,375
If I open the curtain and find you infected

628
01:24:27,833 --> 01:24:29,250
I’ll kill you.

629
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,041
I know you don’t trust me.

630
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,041
Nor would you want to leave with me.

631
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,000
But think about it.

632
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,666
Your blood could be used to save lives.

633
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:41,250
Who knows? Maybe you could save the world.

634
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:53,166
Fuck.

635
01:24:57,458 --> 01:25:00,833
When I got here. The staff was gone.

636
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,958
But there were 8 infants abandoned here.

637
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:08,125
I could barely convince the
government to pick me up.

638
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:14,333
Those maniacs... if they
had found those babies...

639
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:17,166
They would have fucked them...

640
01:25:17,250 --> 01:25:19,083
...Then they would have eaten them.

641
01:25:19,708 --> 01:25:20,708
If I didn’t kill them...

642
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:24,041
They would be in worse hands.

643
01:25:25,666 --> 01:25:28,541
Then I realized, maybe one of these babies

644
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:29,958
might be able to generate
valuable antibodies.

645
01:25:31,416 --> 01:25:34,416
So I injected them all with the virus.

646
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,166
Have I done something wrong?

647
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,291
Have I done something wrong?!

648
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:41,208
They would be dead anyway!

649
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:43,041
I made the most logical
decision that was available to me.

650
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:44,791
Do you get that? Huh?

651
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:54,791
They all got infected, not
a single one was immune.

652
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:06,083
I guess one was a little
more tenacious than the rest...

653
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,583
He managed to survive a little longer.

654
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:09,625
That's all

655
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:46,458
“8th floor maternity
ward. This man has a gun.”

656
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:53,583
“Pick up at NTU hospital, rooftop helipad”

657
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,458
“ETA: 5 minutes, Dr. A.
Wong. Chief of Virology.”

658
01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:23,583
How do you feel right now?

659
01:27:29,208 --> 01:27:30,541
Put that gun away...

660
01:28:10,833 --> 01:28:11,541
Where’s the axe?

661
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:25,458
Is your pussy getting wet?

662
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:27,708
The next...

663
01:28:40,750 --> 01:28:41,458
Fuck!

664
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:48,875
You fucking piece of shit! Motherfucker!

665
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:06,208
Get me up!

666
01:29:07,458 --> 01:29:08,708
You won’t have the access
to the roof without me!

667
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,416
Why are you still standing
there? Help me up!

668
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:20,500
Fuck!

669
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:31,541
Get me up!

670
01:29:33,041 --> 01:29:33,666
Get me up!

671
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:39,125
Now move!

672
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:42,250
They are not going to take you like this.

673
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:44,875
Shut up, hurry up!

674
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,041
Kat...

675
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,791
I made it.

676
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:10,041
I promised you I'd make it here...

677
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:13,041
Oh?

678
01:30:14,333 --> 01:30:16,625
Is this your new boyfriend?

679
01:30:18,958 --> 01:30:21,458
No, Jim.

680
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,083
Are you running away from me now?

681
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:29,541
Thank you for taking care of Kat.

682
01:30:31,375 --> 01:30:33,291
Now...

683
01:30:34,875 --> 01:30:37,333
I’m going to chop your dick off,

684
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:40,375
and feed it you!

685
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,208
You motherfucker!

686
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:41,875
No!

687
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:44,833
Move!

688
01:31:07,375 --> 01:31:10,916
I killed those babies... and...

689
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,666
It felt so good... so good.

690
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:59,041
You found me.

691
01:32:06,916 --> 01:32:08,625
Kat...

692
01:32:10,291 --> 01:32:11,333
open the gate.

693
01:32:21,541 --> 01:32:22,833
How does it feel?

694
01:32:30,583 --> 01:32:32,083
It feels...

695
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:36,750
wonderful...

696
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:41,833
I feel like...

697
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:48,125
I finally have a purpose in life.

698
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:53,125
What purpose?

699
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:56,791
You... you are my purpose.

700
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,083
Kat...

701
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:02,625
listen to me...

702
01:33:03,958 --> 01:33:05,666
When I heard your voice today...

703
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,000
on the phone...

704
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,125
You sounded so scared.

705
01:33:12,208 --> 01:33:13,458
You said you needed me.

706
01:33:19,125 --> 01:33:22,458
I knew I had to find you.

707
01:33:26,083 --> 01:33:28,041
I needed to be with you.

708
01:33:31,166 --> 01:33:32,833
And then...

709
01:33:34,916 --> 01:33:37,291
cut your tits off.

710
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:42,458
And smash your face.

711
01:33:46,666 --> 01:33:48,250
Kat, look at me.

712
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:53,333
I’ll peel your skin off... So slowly.

713
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:01,875
Look at me.

714
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:05,541
Kat...

715
01:34:10,125 --> 01:34:12,541
Don't you realize how much I need you?

716
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,791
Don't you realize how much I love you?

717
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,583
Hey, I really love you.
