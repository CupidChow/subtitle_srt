1
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:16,211
Previously on Betcin.

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,064
No. This is Cindy.

3
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:20,106
Cindy?

4
00:00:20,592 --> 00:00:21,443
BetCin?

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,356
Beth's ex.

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,442
Ah, that Cindy.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:28,611
Ah, that Cindy.

8
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:33,927
Beth is doing everything
for this contest...

9
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:34,826
for you.

10
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,329
But what I'm asking you is...

11
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:39,831
please give her a chance.

12
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,795
Just don't close any doors.

13
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,911
I should be thanking you.

14
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,259
Because you're helping me with Kate.

15
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:26,295
So where are the haters and
the bashers who keep saying...

16
00:01:26,524 --> 00:01:28,586
that there's a third party
getting in the way of BetCin?

17
00:01:28,906 --> 00:01:33,574
It's clear as day they are so in love!

18
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,597
And if you also love and support BetCin,

19
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,015
comment down below!

20
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,355
Guys! Time for some real talk.

21
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:47,024
After the issue came out that
Beth was cheating on Cindy,

22
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:50,611
all of sudden a video of them
kissing leaks out?

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,948
Oh come on, we weren't born yesterday!

24
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:58,040
So please, stop the act!

25
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,168
All I can say is...

26
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,503
love truly wins, right?

27
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:10,589
True!

28
00:02:10,932 --> 00:02:14,468
But the true winner...

29
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,474
Will you stop that!

30
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:20,421
How can you be so calm,

31
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:23,393
I already told you Kate
has blocked me on social media!

32
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,348
She has deleted all our memories.

33
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,152
So? You've broken up already.

34
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:29,445
No, we're not.

35
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:30,538
Okay?

36
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:33,246
No, last time you guys talked...

37
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:35,849
Last time we talked she said,

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,616
she needs space to think.

39
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,284
That's it.

40
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,870
Maybe the time is up.

41
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:43,442
No.

42
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,415
No.

43
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,375
Kate wouldn't do that to me.

44
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,959
That's impossible.
She's not immature like that!

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,543
She won't leave me hanging like that.

46
00:02:53,508 --> 00:02:56,110
First stage of grief, denial.

47
00:02:56,228 --> 00:02:58,325
Cindy, don't start with that.

48
00:02:58,366 --> 00:02:59,805
This is your fault.

49
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:00,954
This is your damn fault!

50
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:02,349
You and your contest!

51
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,694
Second stage, anger.

52
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:11,317
I shouldn't have said yes to this contest,

53
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,651
I never should have gotten involved.

54
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:14,986
You know, it's me who's wrong here.

55
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,238
I was prideful,

56
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,060
I should have just agreed to
what she wanted.

57
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,269
She asked me to move in with her,
she was going to cover the rent.

58
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,896
If only I said yes,
then we'd still be together.

59
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,816
Shit, I know what to do,

60
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:31,336
I'll call her and tell her that I agree,
I'm saying yes to her plans.

61
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:33,792
Just so we can get back together.

62
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,186
Good idea!

63
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:37,259
Third stage, bargaining.

64
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,080
Cindy, stop. You're not helping.

65
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:46,362
I don't want to die alone...please answer.

66
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,583
You're overreacting.

67
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:48,478
Crap.

68
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,189
By the way, fourth stage, depression.

69
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:54,443
Just one more stage, Beth...

70
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,654
acceptance.

71
00:03:56,454 --> 00:03:58,748
You have to accept it and move on.

72
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,533
You just have to find
the peace in your heart.

73
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:05,084
Look for the happiness in
everything that surrounds you.

74
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,956
It's not real, she didn't block me, right?

75
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:11,126
This isn't happening!

76
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,443
-And we're back to stage one.
-Answer the phone!

77
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:16,450
Ouch! That hurts!

78
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:17,837
You're being too much!

79
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,860
You know, I'm curious
what stage violence is...

80
00:04:20,901 --> 00:04:22,222
because that's where I am at now.

81
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,932
Why are you mad at me, I didn't block you.

82
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,089
I didn't delete all your
memories from social media.

83
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,172
She wouldn't have done that
if you didn't kiss me last night.

84
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:33,298
Oh come on Beth, you kissed back.

85
00:04:33,824 --> 00:04:35,153
And don't pretend you didn't like it.

86
00:04:35,194 --> 00:04:36,820
I didn't like it!

87
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,029
Don't say that, you're being offensive.

88
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,123
You know what,

89
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:45,962
I think you're mad because
you got exposed.

90
00:04:46,564 --> 00:04:49,609
Your indecision got exposed
in front of the camera.

91
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:51,580
Think about it,

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,045
you like Kate but you kissed me back.

93
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,175
Which means you also like me.

94
00:04:58,724 --> 00:05:01,519
And I can't blame you,

95
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,678
I am hard to let go of.

96
00:05:05,856 --> 00:05:07,108
You're delusional!

97
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,018
I'm kidding!

98
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,394
But seriously,

99
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,813
there's nothing wrong if
you're still into me.

100
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:16,349
What we went through
these past few days are really extremes.

101
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,567
And you know what they say,

102
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,152
if you're taken out of your comfort zone,

103
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:21,738
that's when the real you shows itself.

104
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,534
Besides, we're two days away
from the end of the contest.

105
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:27,594
So let me get this straight...

106
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,680
while I'm worried sick trying to fix
what's happening between me and Kate,

107
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,562
Right!

108
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:34,724
all you think about is the contest?

109
00:05:34,765 --> 00:05:35,624
Why not?

110
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,273
Like I said,
the winner will be announced in two days.

111
00:05:39,314 --> 00:05:40,630
Eyes on the prize,

112
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,236
we have to finish strong!

113
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,135
The lie detector test will be here
any moment now.

114
00:05:46,163 --> 00:05:47,330
I should have known...

115
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,920
that you will do anything
to win this contest.

116
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:52,806
Right?

117
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,500
Yes.

118
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,255
At the expense of my relationship.

119
00:05:59,264 --> 00:06:03,164
Hey, I talked to Kate for you.

120
00:06:03,205 --> 00:06:05,207
Because I know that will make you happy.

121
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,662
You didn't care about me and Kate
from the get go.

122
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:14,808
You don't have a heart,

123
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,752
you don't know how to love.

124
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,381
Wow.

125
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,404
Wow.

126
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,511
Oh my gosh, wow!

127
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:32,186
So you think I joined this contest...

128
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,559
just because of the prize?

129
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:34,579
Yes!

130
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:36,967
So that's how superficial I am to you?

131
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:39,775
Yup! You're right!
You've hit the nail on the head!

132
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:42,134
Beth, I did this because of you!

133
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,112
Let's not fool each other, Cindy.

134
00:06:44,288 --> 00:06:47,416
I did this because I want to
spend more time with you.

135
00:06:48,806 --> 00:06:52,641
I wanted you to realize that
we're still good together.

136
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,291
I want to win you back.

137
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,305
Don't make this about me, okay?

138
00:06:57,346 --> 00:06:58,762
You're doing this for clout.

139
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,254
You know,

140
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,862
I can't do anything if
you won't believe me...

141
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:06,092
but that's the truth.

142
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,100
I did this hoping that you'd realize that
you didn't want to leave me.

143
00:07:15,543 --> 00:07:16,978
That we still make a great couple.

144
00:07:20,588 --> 00:07:21,589
That I still love you.

145
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,279
And I miss us.

146
00:07:28,218 --> 00:07:29,386
I'm so done...

147
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,285
I'm so done with this insanity!

148
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,050
Yes?

149
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,094
Good morning.

150
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,305
I've been calling Ma'am Cindy
but she's not picking up.

151
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:53,785
So the guard just sent me here.

152
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,560
Sorry my phone was on silent,

153
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,312
but we won't be needing
your services anymore.

154
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,731
What? But I traveled all the way here.

155
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,733
We don't need you anymore.

156
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:06,273
Sorry.

157
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:07,658
What is it?

158
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,973
Polygraph services...

159
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,992
lie detector.

160
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:18,976
What?

161
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:49,928
=BETCIN=

162
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:53,492
You're the one who asked for this
so let's do this!

163
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,494
What the...

164
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,374
Because the plan was to
subject you to the test, not me!

165
00:08:57,415 --> 00:09:00,168
No Cindy, I think we're going to
get a ton of views...

166
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:02,626
if we admit to the Umamis that
we've been lying all along.

167
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,543
Oh my gosh, eyes on the prize, right?

168
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:06,841
I said I don't want to do it anymore!

169
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:09,078
What's the point,
you're leaving me anyway!

170
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,407
You already made it perfectly clear.

171
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:13,856
You said, "You don't have a heart.

172
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:15,277
I don't want to be with you anymore!"

173
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,642
No excuses, let's finish this.

174
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:19,832
Now!

175
00:09:20,255 --> 00:09:22,262
Sir, please set the polygraph up.

176
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:25,431
Sir, remember I'm the one paying you.

177
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:27,698
Sir, you follow me,

178
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,015
so set it up there!

179
00:09:29,056 --> 00:09:30,695
No!

180
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,072
Which one is it?

181
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:35,283
I'll get the camera and the lights,

182
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,827
we're going to do this today, okay?

183
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:40,332
Fine!

184
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:41,664
Alright.

185
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,420
Okay I'll do it,

186
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:47,962
but you have to promise that
you're taking the test too once I'm done.

187
00:09:49,642 --> 00:09:50,493
No.

188
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:51,805
Yes.

189
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:52,842
-No!
-Yes!

190
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,178
So we'll get all the truth out
once and for all.

191
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:00,740
Fine!

192
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:01,627
Fine!

193
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:03,103
-Ma'am?
-What?

194
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,454
Do you have coffee?

195
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,731
Yes, over there.

196
00:10:09,772 --> 00:10:10,693
Okay.

197
00:10:10,913 --> 00:10:11,914
Thank you.

198
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:20,768
Ma'am?

199
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,497
So should I set it up?

200
00:10:30,702 --> 00:10:31,703
Are you good, Sir?

201
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:35,184
Is this even accurate?

202
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,847
Are you ready?

203
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,568
Ready.

204
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,643
First question.

205
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,691
What are the things that
you like about me?

206
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:51,888
Sorry Ma'am,

207
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:53,848
we need to start with protocol questions.

208
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:56,079
Okay.

209
00:10:58,152 --> 00:10:59,862
Is your name Cindy?

210
00:11:00,557 --> 00:11:01,411
Yes.

211
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,887
Are you currently taking a polygraph exam?

212
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:09,127
Yes.

213
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:12,338
Okay?

214
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:14,924
Okay.

215
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:17,665
Same question,

216
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,762
what are the things
that you like about me?

217
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:21,347
That's easy.

218
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:23,423
Super easy.

219
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,124
Ma'am, sorry,

220
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,162
questions answerable by yes or no only.

221
00:11:30,668 --> 00:11:31,586
Thank you.

222
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:32,650
Are there more instructions?

223
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:37,096
This is why I told you earlier
I need to brief you first.

224
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,991
There's no need for that,
we don't have time.

225
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,866
We have to finish this now.

226
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,411
Okay.

227
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,831
-Okay.
-Yes or no questions...

228
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:51,586
Cindy,

229
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,445
do you think I'm gullible?

230
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,111
Well,

231
00:11:57,645 --> 00:12:00,158
I don't think gullible
is the right term for it,

232
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,264
it's more of...

233
00:12:04,569 --> 00:12:07,101
Ma'am sorry,

234
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:11,889
let me just repeat,
yes or no answers only.

235
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,815
Okay?

236
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,482
Fine.

237
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,113
Yes.

238
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,950
You're really manipulative and
I really am stupid.

239
00:12:33,668 --> 00:12:34,532
What?

240
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,858
Wait, can I explain?

241
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,845
I guess...but can you keep it short?

242
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:45,282
We really should have done
the briefing first.

243
00:12:45,323 --> 00:12:46,432
-Because...
-Okay.

244
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:51,250
Okay, fine, you're gullible, yes,

245
00:12:51,518 --> 00:12:52,897
but in a lovable way.

246
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,318
And you're manipulative, in a lovable way!

247
00:12:57,578 --> 00:12:58,787
Beth, come on.

248
00:13:00,166 --> 00:13:05,618
What I mean to say is you're gullible
in a lovable way but...

249
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,495
that's what I like about you.

250
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,917
You always say yes to what I want to do.

251
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,215
You always say that you'll make a way,

252
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:22,802
you'll try even if I know you didn't want.

253
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:28,748
And coming from a household
that the answer is always no...

254
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:31,185
except if Jesus says yes,

255
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,438
I felt...

256
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:37,692
safe.

257
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,321
I felt understood.

258
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:46,018
That's why I love you.

259
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,061
That's enough.

260
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,163
Next question.

261
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,730
Good thing.

262
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,294
Question number two.

263
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:00,214
Cindy,

264
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,259
did you treat me just like
one of your projects?

265
00:14:04,447 --> 00:14:05,303
Projects?

266
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:07,932
What do you mean by projects?

267
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,159
Like your baking projects,

268
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,826
your cooking projects.

269
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,669
Did you enter this
relationship thinking...

270
00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:18,524
you'd be successful?

271
00:14:20,377 --> 00:14:22,379
Then when you're sick and tired of it,

272
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,698
when you didn't want to be in it anymore,
you'd just abandon it?

273
00:14:26,989 --> 00:14:29,827
Is that how you think
this relationship would go?

274
00:14:31,818 --> 00:14:33,695
How did you even get to that conclusion?

275
00:14:34,988 --> 00:14:37,330
Is it because you were
my first girlfriend,

276
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:41,089
you think you're one of my projects?

277
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:44,778
Beth, I'm shocked!

278
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,345
I didn't realize you're that insecure.

279
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,827
Just answer the question.

280
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:51,432
No!

281
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:03,778
What? Hey!

282
00:15:04,453 --> 00:15:07,539
This polygraph test is lying!

283
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:09,700
So now it's the test that's lying.

284
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,118
Okay, fine, at first I admit,

285
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:14,398
I said yes for the experience.

286
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,815
Okay? Like...

287
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,669
Something new to try. A fling!

288
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,963
But then you never managed to
get out of it, is that it?

289
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,049
Because I fell in love with you.

290
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,638
Because you're the only one
who loved me like this.

291
00:15:33,215 --> 00:15:35,760
Because you take care of me and...

292
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:40,519
I've never experienced that with anyone.

293
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:44,819
Okay?

294
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:48,370
Should we move on to the next question?

295
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:53,401
Why don't you ask me if it's true that
I joined hashtag Relationship Goals...

296
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,080
because I wanted you to
give me another chance?

297
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,332
Because I'm not the fool that
you had me pegged to be.

298
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,084
No, so you'd know that
I'm not lying to you.

299
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,860
I have my own set of questions
I want to ask you.

300
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:04,961
You are scared of finding out
what I can do for love.

301
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:06,254
Okay just to get this over with.

302
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:13,460
Did you plan to join this contest...

303
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:14,682
Yes.

304
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,511
-Because you don't want me to leave?
-Yes.

305
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:19,553
Because you love me?

306
00:16:19,594 --> 00:16:21,638
Ma'am one question at a time, please.

307
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,226
Because you love me?

308
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,600
Yes.

309
00:16:27,393 --> 00:16:28,728
She's lying, right?

310
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,222
Actually,

311
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,726
she's telling the truth.

312
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,036
About everything.

313
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,079
You see.

314
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,435
Okay, I'm done.

315
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:43,586
Your turn.

316
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:49,972
Okay Sir, let's start.

317
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,714
Are you not happy with us anymore?

318
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm not answering that.

319
00:16:55,956 --> 00:16:56,849
Cheater.

320
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,412
Cindy, do you want the Umamis to know...

321
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:01,655
that I'm not happy with you anymore?
Not for a long time?

322
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,897
I'll edit it out!

323
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:05,154
Just answer the question.

324
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,663
Fine.

325
00:17:08,643 --> 00:17:10,145
Yes, I'm not happy with you.

326
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:12,270
Ouch, that hurts!

327
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,252
Is that what you want to hear?

328
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,822
Can we not do this, please?

329
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:22,066
Next question,

330
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:27,588
Do you still love me?

331
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:31,470
No.

332
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,563
Truth is I don't know.

333
00:17:45,866 --> 00:17:46,774
I don't know anymore.

334
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:52,444
Then why did you want us to break up?

335
00:17:52,882 --> 00:17:55,157
Maybe we can fix things, right?

336
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,534
I don't know Cindy I just...

337
00:17:58,848 --> 00:18:00,141
I feel sad.

338
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,207
And alone.

339
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,710
Not seen.

340
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:09,322
And unappreciated when I'm with you.

341
00:18:10,812 --> 00:18:12,397
But you never said anything.

342
00:18:12,578 --> 00:18:13,954
You know me.

343
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,961
I'll try to figure things out by myself.

344
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:22,079
And I just figured out that...

345
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,855
it's not you that's the problem,
it's not me too.

346
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,858
It's us.

347
00:18:29,831 --> 00:18:30,958
When we're together.

348
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,751
I don't know what to say.

349
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,122
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:46,153 --> 00:18:48,461
I'm sorry if I neglected you.

351
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,631
I just really didn't know.

352
00:18:52,672 --> 00:18:53,673
That's okay.

353
00:18:54,497 --> 00:18:56,373
But I don't want us to end.

354
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,390
We're BetCin, right?

355
00:19:02,044 --> 00:19:05,102
I don't believe that "us" won't work.

356
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,855
We've always been a team.

357
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,618
You said we're a team, right?

358
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,776
There's no you and me.

359
00:19:14,474 --> 00:19:15,530
It's okay Cindy.

360
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,091
No, I'll make it up to you,
I'll try anything.

361
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:19,742
I'll make things right.

362
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:22,103
It's fine...

363
00:19:23,668 --> 00:19:24,914
you don't have to do anything.

364
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:30,129
This is what I'm saying,
this why I love you,

365
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,632
because even when it's my fault,
you still take the burden away from me.

366
00:19:38,655 --> 00:19:39,512
Sir,

367
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,743
can you please stop?

368
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:43,557
You're destroying the moment.

369
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,885
Sir, go grab some snacks first.

370
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:48,174
Okay.

371
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:49,397
Thank you.

372
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:58,717
Beth last question.

373
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,706
Is there still a chance for us?

374
00:20:07,277 --> 00:20:08,165
No.

375
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:09,750
You're lying.

376
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,744
I'm tired.

377
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:13,921
No, you're lying! You're lying!

378
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:17,101
Why don't you give us another chance?

379
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,310
Why don't you want?

380
00:20:19,527 --> 00:20:22,745
You want to give me another chance
but you won't...

381
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:26,165
because of you're goddamn ego!

382
00:20:26,962 --> 00:20:30,312
You're wasting everything
because of your pride!

383
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,261
Cindy, wait!

384
00:20:34,328 --> 00:20:35,288
Cindy...

385
00:20:37,254 --> 00:20:38,363
Don't close the door on me!

386
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,489
Please go away...

387
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:45,678
If you really can't stand me anymore
please leave me alone.

388
00:20:45,719 --> 00:20:46,662
I won't leave.

389
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,332
Just go, Beth!

390
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,563
I can't leave you like this.

391
00:20:50,604 --> 00:20:53,440
-Open the door!
-I'm done with this!

392
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,775
Cindy...

393
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,507
Stop, please...

394
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,385
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:58,567
I'll be okay.

396
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,298
Thank you for everything.

397
00:22:24,184 --> 00:22:27,096
I'm really sorry for cheating on you.

398
00:22:28,157 --> 00:22:29,056
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:36,730
I'm not deserving for you.

400
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:37,648
Me too.

401
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,488
Are you okay?

402
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:44,877
What did we just do?

403
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,387
I think we just said our last goodbyes.

404
00:25:59,711 --> 00:26:00,559
Yeah...

405
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,520
letting go.

406
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:08,984
Yeah.

407
00:26:13,751 --> 00:26:15,741
What are we going to do with the contest?

408
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,208
Can we still pretend for 17 hours?

409
00:26:36,518 --> 00:26:38,770
I think the right question is...

410
00:26:40,246 --> 00:26:43,185
can we still fool
each other and ourselves...

411
00:26:44,115 --> 00:26:45,604
for less than a day?

412
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,405
You're right.

413
00:26:59,917 --> 00:27:01,745
Let's do the right thing, Beth.

414
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:07,626
Let's just admit to the world that
we're a fraud.

415
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:11,819
Okay.

416
00:28:14,117 --> 00:28:16,226
(NEXT ON BETCIN)

417
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:18,113
Hi Umamis!

418
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:23,911
So we are live today because
we have a very important announcement.

419
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,455
Oh my gosh, are you crying?

420
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,623
Cindy, SOS, SOS!

421
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:28,999
I need you and Beth's help!

422
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:30,876
Oh my gosh!
