1
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:23,950
Previously on Betcin.

2
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,964
Hi babe.

3
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:28,530
It was supposedly a
special honeymoon night.

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,614
Not right now!

5
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,573
-What!
-You've gone mad.

6
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,866
Your other babe...

7
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,030
Just shut it, she broke up with me!

8
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,413
But because of Beth's drama,
she got wasted.

9
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,815
-Enough of this...
-Let me be miserable...

10
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,762
You know what,

11
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:45,587
I think...

12
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:49,932
I'm destined to die alone.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,434
I can't do this anymore.

14
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,519
I'm breaking up with you.

15
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,399
No, I don't want to.

16
00:01:01,343 --> 00:01:04,595
Beth! Hey, BetCin is losing subscribers!

17
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:11,417
For our daily mantra, repeat after me.

18
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,532
I am strong.

19
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,285
I am strong.

20
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,893
I am valid.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,653
I am valid.

22
00:01:21,557 --> 00:01:24,476
I can survive all things.

23
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:27,713
I can survive all things.

24
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,121
Beth...

25
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,200
Can we talk?

26
00:01:38,324 --> 00:01:39,164
Beth...

27
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:44,357
Can you just give me time alone, please?

28
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,355
Thank you.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,476
Beth!

30
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,210
Cindy, who's pregnant?

31
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,755
Beth, I am pregnant...

32
00:02:12,286 --> 00:02:13,614
and you're the father!

33
00:02:14,443 --> 00:02:17,429
I know you still love me and
that's how this baby was formed.

34
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:24,353
I'm sure that's not how biology works.

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,148
You're responsible for this, Beth.

36
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,632
I won't let this child
grow up without a father.

37
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,196
Are you high? Did you take 'shrooms?

38
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,323
Plus you know I hate babies.

39
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,203
But Beth...

40
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,438
Oh my god...

41
00:02:38,437 --> 00:02:39,938
The baby's coming out!

42
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,173
Huh?

43
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:42,054
Right now?

44
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:47,996
Hey!

45
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,962
Beth! Beth!

46
00:02:53,592 --> 00:02:56,893
Beth! Beth!

47
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,440
Mama!

48
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:12,421
Kate!

49
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:29,258
Okay...

50
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,171
It's just a dream...
Beth, you need to chill.

51
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,668
Beth!

52
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,662
Aw, Mommy Beth is finally up!

53
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,203
Good morning, Mommy!

54
00:04:58,244 --> 00:05:00,238
Say hello to our baby!

55
00:05:00,653 --> 00:05:01,551
What the f...

56
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:32,063
=BETCIN=

57
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,054
Hush, baby...

58
00:05:39,438 --> 00:05:41,797
Hush...

59
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,096
Cindy,

60
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:48,658
what the heck?

61
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:53,624
Please explain to me why
there's a baby in our condo.

62
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,125
The last thing I remember,

63
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,168
I was drunk last night,

64
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,568
because of your honeymoon schtick.

65
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,031
And then I wake up and
there's a baby here?

66
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,161
Will you be quiet, please,
the baby can't get any sleep.

67
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,287
Can you please calm down?

68
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,873
How can I calm down, what was that for?

69
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:19,521
How can I calm down,

70
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,172
whose baby is that?

71
00:06:21,687 --> 00:06:22,772
Ours!

72
00:06:23,611 --> 00:06:25,010
What do you mean, ours?

73
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,512
Oh my god, my head is throbbing.

74
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:32,647
There, see what you did?
You made him more upset.

75
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:34,108
Make him stop!

76
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:36,109
-What? No!
-Stop him from crying.

77
00:06:40,646 --> 00:06:42,648
-Feed him.
-Why won't he...

78
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,426
Feed him.

79
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,366
You do it.

80
00:06:50,407 --> 00:06:51,324
No, you do it.

81
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,510
-Sshhh...sorry...
-Oh god, why won't he stop crying?

82
00:07:02,627 --> 00:07:04,906
Hey, don't leave me here!

83
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,040
Don't tell me you kidnapped this baby?

84
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,031
What?

85
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:09,929
You think I'm that crazy?

86
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,231
Yeah.

87
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:18,647
Shhh...stop crying.

88
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:21,750
Stop crying.

89
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:27,137
There you go...good boy.

90
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,240
So now who's insane?

91
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:36,953
Well he's cute.

92
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,921
Oh yes.

93
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,216
Hey! What are you doing?
What is this baby for?

94
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,993
For content, of course!

95
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,050
My god, you really have gone mad.

96
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,097
You got a baby for content?

97
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,139
Is this the effect of
the bump in your head?

98
00:07:53,877 --> 00:07:57,686
Look, baby, Mommy Beth
is trying to be funny.

99
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,453
Stop it. Stop that.

100
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:00,349
What do you mean stop that?

101
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,731
I'm not comfortable.

102
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,113
Don't you remember, you owe me?

103
00:08:04,154 --> 00:08:06,153
Have you seen our last upload?

104
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,703
Our viewership is going down.

105
00:08:08,744 --> 00:08:10,037
We have a lot of haters!

106
00:08:10,077 --> 00:08:12,788
They're calling us a fake couple.

107
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,207
Aren't we?

108
00:08:14,756 --> 00:08:15,964
That's not the point.

109
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,021
The point is,

110
00:08:17,062 --> 00:08:19,958
I told you to wear a disguise
if you're meeting up with Kate.

111
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,187
But no, you just had to show your face,

112
00:08:23,228 --> 00:08:26,756
make a scene, and even allowed
a fan to take a video of you.

113
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:32,721
Thanks for reminding me
that Kate has dumped me.

114
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:37,058
Hence, I don't need
the prize money anymore.

115
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,601
And hence,

116
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,206
I don't need to listen to
and do anything you say.

117
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:45,709
Right, baby? We're done.

118
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,443
He agrees with me.

119
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,100
Look Beth,

120
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:59,504
I just borrowed him
from a family friend, okay?

121
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:02,596
They want exposure for the kid,

122
00:09:02,637 --> 00:09:05,230
maybe get free supplies
from a baby food company.

123
00:09:05,271 --> 00:09:07,631
Plus I promised them
I'm going to give them something...

124
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:11,205
if we do win the cash prize
from hashtag Relationship Goals.

125
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:15,638
So please stop being such a Nega Nancy.

126
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,267
And I'm claiming it,

127
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,477
we will win.

128
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,562
We will win.

129
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:29,932
You know what Cindy, I don't know
if you have gunk stuffed in your ear,

130
00:09:29,973 --> 00:09:33,508
that's why you don't hear
what I'm saying...

131
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:35,492
but let me say it again,

132
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:44,372
I am done with this contest.

133
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:20,651
Okay,

134
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,395
I understand that you're hurt.

135
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:28,920
And I understand that you and
Kate are no longer together and...

136
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,272
with that goes your reason
for joining the contest.

137
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:34,769
Thank you.

138
00:10:36,108 --> 00:10:36,984
But...

139
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:39,931
There's a but?

140
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:42,177
Will you just think for a second?

141
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,101
Think of the prize!

142
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,688
Think of all the things
you can do with it.

143
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:49,471
Your world doesn't
just revolve around Kate.

144
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:52,747
Okay, how about...

145
00:10:53,717 --> 00:10:58,144
why don't you think of all of
the things you hate about her,

146
00:10:58,185 --> 00:10:59,409
so you'll move on easily.

147
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:01,462
Like what?

148
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:06,781
What do you mean like what?
Is she that perfect?

149
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:08,207
Uh, yeah.

150
00:11:08,248 --> 00:11:10,420
No flaws? No negative traits?

151
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,704
Is she flawless?
Does she have white underarms?

152
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:15,800
-Not stretch mark? Nothing?
-Nope.

153
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,719
No bad breath, no skin disease?

154
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,600
No.

155
00:11:19,232 --> 00:11:21,083
What is she, a human or saint?

156
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,417
I know right.

157
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,474
Well, I know for a fact saints
don't steal other people's girlfriends!

158
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:30,607
Okay, this is not helping. Thanks.

159
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,275
What is it that you want?

160
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:36,659
Well what about you, what do you want?

161
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,990
Here you go again.

162
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh my god, Cindy, can you smell that?

163
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:49,393
-Oh my gosh Beth, did you just fart?
-It's not me!

164
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,286
Hi cutie pie!

165
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,538
Ew! Throw that away!

166
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,929
Ugh, that stinks! Beth!

167
00:12:03,036 --> 00:12:04,955
Okay wait, let me film this.

168
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:09,810
Babe, come on!

169
00:12:13,164 --> 00:12:14,749
Oh yes,

170
00:12:15,564 --> 00:12:17,357
nice nice!

171
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,157
Hi Umamis... wait.

172
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,285
Hi Umamis!

173
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,371
So as you can see,
baby has been crying non-stop,

174
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,386
until we realized it's because he pooped!

175
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,835
Good thing Mommy Beth noticed.

176
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,455
Gosh, taking care of babies
can be so stressful.

177
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:41,219
So now, let's watch how
Mommy Beth take care of baby.

178
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,124
She's changing diapers, fresh diaper.

179
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,433
Smile, Mommy Beth!

180
00:12:48,694 --> 00:12:52,712
Babe, can you please hand me
the wipes and the powder, babe.

181
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,690
Sure, babe.

182
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:57,631
Okay this is the baby bag...

183
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,487
Diaper, check!

184
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:01,711
Wipes,

185
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:02,925
check!

186
00:13:04,644 --> 00:13:05,558
Powder,

187
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,435
check!

188
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,331
How do you do this...

189
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:13,960
As you can see, our beloved Umamis,

190
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,005
we've been planning to
have a baby for so long.

191
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,390
Actually, we're both super excited,

192
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,509
we're already thinking of baby names.

193
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,344
What were the names you suggested again?

194
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:25,895
Mark.

195
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:28,528
Mark?

196
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,977
Really, Beth, out of all
the names in the world, Mark?

197
00:13:32,758 --> 00:13:34,118
Are you testing me?

198
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:36,243
Testing you? I'm busy here.

199
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:38,482
Come on, Beth, it's just a name.

200
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:39,649
Be creative.

201
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,739
Something that has meaning like,

202
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,157
Hezekiah or Zebedee.

203
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,132
Wow, did you get those
from your pastor Mom?

204
00:13:50,725 --> 00:13:52,457
Well, yes, in fact
she suggested those names.

205
00:13:53,569 --> 00:13:55,997
There's a Mark in the Bible too
and besides,

206
00:13:56,038 --> 00:13:58,061
why ask me when you already have a list?

207
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,505
That's not the point.

208
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:02,197
Okay, the point is,

209
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,344
I don't want to have a baby.

210
00:14:04,522 --> 00:14:05,362
Okay?

211
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,764
I don't want to pretend for the camera.

212
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:09,474
Why?

213
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,060
Life is a precious thing.

214
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:14,813
Tell that to the children in orphanages.

215
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,897
That's exactly why we're adopting.

216
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,709
There...Baby's smiling.

217
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:38,051
Nice.

218
00:14:41,154 --> 00:14:43,323
You good? Good.

219
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,274
Good job, Beth.

220
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:48,930
For someone who doesn't like babies,

221
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:51,459
you look natural.

222
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,555
So what are you saying,
I'm a natural mother?

223
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,479
If you want.

224
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,525
Mothers are the most
hardworking people I know.

225
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,027
Cindy don't patronize me, okay?

226
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,029
Can you just stop being offended?

227
00:15:06,352 --> 00:15:08,992
You can't just tell
someone not to be offended.

228
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,492
It's not for you to decide.

229
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:12,411
Sorry...

230
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:16,499
Sorry, I didn't mean anything by it.

231
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:18,748
I'm just saying,

232
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,235
that you look good
taking care of other people.

233
00:15:24,045 --> 00:15:26,640
Whether it's a baby or...

234
00:15:26,681 --> 00:15:28,307
an adult like me.

235
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:35,184
Okay, I know you're not
that enthusiastic anymore...

236
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,646
about winning Relationship Goals because
of what you're going through with Kate.

237
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,888
And sorry I seem to be
the reason behind it.

238
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:43,484
Actually, I am the reason.

239
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,946
But then I have given this a thought,

240
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,952
with your consent,
and like I said last night,

241
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,439
I will talk to her.

242
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:54,440
I will explain everything to her.

243
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:57,039
And hopefully after that,
you guys can already talk.

244
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:58,875
But Beth,

245
00:16:00,024 --> 00:16:02,734
please promise that once you've made up,

246
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,838
you'll win this contest for us. Please?

247
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,138
Please?

248
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,905
Okay, game.

249
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,702
Deal?

250
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:36,476
You're so fussy!

251
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:06,359
Hello?

252
00:17:07,436 --> 00:17:09,195
Hello, who's this?

253
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,033
But you called me first.

254
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,078
Look, if this is a prank,
I don't have any time for you.

255
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,189
No, this is Cindy.

256
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,231
Cindy?

257
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,626
Of BetCin.

258
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:25,399
Beth's ex...

259
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,005
Ah, that Cindy.

260
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:30,716
That Cindy...

261
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:31,878
What?

262
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:36,264
What? Did Beth ask you to call me?

263
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,140
No!

264
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:39,350
I mean...

265
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:43,022
well, she told me
you are not answering her calls.

266
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:48,033
So I was hoping I could...help.

267
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:51,529
Why don't you talk to her instead,

268
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,536
anyway, you're married right?

269
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,741
And stop dragging me into
whatever this is.

270
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,954
Why not remove that stick up your ass
and not try to be a complete bitch!

271
00:18:00,999 --> 00:18:04,541
No, I'm sorry, Kate.

272
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:06,327
Look, okay...

273
00:18:06,948 --> 00:18:12,244
Beth is doing everything
in this contest for you.

274
00:18:14,806 --> 00:18:16,641
She wants to please you.

275
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:20,266
She wants to give you
the apartment you want...

276
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,562
and everything else that you want in life.

277
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,680
We're not close so I don't know
what that is.

278
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:30,526
But whatever it is,

279
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,279
Beth can give it to you
through this contest.

280
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:39,702
And Beth is a nice person so,

281
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,331
she's just following my lead.

282
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,708
So what,

283
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,433
do you want me to forgive her right away?

284
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,308
I don't know,

285
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,066
that's your decision.

286
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,232
But what I'm asking you is,

287
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,848
please give her a chance.

288
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:04,769
Just talk to her.

289
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,981
Okay fine, I'll talk to her.

290
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,437
Actually, she's beside me now.

291
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:15,112
I'll give her the phone,

292
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,740
I'll leave you two.

293
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,370
Thank you.

294
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:27,207
Babe...

295
00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:30,589
Babe...

296
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:32,927
Babe,

297
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:37,176
I actually don't know what
explanation I should give to you,

298
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:39,595
but I want you to know,

299
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,306
I don't love Cindy anymore.

300
00:19:43,663 --> 00:19:46,133
I didn't know what to do with myself...

301
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:47,842
when you wouldn't talk to me last night.

302
00:19:49,786 --> 00:19:51,622
But I hope...

303
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,236
You give me another chance.

304
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,530
Please?

305
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,706
Babe...

306
00:20:04,589 --> 00:20:05,537
I don't know...

307
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,504
Sure, I will forgive you.

308
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:20,136
But right now, I need some space to think.

309
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:22,049
Okay,

310
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,014
that's enough.

311
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,063
Just don't close any doors.

312
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:35,749
Thank you for understanding.

313
00:20:36,732 --> 00:20:37,588
Bye.

314
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:39,697
Bye.

315
00:20:44,905 --> 00:20:47,502
Cindy!

316
00:20:50,704 --> 00:20:52,585
Thank you!

317
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,045
It's okay, we're okay.

318
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,130
She gave me an opening.

319
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,138
I can't here you.

320
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,305
Oh okay.

321
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:13,034
So, are you two back together?

322
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,077
How is it?

323
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:16,805
Not yet.
We're in a kind of relationship limbo,

324
00:21:16,846 --> 00:21:19,823
but she's willing to
give me another chance.

325
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,368
-That's good!
-Thank you.

326
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,001
That's good, right?

327
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:24,201
You still have a chance.

328
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,374
-Very good.
-Yeah.

329
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,959
But I cannot screw up again.

330
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,752
It might be my last chance.

331
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:36,504
Right. So, are you ready to make content?

332
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,981
Yeah, I'm in a good mood now.

333
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:45,346
Okay, I figured we should just
go live with the Baby Challenge,

334
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,539
that way we won't have to edit...

335
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,958
and it'll boost
our watch hours too, right?

336
00:21:50,999 --> 00:21:52,939
Sure, whatever it is that you want to do,

337
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,478
as long as it'll help us win,
I'll do it like I promised.

338
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,091
Thank you.

339
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:00,300
So what are we going to do?

340
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,155
Well, we need milk.

341
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,603
-Milk?
-Yeah, for the baby.

342
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:08,827
Okay.

343
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,705
Don't worry, we have Sally.

344
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,258
Who's Sally?

345
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,418
Sally, our shopping ally.

346
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:22,216
Cindy, our groceries here.

347
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,829
Wow, isn't Puregold Mobile so convenient?

348
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:30,015
Oh yes,

349
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:32,893
now with less time to do the groceries,

350
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,648
we have more time for the baby.

351
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:35,529
Right.

352
00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:41,007
-Baby!
-Baby!

353
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,199
Why is he crying?

354
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,034
The hell if I know.

355
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:52,871
Didn't it come with instructions
from the friend you borrowed it from?

356
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,541
You and your side comments...

357
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,421
Kidding.

358
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,375
It looks like he can't breathe...

359
00:22:57,821 --> 00:22:58,905
like his nose is clogged.

360
00:22:59,896 --> 00:23:00,962
Should we call a doctor?

361
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:04,258
-No, we should just unclog it.
-Let's call a doctor.

362
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,637
Okay, but can babies blow their nose?

363
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:11,182
Or maybe I should just press on it.

364
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,356
Wait no!

365
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:15,269
I'll check if there's an aspirator
inside the baby bag.

366
00:23:16,014 --> 00:23:18,689
Stop crying.

367
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,658
We will unclog it, okay?

368
00:23:24,699 --> 00:23:25,539
Wait.

369
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:27,335
Hey, faster.

370
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,868
I think his Mom forgot to
pack his aspirator.

371
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,535
So what are we going to do?

372
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,368
Well, my Mom used to say that
when I was a kid,

373
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,784
whenever I had a
hard time blowing my nose,

374
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:43,380
my Dad would suck out the mucus.

375
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:45,517
Okay, so?

376
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:46,687
So...

377
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,220
suck out his mucus.

378
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,819
Okay...wait, no!

379
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,861
That's like phlegm.

380
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,513
-Yuck!
-What?

381
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,684
It's just bodily fluid,

382
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,769
which I'm sure you're no stranger to.

383
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,501
Go!

384
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,781
-Just dive right in and suck out the...
-Don't say it anymore.

385
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:09,133
I keep imagining it!

386
00:24:09,174 --> 00:24:10,014
I'll do it.

387
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:12,316
Mucus.

388
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,818
Wait, why am I doing it and not you?

389
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,652
Come on, you can do it.

390
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,901
It's so easy. Just go for it.

391
00:24:25,642 --> 00:24:26,518
Oh my.

392
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,362
Are you sure about this?

393
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,344
Yes, just get it over with!

394
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:34,476
Baby...

395
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,318
-Baby...Mommy Beth loves you.
-I can still taste it.

396
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:49,279
If she didn't suck out your mucus,

397
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,739
you wouldn't be able to breathe.

398
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,660
-Sorry!
-Be quiet, you'll wake him up.

399
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,338
Sorry, I can still taste it.

400
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:01,087
You exaggerate.

401
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:07,256
But in fairness,
what you did was impressive.

402
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:11,510
Sucking mucus out of a
baby's nose is impressive now?

403
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:13,137
Of course,

404
00:25:14,028 --> 00:25:15,570
this is not your baby.

405
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,039
That is why I don't like babies,

406
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,756
you have to do irrational
things with babies.

407
00:25:37,185 --> 00:25:38,978
Good thing he's cute.

408
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:43,333
Well, I think that's love.

409
00:25:44,383 --> 00:25:47,177
It's stressful taking care of a baby.

410
00:25:48,866 --> 00:25:50,868
But you have to admit, you enjoyed it.

411
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,593
Right, baby?

412
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,265
Yeah I did,

413
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,267
he really is cute.

414
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,079
Shhh...don't wake him up.

415
00:26:07,927 --> 00:26:09,234
Beth, thank you.

416
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,989
I know you're just forced to do this.

417
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,034
I should be thanking you.

418
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,623
Because you're helping me with Kate.

419
00:26:26,937 --> 00:26:28,010
It's nothing.

420
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:31,086
I mean,

421
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:34,844
I'm just a girl talking to the other girl
who stole her girlfriend,

422
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,012
trying to convince her that
they should get back together.

423
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,055
That's nothing.

424
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:42,608
Whatever.

425
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,775
Next week on Betcin.

426
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,604
They say that if you want to know
where a relationship is heading,

427
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:23,607
sometimes, you must go back
to where and how it all started.

428
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,455
I'm so confused.

429
00:28:27,385 --> 00:28:29,291
This relationship is not working.
