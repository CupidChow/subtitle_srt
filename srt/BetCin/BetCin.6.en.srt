Previously on Betcin.

2
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:20,025
I should be thanking you.

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,590
Because you're helping me with Kate.

4
00:00:28,973 --> 00:00:29,974
It's nothing.

5
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:32,824
I mean,

6
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,871
I'm just a girl talking to the other girl
who stole her girlfriend,

7
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,845
trying to convince her that
they should get back together.

8
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:41,076
That's nothing.

9
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,544
Whatever.

10
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,965

00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:18,010
(NEVER HAVE I EVER)

14
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,540
Hi guys!

15
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,374
So you know Beth...

16
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:24,154
Hi!

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,624
-Remember her from my last vlog...
-Hi.

18
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,337
Hi.

19
00:01:28,654 --> 00:01:29,673
Isn't she something?

20
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:34,260
Anyway, today we're gonna make a content
and we call this...

21
00:01:34,473 --> 00:01:36,642
Never Have I...

22
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:38,110
(NEVER HAVE I...)

23
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:39,974
Ever!

24
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,195
Ever!

25
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:43,395
Look at my partner here,
not contributing anything.

26
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,355
I'm not used to all this.
What is it anyway?

27
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:47,465
Never Have I Ever,

28
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,652
well, I'm sure, you're all familiar
with the mechanics of this game...

29
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,071
but to make it different,
we're putting a slight twist.

30
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,637
So if your answer is never,

31
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:58,469
you have to drink whiskey...

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,567
So it's the other way around?

33
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,448
Yes.

34
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:01,686
Okay.

35
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:02,567
Game?

36
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,582
Game!

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,790
Game!

38
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:10,127
Never have I ever...

39
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,341
-Ever what?
-I can't concentrate!

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,467
Never have I ever...

41
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:20,741
Have a relationship with the opposite sex.

42
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,380
You know my answer to this...

43
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,507
Yes I do, so take a shot.

44
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,591
Okay!

45
00:02:27,787 --> 00:02:29,539
-Crap!
-You can do it!

46
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:34,518
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:35,671
Crap.

48
00:02:36,152 --> 00:02:38,279
How many boyfriends have you had?

49
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:40,696
Like...

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,579
Four.

51
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,087
That's a lot!

52
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,378
But I'm your only girlfriend, right?

53
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,464
Yes, the only one.

54
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,424
Aww, I feel so special.

55
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,800
Babe, can I have a kiss.

56
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,136
Can't look!

57
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,767
You can't look guys,
it's not allowed, guys!

58
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,352
Never have I ever...

59
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,147
cheated on someone in a relationship.

60
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,524
Ah...well...

61
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,567
Never, of course. Right?

62
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:17,530
Right?

63
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:24,581
Does that mean you...

64
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,123
No! I was so young and...

65
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,168
I didn't really know
what commitment meant.

66
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:31,545
Oh, okay.

67
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:33,127
Okay.

68
00:03:33,332 --> 00:03:34,256
And you?

69
00:03:38,071 --> 00:03:40,782
Never ever cheated!

70
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:42,932
I'm not a cheater guys.

71
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,307
-I'm loyal.
-Wow.

72
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,352
Straight. Confident.

73
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,980
-I'm impressed.
-Of course.

74
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,358
Every time I say never,
you have to give me a kiss.

75
00:03:54,507 --> 00:03:55,383
I'm sorry Babe.

76
00:03:56,314 --> 00:03:57,255
Sulked quickly.

77
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,010
Okay, it's my turn.

78
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,368
Never have I ever...

79
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,808
been crazy in love...

80
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,791
with someone like you.

81
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:19,351
Same.

82
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,596
-Same, I just can't chug it but, same.
-You drank too much, that's enough.

83
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:25,784
I'll drink it for you, babe.

84
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:29,672
I don't know
what it is about you babe but...

85
00:04:30,778 --> 00:04:32,836
everyday is just so full of life.

86
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:34,795
You're so full of surprises...

87
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,445
No day is the same.

88
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,317
And just because of that,

89
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:44,075
I think I wanna be with you forever.

90
00:04:53,555 --> 00:04:56,338
I love how you make me feel special.

91
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,178
Every minute that I am with you...

92
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,973
All your efforts to take care of me...

93
00:05:09,981 --> 00:05:12,687
You give in to what I want.

94
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:16,775
And you go along with
all my crazy antics like this.

95
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,368
Hey, we won't get to finish this!

96
00:05:23,086 --> 00:05:24,295
Love you love you love you.

97
00:05:24,336 --> 00:05:26,386
So it's my turn again?

98
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,330
No, me! My turn.

99
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,581
You've had two runs already,
so it's my turn.

100
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,132
Okay, fine.

101
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:36,044
Never have I ever...

102
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:42,217
lived in with the person
I'm in a relationship with?

103
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,405
Never?

104
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,363
Never.

105
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:48,849
Never.

106
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:52,228
Well that's about to change.

107
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,519
Don't finish that.

108
00:05:55,164 --> 00:05:57,357
There's something in your ear, babe.

109
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,199
What's this?

110
00:06:07,037 --> 00:06:08,618
Keycard to my place.

111
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,037
Babe,

112
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,999
I want you to move in with me.

113
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,892
Babe, serious?

114
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,618
Do I look like I'm joking?

115
00:06:20,996 --> 00:06:23,569
-Is this for real?
-You have my keycard now.

116
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,612
Yes, babe. I'm serious.

117
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:30,655
Thank you, babe.

(HOUSE TOUR)

119
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:36,922
Hi guys!

120
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,107
So as you know from my last vlog,

121
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,277
I decided to move in
with my girlfriend, Beth.

122
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:45,572
And since you all
requested for a house tour,

123
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:47,283
actually no one requested,

124
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,628
but I feel like you'd
all find this interesting...

125
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:51,838
So here it goes!

126
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,747
(HOUSE TOUR)

127
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,189
This is our kitchen...

128
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,070
(Our Kitchen)

129
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,836
This is where Beth cooks her specialty,

130
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,877
hot dogs and instant noodles.

131
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:03,903
Because she can't cook.

132
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,555
And here we have...

133
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:08,553
Oh! Hi, babe, say hello to everyone!

134
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:09,721
Hi!

135
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,224
What can you say babe?

136
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,063
Babe, can we turn that off for a minute
and just talk, please?

137
00:07:20,176 --> 00:07:22,448
Sorry guys, we just need to talk.

138
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,329
Fine.

139
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,745
Babe, I know you love vlogging,
and it's cool, I like it too,

140
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,207
but if it's possible,

141
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,042
let's keep our bedroom off-limits.

142
00:07:42,548 --> 00:07:46,377
Because as you know,
I like a little privacy,

143
00:07:46,418 --> 00:07:47,676
even if it's just in the bedroom.

144
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,264
The things that happen there,
the things that we do there...

145
00:07:53,692 --> 00:07:55,819
I just want them to be our thing alone.

146
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,560
Is that okay?

147
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:01,271
Fine.

148
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:03,819
-Are you sure?
-Your house, your rules.

149
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,522
Babe, don't say that, this is our house.

150
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,440
Ours.

151
00:08:08,005 --> 00:08:10,573
Babe, I get it,

152
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,863
of course you're not yet used to this...

153
00:08:13,904 --> 00:08:16,117
But you know, sooner or later,
this'll be like second nature to you.

154
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:17,106
I'll help you.

155
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:18,289
I'll hold your hand through this.

156
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:20,041
Okay.

157
00:08:20,892 --> 00:08:21,732
Thank you.

158
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,499
So...as I was saying,

159
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,709
this is our kitchen.

160
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:35,056
This is where Beth cooks her
hot dogs and instant noodles, my babe!

161
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,200
Hey, I also cook eggs.

162
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,147
That's it, because you don't
know how to cook anything else.

163
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,901
I don't need to learn how,
my babe is an excellent cook.

164
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,823
Yeah, but I'm sure,
no matter how great I am,

165
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,619
you still won't trade
your hot dogs and noodles for my cooking.

166
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:56,665
She's right...

167
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,745
it's the vetsin for me.

168
00:08:58,786 --> 00:08:59,800
See?

169
00:08:59,841 --> 00:09:00,681
So good!

170
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:04,561
What? Did I do something wrong?

171
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:08,238
Oh my gosh, that's it,
I just thought of it now.

172
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,198
What if we changed
the name of the channel?

173
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:17,014
Since they're always seeing the two of us
we can change it to...

174
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:19,476
BetCin!

175
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,060
-BetCin?
-Beth and Cindy!

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,523
-Oh, that's nice!
-BetCin Vlogs!

177
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,078
BetCin...

178
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:28,622
BetCin! Okay.

179
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,487
That's really good, babe!

180
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,116
-It's so good.
-But doesn't it seem too...salty?

181
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:39,583
It's not salty. It's...umami.

182
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,861
Flavorful!

183
00:09:42,694 --> 00:09:45,004
There! I knew it...Umami!

184
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,296
That's what we should call

-Umamis? Umami.
-Isn't it cute?

186
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:50,468
Hi Umamis!

187
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,300
-Hi Umamis!
-Hi Umamis!

188
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:56,389
-That's brilliant!
-Oh my gosh, this is going to be fun.

189
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,430
Sounds great.

190
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,830
Welcome to BetCin Vlogs, Umamis!

191
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,434
This is Beth...

192
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,039
And Cindy.

193
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:07,176
-Babe! I'm so excited!
-Congrats!

194
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:39,152

00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:45,395
(LET'S COOK SEAFOOD PAELLA)

196
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,789
Okay, and we're recording.

197
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:49,566
Okay.

198
00:10:50,604 --> 00:10:51,444
Oh sorry.

199
00:10:52,097 --> 00:10:53,494
Coming.

200
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:55,489
Okay so we're...

201
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,949
what do you call it again, babe?

202
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,408
-Boil. We're boiling.
-Yeah, boiling.

203
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,691
Okay, take two.

204
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:01,661
So I'm boiling the stock,

205
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,538
and it might take around 15 minutes.

206
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,387
While we're waiting for that,
of course we need to...

207
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:07,647
prepare the other ingredients, right?
But it's not boiling yet.

208
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,377
That's why I said 15 minutes!

209
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,881
Anyway we have peas, shrimp,

210
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,219
squid, tomatoes,

211
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,966
red bell pepper, onions,

212
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:20,484
and of course fresh mussels!

213
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,862
We got really big and juicy ones!

214
00:11:22,903 --> 00:11:24,098
Let's show it to them.

215
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,060
-Ummm...this is my favorite.
-Open it, babe.

216
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,440
-Babe! We're a wholesome channel!
-What?

217
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,816
I'm really quite fond of mussels!

218
00:11:32,473 --> 00:11:33,331
Babe...

219
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,236
As you can see...

220
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,615
Babe wait...

221
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,575
Let's just do that later...

222
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:43,343
Let's end this.

223
00:11:43,656 --> 00:11:45,414
Babe come on!

224
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,548
Bye guys!

225
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:47,624
I'll have Cindy for myself first!

226
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:50,793
Let me see.

227
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,418
Babe, everytime I hit on refresh,

228
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,872
our engagement keeps going up.

229
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:58,248
Almost 10,000 already.

230
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,430
Oh my God!

231
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,682
-Wild!
-Your ideas are good.

232
00:12:05,493 --> 00:12:06,519
Is it trending?

233
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,519
It's trending. Super trending.

234
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:10,313
(SPICY NOODLES CHALLENGE)

235
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,697
Babe, I can't feel my tongue!

236
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,907
It's really super spicy,
my beloved Umamis!

237
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,325
How can we ever finish this?

238
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,578
There...

239
00:12:27,028 --> 00:12:28,071
I'll fix it babe.

240
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,709
There...

241
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,923
That's a lot!

242
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,428
Wow, my babe is so pretty.

243
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,350
Look! She's the most beautiful...

244
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,018
Hey!

245
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,019
She's the most beautiful...

246
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,897
-You're not allowed in here!
-You think I can't get you?

247
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,109
Look what you did to me!

248
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:02,115
You're not allowed in here!

249
00:13:05,713 --> 00:13:09,592
Okay, fine. Can I just get a hug.

250
00:13:15,205 --> 00:13:17,207
Hey! That's enough!

251
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,947
I love you.

252
00:13:28,377 --> 00:13:31,394
Hey babe! How's work?

253
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,855
It's fine.

254
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:39,193
Are you good?

255
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:41,279
Yup.

256
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:47,838
Babe,

257
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,582
did you pay our internet bill?

258
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,292
It was due yesterday,

259
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,751
they might cut off our service.

260
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:57,409
It slipped my mind,

261
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,047
I'll take care of it in a while.

262
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,262
Babe,

263
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,794
have you seen our last vlog?

264
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,013
We got a lot of dislikes and
negative comments.

265
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,772
Like this one, from Binibining_MariKate.

266
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:13,071
Ugh, corny ass username!

267
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:15,207
Anyway, look what she said.

268
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,065
Totally scripted,

269
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,685
Beth is not a good actress,

270
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,569
she needs to go through
an acting workshop.

271
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,486
Babe, we need to answer this.

272
00:14:23,636 --> 00:14:26,134
Stop reading that,
you'll just stress yourself out.

273
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,017
You know it's not true.

274
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:29,170
No babe, she might
end up influencing others,

275
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,752
our following could take a hit.

276
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,914
Babe, you're the one who said...

277
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,918
that we reached 60K subscribers
in one year and six months,

278
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,461
you said that's a big feat.

279
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:40,467
We don't need to worry about that.

280
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:45,741
Here's another one
from Bininibing_Marikate.

281
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,435
Cindy has no regard for Beth's feelings,

282
00:14:49,476 --> 00:14:52,512
she's totally using her
for her narcissistic content.

283
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:53,788
What?

284
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:55,353
Me, a narcissist?

285
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:57,355
Unbelievable!

286
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,357
Like I said just ignore it.

287
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,361
Don't stress yourself out.

288
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,612
Please? It's not true, okay?

289
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:06,151
You know what babe,

290
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:10,368
this Binibining_MariKate is our basher,

291
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,829
she's commenting
negatively on all of our vlogs.

292
00:15:14,242 --> 00:15:15,537
I think she has a crush on me.

293
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:16,418
Wow!

294
00:15:16,803 --> 00:15:18,626
And you just said you're not narcissistic.

295
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,087
I need to monitor these bashers.

296
00:15:23,082 --> 00:15:25,031
I think I made the right decision.

297
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:28,700
Now I can give our channel
my 100 percent full attention.

298
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:30,890
What do you mean?

299
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,390
What do you mean, full attention?

300
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,562
I resigned from my job, babe.

301
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:48,155
Babe, I asked you earlier how was work
and you said it was fine.

302
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,450
Now you're telling me you quit?

303
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:54,120
Why didn't you tell...

304
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,872
when were you planning on telling me?

305
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,066
Relax babe. I'm telling you now.

306
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,593
I resigned, it was my last day today.

307
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:10,302
I just feel like I could use all
my creative juices on our vlogs instead.

308
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:13,240
And now that it has my
100 percent full attention,

309
00:16:13,281 --> 00:16:15,516
I can grow our subscriber
base exponentially, don't you think?

310
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:22,277
Okay, it sounds reasonable but
you could've given me a heads up.

311
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:25,234
So it doesn't take me by surprise.

312
00:16:29,326 --> 00:16:30,239
I mean,

313
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,618
we agreed to go half
on the bills here, right?

314
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:37,747
Don't get mad...

315
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:42,962
I didn't tell you sooner because
you always say I'm not practical.

316
00:16:43,607 --> 00:16:46,380
Don't worry babe,
as long as we make quality content,

317
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,799
the bills will pay for themselves.

318
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,766
I can already see it 100K subscribers!

319
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:54,514
That's how optimistic I am about this.

320
00:16:57,992 --> 00:16:59,018
Okay.

321
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,188
I'm gonna support you on this, okay?

322
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:03,856
I won't argue anymore.

323
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:05,261
Yes!

324
00:17:05,605 --> 00:17:07,360
That's why I love you so much!

325
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:08,945
Thank you, babe.

326
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,366
Okay, so for our next content,

327
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:16,536
we'll do a Question and Answer,
no holds barred.

328
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,288
As in, whatever our beloved Umamis
ask us, we'll answer.

329
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,814
Can you explain no holds barred, please?

330
00:17:22,855 --> 00:17:23,981
No holds barred as in...

331
00:17:24,473 --> 00:17:26,402
What do you usually fight about?

332
00:17:26,443 --> 00:17:28,297
Have you ever thought of separating?

333
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:32,196
You know,
what's your favorite sexual position?

334
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,763
Okay babe, no.

335
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,432
No, no.
That's too much information.

336
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,965
Come on, babe. The Umamis love that.

337
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:43,271
They love it when we share our life
experiences with them, don't they?

338
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,939
They're like our family.

339
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,277
So we should share
every milestone of our lives.

340
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,321
Our ups, our downs, our in-betweens.

341
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,158
Babe, your family doesn't
even know you're a lesbian.

342
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,790
Okay, let's talk about that
some other time.

343
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,611
I don't want to do this, okay?
I feel exposed.

344
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:05,837
I'm not comfortable.

345
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,201
I thought you'd support me?

346
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:17,763
Babe...

347
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,921
Babe...

348
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,435
Babe!

349
00:18:26,475 --> 00:18:27,523
Fine.

350
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:30,860
-Really?
-Yes.

351
00:18:31,422 --> 00:18:32,320
Really?

352
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,781
Even our favorite sexual position?

353
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,356
Okay, that's fine.

354
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,878
-Okay, on one condition.
-Okay.

355
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,455
Please take care of our Internet bill.

356
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,208
Okay, paying that right now.

357
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,625
-Okay, good.
-Okay.

358
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,090
Alright.

359
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:59,430
Internet is paid.

360
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:02,933
Babe?

361
00:19:04,241 --> 00:19:05,099
Yes?

362
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:07,730
I don't have enough funds.

363
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:12,026
My last paycheck
won't come in till Friday.

364
00:19:12,607 --> 00:19:15,781
Can you cover the internet bill for now,
please?

365
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:19,116
Sure.

366
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:20,964
Sure.

367
00:19:21,005 --> 00:19:22,006
Thanks, babe.

368
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,534
Let's have the Q and A?

369
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:24,972
Are you ready?

370
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:28,479
BetCin Vlogs 100K subscribers!

371
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,170
Yes, Mr. King?

372
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,174
Actually, you can check it out today,

373
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,591
we have an open house today.

374
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,680
Of course, I can come with you,

375
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,929
of course, that's easy.

376
00:19:41,956 --> 00:19:43,974
What's the best time?

377
00:19:44,782 --> 00:19:45,638
Hello?

378
00:19:46,695 --> 00:19:47,570
Hello?

379
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,166
Babe! What the hell?

380
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:56,320
It's a prank! It's a prank, babe!

381
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:59,330
Can't you see I'm working? Hello...

382
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:01,367
It's a success.

383
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,160
(SCARY MONSTER PRANK)

384
00:20:21,298 --> 00:20:22,299
Let's sleep.

385
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,495
Wait,

386
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,457
we have such an
active and engaged following.

387
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,063
We're such a hit...

388
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,484
Oh my gosh...they give the best comments.

389
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:46,120
Babe! Look at our new merch!

390
00:20:48,635 --> 00:20:50,249
That's a lot.

391
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:53,586
I thought we're cash-strapped?

392
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,297
You're being negative again.

393
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,467
Babe, we have to
spend money to earn money.

394
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:02,323
Don't be such a killjoy!

395
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:05,389
You want coffee?

396
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:17,568
Yes!

397
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,495
Babe, I thought you're going to cook?

398
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,412
Sorry babe,

399
00:21:32,453 --> 00:21:34,691
I had to prepare for our next vlog.

400
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:37,151
It's a make-up tutorial,
I was getting a lot of requests.

401
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,050
But what about my request.

402
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:53,354
Babe, don't feel bad.

403
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,461
Why don't you just eat this
then help me with the vlog.

404
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:05,798
Okay.

405
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:07,591
This is good anyway.

406
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:13,231
Oh wait.

407
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:15,246
Hold this...

408
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,379
Yes.

409
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:35,082
Hi guys.

410
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,189
As you can see,

411
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,815
I just woke up.

412
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:44,237
And this is my babe.

413
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,409
Good morning, babe.

414
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,584
Hey.

415
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:51,942
What the hell.

416
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:53,109
What?

417
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,376
You just woke up and
you're already in a foul mood?

418
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,878
Oh my god why are you vlogging,

419
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,719
you're right, I just woke up!

420
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,179
I still have dried saliva on my mouth and
you're already vlogging?

421
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:05,175
It's a 'woke up like this' vlog!

422
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,427
But I thought we agreed
no vlogging in the bedroom?

423
00:23:08,026 --> 00:23:10,612
Where do you want me to shoot a
'woke up like this' video, in the toilet?

424
00:23:13,537 --> 00:23:15,311
Whatever.

425
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,900
You woke up fully made up? Sheesh.

426
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,341
Okay so today, we're going to do
the 24-hour Ignoring Challenge,

427
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,648
Beth's here so...

428
00:24:11,845 --> 00:24:14,411
Babe, have you seen the comments
on our Question and Answer vlog?

429
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,546
I'm going to read it okay?

430
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:20,334
It says...

431
00:24:21,422 --> 00:24:27,049
You don't have to broadcast
how you have sex!

432
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,263
I told you I was uncomfortable,
can we delete it?

433
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,771
Look, there's another one okay,

434
00:24:39,787 --> 00:24:41,372
from Binibining_MariKate.

435
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,567
Beth looks unhappy,

436
00:24:46,576 --> 00:24:48,870
looks like she's just forced...

437
00:24:49,445 --> 00:24:51,697
and she's being overpowered by Cindy.

438
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,702
Problematic content
for problematic people.

439
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,329
She's saying we're problematic.

440
00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:01,000
Babe!

441
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:07,214
So are we playing a guessing game again?

442
00:25:09,358 --> 00:25:10,532
You know what,

443
00:25:10,573 --> 00:25:13,178
I'm done guessing whatever it is
that's running in your head.

444
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:16,311
The comments are right.

445
00:25:17,172 --> 00:25:19,143
What they're saying
about our vlog was right.

446
00:25:21,614 --> 00:25:22,948
I don't seem happy,

447
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,315
I am not happy!

448
00:25:26,924 --> 00:25:29,362
You're overpowering me,
I just keep following your lead.

449
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,112
I'm the one who always adjusts.

450
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,534
I've supported you, right?

451
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,332
In everything that you want to do.

452
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:42,624
And it sucks that
I have to fight for your attention.

453
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,337
It's so exhausting.

454
00:25:49,402 --> 00:25:50,966
I'm so confused.

455
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,385
This relationship is not working.

456
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,408
You know what,

457
00:25:55,449 --> 00:25:56,928
I don't want to do it like this,

458
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,516
-but I think we should break up.
-It's a prank!

459
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:03,099
24-hour Ignoring Challenge.

460
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,586
You're still thinking of your vlog,
instead of me?

461
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,778
I didn't know you have a lot of issues.

462
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,244
You weren't saying anything.

463
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,831
So I guess, this is 'real' talk?

464
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:27,086
You see that I'm all rattled,

465
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,152
yet you're still thinking about your vlog?

466
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,301
Are you serious, what's your problem?

467
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:36,156
Okay wait,

468
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:41,266
before we continue talking,
is this real or are we acting?

469
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:43,643
-What do you think?
-Hi!

470
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,068
You've said some really hurtful words!

471
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:48,691
But that's what I don't get,

472
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,355
are we being real now?

473
00:26:50,396 --> 00:26:51,981
Or is this for content?

474
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:55,073
I don't even know the difference anymore.

475
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,282
I don't know where
this relationship is headed.

476
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,064
What do you mean?

477
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:02,205
We're almost at 400K subscribers!

478
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:03,163
What?

479
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:08,230
Is that how you measure
the success of this relationship?

480
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,470
Well,

481
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,592
if that's it then congratulations!

482
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,468
Bravo!

483
00:27:15,808 --> 00:27:16,684
Great job!

00:34:22,964 --> 00:34:25,967
Crap!

545
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:27,328
Crap.

546
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,444
Please, this is just sex,

547
00:34:31,485 --> 00:34:33,141
I won't force you to be my girlfriend,
okay?

548
00:34:37,232 --> 00:34:38,275
I cheated.

549
00:34:39,981 --> 00:34:41,043
I cheated on Cindy.

550
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:42,877
I was never a cheater before.

551
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,724
Never say never, babe.

552
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,884
Just when we thought
we know ourselves fully,

553
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,514
life just makes us realize
who we really are.

554
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:20,327
It's nice knowing you Beth,
even for a short while.

555
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:27,959
Is this goodbye?

556
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:30,545
I don't know.

557
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,300
Is it?

558
00:35:43,963 --> 00:35:45,977
(PRESENT DAY...)

559
00:36:01,666 --> 00:36:03,932
(DELETE MEMORIES WITH
BETH MAE ZAMORA?)

560
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:17,380
On the last two episodes of Betcin.

561
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,544
Polygraph services, ma'am.

562
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,055
Lie detector.

563
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,515
Are you ready?

564
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,160
Ready.

565
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:28,261
Cindy...

566
00:36:30,147 --> 00:36:32,982
-Please go away.
-Don't close the door on me.

567
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:36,319
Hi Umamis!

568
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:42,047
So we are live today because
we have a very important announcement.
