1
00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,016
Previously on Betcin.

2
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:18,238
I want us to get married.

3
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,478
I want to be your first.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,604
I love you.

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,189
That will happen.

6
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,399
We're gonna get married.

7
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,192
You want in Europe?

8
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,354
Ask yourself,

9
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:39,748
why are you truly doing this?

10
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,295
Beth all I'm asking you
is to please fight for BetCin.

11
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,964
Maybe you could?

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,099
Babe, you have to believe me.

13
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,276
You're the one that I want.
You're the one I love.

14
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,896
Did you just realize what you did there?

15
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,191
You promised me love
right after your wedding.

16
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,150
Unbelievable!

17
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,236
But that wedding's fake, I told you.

18
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,073
It was all for show, it wasn't real.

19
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,285
One peppermint tea grande
and one cold brew for Beth.

20
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,120
Beth's here.

21
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:24,876
What's the point of disguising
when you gave your name to the barista?

22
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,758
Thanks.

23
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,551
Thank you.

24
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,933
Babe, like I was saying,

25
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,436
it was just a ceremony...

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:44,979
Yes, hello?

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,941
Okay, just send me the lab results.

28
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,028
Yes, and please lower
the dosage of Amox on IV.

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,613
Six, every six hours.

30
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,325
Please monitor the patient's vitals.

31
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,369
Alright. Thank you, bye.

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Now that you're married,

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,083
am I officially your mistress?

34
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,669
No, of course not!

35
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,714
It's not a real wedding,
it was for show, okay?

36
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,509
When I get the prize money…

37
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,387
we're the ones
who're going to get married.

38
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,579
Like we talked about.

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,264
Where do you want to get married?

40
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:24,686
France, US, Europe, take your pick.

41
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,938
Anywhere where same-sex
marriage is allowed, right?

42
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,399
We're gonna get married, that's our plan.

43
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,824
I'm sorry, I know you're upset...

44
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,201
but you have to see...

45
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,829
Hey, are you Beth?

46
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,310
Beth of BetCin?

47
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,185
I knew it, it's you!

48
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:52,209
I'm an Umami! Look!

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,842
Thanks man, but please stop shouting.

50
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,343
I'm sorry,

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,596
I'm such a big fan.

52
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,057
Are you working on a content here?

53
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:08,730
Also, why is Cindy not here?

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,149
Where is she?

55
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:17,221
Oh, I think you have
a big surprise for her.

56
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,141
Or maybe this is a prank.

57
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:23,786
It's a prank!

58
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,410
Where's the camera?

59
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,187
Where's the camera?

60
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,502
Please let me be a part of your vlog!

61
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,088
We're not shooting a content,

62
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,050
I'm just here to talk to a friend.

63
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,469
A friend?

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,805
Kate, Beth's friend.

65
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,515
Hello.

66
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,399
Can we take a picture?

67
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,145
-Can we take a picture?
-Okay.

68
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:53,636
My wife will definitely love this.

69
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,196
There…

70
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,262
Oh no, this looks bad.

71
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:07,038
I look so big from this angle.

72
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,165
Will you take a picture of us?

73
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,500
No problem.

74
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,256
Okay, smile!

75
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,509
One, two, three!

76
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,388
Is this okay?

77
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,269
This is beautiful!

78
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,687
Perfect!

79
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:37,652
My wife and I are really fond
of watching your vlogs.

80
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:44,284
We can see ourselves
in you even though you're dykes.

81
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,535
Lesbians.

82
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,667
Huh?

83
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,830
Nothing.

84
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,959
So, I'm just curious,
in your relationship, which one is Beth?

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,294
That's my wife.

86
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:56,932
Because she's a killjoy.

87
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,382
I'm more of a Cindy!

88
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,427
But I'm not a killjoy.

89
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,512
I agree.

90
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,308
By the way, have you seen
their wedding video already?

91
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:15,064
-Wasn't it so romantic?
-Yes. And when we saw it,

92
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,026
I asked my wife to marry me again.

93
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,862
And she said yes, immediately.

94
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,726
Just like Beth,
she said yes immediately too.

95
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,784
Hey man, thanks for the support,

96
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,038
and I wish you and your wife
a long and healthy relationship.

97
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
Thank you.

98
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,876
It feels like you want me
to leave already.

99
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,919
But that's okay…

100
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,589
nice meeting you, Beth.

101
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,958
Nice meeting you.

102
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,762
You really are an inspiration for us,

103
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:52,018
and I hope you win
the #RelationshipGoals contest.

104
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:56,314
And for your friend here...

105
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,361
nice meeting you.

106
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,499
Babe, I think we need to move
so we can really talk.

107
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,501
Can we stop this bullshit, Beth.

108
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,754
No more lies, no more
pretending for social media.

109
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,632
Find the true answer in your heart.

110
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,511
Just be honest and tell me,

111
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,180
do you still have feelings for Cindy?

112
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,562
Babe,

113
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,393
Cindy and I were together for so long,

114
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,399
it's still hard for me
to see that she's miserable.

115
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,527
It's like muscle memory for me...

116
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,904
that I always have to cheer her up.

117
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,657
But that doesn't mean
I want her or I love her.

118
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,583
Because that's you.
You're the one that i want.

119
00:06:50,002 --> 00:06:51,615
You're the one that I love.

120
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,209
Why didn't you answer that?

121
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,211
It's not important.

122
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,923
How will you know if you don't pick up?

123
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,094
Nothing is more important to me right now
than this talk. And you.

124
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,929
I don't want to lose you.

125
00:07:11,438 --> 00:07:15,852
Will you give me five more days,
just five more days.

126
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,771
I just need the prize money and I'm done!

127
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,273
I'm done with Cindy, it's over!

128
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:21,983
You know what,

129
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,990
I really want to understand you,

130
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,285
that's why I said yes to this set-up.

131
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,999
But it feels like
you're doing these things with Cindy,

132
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,709
because you're stuck with her.

133
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,669
-It's not true.
-You're so consumed by her,

134
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,129
you can't even get out.

135
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,548
It's not true.

136
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,717
Can you please answer that?

137
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,847
I'm sorry. Wait.

138
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,349
-What time are you coming home?
-What?

139
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,895
Why are you not wearing
your shades and hoodie?

140
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,105
I thought we agreed that
you're going to wear a disguise

141
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,065
because someone might see you with Kate?

142
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,027
Can you call me later, I'm busy.

143
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,154
So what time are you coming home?

144
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,166
Why are you smiling?

145
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,169
Have you forgiven me?

146
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,172
I can't believe I'm saying this,

147
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:28,354
but fine, alright.

148
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:30,208
Five days, Beth.

149
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,141
What?

150
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,514
I'll give you five days
to end that foolishness.

151
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,976
You only have five days
to end all this nonsense.

152
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,269
-This is your last chance.
-Okay.

153
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:41,779
Okay, five days, I promise.

154
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:42,903
Promise.

155
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,322
But please...

156
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,068
prove yourself to me,

157
00:08:47,675 --> 00:08:50,010
because I won't settle
for any breadcrumbs anymore.

158
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,490
That's why I chose you, babe.

159
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:54,367
I love you.

160
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,078
I love you Cindy. I love...

161
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,208
No babe, I didn't mean that!

162
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:07,213
I didn't mean that!
Please don't go.

163
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,382
Wait!

164
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:11,932
Babe,

165
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,096
Babe, wait up please!

166
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,430
I'm sorry,

167
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,266
-I can't do this anymore.
-Babe, no!

168
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,977
I'm breaking up with you.

169
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,021
This is me helping your loveteam!

170
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,481
No, what are you talking about?

171
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,650
-Bye!
-Babe, please!

172
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,079
Babe!

173
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,867
What you did is wrong!

174
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,161
You're cheating on Cindy!

175
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,435
You left her!

176
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:43,640
How dare you do that to her?

177
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,257
I hate you!

178
00:09:46,466 --> 00:09:47,754
I hate you!

179
00:09:48,067 --> 00:09:49,801
I hate you...

180
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,009
I hate you!

181
00:10:32,112 --> 00:10:35,338
=BETCIN=

182
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,486
Hi babe!

183
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,822
What the hell is this?

184
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,868
Hey… I've been practicing this for hours.

185
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,086
For what?

186
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,498
For tonight.

187
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,251
Oh my god.

188
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,170
Cindiy, I'm confused.

189
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,924
Babe, our rankings went up.

190
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,883
But we're still in third place,

191
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,970
so we need to do everything
and make a push for the top spot.

192
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,127
Cindy, I'm not in the mood.

193
00:11:22,211 --> 00:11:23,599
Can you please just leave me alone?

194
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:28,229
-Are you trying to play hard to get?
-No, that's not what I'm doing.

195
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,737
Cindy, I said not now!

196
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,027
We need to do this now
coz we just got married.

197
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,662
So naturally, we should be
on our honeymoon.

198
00:11:36,772 --> 00:11:37,987
Honeymoon! What the heck!

199
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,740
Wait, you're so heavy!

200
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,159
The Umamis are waiting for this,
they're all excited.

201
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,286
What are you trying to do?
Live sex!

202
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,623
Of course not!
Our branding's still wholesome.

203
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,585
But we need to tease our followers
and subscribers a little bit.

204
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,339
-Oh my god! You're crazy.
-Let's go babe!

205
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,207
This is too much! Stop it.

206
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,967
-Cindy!
-Babe, I don't have any undies…

207
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,385
Then get one from the drawer.

208
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,761
I'm wet babe.

209
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,916
Oh my god, damn!

210
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,639
Where's the camera, this is a prank.

211
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,267
There are no cameras, not yet.

212
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,145
But if that's what you want,
I'm also on for it.

213
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,939
Cindy, haven't you forgotten that
we're only doing this for money, right?

214
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,863
I know!

215
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,902
Don't tell me you're wet,
or that you don't have panties on.

216
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,112
Get off me!

217
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,990
But it's true, I don't have undies on.

218
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,908
All my panties are in the laundry.

219
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,702
And I'm wet because...

220
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:26,120
I just had a shower.

221
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,777
You want to check?

222
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,067
Stop it!

223
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,667
-What?
-Whatever, you're crazy.

224
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,043
Not like your other babe…

225
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,088
you know what,
tell her she's so insecure!

226
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,591
She just have to bear with it
for a little while and be more patient.

227
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,761
She shouldn't have all these complaints.

228
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,462
This is just for the contest...

229
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,313
-Will you shut it! We've broken up.
-We're talking about millions...

230
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,435
We're done.

231
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,649
So just, stop it.

232
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,085
What were you expecting, a wedding gift?

233
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,921
You had it coming Beth.

234
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,346
Wow.

235
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,258
Thanks for being a good friend.

236
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,515
I'm so lucky to have you.

237
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:24,125
You're so supportive.

238
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:26,821
Believe me, friend,

239
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,141
what you need is not someone who gets you,

240
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,852
but who will slap the truth into you so
you'll wake up and finally leave Cindy.

241
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,521
Damn, what am I going to do?

242
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,149
Kate is not responding
to my texts or calls.

243
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,277
I've been calling her
but she's not picking up.

244
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:46,915
Hey,

245
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,495
are you listening to me?

246
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah yeah…

247
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,793
look, if she's not answering,
what's stopping you from going to her?

248
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:02,216
What are you doing?
Are you taking your clothes off?

249
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,886
Dude, I am on a date, okay?

250
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,904
She's coming out of the shower
any moment now.

251
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,017
What the... This is an emergency
and you're having sex on cam.

252
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,776
Okay.

253
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,259
Beth, I am sorry.

254
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,568
You know that I love you, okay?

255
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,487
But no one can help you here but yourself.

256
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,865
And every second
you spend on this video call,

257
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:29,910
is every second you're wasting not trying
to win Kate back. Okay?

258
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:34,671
Hey!

259
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,294
So just go!

260
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,129
Go to Kate's place.

261
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,755
Plead...

262
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,366
serenade her, grovel,

263
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,009
I don't know, just do everything...

264
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:52,016
and don't stop until she decides
to give you another chance. Okay?

265
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,815
Okay.

266
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,817
Okay. You can do this.

267
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,521
Love you, okay thanks, bye.

268
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,773
Bye.

269
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,818
Are you ready, Simon?

270
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,992
Oh dude… come here.

271
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,078
Where are you going?

272
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,164
Why did you break up, what’s the reason?

273
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,833
You already know that.
Will you let me go.

274
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:19,153
-No, you're too emotional right now...
-Just let me go.

275
00:15:19,237 --> 00:15:20,502
We both know that when you're
like this you become reckless.

276
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,130
-I will not let you out in this state.
-Let's not make this situation any worse.

277
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,049
-You lose your cool and...
-And just let me go!

278
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,887
See, you're doing it right now,
exactly my point!

279
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,806
Sorry, but if you're not
letting me come with you...

280
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,850
then we're both stuck here in the house.

281
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,354
This is all your fault,
we never should have joined that contest.

282
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,189
Simon's right,

283
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,982
I don't know why I always
go along with your plans.

284
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,317
Because you trust me!

285
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,694
You know that my content ideas work.

286
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,612
Look at our last upload, the wedding...

287
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,948
You don't understand,
I don't care about that.

288
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
I bring you success.

289
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,503
I don't care!

290
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,955
We've broken up already, we shouldn't
mind each other anymore. We're over!

291
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,540
I just want us to win.

292
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,585
You know how competitive I can get,
I want to fight for what's mine.

293
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,462
What do you mean "what's yours"?

294
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,172
What the hell are you talking about?

295
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,675
The prize!

296
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,095
And I know you want that too
for your future with Kate.

297
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,973
Doesn't she get it?
You briefed her, right?

298
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,142
That this is all
for content purposes only.

299
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,270
I informed her.

300
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:21,313
So, do we need a whole powerpoint
presentation to explain it to her?

301
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,899
I need to go so I can talk to Kate.

302
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,528
Are you sure that sex won't fix things?

303
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,113
Can you please stop!

304
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,073
No, you're not leaving!

305
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:32,950

00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,841
No, that's enough. Let me have that.

361
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,260
Beth…

362
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,520
Enough please.

363
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:56,680
Don't ever leave me, please…

364
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,861
Don't leave me...

365
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,266
Beth, she texted!

366
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,039
Wow, you really wished she did, huh?

367
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,459
You're always playing with my emotions…

368
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:20,255
I just want to make you laugh...

369
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,757
-Well it's not funny.
-I hate seeing you like this...

370
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,885
That's not funny!

371
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,428
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,311
What? Now you're going to embrace me?

373
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,356
You know what,

374
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:43,487
I think I'm destined to die alone.

375
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,408
No one will ever love me.

376
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:51,912
Maybe I don't know how to love…

377
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,497
that's why people leave me
and don't come back.

378
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,041
Am I that difficult to love?

379
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,168
No, you're not.

380
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,379
Loving you is easy.

381
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,092
In fact,
that makes your partners complacent.

382
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,303
They take you for granted.

383
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,517
But don't say you're alone, you're not.

384
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,436
Even though you cheated on me,

385
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,815
-I'm still here beside you.
-Oh yes, I'm a cheater too…

386
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,532
I don't want to be miserable! Damn!

387
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,078
I just want to sing.

388
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,706
-Let me sing some more.
-Will you relax, please?

389
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,085
I don't want to be alone.

390
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,138
Just get some rest.

391
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,437
I need to talk to Kate.

392
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:01,815
Babe...

393
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,071
Babe.

394
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,114
Beth…

395
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,616
I need to talk to Kate.

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,661
Kate is calling.

397
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:21,710
Babe?

398
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,920
Babe,

399
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:25,803
Babe,

400
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,009
Thank you for calling me.

401
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:34,681
I know that you don't want to talk
to me, just listen to me, please.

402
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,726
I just want to let you know that...

403
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:42,689
when you said you're leaving me,

404
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,277
I didn't know what to do.

405
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,491
I just want you to know that...

406
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,704
you're the one I look forward to everyday.

407
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:04,927
Because whenever I talk to you,

408
00:25:05,828 --> 00:25:07,608
I feel safe.

409
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,805
I feel like I'm not alone.

410
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,642
I feel safe.

411
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,229
I feel loved.

412
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,526
Are you still there?

413
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,071
Why aren't you saying anything?

414
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,741
I know,

415
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:40,914
you asked me
if I still have feelings for Cindy…

416
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:46,572
I'll be honest and say…

417
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:50,057
Yes...

418
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,218
and I don't know why…

419
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,678
But...

420
00:25:57,255 --> 00:26:00,258
I swear! You're the one that I love.

421
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,646
If I were to choose, I'll choose you.

422
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,898
It's really you.

423
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,526
So please don't leave me…

424
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,923
Don't leave me.

425
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,209
Don't leave me.

426
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,375
Please, give me another chance.

427
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,695
Cindy!

428
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:31,843
She left me.

429
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,793
Babe, wait.

430
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,547
I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.

431
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,714
I'm breaking up with you.

432
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:55,938
No, I don't want to.

433
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,219
This is me helping your loveteam!

434
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,221
Hey, wake up!

435
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,264
Beth! Hey!

436
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,058
BetCin is losing subscribers!

437
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,854
This is all your fault,
you even made a scene in public, really!

438
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:10,903
Wake up!

439
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,566
Beth...

440
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,986
Damn you! Beth!

441
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,406
Next on Betcin.

442
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,617
Cindy, who's pregnant?

443
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,494
I am pregnant.

444
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:28,832
Hey!

445
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,375
Beth!
