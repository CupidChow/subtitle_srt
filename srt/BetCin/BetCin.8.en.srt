1
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,225
Previously on Betcin.

2
00:00:17,965 --> 00:00:21,177
The last nine days of the contest
was a roller coaster ride.

3
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,072
You said yes.

4
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,108
What the heck!

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,737
We joined for the prize money.

6
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:34,557
But I think we got something better.

7
00:00:41,506 --> 00:00:44,176
Is it goodbye millions for Betcin?

8
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:50,342
Can we still fool ourselves
for less than a day?

9
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,286
Let's do the right thing Beth.

10
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,402
Let's just admit to the world that
we are a fraud.

11
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:09,514
Are you okay?

12
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:12,178
Are you ready to delete
our social media memories?

13
00:01:16,813 --> 00:01:17,661
No.

14
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,915
Why? What's wrong?

15
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:28,714
What if we delete something
that might be important to me.

16
00:01:30,293 --> 00:01:31,133
Beth,

17
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:34,151
these are social media memories,

18
00:01:34,192 --> 00:01:37,403
not your birth certificate
or driver's license.

19
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:41,018
So what could you
possibly need in the future?

20
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,063
The memories!

21
00:01:48,915 --> 00:01:51,653
That could turn out to be
important to me in the future.

22
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:54,155
Beth,

23
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:55,407
I know you,

24
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:58,355
once you start keeping a picture,

25
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:00,078
you'll keep one more,

26
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,749
and then another, and then another,

27
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,875
until you'll end up not deleting
our social media memories.

28
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:08,432
It defeats the purpose
of what we're doing.

29
00:02:11,043 --> 00:02:11,923
I know...

30
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:16,053
so, let's just not do it.

31
00:02:20,942 --> 00:02:21,782
You know what,

32
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,019
I don't get you.

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,446
Ten days ago,
you're asking for a break up.

34
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,318
And then you're the one
who initially wanted...

35
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:33,069
to delete our social
media memories, right?

36
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,239
Now that I'm giving it to you...

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,489
It's different.

38
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,867
I had Kate then.

39
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,578
I had someone to love.

40
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,997
We had plans.

41
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:46,978
We had a future that
we were going to build together.

42
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,465
Do you want me to help you
create a dating app profile?

43
00:02:54,314 --> 00:02:56,524
So you can find someone you can love.

44
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,786
I don't know what to do with myself.

45
00:02:59,827 --> 00:03:02,307
I'll have nothing left. I'm losing you.

46
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,559
I've lost Kate.

47
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,735
I'll have nowhere to be
when you leave here.

48
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:12,689
You'll stay in this condo.
This is yours anyway.

49
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,565
I don't want it if you're not in it.

50
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,280
I'll just end up missing you.

51
00:03:17,726 --> 00:03:20,113
Memories of us will haunt me.

52
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:21,572
Memories of BetCin.

53
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,580
I'll just have a hard time moving on.

54
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:28,335
Well,

55
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:33,359
a house and lot is part of the prize
package of hashtag Relationship Goals.

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,401
You can have that.

57
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,759
I thought we're done pretending?

58
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,369
I'm just saying,
since we haven't fessed up yet...

59
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,472
we're still in the game.

60
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,107
Right?

61
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,852
You don't understand.

62
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,607
You know what, don't worry about me.

63
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,026
Maybe I'm just being sentimental today.

64
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,573
I'll be okay, I'll get over it.

65
00:04:01,358 --> 00:04:02,868
Let's delete the memories.

66
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,993
You know, it occurred to me to,

67
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:09,863
what if we announce to the Umamis first
that we've broken up...

68
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:12,282
and then we delete
our social media memories.

69
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:15,505
What's the difference,
we're still breaking up?

70
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,846
No, this is for the Umamis,

71
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:21,136
so we can break it to them gently.

72
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,519
Imagine you're one of them...

73
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,519
and you were searching
for our social media accounts,

74
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,852
but you didn't find any.

75
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,226
It would be understandable if
they knew that we've split, but no.

76
00:04:33,267 --> 00:04:34,756
So they'd wonder and probably think.

77
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,258
Oh my gosh, BetCin got hacked!

78
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:39,965
Or we're in the middle
of some type of scandal.

79
00:04:40,006 --> 00:04:41,237
Or we're in danger.

80
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:42,556
Then it gets worse and worse,

81
00:04:42,597 --> 00:04:44,537
it goes viral,
it becomes a national issue.

82
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:48,534
Don't you think we should
lessen the impact for the Umamis?

83
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,792
I'm not in the mood to digest
everything you're saying.

84
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,000
But if you think
this is the right thing to do,

85
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,505
then let's do it.

86
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,590
Even up to the bitter end
of this relationship,

87
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,511
you're still getting your way.

88
00:05:05,378 --> 00:05:07,129
Think of the Umamis.

89
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,491
Three, two, one...

90
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:16,105
-Hi dear Umamis!
-This is BetCin and...

91
00:05:16,146 --> 00:05:17,150
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,359
Sorry, Umamis first?

93
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,779
Three, two one, go!

94
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,242
-Hi Umamis!
-HI Umamis!

95
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,827
-We are BetCin and...
-This is BetCin...

96
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,245
Sorry, I don't think I can do it.

97
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,494
Okay, this is it.

98
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,108
Hi Umamis...

99
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:31,785
Do you want to count us off?

100
00:05:31,826 --> 00:05:32,666
Sure.

101
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,419
One,

102
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,920
two, three, action!

103
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,940
-Hi Umamis!
-Hi Umamis!

104
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:41,716
-We are BetCin and we've broken up!
-This is BetCin and we've broken up!

105
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:14,958
=BETCIN=

106
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:23,808
Cut.

107
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,094
It doesn't sound good.

108
00:06:26,591 --> 00:06:27,634
It sounds weird!

109
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,014
Really?

110
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,851
But you're the one
who wants to keep it light.

111
00:06:33,132 --> 00:06:37,969
I just want them to realize that
even though we've broken up,

112
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,010
we're fine!

113
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,713
I don't want the Umamis to worry.

114
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:44,907
We should still be responsible
Internet personalities, right?

115
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,365
I don't want us to add to
the things they're already thinking about.

116
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:49,746
Okay, well you have a good point.

117
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,341
But Cindy,

118
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:54,134
this is a breakup video.

119
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,208
Have you not watched
a single breakup video?

120
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,711
Couples can barely breathe
from the pain and all the crying.

121
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:05,175
Snot running down their noses
and tears ruining their eye make-up.

122
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,677
Then there's us, BetCin,
whose breakup video is a happy one.

123
00:07:08,758 --> 00:07:10,884
People won't buy it.

124
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:13,652
They're just gonna think
that we're doing this for clout.

125
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:14,643
So...

126
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,680
I think...

127
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:20,732
we should just be honest.

128
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,316
What if we do a live.

129
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:26,166
So it's more spontaneous.

130
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,615
I think that'll work. Sure.

131
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,534
But can we rehearse first?

132
00:07:32,227 --> 00:07:34,163
Cindy, what do you really want?

133
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,623
Live but we're rehearsing?

134
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,375
-I'm just nervous.
-That's not live anymore.

135
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,918
Come on, let's just do one pass.

136
00:07:40,855 --> 00:07:41,695
Alright.

137
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:43,309
Okay.

138
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:47,360
So we're live.

139
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:50,529
Live.

140
00:07:53,327 --> 00:07:54,641
Hi Umamis!

141
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,355
So we are live today because
we have a very important announcement.

142
00:08:01,125 --> 00:08:04,379
I'm sure this will come as
a surprise to you all.

143
00:08:05,674 --> 00:08:07,218
Or not.

144
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,439
I know that there are a lot
of rumors floating around.

145
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:15,450
And I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

146
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:18,559
You want to know the real score.

147
00:08:19,514 --> 00:08:22,433
And the truth is…

148
00:08:25,268 --> 00:08:26,727
Beth and I have broken up.

149
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:33,722
And we want to tell you guys because...

150
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,013
of course we respect you,

151
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:41,271
we love your support,

152
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,982
and we're thankful to all of you...

153
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:45,978
-Right.
-So...

154
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,611
this is it.

155
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,747
Don't worry about us,

156
00:08:55,788 --> 00:09:02,291
we will have our own endeavors and
we hope that you continue to support us.

157
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:04,601
Yeah.

158
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,338
As Beth and Cindy...

159
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:09,684
separately.

160
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,635
So,

161
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,341
thank you so much for your support.

162
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,152
This is BetCin,

163
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:22,475
signing off.

164
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:25,231
Oh my gosh.

165
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:35,287
That's good, right?

166
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,415
We should have just filmed that.

167
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:41,252
Well we can just do it again.

168
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:43,838
Okay, game.

169
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:46,016
Okay, game.

170
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,753
Let's do it again.

171
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,932
It's Dana, our page admin.

172
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,307
Did she somehow hear about
what's really happening to us?

173
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:04,099
Just answer the call
so we'll know what's up.

174
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:06,689
Okay.

175
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,016
Hi Dana, what's up?

176
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:12,226
Oh my gosh, are you crying?

177
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:15,072
Cindy, SOS, I need your help.

178
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:16,116
You and Beth!

179
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,365
One of our new members in Umamis Forever,

180
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,409
Miguel, you know Miguel, right?

181
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,498
-Yeah, the one who makes edgy memes.
-Yes.

182
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,793
Right! Well, here's the thing.

183
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,148
He's been crying for a while now,

184
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:30,755
it seems like his girlfriend
of five years has left him.

185
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,332
And now, he's...

186
00:10:32,373 --> 00:10:34,775
wait I'll show you,
I don't know how to say it.

187
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,925
Oh my gosh!

188
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:39,386
Hey ask him to step down, he could fall!

189
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:44,129
Beth, I think that's his plan.

190
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,355
Anyway, he mentioned that
he only wants to talk to both of you.

191
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:49,419
Okay, we'll go there.

192
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,349
You have to do everything to distract him,

193
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,821
don't let him jump!

194
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:53,853
We're on our way!

195
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:56,897
Dana, send us the address please!

196
00:10:58,918 --> 00:11:00,660
How did we come to this point?

197
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,838
All I want is to share our lives
when we start making those vlogs.

198
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,351
I just want to make people happy...

199
00:11:05,392 --> 00:11:07,182
actually, to earn money.

200
00:11:07,223 --> 00:11:09,309
How did we become a rescue team now?

201
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,310
You're the one who said that...

202
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,633
when we welcomed them into our lives,

203
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,343
we somehow became responsible for them.

204
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,802
I know but where are the cops?

205
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:19,164
I don't know.

206
00:11:19,205 --> 00:11:21,249
Maybe they'd show up when
we're done fighting the goons?

207
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:24,057
What?

208
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:26,227
Let's just look for the rooftop.

209
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:29,452
Let's go!

210
00:11:34,474 --> 00:11:37,035
Oh my god! Migs!

211
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,490
Migs, get off that ledge! Let's talk!

212
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:44,475
Migs, Dana filled us in.

213
00:11:44,516 --> 00:11:46,636
We know about
your girlfriend of two years.

214
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,083
Yes we know, we're here!

215
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,001
Five years!

216
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,586
Oh sorry five years,
and we're sorry about that,

217
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:56,110
but this is not the solution
to your problem!

218
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:58,998
What else will I do with my life?

219
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,229
She was my everything.

220
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:03,842
I did everything for us.

221
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:05,570
For our future.

222
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,518
Five years!

223
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:09,460
And still she managed to leave me.

224
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:12,223
Life is like that Migs,

225
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,485
even if we constantly choose
the person we love...

226
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,487
Wow, constantly?

227
00:12:18,831 --> 00:12:20,167
I'm talking to him!

228
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:21,407
Go!

229
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,965
As I was saying,

230
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:26,206
when they made up
their minds to leave us,

231
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:28,873
we can't do anything.

232
00:12:30,887 --> 00:12:31,888
That's right.

233
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,132
Sometimes it seems like there's no hope...

234
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,997
-but never forget...
-Yes.

235
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,127
Or take your own worth for granted, right?

236
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,248
Don't force yourself to someone.

237
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:45,129
True.

238
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,880
There are many girls out there.

239
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:53,484
Maybe they won't be as kind,
or as pretty, or as loving,

240
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:54,965
but you'll find someone.

241
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:56,985
Someone better, better for you!

242
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,452
You're not so sure about that.

243
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:01,381
Migs,

244
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:03,654
what was the reason...

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,416
why she left?

246
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:07,938
Tell us.

247
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:08,846
Come here.

248
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:12,000
She has someone else.

249
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,688
Beth can definitely give
you an advice or two on that.

250
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:19,549
Ouch!

251
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,189
Be serious.

252
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:27,307
What's your girlfriend's number?

253
00:13:27,567 --> 00:13:28,934
Maybe we can call her?

254
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,312
-Yeah, she can try to convince you...
-Cellphone.

255
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,377
-No...
-not to push through with your plan.

256
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:37,047
No, I already called her earlier
before I even went up here.

257
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:38,901
She got mad.

258
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,739
She told me never to disturb
her honeymoon in Italy again.

259
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:44,811
Huh?

260
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:46,437
Honeymoon?

261
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,211
You're girlfriend's already married?

262
00:13:48,723 --> 00:13:49,746
That quick?

263
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:51,664
When did you break up?

264
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:56,294
One year, nine months and three days ago.

265
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,798
But I still feel like
it was just yesterday.

266
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:04,479
Migs, I think you need to
learn to move on.

267
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,869
Oh my god, Cindy!

268
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:06,984
That's the right thing.

269
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:08,401
I've been trying,

270
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,706
but I just can't do it.

271
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:13,645
Yes, wait, what Cindy meant was...

272
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,898
jumping from there is not
the solution to your problem.

273
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,778
Right!

274
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:17,982
Okay?

275
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:19,472
I can't handle this anymore.

276
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:20,541
Oh shit...

277
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:24,155
Every time I see her social media page,

278
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,949
I see that she's happy with her...

279
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:31,369
Spanish/French/

280
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,041
Brazilian/Korean boyfriend.

281
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,251
Maybe stop stalking her page?

282
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,336
Oh my god.

283
00:14:41,977 --> 00:14:43,330
I thought I could do that.

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,429
I thought it's true that
time heals all wounds.

285
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,549
It's true.

286
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,675
But it's not.

287
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,643
Isn't there a song that says,

288
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:55,199
there's no easy way to
break somebody's heart?

289
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:56,646
What are you doing?

290
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,919
Who sung that?

291
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,908
I don't know,

292
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:01,200
I just heard it on the radio
on our way here.

293
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,945
Well, whoever he is, screw him!

294
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:11,077
Crap!

295
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:14,357
Dana! Maybe you want to help?

296
00:15:17,696 --> 00:15:19,585
Ouch!

297
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:20,586
Oh my god!

298
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,632
We have to pull him up!
Okay one, two, three!

299
00:15:39,878 --> 00:15:42,214
I'm just so tired Beth and Cindy.

300
00:15:42,923 --> 00:15:44,591
I'm tired of being alone.

301
00:15:46,171 --> 00:15:47,238
And rejected.

302
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,365
And starting over again.

303
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,328
Go on dates again. Court someone again.

304
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,289
Get to know another girl again.

305
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:01,634
Look at you guys,

306
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:03,963
you're perfect.

307
00:16:05,752 --> 00:16:07,295
Your relationship is perfect.

308
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:09,510
While me,

309
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,126
I'm devastated.

310
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:15,099
Migs, I know it hurts.

311
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:17,351
I know how you feel.

312
00:16:17,392 --> 00:16:18,232
No.

313
00:16:19,752 --> 00:16:22,587
You will never understand
because you're happy.

314
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,067
Your relationship is perfect.

315
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,183
No Migs, we're not perfect.

316
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,325
No relationship is perfect.

317
00:16:33,015 --> 00:16:34,744
No one is. Nobody's perfect.

318
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:39,290
Isn't that the beauty of life.

319
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,002
We struggle so we learn.

320
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,494
No matter how painful it is,

321
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:48,895
we just learn and we get up,

322
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:52,678
stand up,

323
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:55,598
that's life's way of teaching us a lesson.

324
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:04,235
We have something to tell you.

325
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,900
And we're only telling you this.

326
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,153
Let's tell the truth.

327
00:17:12,945 --> 00:17:14,700
There's no more BetCin, Migs.

328
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:17,912
We've broken up.

329
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,514
What?

330
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,339
No way!

331
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:31,926
It's true, Migs.

332
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,096
We broke up already.

333
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,854
We were just pretending
actually to join the contest.

334
00:17:49,794 --> 00:17:51,171
But you know, like I said,

335
00:17:52,177 --> 00:17:53,595
another mistake,

336
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,978
but we learned, right?

337
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:58,936
Right.

338
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,248
I'd like to think that...

339
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:07,503
I got to know Cindy better
in the last 10 days.

340
00:18:10,151 --> 00:18:12,027
I've also gotten to know myself better...

341
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,812
than in the many years that
we were together.

342
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:19,295
That's right.

343
00:18:20,804 --> 00:18:24,061
And now we're setting things right.

344
00:18:25,544 --> 00:18:28,755
Because the truth will set us all free.

345
00:18:32,448 --> 00:18:33,404
Wait,

346
00:18:34,943 --> 00:18:36,069
there's no more BetCin?

347
00:18:36,778 --> 00:18:39,364
I'm so sorry Migs but that's the truth.

348
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:46,792
You know, maybe the world is harsh.

349
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:51,047
Maybe forever doesn't really exist.

350
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:54,550
You know what,

351
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,290
-please stop being so dark...
-I'm not done.

352
00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:02,130
Maybe there's nothing
that's inherently perfect.

353
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,732
But we can make it.

354
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:08,110
We can choose to be happy.

355
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,819
We can choose to love,

356
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,943
to seek perfection everyday.

357
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:17,914
You know, acknowledge
the things that are not good,

358
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,833
and work on those things
and make them better.

359
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,124
You guys suck.

360
00:19:23,782 --> 00:19:24,652
Whatever.

361
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,374
From now on, consider me unsubscribed.

362
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,458
That's okay,

363
00:19:29,106 --> 00:19:31,587
just don't unsubscribe from life.

364
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:33,289
So corny!

365
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,205
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,138
I'm trying.

367
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,082
Migs, there's just one thing that
we'd like to ask from you.

368
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,848
Please don't tell the Umamis yet.

369
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,311
Let Beth and I announce it to them.

370
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,395
We will, soon.

371
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,147
Please?

372
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,484
Do what you want.

373
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:55,611
I don't care about BetCin anymore.

374
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:58,300
I don't care about love as well.

375
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,701
Are you okay?

376
00:20:17,113 --> 00:20:18,697
Ouch!

377
00:20:19,123 --> 00:20:20,594
Did we do the right thing?

378
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,889
To be honest,

379
00:20:25,616 --> 00:20:26,851
I'm not sure too.

380
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:33,524
Dana! Oh my gosh!

381
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,285
This day is extremely tiring.

382
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:45,951
So many things happened.

383
00:20:45,992 --> 00:20:48,130
I just hope that Migs is okay.

384
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,569
And so is Dana.

385
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,677
Oh my gosh, Dana,

386
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,663
she couldn't handle
the heat at the rooftop!

387
00:20:52,704 --> 00:20:53,586
Right.

388
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:01,093
Oh god please, not another emergency.

389
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,304
Announcement of winners…

390
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,642
Oh no, we still haven't
made our announcement.

391
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,598
If we hurry,

392
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,743
we can still tell to the Umamis...

393
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:14,680
and then delete our social media memories
minutes before the announcement, right?

394
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:15,561
Good idea!

395
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,341
Right? Let's go?

396
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:18,222
Let's go.

397
00:21:22,418 --> 00:21:25,443
Surprise!

398
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:28,992
What's happening?

399
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:32,293
-Hi!
-BetCin!

400
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,334
Wow! Thank you.

401
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,382
How did you get in here?

402
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,489
We have our ways.

403
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,426
We'll do anything for BetCin!

404
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,315
Right, guys?

405
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,647
-Yes!
-Yes!

406
00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:46,120
Wow! Thank you!

407
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:48,122
But are you guys fans or stalkers?

408
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:50,275
You are really funny Beth!

409
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:53,480
OMG, we're all so excited
for the announcement later.

410
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,772
We're sure the win is in the bag,
right guys?

411
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,550
Thank you but we're not expecting to win.

412
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:02,806
You should because
you're at the top of the leaderboards.

413
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:03,692
And one more thing,

414
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:06,868
Mig's video from earlier after
you helped him went viral.

415
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,275
Look! Right, guys?

416
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:09,156
Hi guys!

417
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:13,587
I just want to thank Beth and Cindy
for saving my life.

418
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:15,125
Good thing they came.

419
00:22:15,453 --> 00:22:19,963
I just want to say too that I hope
you're always happy with your decisions.

420
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,209
BetCin! BetCin! BetCin!

421
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,621
Umamis, Beth and I
have an announcement to make.

422
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:30,267
-Right.
-Before we hear about the winners.

423
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,159
Yup.

424
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,076
-Okay, go.
-Let's go.

425
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,065
I'm so excited!

426
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,608
Okay.

427
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,091
Go Beth!

428
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:43,859
Why me?

429
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,001
You can do it.

430
00:22:45,042 --> 00:22:46,043
I'm here for support!

431
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:50,911
Umamis!

432
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,876
Thank you so much for coming here,

433
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,729
although uninvited, thank you!

434
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,670
We love you, you are welcome here.

435
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:06,552
Oh my god, here comes
the announcement of winners!

436
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:10,806
BetCin! BetCin! BetCin!

437
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:14,310
Hello netizens, influencers,

438
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,645
vloggers, social media addicts,

439
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,939
even the trolls and the haters.

440
00:23:19,076 --> 00:23:21,860
This is the search for
the Internet's sweetest sweethearts,

441
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,944
the most adorable, lovable,

442
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,573
and influential
hashtag Relationship Goals couple!

443
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,918
Cindy, do you think
we have a shot at winning?

444
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,123
I hope not.

445
00:23:37,566 --> 00:23:41,403
You're the one who said
"let's be millionaires".

446
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,018
Yeah but didn't we agree that
we don't care about the contest anymore?

447
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,844
But if we do win,

448
00:23:49,565 --> 00:23:52,139
let's just split the prize money.

449
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,057
I wonder if it's tax-free.

450
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:00,356
Let me check.

451
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,408
Thank you for being with us everyone!

452
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,116
I know you've all been
eagerly waiting to know...

453
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,621
who among the contestants will take home
the hashtag Relationship Goals title.

454
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,559
As well as the fabulous prizes.

455
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,306
Cindy, did you know about this?

456
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,504
Have you read segment four of the rules?

457
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,340
Which part?

458
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,330
Segment four!

459
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:29,969
It says here,

460
00:24:30,614 --> 00:24:31,740
The winners...

461
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,067
will stay together for 30 years,

462
00:24:35,108 --> 00:24:38,111
and the prize money
will be given in installments.

463
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:43,774
It further stipulates,

464
00:24:44,662 --> 00:24:46,247
If the couple wins...

465
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:48,904
and they don't stay together,

466
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:51,407
they have to return the prize money.

467
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:55,828
Did you know about this?

468
00:25:01,562 --> 00:25:03,990
After 10 days,
the couple with the most interactions,

469
00:25:04,031 --> 00:25:05,702
You're not answering my question.
Did you know about this?

470
00:25:05,742 --> 00:25:07,694
And these are accumulated likes,

471
00:25:07,735 --> 00:25:11,010
comments and reactions
from all their posts is…

472
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:12,302
Oh my god!

473
00:25:13,256 --> 00:25:16,153
Why did you join a contest
with this crazy rule...

474
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:17,904
and never even bother to tell me?

475
00:25:17,945 --> 00:25:19,516
I was planning to!

476
00:25:19,557 --> 00:25:22,518
But so many things are happening
at once so honestly, I forgot.

477
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,752
Oh my god, every single time...

478
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:26,378
Why didn't you tell me?

479
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,985
Don't be upset.

480
00:25:29,874 --> 00:25:32,322
We might not even win anyway.

481
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,125
And they are...

482
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:55,550
Beth and Cindy of BetCin Vlogs!

483
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,638
(CONGRATULATIONS!)
(BETCIN)
