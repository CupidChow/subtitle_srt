1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,932
Previously on BetCin.

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,020
Cindy is finally out of the closet.

3
00:00:20,391 --> 00:00:22,852
Mom, I'm a lesbian.

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,610
I know. I'm your mom, right?

5
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,864
But our break up is still a secret.

6
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,074
That's why I know something's wrong.

7
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:36,277
Why do you need to pretend?

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:38,455
For social media? For other people?

9
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,374
How long can you fool each other?

10
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,257
Hi there, Umamis!

11
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,218
Today, we're going to
create your most requested...

12
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,101
Your...

13
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,598
Beth,

14
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,175
-Beth!
-What?

15
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:01,145
Today is really special
because we have our featured...

16
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,772
Let's go, let's make the video.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,571
Is this Chicken Ni Nene?

18
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,572
Nene's Chicken.

19
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,313
They've rebranded, thank God!

20
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,287
But yes, this is it.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,706
When did you close that deal?

22
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,749
Weeks ago,

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,128
before you decided that I'm a bum
and wanted to break up with me.

24
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,922
I never said you were a bum.

25
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,967
It's okay, I've moved on.

26
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,968
The damage has been done.

27
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,974
Do not cry over spilled milk!

28
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,391
I think you're using
the wrong idiom there.

29
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,811
Does everything have to be an argument?

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,274
Fine, I'll just shut my mouth.

31
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,985
Good. Now let's make the video,

32
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,362
because I forgot to charge
the batteries and they might run out.

33
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,363
Make sure your energy's up,

34
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,116
so the client will like us.

35
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,702
Happy, excited…

36
00:02:00,533 --> 00:02:02,289
Can you do that later?

37
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:04,570
Let's just finish this video,

38
00:02:04,612 --> 00:02:06,114
then you can do whatever you want.

39
00:02:06,605 --> 00:02:08,149
Anyway this is just chicken cordon bleu...

40
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,735
Chicken cordon bleu?
That's too complicated,

41
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,487
let's just cook chicken soup instead.

42
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,102
I really have to take the call.

43
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:24,394
Hey babe.

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,239
You took so long to answer. Busy?

45
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:29,733
No, we're just working on some content.

46
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:32,367
Chicken ni Nene is sponsoring us.

47
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,083
Nene's Chicken!

48
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,234
-Nene's Chicken.
-Wow.

49
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,896
Nothing, I just miss you.

50
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,646
Am I not allowed to miss you?

51
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,371
I miss you too.

52
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,335
I miss you.

53
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:48,923
What are you doing?

54
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:53,511
I'm here at the clinic, I just got here.

55
00:02:54,477 --> 00:02:58,307
But I'll be home early
so I can prepare for tonight.

56
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:00,480
Tonight? What's tonight?

57
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:01,362
Yes babe,

58
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,476
it's white panty night.

59
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:04,358
What?

60
00:03:05,207 --> 00:03:06,231
Are you sure?

61
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:10,652
I checked my calendar and
white panty night isn't until tomorrow.

62
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:15,032
No babe, it's tonight.

63
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:17,492
So,

64
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:18,994
are you coming?

65
00:03:19,726 --> 00:03:21,121
You don't have to ask that.

66
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:23,588
I'll be there.

67
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,005
Oh sorry,

68
00:03:31,075 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm just prepping the breast,

69
00:03:32,927 --> 00:03:35,513
I mean chicken breasts.

70
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,810
Go on!

71
00:03:39,504 --> 00:03:42,299
Are you sure, you're coming?

72
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:44,519
I'll be there, see you later.

73
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,858
What's going on in the background?

74
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:54,905
It's nothing just ignore it.

75
00:03:58,868 --> 00:03:59,743
Cindy…

76
00:04:01,787 --> 00:04:02,746
Cindy!

77
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:06,809
Okay calm down.

78
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:11,901
So, I'll see you later at 7:00 PM?

79
00:04:15,092 --> 00:04:17,427
Bye. I love you.

80
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,055
Okay, I love you.

81
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:26,881
Are you trying to start something?

82
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,273
Can't you work on something that's quiet,

83
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,359
like, chopping carrots? I'm on the phone.

84
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,790
Chicken cordon bleu doesn't have carrots.

85
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:36,644
My point is…

86
00:04:38,908 --> 00:04:39,783
Nevermind.

87
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,708
Let's just get this over
and done with so...

88
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:48,682
So what's white panty night?

89
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:57,968
Do you really want to know?

90
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,137
That's why I'm asking.

91
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,353
White panty night is...

92
00:05:07,826 --> 00:05:09,813
the first night after her period
so that means we can...

93
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,482
Okay, that's enough, I get it.

94
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:18,780
Well, does Kate know
you have a party tonight?

95
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:20,758
What party?

96
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,763
Why do you think
I'm cooking chicken cordon bleu?

97
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:26,580
What party?

98
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:29,041
Well I've invited some friends.

99
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,058
Friends? What friends?
You're driving me crazy, Cindy.

100
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:36,350
I just want us to be with friends when
we watch the live ranking announcement.

101
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:38,300
Cindy, what the hell?

102
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,844
It's like a viewing party.

103
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:40,962
I'm not available!

104
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:43,703
This is why I don't tell you things,
because you always say no.

105
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,623
You know that I can. I have a date.

106
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:50,098
Well, I'm sorry, it has been arranged.

107
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,523
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll enjoy this panty,

108
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,358
I mean, party.

109
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:35,732
=BETCIN=

110
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:47,479
Sorry,

111
00:06:48,153 --> 00:06:52,002
I know we're not together anymore,
but can you help me?

112
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,843
This one? Are you sure?

113
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:05,515
Yes, it exudes confidence,
but in a low-key way.

114
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:09,519
Right. Thank you.

115
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,859
I think you need to change though,

116
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:17,587
you know, to match
the color of this outfit.

117
00:07:21,953 --> 00:07:23,116
-Fine.
-Okay?

118
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,084
Cindy,

119
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,592
do we really have to do this?

120
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,764
What if we're low in the rankings?

121
00:07:45,283 --> 00:07:46,949
Stop it, negatron!

122
00:07:48,232 --> 00:07:51,360
We got great engagement on our last video.

123
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:54,416
It's about coming out, introducing
you to my family as my girlfriend,

124
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,567
so I'm confident.

125
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,438
Okay,

126
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,796
but please, next time...

127
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:08,508
let me know of your plans
so I can adjust my schedule accordingly.

128
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,582
Well I never tell you things
because you always say no.

129
00:08:12,624 --> 00:08:14,000
Everything's been set.

130
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:23,218
Okay, but let's make this quick?

131
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:28,849
No after parties or anything like that
because I have a date.

132
00:08:29,649 --> 00:08:30,817
I'm meeting up with Kate.

133
00:08:31,873 --> 00:08:34,312
I think you need to get
dressed because any minute now...

134
00:08:34,354 --> 00:08:36,940
our friends will be here. Okay?

135
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:43,280
So who did you invite?

136
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,216
Our friends.

137
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:56,334
Nat, Carleen, George, and Lexy of course.

138
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:01,923
Do you remember,
we invited them too for our housewarming.

139
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,260
We were so happy back then.

140
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,587
We were just starting out,

141
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:11,349
feeling our way into the relationship.

142
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,454
And you, you're feeling out other things.

143
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,945
So who else did you invite?

144
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:27,324
That's it.
Who else did you want me to invite?

145
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:30,222
Nobody.

146
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:34,039
It's just that, they're all your friends.

147
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:36,862
What? They are our friends.

148
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,294
No, they're your friends.

149
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,589
But because they're your friends,
you wanted me to hang out with them too.

150
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:46,051
So I was just going along with it,
but really...

151
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,763
So you've been faking
befriending them all this time?

152
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:51,640
They're just not my type of people.

153
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,560
And I'm not faking anything,
I'm just trying to get along,

154
00:09:56,384 --> 00:09:57,224
Okay?

155
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:00,364
They're your friends,
so I try to get along with them.

156
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:02,234
But you never said anything,

157
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,288
you never talked about any
issue you might have with them.

158
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,331
You know what?

159
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,075
This doesn't matter, we broke up.

160
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,545
You know what,
this is exactly why we broke up.

161
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:23,327
You are being untruthful.

162
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:26,288
Imagine, you didn't like them
but you didn't say anything.

163
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,386
I thought you've moved on from all this.

164
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:31,844
"Do not cry over spilled milk".

165
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,723
Why are you picking a fight now?

166
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,703
Excuse me, I'm not picking a fight.

167
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:38,979
We will not last until
the end of the contest,

168
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,668
if we're going to be like this.

169
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,754
It's just 10 days, okay?

170
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:43,977
Fine.

171
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,486
Who else did you want to invite?

172
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,241
Um…

173
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,606
See? You can't think of anyone.

174
00:10:55,792 --> 00:10:57,377
It's cause you're antisocial.

175
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,541
I should have listened to Lexy,

176
00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,626
I'm really not compatible with Virgos.

177
00:11:01,668 --> 00:11:04,809
How many times do I have to tell you,
I'm not antisocial.

178
00:11:04,851 --> 00:11:06,006
I'm an introvert.

179
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,009
And please, enough of this obsession
with the Zodiac, it's just not true.

180
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:12,767
Spoken like a true Virgo cynic.

181
00:11:12,957 --> 00:11:14,358
It's pseudo-psychology,

182
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,838
like those internet quizzes
you always force me to take.

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,815
They're all untrue.

184
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:25,862
So what type of coffee are you again?

185
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:30,947
Black.

186
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,569
But it doesn't mean anything.

187
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:39,998
Don't worry, I'll invite Simon
so you can have someone to talk to.

188
00:11:40,522 --> 00:11:42,274
Wow, thank you!

189
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,437
You're welcome!

190
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:51,279
-Hi guys!
-Sis!

191
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,387
You're house is so pretty!

192
00:11:53,428 --> 00:11:56,222
It has such great aura.

193
00:11:56,264 --> 00:11:57,891
She really prepared everything!

194
00:11:57,933 --> 00:12:01,353
I'm so excited guys!

195
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:03,147
Let me take a picture.

196
00:12:04,471 --> 00:12:08,916
-Oh I love it, I love it!
-In a few minutes, we'll be watching...

197
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,405
the hashtag Relationship
Goals daily ranking!

198
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,045
BetCin for the win!

199
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:16,197
Say hi to our followers.

200
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:19,410
Thank you! Hi everyone!

201
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,706
Here in my live broadcast too, sister.
Say hi to the Umamis!

202
00:12:22,748 --> 00:12:27,169
Hi Umamis!
Thank you, I love you all! Mwah!

203
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:31,055
Support our dyke friends please.

204
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:34,094
Wait, is dyke politically-correct?

205
00:12:34,136 --> 00:12:36,306
It's fine. Just take your seats.

206
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:37,641
Thank you.

207
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:39,140
Here have some drinks.

208
00:12:41,851 --> 00:12:43,395
Oh, this looks good...

209
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:44,856
-No!
-Ouch!

210
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,354
We need to take photos first.
For our followers!

211
00:12:47,396 --> 00:12:48,314
Oh yeah.

212
00:12:49,187 --> 00:12:50,814
-Let's take photos.
-Wait.

213
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,364
This looks delicious.

214
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,496
And expensive too. Perfect!

215
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,060
Wait, where's Beth?

216
00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:04,310
Beth?

217
00:13:05,513 --> 00:13:06,398
Beth?

218
00:13:07,463 --> 00:13:08,548
Babe…

219
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,133
Here she is.

220
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,970
I really love this girl.

221
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,806
Hey, entertain them, okay?

222
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,062
Beth will take care of you for a while.

223
00:13:26,928 --> 00:13:28,109
Hello.

224
00:13:37,498 --> 00:13:40,830
Hey!

225
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,334
Missed me?

226
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,588
Yeah, always. You saved me.

227
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:52,258
Hashtag Relationship Goals,

228
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,177
sounds pretentious as shit.

229
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,765
What? Oh yeah I forgot,

230
00:14:00,015 --> 00:14:01,976
you hate social media.

231
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:04,604
I don't hate it,
I'm just not active on it.

232
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:09,606
Those dating apps that
you use to look for chicks,

233
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,569
they count as social media.

234
00:14:13,163 --> 00:14:17,918
I just don't like broadcasting
my love life to the world.

235
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,036
Relationships are only
complicated between two people...

236
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:23,561
-I know.
-Then you'd involve more people,

237
00:14:23,603 --> 00:14:25,855
random strangers at that, on social media.

238
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:31,756
You have hundreds, thousands
of followers involved in your lives.

239
00:14:32,544 --> 00:14:34,255
That's just chaos waiting to happen, man.

240
00:14:34,297 --> 00:14:36,174
I know…

241
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:38,580
Hey you're such a hater.

242
00:14:38,622 --> 00:14:42,793
You're probably one of those bitter trolls
who comment on our vlogs.

243
00:14:44,226 --> 00:14:45,978
I don't even watch your vlogs,

244
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:49,815
they'd just be constant reminders
that I never got to have you.

245
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:54,278
Made you warm and fuzzy inside?

246
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,733
No, made me cringe.

247
00:14:57,822 --> 00:14:58,663
I'm kidding,

248
00:14:58,705 --> 00:15:01,619
I'm never going for you,
you're complicated.

249
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:07,481
Simon, let's be serious now.
You're my godsister.

250
00:15:08,011 --> 00:15:09,763
Plus, you're my only friend here.

251
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:15,163
I know, so you better listen to my advice.

252
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:20,211
Drop this nonsense because
you and Cindy are over!

253
00:15:20,332 --> 00:15:21,172
Hey.

254
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,267
Shush, they don't know it yet.

255
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:31,057
Damn.

256
00:15:31,747 --> 00:15:34,375
Why did you even agree to this?

257
00:15:34,586 --> 00:15:37,381
I already told you, it's for the contest.

258
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,281
Obviously, I don't buy it.

259
00:15:42,961 --> 00:15:49,667
-See, if you're breaking with someone...
-Here we go again, damn.

260
00:15:50,037 --> 00:15:53,003
You're constantly fighting, drinking,

261
00:15:53,045 --> 00:15:56,257
going away,
doing everything in your power...

262
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:57,988
to be able to move on from each other.

263
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,051
To forget.

264
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,553
You don't join a contest, okay?

265
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:04,451
You don't play-pretend that...

266
00:16:04,493 --> 00:16:07,688
you're still together in
front of an audience, okay?

267
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:15,121
Ten million pesos,
that's what's at stake here.

268
00:16:15,163 --> 00:16:16,735
And you know I need it.

269
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,906
You know my situation.
Why the hell are you laughing?

270
00:16:20,948 --> 00:16:25,119
I swear to God, you are unbelievable.

271
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,318
You don't need to convince me.

272
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,710
Ask yourself,

273
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,132
why are you truly doing this?

274
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,114
And while you're trying to figure it out,

275
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,646
think of Kate.

276
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:57,683
Oh damn, Kate!

277
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,859
-Shit!
-Why what happened to her?

278
00:16:59,566 --> 00:17:01,485
It's white panty night!

279
00:17:03,528 --> 00:17:04,529
-White panty night?
-Wait.

280
00:17:12,624 --> 00:17:14,627
-They're about to make the announcement,
-Hello...

281
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:17,796
-Let's go.
-Wait, I need to talk to someone.

282
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:55,960
Excuse me guys, sorry…okay.

283
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:57,253
Let's go babe.

284
00:17:59,006 --> 00:18:01,079
Hi Umamis, here we go,

285
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,832
this is Beth, and Cindy!

286
00:18:04,312 --> 00:18:08,171
We're so excited for this announcement!

287
00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:10,141
Thank you so much, Umamis.
This is all for you.

288
00:18:10,474 --> 00:18:14,103
Here we go…oh my gosh!

289
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,811
Hello netizens!

290
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:24,110
I know you're all excited
so I won't drag this out!

291
00:18:24,613 --> 00:18:29,349
Based on all the combined engagements
like Likes, Comments, and Shares...

292
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:32,770
across the social media
accounts of our couple contestants,

293
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,231
here is our first daily ranking!

294
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:37,607
In third place,

295
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,735
congratulations to
the travelling couple of Makati,

296
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:42,881
Alex and Minda!

297
00:18:43,475 --> 00:18:46,998
Their travel selfies are truly inspiring!

298
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,200
From Africa, Japan, Paris, you name it,

299
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:53,202
they've been everywhere!

300
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,146
I wish we could be like that,

301
00:18:58,814 --> 00:19:00,107
travelling all the time.

302
00:19:00,411 --> 00:19:02,151
In second place,

303
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:04,945
congratulations to the throuple of Cebu,

304
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,710
Michael, Fiona and Horace!

305
00:19:08,935 --> 00:19:11,562
Aw, isn't that sweet guys?

306
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:14,569
Congrats Michael, Fiona and Horace!

307
00:19:14,801 --> 00:19:17,675
See, polyamory isn't so bad.

308
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:19,136
Why don't you want to try it?

309
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,263
Next time.

310
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:23,797
I don't mind being your third wheel!

311
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:28,214
Enough guys,
they're about to announce first place.

312
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,029
Simon, be ready with the party popper.

313
00:19:31,932 --> 00:19:32,808
Okay, let's go!

314
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:35,561
This is it!

315
00:19:36,023 --> 00:19:38,592
The couple in first place,

316
00:19:38,934 --> 00:19:43,108
thanks to all your Likes,
Comments and interactions...

317
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,986
they have earned the top spot for today,

318
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,362
is none other than
the teenage couple from Fairview,

319
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:52,242
John and Julia!

320
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,799
Aw, the fleeting romance of baby love,

321
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:00,581
which sooner or later could
produce an actual baby…

322
00:20:00,623 --> 00:20:02,167
Kidding!

323
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:07,671
They deserve it, they look so sweet.

324
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:11,511
It's okay,
it's just the first daily ranking,

325
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:12,888
we'll do better tomorrow.

326
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,433
What the fuck? What happened?

327
00:20:19,774 --> 00:20:22,819
Okay, I think we're done here.
Thank you so much for coming.

328
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,961
No, we can't lose in this competition.

329
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,445
I won't allow it.

330
00:20:28,946 --> 00:20:29,863
But we did lose.

331
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,041
We have to do something!

332
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,199
Like what?

333
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:34,421
We need to come up
with some killer content.

334
00:20:34,463 --> 00:20:36,912
-No. I have to be somewhere.
-Okay, will you come with us, guys?

335
00:20:36,954 --> 00:20:37,871
-No.
-Let's go.

336
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:39,999
-Cindy!
-We cannot lose!

337
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:45,170
Cindy we are not leaving. We'll stay here!

338
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:49,133
Come with me!

339
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,056
No!
Don't let go of me!

340
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,310
What you think I can handle all of you

341
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,537
with my size?

342
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:58,267
Wait! Let me talk to Beth.

343
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:00,996
Cindy, I really don't want to
do this, okay?

344
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,864
Beth, it's just for content, please?

345
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:05,924
Cindy,

346
00:22:07,213 --> 00:22:11,055
the fact that we weren't in
the top three,

347
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,175
You know, maybe it's a sign from heaven.

348
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:16,588
Wow, so now you're suddenly religious?

349
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,513
Okay, let's pray for a win.

350
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:21,726
St. Jude Thaddeus,
patron saint of hopeless cases.

351
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:25,657
Simon's right, this is nuts!

352
00:22:26,146 --> 00:22:27,314
And your Mom's right, too.

353
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:30,068
We were just fooling ourselves.

354
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,392
Beth we made a deal.

355
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:34,947
You promised.

356
00:22:35,976 --> 00:22:38,200
Just like how you promised me that
no matter what happens,

357
00:22:38,242 --> 00:22:39,451
we'll always be together.

358
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:43,121
You didn't keep that promise,
so please keep this one instead.

359
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:46,291
Okay, I'm sorry.

360
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:51,584
I made a big mess, I admit. I'm guilty.

361
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:55,175
And that's probably
why I'm doing your bidding...

362
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,896
even though we've broken up.

363
00:22:59,241 --> 00:23:03,370
Why I said yes to this contest.

364
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,690
Beth all I'm asking for is
for you to please fight for BetCin.

365
00:23:10,124 --> 00:23:11,441
Maybe you can do that?

366
00:23:12,848 --> 00:23:14,766
Since this is probably
the last time anyway?

367
00:23:16,398 --> 00:23:17,900
If you can't do it for me,

368
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,129
can you just do it for the people
who support and love us.

369
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,881
Okay, fine.

370
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:40,220
What's on your mind?
What are we going to do?

371
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:11,960
Hello, are we just going to
stare at each other here or what?

372
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:15,881
I have a feeding program waiting
for me after this wedding.

373
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:18,133
Mayor, a feeding program?

374
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,500
At night?

375
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,086
Who exactly do you feed at this hour?

376
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:26,474
We're a 24-hour service here.

377
00:24:26,516 --> 00:24:28,393
That's how we ended up
doing your wedding now.

378
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,759
Okay, Mayor,

379
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:37,889
I'll go first since
my wife here is a bit shy.

380
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,368
Beth,

381
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:47,955
ever since I laid my eyes on you...

382
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:50,624
Simon, move here to get a better shot.

383
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:56,786
Beth,

384
00:24:58,507 --> 00:25:00,800
ever since I laid my eyes on you...

385
00:25:06,092 --> 00:25:06,932
Are you done?

386
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:08,988
I'm sorry acid reflux, sis.

387
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:10,107
Go!

388
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:16,232
Beth,

389
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:20,487
ever since I laid my eyes on you...

390
00:25:22,178 --> 00:25:24,389
-Wait.
-What is it?

391
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:27,915
Wait.

392
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,288
I need to fix your hair.

393
00:25:36,541 --> 00:25:38,505
It's okay now.

394
00:25:50,727 --> 00:25:53,021
I remember when you first told me,

395
00:25:55,943 --> 00:25:58,279
that you can't explain why you love me.

396
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:01,642
I felt the same way.

397
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:06,837
Beth my love for you is...

398
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:08,828
intense,

399
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:10,599
it's crazy,

400
00:26:12,541 --> 00:26:14,125
but I love the feeling.

401
00:26:18,354 --> 00:26:20,690
I don't believe in forevers,

402
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:26,424
but when I first laid my eyes on you,

403
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:31,025
I knew you were the one.

404
00:26:39,985 --> 00:26:41,528
You're my forever, Beth.

405
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:53,241
And I'm willing to do
anything to save what we have.

406
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:59,294
Because I don't want to lose you.

407
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:05,384
And I want this love...

408
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,306
to last a lifetime.

409
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:13,933
That's so touching.

410
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:15,667
Okay, your turn.

411
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:24,319
Cindy,

412
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,100
babe.

413
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,458
You know I don't believe in forever.

414
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:34,836
I still don't.

415
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:41,044
But I do believe in living in the moment.

416
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,058
What we had then,

417
00:27:47,842 --> 00:27:48,968
what we have now,

418
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:52,354
will always be with me I promise.

419
00:28:00,881 --> 00:28:05,402
I know our time is short, it's counted.

420
00:28:11,696 --> 00:28:14,035
But I promise I'll cherish this forever.

421
00:28:17,274 --> 00:28:18,275
I promise.

422
00:28:42,201 --> 00:28:43,535
This is so emotional,

423
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:46,192
I'm going to tell
all my mahjong friends about it...

424
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,627
I mean the people
at the feeding program.

425
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,075
You may now kiss your spouse.

426
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:12,636
Congratulations!

427
00:29:13,408 --> 00:29:16,495
But I really have to go now.

428
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:19,726
Mayor, wait, we're not done!

429
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:21,270
Simon here will sing us a song.

430
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:22,692
Huh?

431
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,666
Come on, just one song.
It'll be your wedding gift for us.

432
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:28,236
Good thing we have a guitar here.

433
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:29,264
Oh, perfect.

434
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:31,577
Go!

435
00:29:32,308 --> 00:29:33,148
Beth…

436
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:39,284
Just one song.

437
00:30:54,821 --> 00:30:57,991
I love you BetCin! Oh my God!

438
00:32:55,984 --> 00:32:57,485
Next on Betcin.

439
00:32:58,754 --> 00:32:59,630
Hi babe.

440
00:33:00,338 --> 00:33:03,216
We need to do this to get the first spot.

441
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:05,452
Cindy please get out of my way!
I need to talk to her,

442
00:33:05,494 --> 00:33:09,060
-I need to leave now...
-Are you sure sex won't fix things?
