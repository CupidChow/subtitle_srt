1
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,461
Cindy.

2
00:00:59,897 --> 00:01:01,865
Enough of that.
We posted too much already.

3
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:05,031
Can we talk?

4
00:01:06,356 --> 00:01:07,775
Babe, let's take a selfie.

5
00:01:11,797 --> 00:01:12,885
Smile!

6
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,092
One more.
Why don't you show off your plate?

7
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,409
Higher so they can see it.

8
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:28,605
Nice. That's nice.

9
00:01:30,235 --> 00:01:31,263
Babe.

10
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,046
Can we talk?

11
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,497
One more selfie, I promise.

12
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:42,129
On my count of three, you will move, okay?

13
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:44,955
One, two, three!

14
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:49,209
Oh my gosh! You're so cute, Babe!

15
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:51,845
It's my first time seeing you like this.

16
00:01:53,018 --> 00:01:53,883
Cindy.

17
00:01:55,022 --> 00:01:56,179
Can't you hear me?

18
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:57,715
Huh?

19
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:59,649
I've been talking here.

20
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:01,880
I can hear you.

21
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,168
Oh Babe, before I forget.

22
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,354
(The Great Food)

23
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:11,736
Wow!

24
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,101
That's great.

25
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,894
I remember your seafood paella.
It's really good.

26
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,764
Or any other dish that you prepared.

27
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,984
So we no longer need to dine outside.

28
00:02:24,127 --> 00:02:26,121
Right? Does that sound like a good idea?

29
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,586
I don't feel like cooking.

30
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,569
Oh, which reminds me.

31
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,860
Babe, you know what?

32
00:02:34,944 --> 00:02:36,871
We can get 30 percent off
on our next bill,

33
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:39,760
if we post couple pictures
with this receipt.

34
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,448
See?

35
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:44,908
It pays to read
the terms and conditions in promos.

36
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:47,309
You're really bright.

37
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,895
But all that I can see
is the total amount.

38
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:51,939
You are so cute.

39
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:57,611
(1 Kate)

40
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:04,451
Babe.

41
00:03:05,422 --> 00:03:07,082
What do you want to talk about?

42
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:13,919
Well...

43
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:19,406
The thing is...

44
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,342
Let's talk about it later.

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,436
Okay Babe, if you say so.

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,053
You're the boss.

47
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:41,434
What's with that tone?

48
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,286
Huh?

49
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,769
"You're the boss."

50
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,990
What do you mean by that?

51
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:53,948
Babe.

52
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,567
I asked you
what do you want to talk about.

53
00:03:57,651 --> 00:03:58,839
You said nothing.

54
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,885
I said later.

55
00:04:07,097 --> 00:04:08,665
I'll fix the light first.

56
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,271
But clearly, you are bothered by it.

57
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:16,323
So what is it?

58
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,317
What do you want to talk about?

59
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:19,650
Hopeless.

60
00:04:19,734 --> 00:04:21,230
It's really hopeless.

61
00:04:24,907 --> 00:04:25,904
There's still hope.

62
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,173
It's hopeless.

63
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,533
Give me that.

64
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,480
I just happen to mix the new
with the old ones.

65
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,751
This should be disposed right away.

66
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,426
Try this one.

67
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,434
Look. What did I tell you?

68
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,879
It's really hopeless.

69
00:04:55,288 --> 00:04:56,589
There's still hope.

70
00:04:57,493 --> 00:04:58,576
It just needs fixing.

71
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,340
No, it's not working anymore.

72
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:04,739
Maybe you just didn't tighten it.

73
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,150
Let me do it.

74
00:05:12,928 --> 00:05:14,455
What have you done here?
It's still okay...

75
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:16,166
I did not do anything.

76
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:24,514
Cindy, I'm breaking up with you.

77
00:05:27,266 --> 00:05:28,511
I really don't understand.

78
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,055
Why is it not working?

79
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:32,620
Cindy, listen.

80
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:35,184
Did you not hear me?
I said I'm breaking up with you!

81
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,479
Yes, I can hear you! I'm not deaf!

82
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,852
Sorry.

83
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,769
Wait.

84
00:05:46,587 --> 00:05:47,772
I will just go to the toilet.

85
00:05:50,095 --> 00:05:51,059
Wait, what?

86
00:05:51,388 --> 00:05:54,067
I'm breaking up with you
and you're going to go to the toilet?

87
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:55,738
I need to pee.

88
00:05:56,476 --> 00:05:58,500
You want me to pee in my panty?

89
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,798
Cindy!

90
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:10,621
Damn!

91
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:41,042
=BETCIN=

92
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,753
Hello?

93
00:06:44,018 --> 00:06:45,129
Are you in the clinic?

94
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:47,380
Just about to leave for my round, Babe.

95
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,678
So, have you watched the video?

96
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,240
I'll send you the photo.

97
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,877
Okay.

98
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,850
So, what do you think?

99
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,898
Will this be our dream house?

100
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,063
90 square?

101
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,830
Floor area?

102
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,742
It's nice.

103
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,706
Yes. I knew you'd like it.

104
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,933
Look at the kitchen.

105
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:15,375
It's huge, right?

106
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,747
And the attic.
It's so perfect for your dream office.

107
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:23,099
The location is so perfect
and it is very near to my office.

108
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:27,328
But June is reminding us
that if we failed to give the...

109
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,791
30 percent down payment in two weeks...

110
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,700
The house will still be an open house.

111
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:34,513
No, Babe.

112
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,711
I'm also a sales agent.

113
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:40,262
Why are you mad?

114
00:07:41,453 --> 00:07:44,062
Sorry. I'm not mad.

115
00:07:44,146 --> 00:07:45,232
You know, uhm...

116
00:07:45,603 --> 00:07:47,984
If you think that
we can't afford the price,

117
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,845
we can settle for something smaller.

118
00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:51,455
No. No, you're right.

119
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,368
The place is perfect.

120
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:56,076
And I want our start to be perfect.

121
00:07:57,421 --> 00:08:02,032
I want to stick to our agreement
that we'll split the down payment.

122
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:05,975
But why do you sound unhappy?

123
00:08:09,335 --> 00:08:10,524
I'm happy.

124
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:12,014
I am happy.

125
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:15,387
You haven't told her yet?

126
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,100
Actually, you know what?
I just told her just now.

127
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,352
Shit! I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:24,729
How did she take it?

129
00:08:25,454 --> 00:08:27,529
She is in denial.
She is in the bathroom right now.

130
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,243
She hasn't come out yet.

131
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:32,529
You know what will happen next, Babe.

132
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:36,330
She will play the sympathy and guilt card.

133
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:38,958
You have to be strong, okay?

134
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:41,537
Remember, you've been preparing for this
for a long time.

135
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,833
We have already
planned our future together.

136
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:47,961
You're just doing this
for our future, okay?

137
00:08:49,206 --> 00:08:51,254
I know. I never forget.

138
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:53,091
Just be strong.

139
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:55,425
Strong.

140
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,972
Remember, our dream house is waiting...

141
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:02,203
with me inside the shower...

142
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:03,227
Oh my God!

143
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:06,104
You don't know
how much I need that right now.

144
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:10,524
Okay. I love you, Babe.
I'll text you later.

145
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,252
Remember, you have
to end things with her tonight.

146
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,181
Promise?

147
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:16,173
-I love you.
-Promise.

148
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,713
Cinds?

149
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,039
Are you okay?

150
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:44,684
Cinds, I'm sorry.

151
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,849
No, you're not.

152
00:09:54,056 --> 00:09:55,791
Let's talk about this first.

153
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,436
No, I'm not yet ready.

154
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:07,269
Let's talk about this.

155
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:09,025
Cindy!

156
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:13,755
Cindy.

157
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:17,050
Let's talk.

158
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,644
(3 You have new notifications)

159
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,820
You don't want to talk to me
but you posted?

160
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:42,448
Cindy!

161
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:45,982
Cindy!

162
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,393
Hi there!

163
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:20,976
This is Manila Island Banking Corporation.

164
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,424
We are calling to inform you
of your overdue payment in...

165
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:30,515
Gold Value card number
0-0-9-5-0-1-1-8-9...

166

4-7-0-0.

169
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:46,283
Please pay overdue balance
of 253,190 pesos and...

170
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:22,735
Hey.

171
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:25,575
Are we not going to talk about it?

172
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,129
Will you just pack things up?

173
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:31,573
Cinds.

174
00:13:38,762 --> 00:13:40,334
Are we gonna make this more difficult?

175
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:48,720
I will just come back for my photography
books and fashion magazines.

176
00:13:53,905 --> 00:13:56,436
And also my bikinis and mannequins.

177
00:13:58,952 --> 00:14:01,316
And my cooking and baking stuff also.

178
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:06,696
And those.

179
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:09,861
My candles. I will come back for those.

180
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:12,160
And my soaps,

181
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,773
Christmas decor, yoga mat,

182
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,249
and paintings.

183
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,210
What if I just leave instead?

184
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,756
It's your condo.
I'm the one who should leave.

185
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:31,669
I'm the one who broke up with you,
I'm the one who should leave.

186
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,477
You know I can't afford the rent, right?

187
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:44,442
We still have our two months deposit.
You can still use it...

188
00:14:45,405 --> 00:14:48,080
while you're looking for a new place.

189
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:52,116
No, thanks.

190
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,302
I don't want to trouble you.

191
00:14:58,817 --> 00:15:00,123
Let me at least help you with that.

192
00:15:05,501 --> 00:15:07,746
Tell me again,
why are you breaking up with me?

193
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:17,644
It's not working anymore.

194
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:22,812
There is no more spark.

195
00:15:22,896 --> 00:15:24,106
There is no more magic.

196
00:15:29,612 --> 00:15:30,774
Fine.

197
00:15:35,053 --> 00:15:36,258
I don't love you anymore.

198
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:54,444
It was just the third day of dating,

199
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:59,580
when you suddenly say that you love me.

200
00:16:04,242 --> 00:16:06,649
I asked you why? You said,

201
00:16:07,492 --> 00:16:08,831
you don't know.

202
00:16:10,223 --> 00:16:11,529
It just happened.

203
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:19,632
Now I'm asking you
why you don't love me anymore.

204
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:22,915
You just answered me...

205
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:25,209
there's no more magic.

206
00:16:27,634 --> 00:16:29,672
It just happened too?

207
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:42,666
Is there someone else?

208
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:51,436
What a stupid question.

209
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,930
Of course there is.

210
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:57,172
And you had the guts
to look for someone else.

211
00:16:59,048 --> 00:16:59,994
Wow.

212
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:02,277
And what do you mean by that?

213
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,293
What do you mean by that?

214
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,758
Yes, I looked for someone else.

215
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,203
You want to know why?

216
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,075
Because I'm already tired.

217
00:17:22,397 --> 00:17:25,375
I am tired of this one-sided relationship.

218
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:28,876
One-sided?

219
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,534
I go both ways.

220
00:17:30,936 --> 00:17:33,319
I'm serious.

221
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,017
Me too.

222
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:37,307
I shouldered everything.

223
00:17:38,168 --> 00:17:39,754
I pay the bills and our food.

224
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,145
You're so picky with what you eat.

225
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:43,528
You are fond of takeaways.

226
00:17:43,612 --> 00:17:45,313
You can just cook.
You know how to cook.

227
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,915
You are good at cooking.

228
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,272
You always want
something instagramable.

229
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,163
But still, I'm going to pay for it.

230
00:17:51,247 --> 00:17:53,040
Isn't that what you want?

231
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:59,554
From the very start
you wanted to be the provider,

232
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,700
the man of the house.

233
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,825
Cindy, you are the only one
who thinks that way.

234
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,260
Just because I have short hair
you perceived it that way.

235
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:09,472
I tried paying.

236
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,701
Oh really, when?

237
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,434
I can't even remember
when was the last time.

238
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:16,277
The first few times
when we were still dating,

239
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,107
but you refused it.

240
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:19,048
Of course.

241
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,868
I want to impress you then.

242
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,460
But how long have we been together?

243
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:26,315
You made me shoulder everything.

244
00:18:27,223 --> 00:18:29,698
Even your expensive counseling sessions...

245
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:32,362
that unfortunately didn't work.

246
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,389
I think the doctor had a crush on you,
that's why we always come back.

247
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:37,123
Bullshit.

248
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:39,226
I didn't know it was against your will.

249
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:42,511
Why did you let me?

250
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:44,160
Because that's us, Cindy.

251
00:18:45,016 --> 00:18:46,808
Because that's how our relationship works.

252
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:49,571
You will still insist on what you want.

253
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,157
You won't even ask me
if it's okay with me.

254
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:55,401
You will not stop until I approve.

255
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:57,635
That is not true.

256
00:18:58,619 --> 00:18:59,620
It's true.

257
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:02,255
That is all true.

258
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:07,079
But you know, I'm so fed up.

259
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,938
I'm fed up with your IG posts.

260
00:19:12,022 --> 00:19:13,981
I'm tired of pretending.

261
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:16,865
But in real life,

262
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:19,550
I took all the responsibilities.

263
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,428
I was not even able to save money
for myself.

264
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:28,558
You did not tell me.

265
00:19:34,444 --> 00:19:37,693
I thought there was no you and me?

266
00:19:40,961 --> 00:19:44,033
Ever since we started you said,

267
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:47,864
everything we do is for us.

268
00:19:51,318 --> 00:19:53,668
You posted it. You said...

269
00:19:54,999 --> 00:19:56,759
you said we are a team.

270
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:01,369
Without you and me,

271
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,592
we are nothing.

272
00:20:02,688 --> 00:20:05,388
When I said it, I meant it.

273
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:09,485
But I'm tired.

274
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,394
I got tired.

275
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:15,824
Am I the only one with shortcomings?

276
00:20:17,117 --> 00:20:20,374
Beth, I have my own sentiments with you,
but I put up with you.

277
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:21,537
Put up with me?

278
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,656
What have you put up with me?

279
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:25,398
You are always busy.

280
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,244
You are cold.

281
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:30,717
You are emotionally detached.

282
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,039
You're so passive.

283
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,464
You know what,
if I'm not trying to make an effort...

284
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:36,535
to initiate to make this thing work,
nothing will happen.

285
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,587
We're like zombies here.

286
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:41,017
How do you expect me to be sweet
when you're always on live?

287
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,183
And you can't blame me for that.

288
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:45,428
I'm working for us.

289
00:20:45,595 --> 00:20:48,144
You should have showed
a little bit more effort.

290
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,207
Yes, you're in charge financially...

291
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:55,517
But emotionally,

292
00:20:57,492 --> 00:21:00,526
I feel that I'm the only one
working on this relationship.

293
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:04,675
You are not the only one
who gets tired, Beth.

294
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,845
That's why...

295
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:14,729
That's what I'm trying to say.

296
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:17,525
We are both tired.

297
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:21,700
So...

298
00:21:24,134 --> 00:21:25,596
Let's end this.

299
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:50,507
(1 Kate)

300
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:57,079
(Hi, Babe! So sorry. toxic last night.
How are you?)

301
00:22:04,905 --> 00:22:06,799
(Kate is typing...)

302
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:08,710
(Be strong, Babe.)

303
00:22:21,636 --> 00:22:28,079
(I'm excited to tell the world
that you are my GF. I LOVE YOU!!!!!)

304
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:40,046
You're right.

305
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,080
Right?

306
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:45,089
Where?

307
00:22:46,238 --> 00:22:48,426
That our relationship is one-sided?

308
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:53,548
That we should break up.

309
00:22:57,087 --> 00:22:59,656
But if we are going to do it,
we have to do it right.

310
00:23:00,832 --> 00:23:02,031
Give me your phone.

311
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:09,820
Cindy, what's this?
Why do you need my phone?

312
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,518
It's not just about us, Beth.

313
00:23:15,993 --> 00:23:21,055
BetCin is nothing without
our 400,426 subscribers.

314
00:23:21,658 --> 00:23:23,711
Our dear Umamis.

315
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,548
We can't just let them down.

316
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:29,424
We swore to them...

317
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:32,326
that we'll make them part of our lives.

318
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,369
When did that happen? I can't recall.

319
00:23:40,214 --> 00:23:42,369
I'm sure they'll be devastated...

320
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,331
if they found out that we are done.

321
00:23:45,373 --> 00:23:46,943
They will be heartbroken.

322
00:23:47,358 --> 00:23:48,394
So...

323
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:52,436
The least we can do
is tell them the truth,

324
00:23:53,794 --> 00:23:55,743
hear it straight from us.
Something like that.

325
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,062
What do you have in mind?

326
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,460
Like a live breakup?

327
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:13,302
I guess we have to talk to them.

328
00:24:14,206 --> 00:24:16,002
A lot of them are already asking.

329
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,296
Of course.

330
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,875
You posted first before you talked to me.

331
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,634
You are very fond of that.

332
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,108
You know there are lots of them.

333
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:28,567
That's why
we will explain to them everything.

334
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:33,930
That it will be our last post on our page.

335
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
What do you think?

336
00:24:36,405 --> 00:24:37,254
Game?

337
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:40,657
What are we going to say?

338
00:24:47,056 --> 00:24:47,920
Well...

339
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,882
Maybe we can start by...

340
00:24:53,055 --> 00:24:54,844
deleting memories of us.

341
00:24:57,555 --> 00:24:58,698
Okay, let's do that.

342
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:00,619
Okay.

343
00:25:01,404 --> 00:25:02,412
Okay.

344
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,538
On the count of three.

345
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,699
One...

346
00:25:13,404 --> 00:25:14,374
Two...

347
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,328
Two and a half...

348
00:25:27,576 --> 00:25:28,544
Ma'am.

349
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,661
Have you already seen Jesus?

350
00:25:31,873 --> 00:25:34,550
We want to introduce you to Our Savior.

Divine intervention.

358
00:26:00,534 --> 00:26:03,744

we should talk to Him first.

Cinds, you know that it's not safe anymore
and you let them in!

363
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,424
I'm sorry.

364
00:26:15,563 --> 00:26:16,888
-Let's do this, okay?
-Okay, fine.

365
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:19,303
Fine. On the count of three again.

366
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:21,309
One.

367
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:23,807
Two.

368
00:26:27,596 --> 00:26:29,385
No. No, no. No.

369
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:33,424
Even if it's the end of the world,

370
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,282
we will delete all our memories.

371
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:36,884
Do you want me to count?

372
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:38,948
Game?

373
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:40,094
Fine!

374
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:46,038
One.

375
00:26:47,013 --> 00:26:48,248
-Two...
-Wait!

376
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:50,058
-Wait.
-What now?

377
00:26:50,774 --> 00:26:51,657
Cinds.

378
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:53,003
Last selfie?

379
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:54,912
Come on.

380
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:58,948
Come on.

381
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,148
It seems like there's still spark.

382
00:27:15,148 --> 00:27:16,520
Stop that. Let's start.

383
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:17,528
Okay, fine.

384
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:19,161
I will start counting.

385
00:27:19,246 --> 00:27:20,155
Fine.

386
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,491
One.

387
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,308
Two.

388
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,709
Wait! Wait! Wait!

389
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:27,161
What now?

390
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:28,194
Wait!

391
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:30,436
We have a congratulatory message.

392
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:31,879
Congrats for what?

393
00:27:32,082 --> 00:27:34,115
I-I don't know.
I think we won something.

394
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:36,857
Congratulations!

395
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:37,833
You have been selected

396
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:40,790
as one of the semi-finalist
of #RelationshipGoals...

397
00:27:41,155 --> 00:27:42,738
for #RelationshipGoals.

398
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:44,805
What's at stake?

399
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,065
Oh my God, Beth!

400
00:27:47,149 --> 00:27:50,253
A five-year contract
worth 10 million pesos,

401
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:53,295
instant cash prize of 5 million pesos,

402
00:27:53,379 --> 00:27:54,732
house and lot,

403
00:27:55,065 --> 00:27:58,694
a honeymoon package worth 5 million pesos
and other perks!

404
00:28:00,066 --> 00:28:01,334
If you wish to continue,

405
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,596
please confirm in 3 minutes or
we will give the chance to other couples.

406
00:28:07,597 --> 00:28:08,704
-No!.
-Click the button below.

407
00:28:08,949 --> 00:28:10,566
-No. No!
-Beth.

408
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,750
Beth, think about it.

409
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:15,041
10 seconds. Think about it.

410
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:17,348
Millions.

411
00:28:18,047 --> 00:28:19,326
House and lot.

412
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,735
We both need it.

413
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:24,969
Yeah. That is if we won.

414
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,138
That's a big if, Cindy.

415
00:28:27,222 --> 00:28:28,486
And why not?

416
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:30,787
We have hundreds of thousands of Umamis.

417
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:32,351
Yeah right.

418
00:28:32,435 --> 00:28:36,083
The name of the contest is
Search for #RelationshipGoals.

419
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,017
Cindy, we're done.

420
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:46,033
Well,

421
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:49,953
you can pretend that you love me?

422
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:54,832
You have been doing that
for God knows how long.

423
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,756
But...

424
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,565
you are already experienced.

425
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:00,160
It is no longer difficult for you.

426
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,032
What you are saying is sheer madness.

427
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:05,534
Think about it.
We are talking about millions.

428
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:08,400
We never had a million.

429
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,751
We both know that you need it.

430
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,328
How about this?

431
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:20,041
After the contest, after we win,

432
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:22,530
we'll split the prize.

433
00:29:23,469 --> 00:29:25,697
Then we'll split up.

434
00:29:27,386 --> 00:29:28,293
No.

435
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,526
Please, Beth. Please.

436
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,037
I need this.

437
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,000
You owe this to me, Beth...

438
00:29:37,897 --> 00:29:39,217
for cheating on me.

439
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,215
Come on.

440
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:48,971
You know you want this too.

441
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:50,472
Come on.

442
00:29:54,311 --> 00:29:57,020
Not to pressure you
but we only have 30 seconds left.

443
00:29:57,156 --> 00:30:00,472
If you prolong it further,
we are saying goodbye to millions.

444
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:01,525
Wait.

445
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:02,818
Beth.

446
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:04,278
Shit.

447
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:06,728
Nine.

448
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:08,157
Eight.

449
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:09,575
Seven.

450
00:30:10,006 --> 00:30:10,909
Six.

451
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:12,703
Five.

452
00:30:13,632 --> 00:30:14,538
Four.

453
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:16,124
Three.

454
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,666
Two.

455
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:22,212
Yes!

456
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:30,762
Let's be millionaires, Babe.

457
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,264
I mean Beth.

458
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,224
You said yes!

459
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,114
You said yes!

460
00:30:36,476 --> 00:30:39,062
You said yes! You said yes!

461
00:30:40,927 --> 00:30:42,024
You said yes!

462
00:30:44,526 --> 00:30:46,445
(Next on Betcin)
This season on BetCin.

463
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:49,322
If we are going to do this,

464
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:52,409
we have to set rules.

465
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:57,822
The only rule we need is we have to win
at all cost.

466
00:31:00,596 --> 00:31:01,652
We broke up.

467
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:03,801
We broke up, Babe. Promise.

468
00:31:04,191 --> 00:31:05,297
10 days only.

469
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,721
I'm game.

470
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,330
Cindy, you might be forgetting
we're only doing this for money, right?

471
00:31:10,414 --> 00:31:11,303
I know.

472
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,777
Hi guys!

473
00:31:14,199 --> 00:31:16,203
Okay and we're recording.

474
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,686
Spirit of third sex...

475
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,807
Casting you out!

476
00:31:21,891 --> 00:31:23,649
Go away!

477
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:30,766
Nice!
