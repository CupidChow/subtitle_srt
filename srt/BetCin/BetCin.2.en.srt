2
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,165
Cindy, I'm breaking up with you.

3
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:32,780
I really don't understand.
Why is it not working?

4
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,723
Tell me again
why are you breaking up with me.

5
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,445
I don't love you anymore.

6
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:39,871
You know what will happen next, Babe.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,396
She will play the sympathy and guilt card.

8
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,200
You have to be strong, okay?

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,718
Remember, you've been preparing for this
for a long time.

10
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:52,119
We have already
planned our future together.

11
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:57,416
Even if it's the end of the world,
we will delete all our memories.

12
00:00:57,497 --> 00:01:00,273
-Wait, wait, wait.
-What now?

13
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:01,263
Wait!

14
00:01:01,906 --> 00:01:03,773
We have a congratulatory message.

15
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,301
Millions.

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,350
House and lot.

17
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,056
We both need it.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,679
You owe this to me, Beth.

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,797
For cheating on me.

20
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,796

Hey.

50
00:03:00,026 --> 00:03:01,128
Why?

51
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,153
Just to be clear, we've broken up.

52
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:05,815
Yes.

53
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,866
We're only doing this for the content.

54
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,190
One hundred percent.

55
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:15,560
We're only doing this for the prize.

56
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,761
For the millions.

57
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:19,942
Okay.

58
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,777
For the millions.

59
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:27,387
For the millions.

60
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:35,616
Laugh a little.
Something that looks happy and candid.

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,083
Is that okay?

62
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,317
Cute.

63
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,964
There's really a spark there.

65
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,221
Shit.

=Betcin=

67
00:04:45,838 --> 00:04:47,733
Hello? Babe?

68
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,077
So, what happened to "be strong"?

69
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,445
Here we go again.

70
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:55,880
What?

71
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,269
No. I mean...

72
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,834
I was forced to do it.

73
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:06,511
Sorry, babe. I had no choice
but this is just temporary.

74
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:09,389
Ten days. Just 10 days.

75
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,820
So what? Have you broken up or not?

76
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,570
We've broken up.
We broke up, babe. I promise.

77
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:17,765
It doesn't seem like it.

78
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,717
Look at the comments
on your official page.

79
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:25,237
"Wow."

80
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,595
-"They look so sweet."
-It's all for show, it's all fake, babe.

81
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:29,619
"#RelationshipGoals."

82
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,434
"I hope my girlfriend and I are like that.
It's so inspiring."

83
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:36,474
Wow, Beth.

84
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,612
You've convinced the whole world.

85
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,273
Of course, babe. We need
to make it look convincing.

86
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,234
There's more.

87
00:05:43,314 --> 00:05:46,560
This is my favorite. From Katy Katkath.

88
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:51,901
"It made me wanna find someone
who can love me and only me."

89
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,878
Unlike my girlfriend now,
who can't be proud of me.

90
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:58,453
Come on, babe. That's you.

91
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:00,120
Of course!

92
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:05,170
Hello, Doc.

93
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:07,239
I'll follow you, Katy Katkath.

94
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,512
Bye.

95
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:10,170
Alright.

96
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:23,030
Babe, I'll explain everything again.

97
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:25,933
This is just temporary,
it will only be for 10 days.

98
00:06:26,014 --> 00:06:29,263
There's a huge prize money,
you know that I need that, right?

99
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:31,739
I need that for our future.

100
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,575
For our dream house, for you.

101
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,436
Look, if this is about the house,

102
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,176
I can pay for the down payment.

103
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:41,367
Or we can settle for something smaller.

104
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,102
No. It's not about the house.

105
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,370
It's about you and me.

106
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,412
Our future.

107
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:50,772
Kate.

108
00:06:57,863 --> 00:06:59,314
That's what you want.

109
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,913
I also want to start my own business.

110
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,640
This is the only way... that money.
I'm doing this for you.

111
00:07:07,236 --> 00:07:09,493
You want to have kids? Let's do it.

112
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:12,315
One, two, four.
Is that what you want?

113
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:14,147
We can even have a dozen of them.

114
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,627
Both of us, together.

115
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:26,338
So are you saying that
you're sacrificing for us?

116
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,730
Babe, I don't wanna explain anymore.

117
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,880
You just gonna have to trust me, okay?

118
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:35,309
I do trust you.

119
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,513
I just don't trust Cindy.

120
00:07:39,568 --> 00:07:41,165
Don't think about her.

121
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,677
I can handle her.

122
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:48,003
I know what to do with Cindy, okay?
After this contest, I won't have any...

123
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,658
Okay? If you want,
we can compete together.

124
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,402
We can also compete.
We'll replace all these memories.

125
00:07:58,482 --> 00:08:02,488
We will change everything.
Do you also want us to join the contest?

126
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:05,761
Do you know what will be
the name of our loveteam?

127
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:07,549
"KaBeth."

128
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:13,372
"KateBeth."

129
00:08:13,662 --> 00:08:17,276
"BethKate." Whatever it is.
You already know that.

130
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,748
You don't have to do that, babe.

131
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,666
I don't need an audience.

132
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,403
All I want is a beach wedding with you.

133
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:28,822
I want us to get married.
I want to be your first.

134
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,530
That's why I chose you,
that's what I like about you. I love you.

135
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,334
It's gonna happen.
We're gonna get married.

136
00:08:36,853 --> 00:08:39,866
You wanna get married in Europe?
Oh, my God, if we win...

137
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:42,048
we will get married in Europe.

138
00:08:42,581 --> 00:08:44,003
Even our honeymoon...

139
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:45,598
unlimited travel.

140
00:08:48,332 --> 00:08:50,393
Do you wanna get married in Vatican?

141
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,717
St. Peters Cathedral?

142
00:08:53,496 --> 00:08:54,513
Shit.

143
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,338
-That's hot.
-I know.

144
00:08:56,896 --> 00:08:58,692
I can already imagine you.

145
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:00,694
No.

146
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:02,974
I can imagine you there.

147
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:05,873
I love you.

148
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,522
I love you, I love you.

149
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,021
So, are you okay now?

150
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,269
You're so sweet.

151
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:15,055
Can I have a kiss?

152
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:17,654
I'll kiss you everywhere.

153
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:21,466
Oh, that's good.

154
00:09:24,695 --> 00:09:25,679
Babe!

155
00:09:26,245 --> 00:09:27,800
Stop it.

156
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:36,763
Perverts!

157
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:39,895
Hey!

158
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:42,999
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-What are you doing?

159
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:50,307
Hey, Cindy!

160
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,384
Were you listening to me
while I'm talking on the phone?

161
00:09:58,311 --> 00:09:59,416
Of course not.

162
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,896
Then why are you holding that?

163
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:07,777
I'll drink water.

164
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:11,356
You're gonna drink using that?

165
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:14,397
It's so hot.

166
00:10:27,395 --> 00:10:31,808
By the way,
I heard some weird moaning earlier.

167
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:35,027
I thought our cat died.

168
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,390
We don't have a cat here.

169
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,476
Are you sure?

170
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:42,414
I think it's a good idea to have one.

171
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,767
Our followers will like it.

172
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:47,710
Cindy, if we're really going to this,

173
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,213
we need to set some rules.

174
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,912
The only rule we need is,
"We have to win."

175
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:56,585
At all cost!

176
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,374
I'm serious.

177
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,689
Do I look like I'm joking?

178
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,170
Look, Beth, you know...

179
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:10,338
our efforts will go in vain
if we didn't get the millions, right?

180
00:11:11,507 --> 00:11:12,613
Do you agree?

181
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:18,575
I agree.

182
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,167
But...

183
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:24,253
If we're gonna do this,

184
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:27,420
we need...

185
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:29,765
We need to talk about it,

186
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,793
not like before,
I'm just following whatever you say.

187
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,365
Sure.

188
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:36,868
We should be a team.

189
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:37,910
Fine.

190
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,471
I agree to whatever you want to do.

191
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,340
Okay? Let's talk about it.

192
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,250
Of course.

193
00:11:45,627 --> 00:11:46,753
Good.

194
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,319
So...

195
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,420
So...

196
00:11:52,716 --> 00:11:54,684
What are your plans?

197
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:57,268
What's on your mind?

198
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,281
Well, we need a strategy.

199
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:04,452
Our first post should be explosive,
big, different!

200
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:07,797
And so I've got an idea.

201
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,025
What?

202
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:15,078
What is one thing that
you want me to do that I wasn't ready for.

203
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:16,788
Orgy?

204
00:12:18,232 --> 00:12:19,222
Better.

205
00:12:20,492 --> 00:12:22,684
Better than an orgy?

206
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:36,378
Hi, Ma!

207
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,891
You're already here,
and you even went to the grocery.

208
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,660
We skipped the line, Ma.

209
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,926
How?

210
00:12:45,749 --> 00:12:50,221
Let me show you our secret
to easy and safe shopping.

211
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:55,011
All you have to do
is download the Puregold Mobile app.

212
00:12:55,955 --> 00:12:58,098
Register an account.

213
00:12:59,385 --> 00:13:01,291
Enter your phone number.

214
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,363
-Click on your nearest Puregolds store...
-Okay.

215
00:13:04,444 --> 00:13:07,893
and you can start
your online grocery shopping.

216
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:09,417
That's it?

217
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,066
Add to cart, that's all?

218
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,993
How about the payment?
Isn't it hard?

219
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,441
They have many payment options.
A lot.

220
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:19,210
-And there's no line?
-Complete.

221
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,287
They have separate line for pick-ups.

222
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,608
That is why...

223
00:13:22,819 --> 00:13:24,321
-We skipped the line.
-We skipped the line.

224
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,486
-We skipped the line.
-Amazing, right!

225
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,108
Conrad! Justine!

226
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:33,240
-Help us please.
-Sure.

227
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:36,499
-Beth, you came at the right time. Hello.
-Thank you.

228
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:39,443
-Pa, I miss you.
-I miss you, too.

229
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:41,302
-Justine.
-Hi, Justine.

230
00:13:41,382 --> 00:13:42,329
Hi, sister.

231
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,632
Cindy, I hope
you visited the church today.

232
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,313
Pa, what's for dinner?

233
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:49,091
Let's go to the kitchen, honey.
Then you'll see.

234
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,671
Conrad, did you check
if you turned off the oven?

235
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:54,016
-The dish might get burned.
-Yes, mommy. Yes, yes.

236
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,842
Thankfully, you haven't kicked her
out of the house.

237
00:13:58,062 --> 00:13:59,648
Did she borrow money from you?

238
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:01,954
Oh, Ma.

239
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,724
We have ice cream in the bag,
put it in the fridge before it melts.

240
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,151
-Okay, okay.
-Put in the fridge, yeah.

241
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,744
-You should come inside.
-Yeah, we'll be there in a minute.

242
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:13,044
Borrowed money? What's that?

243
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:18,042
Are you sure about this?

244
00:14:18,463 --> 00:14:19,727
Yes, I'm sure.

245
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:23,341
Come on, this is my official "coming out"
to my parents.

246
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:27,126
To my conservative family,
especially to my mom who's a pastor.

247
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:30,072
For sure, she'll burst into madness.

248
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:32,772
And they will disown me, then boom!

249
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,753
Our video will go viral.

250
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,582
Headline.
"Pastor, disowns her lesbian daughter."

251
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,369
I'm sure it's going to hit number one.

252
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,440
But you have to make sure
that we're on live, okay?

253
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,473
Wait, isn't this too much?

254
00:14:51,396 --> 00:14:54,858
You've been asking me
to introduce you to my family...

255
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:57,947
-as my girlfriend.
-Yeah, when were still together.

256
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,358
Ironically, you're doing this now
that we've broken up.

257
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,357
Better late than never.

258
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,131
Wait.

259
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:06,040
I need to tell you something.

260
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,449
What?

261
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:11,192
When I give you the signal,
we have to run for our lives.

262
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,415
Okay?

263
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:14,986
Why? What's going to happen?

264
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,882
Just relax. You'll find out...

265
00:15:17,244 --> 00:15:18,737
when I give you the signal.

266
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:20,676
Let's go.

267
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,691
Turn it on, hurry.

268
00:15:32,952 --> 00:15:33,923
Okay.

269
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,908
I'll lead the prayer.

270
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,806
Thank you, Lord...

271
00:15:42,883 --> 00:15:45,613
for blessing us with this delicious meal.

272
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,978
May it nourish our body, mind and spirit.

273
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:52,788
-Praise the Lord.
-Thank you, Lord God...

274
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,255
for making our family complete again
in this dinner.

275
00:15:56,908 --> 00:15:58,210
Praise the Lord!

276
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:02,336
Lord God!

277
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:03,881
Lord God...

278
00:16:04,112 --> 00:16:07,898
Thank you for blessing me
with my girlfriend, Beth.

279
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:12,526
And for showing me
that even if I am a lesbian...

280
00:16:12,988 --> 00:16:16,039
I am still worthy
of your unconditional love.

281
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,629
Praise the Lord!

282
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:22,082
Ma, I'm a lesbian.

283
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,722
Aren't you gonna get mad...

284
00:16:26,914 --> 00:16:28,953
or will lash out?

285
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:33,264
Ma, your first born is a lesbian.

286
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:36,279
Why would I get mad?

287
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,677
Because I am sinful?

288
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,910
Romans 1:26.

289
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,821
For this cause
God gave them up unto vile affections...

290
00:16:43,906 --> 00:16:46,149
for even their women
did change the natural use...

291
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,889
into that which is against nature.

292
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,233
Ma...

293
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,815
According to the bible,
I'm an abomination.

294
00:16:52,266 --> 00:16:55,104
And according to the bible, love is love.

295
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,817
And I love you no matter what you are.

296
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:00,702
I've known this a long time ago, Cindy.

297
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:03,688
I'm just waiting for you
to tell me about this yourself.

298
00:17:03,797 --> 00:17:06,623
And now that you have,
I couldn't be any happier.

299
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,336
Beth...

300
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,325
Thank you so much for loving our daugther.

301
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:16,164
Pa?

302
00:17:18,175 --> 00:17:19,054
Let's eat.

303
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:21,417
It's bad to keep the food waiting.

304
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:33,795
(Hello BetCin!)

305
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,188
(What's happening?)

306
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:36,585
(Meet the parents?)

307
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,548
What the heck did just happen?

308
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:43,252
I don't know.

309
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:46,147
My mom seems to be possessed
by an evil spirit.

310
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:49,906
You're still here.

311
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:55,158
Yes, but we already booked a cab.
We're just waiting for it.

312
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:59,153
Okay, okay. Good.
Now, we can take a groufie.

313
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:00,383
Come, come.

314
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:02,156
Let's take a groufie.

315
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:04,466
One, two, three.

316
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,349
Oh, see.

317
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:14,256
Post, share and upload all your sweet,
romantic, inspiring...

318
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:19,012
#RelationshipGoals moments
on your social media account.

319
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,643
You need to earn your points, right?

320
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:30,966
Oh, come on. I'm not stupid.

321
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,407
I know how social media works.

322
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,267
And I know all about BetCin.

323
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:37,954
What?

324
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:39,617
Wait...

325
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,822
-Don't tell me that you watch...
-Yes.

326
00:18:42,902 --> 00:18:45,409
I am an Umami, too.

327
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:46,576
Oh my gosh!

328
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,308
Since when, Ma?

329
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:53,189
I thought you said, "Social media
is an instrument of the devil?"

330
00:18:55,996 --> 00:19:01,460
Exactly. That's why my angel squad and I
are checking on social media.

331
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,740
And I know...

332
00:19:04,807 --> 00:19:07,951
I know you didn't get the reaction
that you wanted to get from me.

333
00:19:08,394 --> 00:19:09,316
Am I right?

334
00:19:09,574 --> 00:19:12,741
You wanted me to get mad,
to lose my temper...

335
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,901
to kick you out of my house, right?

336
00:19:16,395 --> 00:19:17,548
But you know what...

337
00:19:18,137 --> 00:19:22,769
My squad member told me that
social media is good to be unpredictable.

338
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,371
It has its merits, too.

339
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:38,613
(Meeting the Family)

340
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:42,618
Okay.

341
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:44,901
But now...

342
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:48,962
Now that we don't have an audience.

343
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:51,204
Be honest with me.

344
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,774
What is this nonsense you two are doing?

345
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,269
Ma, I'm sorry.

346
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,715
But I really am a lesbian.

347
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,573
Whether you accept it or not,
it's just...

348
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:10,417
You can't change who I am.

349
00:20:11,827 --> 00:20:13,528
I know that.

350
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:16,073
I'm your mother, remember?

351
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:21,346
But I'm not talking about your sexuality.

352
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:27,625
What is it?

353
00:20:38,463 --> 00:20:39,643
Come here, Cindy.

354
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:42,411
Come.

355
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:48,647
Cindy, honey.

356
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,266
Do you remember when you...

357
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:55,337
first introduce Beth to us
as your housemate?

358
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:00,852
That was our anniversary, your dad and I,
at Seafood Dwarf.

359
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:04,048
You were late.

360
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,631
As usual, you did a dramatic entrance.

361
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,262
I remember that, Ma.

362
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,710
I'm having a terrible hungover that time.

363
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:17,762
I was trying not to puke in the middle
of my speech. That was so hard.

364
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:23,865
Beth and I came from a party
of a common friend.

365
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,764
And...

366
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:29,552
that was the first time we met...

367
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,699
from a dating app.

368
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:33,928
And then,

369
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:39,107
for the whole night,
we just talked, laughed...

370
00:21:40,987 --> 00:21:44,115
We made fun of the guys
who tried to hit on us.

371
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:47,380
And when we got bored...

372
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:49,934
She invited me to her condo.

373
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,704
Hey! What are you saying, Cind?

374
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:53,677
No.

375
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,478
Not that kind of invitation...

376
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,498
She was looking for a housemate,
that's why she invited me over.

377
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,403
Right. That's it. That's all.

378
00:22:03,144 --> 00:22:05,292
But she was planning something else.

379
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:07,550
'Cause when I went inside,

380
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,475
there was music.

381
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,523
And then she held me at my waist.

382
00:22:13,072 --> 00:22:14,489
She pulled me close...

383
00:22:14,573 --> 00:22:16,666
Okay. Stop, stop.

384
00:22:16,757 --> 00:22:19,346
-to dance with me.
-Too much information.

385
00:22:19,426 --> 00:22:20,672
Then...

386
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:23,536
-she took me to her bedroom.
-Cindy!

387
00:22:23,616 --> 00:22:25,981
She made me lie down
while taking off my...

388
00:22:26,537 --> 00:22:29,459
-No, no. Your mom won't believe...
-I'm just kidding.

389
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:34,635
Right, right. But you know what...

390
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,619
You see, that's exactly my point.

391
00:22:39,004 --> 00:22:42,606
I saw you the happiest that day.

392
00:22:43,826 --> 00:22:47,386
And even if you were hiding,
I know there's something going on,

393
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:52,432
and even if I didn't approve
of your relationship, I mean,

394
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,191
I saw how in love you are with each other.

395
00:22:56,216 --> 00:22:59,390
The way you looked at her,
I saw it everytime I saw you.

396
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,466
But tonight, I didn't see that.

397
00:23:06,508 --> 00:23:08,544
That's why I know there's something wrong.

398
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:13,846
And I'm not saying this
to interfere in your relationship.

399
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:16,867
But for me,

400
00:23:19,846 --> 00:23:22,765
why do you have to pretend?

401
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,114
For social media?
For other people to see?

402
00:23:27,634 --> 00:23:29,560
'Cause if I can see that,

403
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,306
other people can see it, too.

404
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,244
We have our reasons, Ma.

405
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,100
It's for the 10 million worth
of cash and prizes.

406
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:50,567
Cindy, love...

407
00:23:52,658 --> 00:23:54,679
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

408
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:01,011
Okay.

409
00:24:03,091 --> 00:24:07,707
See, you can fool the social media world.

410
00:24:12,152 --> 00:24:13,643
What about the two of you?

411
00:24:17,003 --> 00:24:19,294
Until when
are you going to fool yourselves?

412
00:24:27,898 --> 00:24:29,253
Excuse me.

413
00:24:30,877 --> 00:24:32,223
Our ride is here.

414
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:34,928
Ma, we have to go.

415
00:24:35,411 --> 00:24:38,948
Wait, wait.
Before you go, we have to do this.

416
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,513
Spirit of third sex.

417
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:46,677
I am casting you out.
Stay away from these girls.

418
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:49,296
Stay away from these two lesbians.

419
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:52,151
Stay away! Stay away!

420
00:24:56,643 --> 00:24:59,019
Spirit of third sex.

421
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:01,266
Stay away from us!

422
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,507
Damn.

423
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:05,690
-Sorry, sorry.
-It's fine.

424
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,251
Your mom is weird.

425
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,287
Were you offended?

426
00:25:11,632 --> 00:25:12,822
Not really.

427
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:16,945
But you know what,
I've been feeling insecured...

428
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,680
because you don't want to introduce me
to your family.

429
00:25:20,615 --> 00:25:22,774
Now, I understand why.

430
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,316
But thank you.

431
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:28,105
For what?

432
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:30,344
For accompanying me.

433
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,704
Not a problem, Cinds.

434
00:25:41,253 --> 00:25:42,915
Babe. Babe, look!

435
00:25:43,103 --> 00:25:44,113
We did it!

436
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,855
1.2 million likes and counting.

437
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,865
Good job.

438
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,704
Cinds.

439
00:25:49,719 --> 00:25:52,340
-Perfect score. Nice!
-Yes!

440
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:01,791
Good idea.

441
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:04,840
Do you remember that night?

442
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,287
What night?

443
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,879
What night?

444
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:15,105
Too many people here.

445
00:26:15,518 --> 00:26:16,716
We have rules.

446
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:22,191
This isn't gonna take long.
I'll go outside. Wait a sec.

447
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,173
Babe.

448
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,237
Yeah.

449
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:33,896
I said, yes. I'm going.

450
00:26:36,165 --> 00:26:38,155
I'll be there.

451
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:47,300
Next on BetCin.

452
00:26:48,237 --> 00:26:50,319
-It's white panty night.
-What?

453
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:52,772
So, what is "White panty night?"

454
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,562
Do you really wanna know?

455
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,346
What the heck!
