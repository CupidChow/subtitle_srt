♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,950
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:39,660
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,550
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,110
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world?

10
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,760
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,870
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,980
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,080
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,620
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,340
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,470
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:21,530
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,870
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

~ Episode 9 ~

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,370
What are you doing? You! Let go of me.

23
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,330
Is this counted as a weird thing?

24
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,190
Thanks.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
Someone is really coming.

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,250
Who would still believe you?

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,910
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

28
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,210
Xiaoqi? Xiaoqi!

29
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,140
Xiaoqi!

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,120
Older Sis Fuyao!

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,300
Older Sis Fuyao, are you all right?

32
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,090
I'm fine. I am a very blessed being. What can happen to me?

33
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,930
That's great. I finally saw you!

34
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:26,500
- Your Highness Heir Apparent.
- That day when I saved you two,

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,550
you had protected him well and he didn't suffer many injuries,

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,300
but he needed time to recuperate.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,260
Zong Yue doesn't have enough manpower, so I sent him to a safer place.

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,350
He was only able to reunite with you today.

39
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,760
Thank you, Your Highness Heir Apparent.

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,620
Okay already. You've seen the person that you should meet.

41
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,090
You're also done with the matter that you should handle.

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,320
Even if you see a friend off for a thousand li, in the end you still have to part.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,920
Moving west from here will be Heaven Fiend Nation.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,230
Moving east will be Capital Kun.

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,710
You two decide on how your future will be.

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,410
I want to go to Capital Kun. Xiaoqi, are you coming with me?

47
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,800
I'll listen to you. I'll go wherever you go.

48
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,980
Your Highness Heir Apparent, are you coming with us?

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,030
Not anymore. I still have other important things to do.

50
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,340
Moreover, you two won't be safe if you travel with me.

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,330
That's right, too.

52
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:09,100
What you have helped me lately, I'll remember them in my heart.

53
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,470
If given a chance in the future, I will pay you back.

54
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,840
No need to worry.

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,030
Even if you have forgotten,

56
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,930
I will look for you and ask for it.

57
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,500
When you go out from here, you'll encounter novel things and dangers that you haven't encountered before.

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,740
This must be the freedom that you wanted.

59
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,510
But I must remind you that

60
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,680
this freedom has never come easily or relaxingly.

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,010
Your path is a hard one.

62
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,720
There's no path in this world that's an easy one to walk on.

63
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,270
Heir Apparent, take good care of yourself.

64
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,950
You, too.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,690
Older Sis Fuyao, what are you thinking?

66
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,080
I came to Mt. Mystic Soul when I was six years old.

67
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,730
Now is the twelfth year.

68
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,480
How the flowers and plants here grow,

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,590
no one knows them better than me.

70
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,340
That's right.

71
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,520
We're finally leaving now.

72
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,610
I'm a bit tearful.

73
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,970
Who doesn't?

74
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:34,150
But the world outside is vast. We should at least take a look.

75
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,190
It's too bad that Uncle Zhou wasn't able to come with us.

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,360
Older Sis Fuyao, I miss him so much.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,580
Uncle Zhou gave so much for us.

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,310
Hence, we must bring his share and continue living well.

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,420
Uncle Zhou, we will surely be all right!

80
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,480
Uncle Zhou, we will surely live well!

81
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,090
Uncle Zhou, have a safe journey!

82
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:25,240
Uncle Zhou, have a safe journey! Uncle Zhou, have a safe journey...

83
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,780
Heir Apparent really thought things thoroughly for us.

84
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,090
Not only did he give us a horse, he even left us so much money.

85
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,960
Remember, when you receive someone's favor, you must repay it next time.

86
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,880
Prime Minister Qi, you sent me a letter.

87
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,020
I now know that your king is about to die.

88
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,630
For what you suggested of exchanging our adjacent territory Mt. Great Vast with Earth Absorbing Hell of Heaven Fiend Nation,

89
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,300
my Heaven Fiend court greatly thinks that it's inappropriate.

90
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,470
Mt. Great Vast has always been a disputed land between Heaven Fiend and Deep Water.

91
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,370
Fragmenting it for 100 years, with our two nations co-governing it.

92
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,060
Using co-governance to exchange for a national treasure of Heaven Fiend

93
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,090
is not acceptable by the Zhan clan,

94
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,070
is not wanted by the citizens of Heaven Fiend,

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,500
and is against the co-existence of the five regions.

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,740
Considering that our two nations have been on good terms for so many years,

97
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,540
and that you have been working in and out with all your efforts,

98
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,150
my Heaven Fiend is willing to lend you Earth Absorbing Bell for private use.

99
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,930
This will be an agreement between gentlemen.

100
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,800
Of course, after borrowing the bell, the ownership of Mt. Great Vast should already be settled.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,670
It must all belong to Heaven Fiend Nation.

102
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,440
They all say that the new king of Heaven Fiend Nation, Zhan Nancheng

103
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,880
is infatuated with trifle details impeding progress and acts in unreasonable manners.

104
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,250
But within these words, you can see that's he's haggling over every cent

105
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,850
and a treacherous man who isn't satisfied with small gains?

106
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,630
Sacrificing Mt. Great Vast just to use Earth Absorbing Bell,

107
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,450
he actually dared to make such a request?

108
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,360
I'm the one who is in need of something from him.

109
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,850
If I'm unable to get Earth Absorbing Bell,

110
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,100
we won't be able to do the magic technique that Palace Leader Fei Yan taught us.

111
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,070
Then Godfather?

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,280
Exchange.

113
00:07:55,350 --> 00:08:00,930
If I'm unable to be the king, what's the use of this Mt. Great Vast to me?

114
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,640
Once I've become this king,

115
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,700
taking it back will happen sooner or later.

116
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,220
Yes.

117
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,150
I'm thinking now...

118
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,130
who Heaven Fiend Nation will send to escort this Earth Absorbing Bell?

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,600
Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend is here!

120
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,530
[Rock City]

121
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,990
We'll return to Capital Kun tomorrow.

122
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,590
Be observant of Xuanyuan Min's tracks on our way back.

123
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:17,560
Godfather, don't worry. I've sent out 300 scouts.

124
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,730
If there is any news about Heir Apparent, they will directly report it back to Capital Kun.

125
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,880
We can only do that for now.

126
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh, right, Godfather. I've heard that the king's illness has worsened.

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,490
He hasn't eaten for three days.

128
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,350
If there is still no news about Heir Apparent, Godfather, you plan to... ?

129
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,880
While we haven't obtained the Water Manipulation Technique, he can't die.

130
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,640
Hence, I still need one more person to help me.

131
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,870
Destroy all of these!

132
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,300
- These Juqian Herbs were brought back by my mister from Mt. South.
- I don't care!

133
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,060
How can you just smash them?

134
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,020
Why are you all being so unreasonable?! Don't smash them just because you say so!

135
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,380
Smash them all!

136
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,760
Stop smashing!

137
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,920
Stop smashing! Don't smashing them!

138
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,410
- Qing Feng.
- Mister.

139
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,560
Just let them be.

140
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,580
What kind of master breeds what kind of dog?

141
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,020
Let's not lower down our status.

142
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,220
Who are you saying to be a dog? Just try saying that again!

143
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,260
- Unruly!
- Who is that?!

144
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,460
A group of ignorant servants.

145
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,960
You dare to disturb the medical sage?

146
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,630
Prime Minister!

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,460
You are so bold.

148
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,940
Drag them all away and flog them 20 times.

149
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,560
Prime Minister, please have mercy. We didn't deliberately want to cause trouble.

150
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,070
It's because Miss has been inviting Medical Sage Song to treat her wounds,

151
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,190
but he keeps refusing.

152
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,150
We were also worried about Miss' injuries;

153
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,250
hence, came up with this method.

154
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,560
Mister, please wait.

155
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,690
- Drag them all away.
- Take them away.

156
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,900
Move!

157
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,000
Hurry! Move!

158
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,350
Prime Minister, please enter.

159
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,410
Sorry to bother, Mister.

160
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,100
I wonder if Prime Minister is also blaming me for the matter about not willing to treat the prefecture princess' injury.

161
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,230
I have heard that Mister chooses whether to treat only according to your own personal preference.

162
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,010
I assume that Yuan'er must have normally offended Mister a lot and angered you.

163
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,570
She just didn't have this fate to be treated by you.

164
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Prime Minister, please.

165
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,790
If I wanted to poison you,

166
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,340
I am afraid that Prime Minister would have died before stepping through the door.

167
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,590
I wouldn't have wasted this newly developed Snow White Dew.

168
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,030
Mister, you've been overthinking.

169
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,850
Good tea.

170
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,510
Since Prime Minister is not here about the prefecture princess,

171
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,790
then may I ask what you are here for?

172
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,660
I have traveled through the Five Regions,

173
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
and have met quite a lot of famous doctors.

174
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,450
But seeing someone like Mister with such superb medical skills is really the first time.

175
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,220
Mister is a good doctor.

176
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,070
However, you live in seclusion in the mountains and work and live in the countryside.

177
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,920
That's really a waste.

178
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
A waste?

179
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,470
I actually don't think so.

180
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,790
Although I don't live an affluent life in the mountains,

181
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,560
being able to have some congee and rice is already enough.

182
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,380
Compared to these kinds of matters,

183
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,390
what I care about more is the freedom in the mountains.

184
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,250
You're right. There are refined pleasures in living in the mountains.

185
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,170
But what a doctor is for is to practice medicine in order to help people.

186
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,830
If Mister lives in seclusion in the mountains for his entire lifetime,

187
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,420
all the effort that was put into researching medical skills and herbalism would have no use.

188
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,980
Isn't that a pity?

189
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,450
Oh?

190
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,850
Would it be possible for you to come with me to Capital Kun?

191
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,540
Capital Kun is the most prosperous and wealthy place of the Five Regions.

192
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,930
Let alone the fun novelties brought in by all different ethnic groups who gather there.

193
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,220
Just the Royal Palace of Deep Water alone,

194
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,010
the rare herbs and medicinal stones from the tributes of all different areas

195
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,230
are all far more precious than the wild herbs from the mountains found at Mt. Mystic Soul here.

196
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,890
What Prime Minister is saying is that all the medicinal herbs in the Deep Nation Treasury,

197
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,690
can be used as I wish?

198
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,580
Manage the Imperial Doctor Department for me.

199
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,460
Let alone the rare and precious herbs in the treasury,

200
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,510
within the Five Regions. If there is something that you want,

201
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,260
I will surely appoint someone to search for it and bring it to you.

202
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,100
Seeing Prime Minister like this, as expected, you came well prepared.

203
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,690
I sincerely hope for you to agree.

204
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,320
If Prime Minister can agree to my three rules,

205
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,850
I can go with you to Capital Kun.

206
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,400
I'd like to hear the details.

207
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,670
First, I usually don't like clamoring

208
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,330
or making friends.

209
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:16,240
When I arrive at Capital Kun, I politely decline any useless social events.

210
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,760
Mister, don't worry about that.

211
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,730
Second, I usually am very picky in the people I use.

212
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,030
I must personally choose my servants and attendants.

213
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,860
If Prime Minister has doubts about that, let's just end this here.

214
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,640
We will do according to your wish.

215
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,420
Third, I cure people, but also kill people.

216
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,210
If Prime Minister is going to use the excuse of doctors having a benevolent heart

217
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,710
and ask me to become a hypocrite, a fake kind man,

218
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,810
forgive me for I can't obey.

219
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,510
Mister, after hearing what you said,

220
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,720
you and I really have similar tastes.

221
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,340
Don't say just these three terms.

222
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,070
Even if you have another three or five terms,

223
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,180
I can agree to all of those.

224
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,490
That's great, then.

225
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,500
Grandteacher Di Feitian.

226
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,060
As long as she becomes my servant,

227
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,900
everything will be as easy as turning my palms over.

228
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,200
The moment when she breaks the Five Seals

229
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,420
will be the day when we succeed.

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,090
Older Sis Fuyao, it seems like the path will get narrower as we walk.

231
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,910
Is it possible there isn't any path?

232
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,800
Capital Kun City is in the west.

233
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,570
As long as we follow the direction of the sunset, we won't be walking in the wrong direction.

234
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,870
But why do I feel that it is so cold here?

235
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,880
Look. It's the summertime right now and yet it is so cold.

236
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,320
And listen, the sounds made by the birds here are so scary.

237
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,820
Why didn't I realize that you were a coward when we were in the mountain?

238
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,010
It's not that I am a coward, it's just that it is really scary.

239
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,100
If I had known earlier, it'd be good if we had chosen to go through the broad road.

240
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,210
Being caught by people from the Prime Minister Manor is still better than being caught by monsters.

241
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,250
Stop saying nonsense.

242
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,360
What noise is that?

243
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,880
Is it the crying from some children?

244
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,460
What? It can't be, right?

245
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,290
Can it be noise from some bobcats?

246
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,100
They sound pretty similar.

247
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,820
Lead the horse for me. I will go take a look.

248
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,050
Why are you going? No, don't! Older Sis Fuyao, don't go!

249
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,600
- Wait for me here.
- I am scared.

250
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,700
Hold it well and wait for me.

251
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,960
Who is there?

252
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,650
Come out! You!

253
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,420
Servant.

254
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,590
Servant.

255
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,900
Who is there?

256
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,590
Come out!

257
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,760
Servant.

258
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,020
Servant.

259
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,620
Servant.

260
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,280
Be my servant.

261
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,670
Be my servant.

262
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,510
Get rid of your mortal life.

263
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,660
Leave this sea of suffering.

264
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,410
Why aren't you coming? Child.

265
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:05,840
You must have suffered a lot throughout your path.

266
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,150
Let me take care of you.

267
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,280
And you will no longer have any worry.

268
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,160
I will guide you to step out of the illusion

269
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,530
as long as you submit yourself to me.

270
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,110
Who are you?

271
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,930
What do you want?

272
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,120
Uncle Zhou!

273
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,640
Fuyao! The guests have arrived here.

274
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,370
Hurry and go work!

275
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,390
That's not right.

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,960
You are not Uncle Zhou.

277
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,170
Fuyao.

278
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,920
First Senior Brother?

279
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,640
You are the only one in my heart.

280
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Why? Why didn't you come find me?

281
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,550
Silly girl.

282
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,210
I told you before that this path is filled with dangers.

283
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,700
Come, I will guide you out.

284
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,370
Just now, didn't you already?

285
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,670
I am worried about you, that's why I came back to find you.

286
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,600
See, this bamboo forest is filled with evil monsters.

287
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,470
Let's go. My horse is right there.

288
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,100
Just now, you already left.

289
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,230
Silly girl, just another step forward

290
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,090
and you can step out of this illusion. Step out of it.

291
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,450
Follow Uncle Zhou and go back.

292
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,650
Fuyao, I will bring you out.

293
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,260
- Let's go.
- You are the only one in my heart.

294
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,220
- Step out of it.
- Why didn't you come find me?

295
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,000
It's fake!

296
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,950
- Come here!
- Step out!

297
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,990
You are all fake!

298
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,030
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

299
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,800
Older Sis Fuyao, are you okay?

300
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,540
Miss!

301
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,300
Miss, the Young Master is here to see you.

302
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,230
Wait a minute.

303
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't come in!

304
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,970
Senior Brother, you... Just stay far away, just stay there.

305
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,180
Junior Sister, how have you been doing the past two days?

306
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,770
Father especially told me to come visit you.

307
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:13,000
If Teacher hadn't told you to come, would you have not come then?

308
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,410
What are you saying, Junior Sister?

309
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,840
I've become like this.

310
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,730
I am afraid that Senior Brother is unhappy.

311
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,590
Taking care of Junior Sister is my responsibility to begin with.

312
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,000
Why would I be unhappy?

313
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,770
What Senior Brother just said, are those really your true words?

314
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,180
Junior Sister, stop overthinking.

315
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,130
Junior Sister, rest and recover well.

316
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,280
I will come see you on another day.

317
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,100
Wait.

318
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,440
Sooner or later, you and I will have to see each other.

319
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,590
It can't be that you and I will forever

320
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,800
be separated by this folding screen, right?

321
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,230
Unless Senior Brother

322
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:17,120
is actually not willing to marry me.

323
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,000
Junior Sister, stop overthinking.

324
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,000
Senior Brother,

325
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,020
are you willing to see me?

326
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,400
Enough, Junior Sister.

327
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,450
Why are you forcing yourself?

328
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,320
I don’t care about this.

329
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:38,100
Really?

330
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,990
Or Senior Brother

331
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,640
actually doesn’t care about how I look like at all?

332
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,020
Junior Sister, why did you say that?

333
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,080
Yes.

334
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:03,650
I was wrong.

335
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,030
Senior Brother, I-I shouldn’t have said this.

336
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,370
Senior Brother.

337
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,670
Senior Brother, you haven’t known about it. Right?

338
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,360
Uncle has sent people back to inform my family to plan our wedding.

339
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,690
Our manor will be built in Imperial General Terrace.

340
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,930
Also, Uncle said recently there’re are a few open official positions in Capital Kun.

341
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,220
He’s holding them and hasn’t hired anyone yet.

342
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,280
He’s waiting for us to reach there and he will let you choose from them at your will.

343
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,610
All right.

344
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,900
I’m okay with anything.

345
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,820
I fear that towards a me like this,

346
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:52,390
you actually disliked everything. Right?

347
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,210
Junior Sister, you’re tired.

348
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,850
Rest early.

349
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,420
Tomorrow, we will leave together.

350
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,610
Senior Brother?

351
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,860
Senior Brother!

352
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,340
Miss.

353
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,860
Miss.

354
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,370
After all, Senior Brother, he likes me after all.

355
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,110
Isn't that right?

356
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:28,060
Of course.

357
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,330
If not... If not, Young Master wouldn't

358
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,710
leave with Miss to Capital Kun for your marriage.

359
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,180
Really?

360
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,370
Is he really willing to marry me?

361
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,730
I’m afraid that

362
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,940
he couldn't dare to not marry me!

363
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,560
Miss.

364
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,530
Will this heal? This will heal, right? This will heal, right?

365
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,390
This will heal. This will heal, right?

366
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,560
Yes, Miss.

367
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,500
Fuyao, this slut.

368
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,890
You ruined me.

369
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,160
I will ruin you, too!

370
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,450
I waited for you for so long and you didn’t come.

371
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,990
Thus, I was afraid.

372
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,120
Thus, I gritted my teeth and walked into the forest.

373
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,960
But after I entered the forest, I realized that the forest is not scary at all.

374
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,230
But I yelled for you for so long and you didn’t answer me.

375
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,080
I was afraid again.

376
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,200
But luckily I met them.

377
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,260
By the way, I heard from them that there are dense fogs and miasmas in the forest later.

378
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,120
Do you mean, because I encountered those dense fogs and miasmas, I had illusions?

379
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,590
Right.

380
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,030
- That’s what they all said.
- No wonder.

381
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,950
Miss.

382
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,060
Hey, General Ji.

383
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,670
If you didn’t meet our general today, I’m afraid that you would be buried in the forest now.

384
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,090
You’re hungry, right? Here.

385
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,860
Thank you.

386
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,290
Our general said that there is dirty stuff in this forest.

387
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,090
We pity you, brother and sister.

388
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:29,340
Just travel along with us for these few days.

389
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,860
You can then decide once we exit this forest.

390
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,230
- Older Sis Fuyao.
- Hey.

391
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,530
What's the name of your general?

392
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,630
This... Miss, you don’t have to know.

393
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,920
Our General has an important mission.

394
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,940
He shouldn’t meddle in this type of business.

395
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,920
If today’s situation wasn’t urgent...

396
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,510
Forget it.

397
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,030
It’s good enough if you appreciate his help.

398
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,780
You better not create trouble.

399
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,900
Thank you.

400
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,960
- Eat then.
- Thank You, General Ji.

401
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:14,600
This General Ji looks good.

402
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,640
But-But that coffin face.

403
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,360
But thanks to him saving me today.

404
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,000
I think his surname is Zhan.

405
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,820
Who told you?

406
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:33,520
If I’m not wrong, he is of the royal clan of the Heaven Fiend Nation.

407
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,530
Maybe he’s a prince.

408
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,730
Just not long after leaving the mountain and you already learned to talk nonsense.

409
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,930
I’m not talk— I’m not talking nonsense.

410
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,000
Look. Look at the bell he’s carrying at his waist.

411
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:55,340
An adult man carrying a bell on his waist, it’s quite funny.

412
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,660
That thing is called Earth Absorbing Bell.

413
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,470
It’s a treasure of the Heaven Fiend Nation. Only royal blood can carry it.

414
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,140
What’s the matter? Is this bell very valuable?

415
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,940
This is not about whether it’s valuable or not.

416
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,410
The main point is this bell can ward off evils and avoid monsters.

417
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:16,010
I think the reason of why they're not scared of the ghosts in this forest is mainly because of this bell.

418
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,170
How do you know?

419
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,620
I... Before you and Uncle Zhou adopted me,

420
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,410
I traveled around in Jianghu with my grandfather for a while.

421
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,060
You were this big when me and Uncle Zhou adopted you.

422
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,000
How did you travel in Jianghu? You.

423
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,130
- You learnt to talk nonsense, right?
- Older Sis Fuyao, I will not say it again. I’m sorry.

424
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:38,920
Stop pulling. It hurts.

425
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,390
Stop pulling.

426
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,700
I don’t care if you believe it or not.

427
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,680
- Where are you going?
- To poop.

428
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,730
Just do it here.

429
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,980
- Clique Leader Yan, Congratulations.
- Congratulations. Congratulations, Clique Leader Yan.

430
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,720
I’ll stop sending you. Safe journey.

431
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,780
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

432
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,640
Why are you unhappy?

433
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,560
Tomorrow is the day we leave to the capital for our wedding.

434
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,470
Chen’er thinks—

435
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,000
Things have become like this. You have no right to think about other things.

436
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,030
Even if you are unwilling, you have to pretend like you’re willing.

437
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,560
Yes.

438
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,360
You're the future owner of Mt. Mystic Soul.

439
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,470
You must always put the general good above everything else.

440
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,630
You are doing this marriage so as to get the chance to go to Capital Kun and open up career opportunities for youself.

441
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:02,030
This is the best choice that I, your dad, can make for you.

442
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,430
Chen’er understands.

443
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:07,540
Remember, you are the hope of Yan Clan.

444
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,060
You must step on my shoulders and go even further.

445
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,150
Yes.

446
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,850
Do you still have the Spirit Breaker Powder I gave you?

447
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,630
That is the one Father wanted me to give to Fuyao.

448
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,670
Keep it safe.

449
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,100
I know you don’t like Pei Yuan,

450
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,710
especially after her face was ruined.

451
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,140
She was immature but she’s evil now.

452
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,160
I know you will suffer from marrying this kind of girl.

453
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,630
But you have to endure this.

454
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,110
You have to endure until the time is right.

455
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,400
Endure until the time when she’s not valuable to you anymore.

456
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,360
Father.

457
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:00,010
The relationship between people is just for mutual usage.

458
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,980
You married her because of her mother’s family’s power.

459
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,140
Once your position in Capital Kun is stable,

460
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,570
with Pei Yuan’s personality,

461
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,570
she will only cause troubles in the future; she will never be able to help you.

462
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,100
By then, this Spirit Breaker Powder will help you.

463
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,830
Father wants me to—

464
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,990
Just remember one thing, you have to be careful on everything.

465
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,360
Once you use this item, you must find a scapegoat.

466
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,590
If people don’t suspect you,

467
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,370
her death will bring you everyone’s pity,

468
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:40,440
and this pity will give you more opportunities.

469
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,240
No, Father.

470
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,460
I can’t do this even if I don’t like her.

471
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,860
Soft-hearted ones can’t succeed.

472
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,780
Fine.

473
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:58,790
We still need to take our time making a plan for this.

474
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,670
You will leave tomorrow.

475
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,540
I won’t say much about this.

476
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,230
Remember what I said.

477
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,530
Yes.

478
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,630
Miss, here’s your cloak.

479
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,650
Miss, what happened to you?

480
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,020
Are you sick?

481
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,230
Your hands are trembling.

482
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,800
Miss.

483
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,180
Miss, are you okay?

484
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,900
Mother, has the water gone cold?

485
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,380
No, it's not cold.

486
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,200
I'll tell them to get more flower petals.

487
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,840
No need.

488
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,900
Ye'er, I want to hear you sing.

489
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,820
Okay.

Wake up. Wake up.

500
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,820
What is it?

501
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,730
Hand it over.

502
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,170
Hand over what?

503
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,190
The Earth Absorbing Bell.

504
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:54,220
Earth Absorbing Bell?

505
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,700
That thing is really called Earth Absorbing Bell?

506
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,280
You indeed know.

507
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,560
It looks like I didn't falsely accuse you.

508
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,700
Hand over the bell now and

509
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,660
I'll let you go.

510
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,770
What happened?

511
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,170
Did you lose your bell?

512
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:16,190
You even dare to deny it face-to-face when you've stolen my stuff?

513
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:18,610
You are quite bold.

514
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,000
You say that I stole your item.

515
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,040
Why then am I still sleeping here?

516
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,820
Aren't I too careless?

517
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:30,300
Is there such a stupid thief like me in this world?

518
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,200
I don't know if you're stupid or not.

519
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,280
But your accomplice isn't.

520
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,710
He took my item and left.

521
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,080
Where is Xiaoqi?

522
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,200
Xiaoqi!

523
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,010
Tie her up.

524
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:49,230
No one must let her go until we catch that thief.

525
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,180
Yes.

526
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,890
Owner, have you seen a man wearing white clothes and a golden headdress?

527
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,050
White clothes with golden headdress?

528
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,370
Customer, have you seen one?

529
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,050
I seemed to have remembered it. He went that way.

530
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,370
- Okay. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

531
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,860
Take care.

532
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,530
Customer, two copper coins for the tea.

533
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,320
Painful... Mister... Painful...

534
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,870
You are getting better at playing.

535
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,640
I learned this from you.

536
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,500
One must do a complete act.

537
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,010
How is the situation in Capital Kun?

538
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:54,780
The roof that's been blocking the water disaster won't last that long.

539
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,310
I'm guessing that the old king inside the palace, Xuanyuan Ren, won't live that long.

540
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,160
How about Qi Zhen?

541
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,750
He has rushed back down from Mt. Mystic Soul.

542
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,550
He's been asking about your whereabouts along the way.

543
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,790
He even posted a public writing

544
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:11,650
looking for a woman who escaped from Mt. Mystic Soul.

545
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,500
This girl is really something.

546
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:19,370
Oh, right. Our secret agents in the city are in position.

547
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,000
We can set out for Capital Kun by today.

548
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,840
Okay. It's time to do a serious matter.

549
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,020
Your mustache is so ugly.

550
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,090
Is it?

551
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,880
It's just okay, right?

552
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,050
General, Capital Kun is just in front!

553
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,730
Okay.

554
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,530
What about that lady?

555
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,330
What? You finally believed that it wasn't me who stole your bell?

556
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:16,990
I just don't like torturing women.

557
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,070
Aren't you afraid that I'll escape while you're not looking?

558
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,620
Sure. Just try.

559
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,340
General, a letter.

560
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,530
Hasten our steps.

561
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,120
Those people at the back are closing in.

562
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,640
Yes!

563
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,860
General, what about that lady?

564
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,170
Bring her here.

565
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,400
Quickly go over there.

566
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,690
How is the king?

567
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,630
I am stupid and my medicinal skills are limited.

568
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:51,290
- How is the situation?
- Leave now.

569
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:53,440
All of you, leave.

570
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,440
- Official Zhang.
- Official Zhang.

571
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,560
- Official Zhang.
- His Majesty—

572
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,090
Forgive me for being useless.

573
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,180
Has the king awakened?

574
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,310
How long still before Qi Zhen is back in the palace?

575
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,780
This—

576
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,120
What's so hard to say?

577
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,430
I heard that Prime Minister is already back in his manor.

578
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,260
When?

579
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,560
Last night.

580
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,780
How dare him!

581
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,620
The king is gravely sick, while he, being the prime minister,

582
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,230
didn't even immediately return to the palace to visit the king.

583
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:01,530
He totally isn't putting any importance to the whole Xuanyuan royal clan.

584
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,830
May Official calm down.

585
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:05,300
Maybe Prime Minister is also worrying.

586
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,500
Worrying?

587
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,850
Can he be more worried than me?

588
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:12,880
I heard that the Heir Apparent Xuanyuan Min is missing.

589
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,340
He got abducted by evil people in Mt. Mystic Soul.

590
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,520
- His whereabouts are unknown.
- What did you say?

591
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,700
I even heard that Prime Minister is suspecting that it was you who abducted Heir Apparent.

592
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:27,000
He said that you wanted to take hold of the government and refused to hand it over to the new Heir Apparent.

593
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,280
Totally nonsense.

594
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,780
Slander!
