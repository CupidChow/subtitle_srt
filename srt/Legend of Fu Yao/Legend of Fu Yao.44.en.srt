00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,200
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,900
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,300
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,900
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,200
~ Episode 44 ~

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,340
Don't be afraid.

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,970
Even if they stop caring for you,

24
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,640
I will keep you company continuously.

25
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,160
Don't be afraid.

26
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,020
Fifth Older Brother, why don't I tell you a story?

27
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:13,600
When I was little, Royal Older Brother and I went to Heaven Fiend.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,600
In the end, we had entered the palace and got lost.

29
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,100
Unintentionally, we wandered into a very beautiful palace hall.

30
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,700
I then saw you were helping a very beautiful lady to wash her hair.

31
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,300
Do you know?

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:43,000
For as long as I had lived, I had never seen a boy helping a woman wash her hair.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,400
In our Qiongye,

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,000
my King Father and Royal Older Brothers' hair were all washed by women.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,700
If the water got a little cold, they would kick them out of the way.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,400
I remembered in front of that palace hall that day,

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,700
the crepe myrtle flowers were blooming on your head.

38
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Slowly,

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,400
you helped that woman clean her hair.

40
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Then slowly,

41
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,700
you used a handkerchief to dry that woman's hair.

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,900
From that time, I have taken you as my Mr. Right.

43
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,600
Do you still remember?

44
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,900
I said to you at that time.

45
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,400
I said, "Hey, I fell in love with you.

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,900
If I want to be your lover, I want to be the first and only."

47
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,200
You didn't answer me at that time.

48
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
Although you still haven't said yes to me,

49
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,460
but in my heart,

50
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,780
I'm already your woman.

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm not afraid for you to laugh at me.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,900
I just like you and want to follow you.

53
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,200
Even if the whole world rejects it,

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,300
I will still like you.

55
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,900
Zhan Beiye, listen carefully.

56
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,040
You are the best person I have seen,

57
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,900
so I surely will not let you die.

58
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
I surely will let you live.

59
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you hear me?

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,200
Fifth Older Brother, do you know about our Qiongye's protocol?

61
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,200
You surely have heard of it, right?

62
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,010
Okay.

63
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,400
Today, I'll use our protocol to save you.

64
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Fuyao!

65
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,360
This is indeed the Sky Gate Ruin.

66
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,700
What must come will eventually come.

67
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,800
Come.

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,600
I already knew that I wouldn't need to waste too much talking when I saw you.

69
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,500
But we are of the same root originally,

70
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,400
why must you be this heartless?

71
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,680
Who really are you?

72
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,000
What do you want?

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,650
I am you.

74
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,500
You are me.

75
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,360
Why don't you kill me?

76
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,800
Is it because you can't kill me?

77
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Or are you scared and don't want to face me?

78
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,000
Just like how you refused to face those dark things inside your heart.

79
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,800
Don't think you can use this witchcraft to bewitch me!

80
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,400
Bewitch you?

81
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,700
No, I am here to help you.

82
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not the wind moving.

83
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,800
It's not the banner moving.

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
It's the heart that's moving.

85
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
Wuji!

86
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,090
Follow me.

87
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
One more time.

88
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,000
Fuyao.

89
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,900
But Father has said,

90
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
once we use this protocol,

91
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,280
the lightest effect is we might just harm our body and

92
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:26,010
the most severe is we might lose our life.

93
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,080
Fifth Older Brother,

94
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,090
I am afraid that I might not be here when you wake up.

95
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,590
I am not scared of death.

96
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,100
Really, I am not scared of death.

97
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
The only thing I am scared of is not being able to see you again.

98
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,820
Fifth Older Brother,

99
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,570
promise me that you will live well.

100
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,900
You must live well.

101
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,680
Do you hear me?

102
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,800
Also,

103
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:31,400
the last thing I will beg you is to never forget me.

104
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,230
Do you see?

105
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,600
There are so many regrets and fears.

106
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,660
What to do?

107
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,130
Why don't you go to sleep there?

108
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:42,890
Once you sleep, you won't have to think about it anymore.

109
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,770
Girl, girl!

110
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,730
Wake up. Wake up!

111
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,880
Girl!

112
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,830
Girl, wake up!

113
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,770
You're awake.

114
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
Once you're awake—

115
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,380
Do you want to kill me?

116
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,170
That's right.

117
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,040
Since you are me and I am you,

118
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,350
your strengths are my strengths.

119
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,990
My weaknesses are your weaknesses.

120
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,310
Girl.

121
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,730
Girl.

122
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,070
I never thought that I'd be able to see our Crown Prince Wuji here inside the Sky Gate Ruin.

123
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,350
I never thought that I'd be able to see our Crown Prince Wuji here inside the Sky Gate Ruin.

124
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,560
Aren't you dead already?

125
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,040
And this Fuyao,

126
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,590
she escaped Yao City because she was lucky.

127
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:07,230
But today, she doesn't have such luck.

128
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,900
Actually, I should thank you two nicely today.

129
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,600
Thank you for sending yourselves to die in front of me.

130
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,840
Now, all the citizens of Five Regions

131
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,430
will only remember that I went through Sky Gate Ruin alone

132
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:27,580
and came back safely.

133
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,260
The story of Crown Prince Wuji

134
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:34,010
will no longer be brought up any more.

135
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:45,670
But this is the smartest thing you've ever done for this lifetime.

136
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:51,620
Isn't it all thanks to so many years of assistance from you?

137
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,460
Now I do regret a little.

138
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,050
I shouldn't have spared you your life back then.

139
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,810
It's too late.

140
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,770
I'll send Your Highness Crown Prince away today.

141
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,310
Save me!

142
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,020
Save me. Save me quickly!

143
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,590
You've done all sorts of evil.

144
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,750
Why must we save you?

145
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,530
Don't, don't. I was just envious of the title of the heir of Megrez.

146
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,080
I just wanted one, too.

147
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,750
I was wrong. I was wrong. Hurry and save me!

148
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,590
I can't hold on anymore, Wuji! Wuji!

149
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,920
How should we deal with him?

150
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,120
Save me!

151
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,580
Wuji!

152
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,470
Wuji! I beg of you, please save me!

153
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,220
Zhuzhu! Zhuzhu?

154
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,670
What exactly happened to General Zhan?

155
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,010
Did something happen to him?

156
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,780
He-He will wake up soon.

157
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,840
Really?

158
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,060
General Zhan will be recovered.

159
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,660
That's good.

160
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,250
General Zhan will really wake up soon.

161
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,280
Then, Zhuzhu, you—

162
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:30,700
Zhuzhu, what happened to you?

163
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,850
You... What did you do?

164
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,280
I've saved him.

165
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,510
You've saved him.

166
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,660
Your eyes?

167
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,240
Zhuzhu, are you crazy?

168
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,490
Why did you do this?

169
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,180
We have the Earth Absorbing Bell.

170
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,410
We can save him. He won't die.

171
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,620
You didn't have to give up your eyes, you know?

172
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,260
Those are your eyes.

173
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,870
Xiaoqi, Fifth Older Brother will wake up soon.

174
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,990
Let's not wake him up. Okay?

175
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,860
Zhuzhu...

176
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,990
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes...

177
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,900
Xiaoqi,

178
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,850
can I ask you to do something?

179
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,130
Okay? Promise me, okay?

180
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,540
No.

181
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,560
Zhuzhu, are you okay? Are you okay?

182
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,500
Can you promise me one thing?

183
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,480
Okay.

184
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,490
♫ Wait for waking up from dreams and then long for ♫

185
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,940
When Fifth Older Brother wakes up,

186
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,360
you must not tell him.

187
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,390
I don't want him to feel guilty.

188
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,390
♫ See if our promises can be tested ♫

189
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,690
No matter what price I must pay,

190
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,300
I was all willing.

191
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,810
♫ That lady is infatuated with him ♫

192
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,330
If I clearly knew that I can save him,

193
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,280
but I only watched him die,

194
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,480
that would really kill me.

195
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,580
But... will he ever know?

196
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,890
You must not tell him, okay?

197
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,660
♫ Whom will I wait to go see bright flowers in full bloom with? ♫

198
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,430
I promise you.

199
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,750
- Oh, right.
- What?

200
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,230
When my Fifth Older Brother wakes up,

201
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,640
he might be very weak and afraid of cold.

202
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,770
You must provide him more heat and charcoal.

203
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,310
Although he doesn't like heat,

204
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,470
it's not up to him on this matter.

205
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,320
Also,

206
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,690
he likes to eat mountain deer stew with icy sprouts

207
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,090
and drink the Lingzi Brew of Music Winery in the western side of the city.

208
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,800
But that wine, you must warm it first.

209
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,440
♫ Wind dances and forest movements chase away oceans and rivers ♫

210

♫ We see another young man returning to his hometown ♫

211
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,730
♫ Your young face shows that you have no lover ♫

212
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,970
- Also...
- Say it.

213
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,360
Once he wakes up... he mustn't eat oily foods.

214
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,180
You must prepare a lot of fresh produce for him. Okay?

215
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:04,230
- Okay.
- In Rock City, you probably can buy them if you go to the southern market very early.

216
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,270
Don't worry.

217
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,650
Take good care of him on my behalf.

218
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,660
Please help me take care of him.

219
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,890
Slowly.

220
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:39,190
♫ Deserted long wilderness

240
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,210
Look. Isn't that five-colored sunlight?

241
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,480
The last time it appeared in Five Regions was when Crown Prince Wuji entered the Sky Gate Ruin alone.

242
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,050
Looks like...

243
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,310
That's right. Looks like His Highness Prince Assist has also succeeded in going through the Sky Gate Ruin.

244
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:14,320
This is really rare. The Zhangsun family has two heirs chosen by the gods.

245
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,040
This is the great blessing of Five Regions.

246
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,800
How is this a blessing?

247
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,620
Let's stop talking. Just look.

248
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,130
Royal Older Brother, looks like the territory of Heaven Fiend will be twenty percent more.

249
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,450
He's coming out!

250
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,910
His Highness Prince Assist!

251
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,990
It's Prince Assist. It's really Prince Assist.

252
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,190
Really?

253
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,440
It's indeed Prince Assist.

254
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,060
That's right...

255
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,230
It was Prince Assist who successfully survived the Sky Gate Ruin.

256
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,850
Look!

257
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,390
There is another person behind him.

258
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,710
Greetings, Your Highness Crown Prince Wuji!

259
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,680
Eunuch Han, please rise.

260
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,660
You're back.

261
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,860
You're finally back.

262
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,890
Heaven is really blessing Megrez.

263
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:54,500
You are indeed the predestined heir, the bearer of the seal.

264
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,080
You were destined to safely return.

265
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,820
Today, I'm deeply honored to be welcoming two Megrez royal sons.

266
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,420
This is indeed a blessing to my Heaven Fiend.

267
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,330
Looks like we're able to witness again the sacred feat of Crown Prince Wuji.

268
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,190
What's going on?

269
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,110
When did Crown Prince arrive here in Rock City?

270
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,800
Why didn't you inform us first?

271
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,390
Thanks to you, I didn't die in Rock City.

272
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,090
What great luck.

273
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,180
Respectfully welcoming the return of His Highness Crown Prince Wuji!

274
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,980
Respectfully welcoming the return of Crown Prince Wuji!

275
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,350
Save me! Quickly save me!

276
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,410
I have the antidote! I have the anti—

277
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,930
Wuji...

278
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,760
What did you say?

279
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,400
I didn't say anything.

280
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,500
Why didn't you give me the antidote when I asked you for it before.

281
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:17,160
Isn't it all because she cut off my—

282
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,830
I'm giving you a chance.

283
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,450
Give me the antidote now and I'll spare your life.

284
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,240
I'm unable to give it to you now.

285
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,710
This... This antidote is my blood.

286
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,950
When Teacher concocted this Passion Lockup Toxin,

287
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,880
because the poison is too strong, if a person wants to rid himself of the poison,

288
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,280
he must continuously take in the antidote for 72 days.

289
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,290
But when Teacher died, the only thing that can cure the poison now is my blood.

290
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,690
Why must we believe you?

291
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,910
I can swear by Heaven that everything I say is true.

292
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,530
Okay then. Since that's the case, I also have something here to show you.

293
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,270
What are you doing?

294
00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:01,270
This item was given by Zong Yue to me back then.

295
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:06,740
It's called... Seven Apertures Bone Breaking pill.

296
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,000
Nothing will really happen to you after taking it.

297
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,830
You just will bleed from your seven apertures and your bones will break until you die.

298
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,150
- You—
- Remember.

299
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,150
An antidote in exchange for the antidote.

300
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:50,730
- How did it go?
- His blood is indeed a guiding drug.

301
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,500
Once I've gathered the proper medicinal ingredients, I can concoct you an antidote.

302
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,340
I feel sorry for Fuyao then. Let's go.

303
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,400
Hey!

304
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,130
Wuji.

305
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,310
The antidote?

306
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,490
The antidote.

307
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,140
Older brother took in the Seven Aperture Bone Breaking Pill that you gave Fuyao last time.

308
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,550
It's better to cure such a poisonous thing as soon as possible,

309
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,750
so my older brother won't die from bleeding from his seven apertures.

310
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,380
That's right. That's right.

311
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,910
Okay.

312
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,920
Don't rush.

313
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,660
This one, take it. It will save your life.

314
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:38,390
I'll keep the other half first.

315
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,640
As long as you are obedient, I'll deliver this pill to your manor after a few days.

316
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,150
You...

317
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,120
Wuji, we'd made an agreement before.

318
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,520
You mustn't break your words like this.

319
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,790
You kept wanting to kill me.

320
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,350
I didn't kill you and instead saved you.

321
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,000
Older Brother, aren't I being too kind on you?

322
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,860
No...

323
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,710
Prince Eternal is here!

324
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,910
Crown Prince Wuji, Royal Older Brother knows that you had a bumpy journey for days and nights.

325
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,350
He was afraid that we were unable to entertain you well.

326
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,920
He especially set up a banquet tonight and invites both princes to give him his honor and go there together.

327
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,330
I just survived a great ordeal and am already very exhausted.

328
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,150
Let's just reschedule this banquet some other day.

329
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,670
How come I don't remember giving Fuyao any Bone Breaking Pill?

330
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,920
What's going on?

331
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,260
That was just a mud ball she created from the ground.

332
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,090
Who knows if Zhangsun Pingrong really believed it?

333
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,490
When a person is greedy for power, he will become afraid of death.

334
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,850
If he fears death, he'll lose control.

335
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,280
In the end, he couldn't even discern what's true from false.

336
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,560
The style and manner that Fuyao does things is becoming more and more similar to some person.

337
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,640
As they say, proximity to cinnabar makes you red, to pitch makes you black.

338
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,220
What about the antidote that you gave him?

339
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,900
A poison.

340
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,560
Don't worry. He won't die.

341
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,620
It just will be a bit unsightly.

342
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,460
Your Highness Prince Assist, what really happened inside Sky Gate Ruin today?

343
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,900
How come Crown Prince came out from it?

344
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,000
How would I know?

345
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,940
His Majesty asks that since Crown Prince is now back, then your agreement last time—

346
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,490
Do you finally know to ask me?

347
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,680
Do you all only have that Crown Prince Wuji in your eyes?

348
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,690
Let me tell you—

349
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:47,660
Then our Heaven Fiend's Earth Absorbing Bell?

350
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,550
Earth Absorbing Bell! Earth Absorbing Bell!

351
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:53,380
If not because that item of yours didn't work, would I end up like this now?

352
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,030
Since you don't have any use for it now, why don't you return it to me soon?

353
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,680
I...

354
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,090
I...

355
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,840
Preposterous!

356
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,810
I've already found most of the medicinal ingredients you asked me to search.

357
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:20,010
It's just that... that Geya rose... I really couldn't find it.

358
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,580
I've already asked someone to get that.

359
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,900
It should arrive soon.

360
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,540
Geya Desert is so far and dangerous.

361
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,730
Who's willing to get it?

362
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,460
Mr. Zong, someone's looking for you.

363
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:38,180
Mr. Zong, this is the item that you asked.

364
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,090
[Imperial Mud Shop]

365
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,890
Right. The main ingredient of the facial toner from the Imperial Mud Shop is Geya rose.

366
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,630
Thank you, shop manager. Sorry for letting you personally come here.

367
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,780
It's nothing.

368
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,960
Hope that this rose is useful to you.

369
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,250
I'll take my leave now.

370
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,990
Thanks.

371
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,950
Quickly help me give Fuyao her medicine.

372
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,940
♫ Deserted long wilderness

373
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,020
♫ Torrential rivers and oceans

374
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,780
♫ My son has left

375
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,270
♫ I don't know where he went

376
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,380
Zhan Beiye! Zhan Beiye! Lie down...

377
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,680
Fuyao.

378
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,790
You're awake.

379
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,290
I was even thinking earlier to use this to save your life.

380
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,800
I didn't expect that you were already awake.

381
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,650
I'm returning it to its rightful owner.

382
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,180
Earth Absorbing Bell?

383
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,080
What's going on?

384
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,160
You slept for too long. So many things have happened when you were asleep.

385
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:08,380
Once you've recovered, I'll tell them to you one by one.

386
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,980
Rest well for now. I'll go tell them that you're awake.

387
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:17,480
Fuyao, when I was unconscious,

388
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,720
were you singing a song to me?

389
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,740
A Heaven Fiend song?

390
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,880
My singing is very bad.

391
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,960
I might scare you.

392
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,700
Xiaoqi.

393
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,780
- Older Sis Fuyao.
- Zhan Beiye is awake.

394
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,720
Where's Zhuzhu?

395
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:48,240
Zhuzhu? She-She was too tired so she went to sleep first.

396
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,410
She's asleep?

397
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,170
She could bear to go to sleep?

398
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:54,210
Didn't she keep General Zhan company for the last few days? She didn't get much rest.

399
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,320
Maybe she was really tired today so she went to sleep.

400
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,820
But...

401
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,640
Never mind. Let her sleep.

402
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,070
She really has been too tired.

403
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:08,180
Once she's awake and knows Zhan Beiye's awake, she'll definitely be happy.

404
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,820
Penny for your thoughts?

405
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,890
I've got no money. I'm thinking the medicine the doctor gave me is too bitter.

406
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,980
The Passion Lockup Toxin within you is cured.

407
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,910
- But—
- But?

408
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,430
Although the toxin is gone, you shouldn't eat anything cold in the next seven days.

409
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,780
All right.

410
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,740
I had her take the antidote.

411
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,030
The toxin will be gone within seven days.

412
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,480
But one thing is strange.

413
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,220
- Do you mean her pulse?
- Yes.

414
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,430
Generally speaking, after taking the antidote, her pulse should be smooth and flowing unimpeded.

415
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,380
But her pulse goes in the wrong direction.

416
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,480
There is a new force through her veins.

417
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,930
It seems to be growing stronger and stronger.

418
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,260
So what exactly happened to you guys within Sky Gate Ruin?

419
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,890
Maybe in Sky Gate Ruin,

420
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:18,430
could it be that the seals on her were triggered and broken by something?

421
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:20,840
Have you never suspected?

422
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:31,050
You clearly know that within Fuyao, there are several contradicting forces.

423
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:35,480
Even though every time a seal is broken, her pulse will be more steady,

424
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,760
but the other hidden forces become ever stronger.

425
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,990
These contradicting forces are very dangerous.

426
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:54,510
The Sealing Technique had disappeared from the Five Regions for thousands of years.

427
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,090
Why would it have been used on Fuyao?

428
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,710
And there are five seals.

429
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,400
Is she really just a poor disciple of Mt. Mystic Soul?

430
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,460
Could it be that you have never suspected?

431
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:16,030
Nothing can escape the Medical Sage Zong.

432
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:21,920
As for me, I just need to know that she's my Fuyao.

433
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,620
That's enough.

434
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,750
Really?

435
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:33,180
You are the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

436
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:38,300
Only you can change the universe. Find the girl with the Five-Colored Stone.

437
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,370
Or else, the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

438
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,810
Your Majesty. There's news.

439
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,950
Come to tell me at my ear.

440
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,150
Crown Prince Wuji is still alive.

441
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,650
He has broken through the Sky Gate Ruin.

442
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,970
They told me you had fasted for several days.

443
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,100
Why put yourself through that?

444
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,820
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

445
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:57,020
You're the Empress of the Megrez.

446
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,460
The good health of the Empress is what I want.

447
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,520
There's no need for you to lie, Your Majesty.

448
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:12,080
Everything has gone according to your plan.

449
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,600
Whether I live or die,

450
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,970
why does it concern you?

451
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,210
The one I hate is still alive.

452
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,490
How can you say everything has gone according to my plan?

453
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:30,550
Empress,

454
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,580
do you hate him?

455
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,390
Why would I hate him?

456
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,510
For him, you lost your propriety and integrity.

457
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,830
You don't even want the honor as an Empress.

458
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:55,030
But he left you and cared only for his own life.

459
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,220
Your Majesty,

460
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,560
you've never truly loved anyone in your lifetime

461
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:19,210
nor trusted anyone. Right?

462
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:31,990
If by saying he has escaped can make you happier,

463
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,230
then so be it.

464
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,200
Yet I clearly understand,

465
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,830
he'll only have a chance to save me, if he lives.

466
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:54,420
I've never hated him.

467
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm actually quite grateful.

468
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,120
Then you should definitely live well.

469
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,380
Zhangsun Jiong,

470
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:19,070
you used me as bait to entrap him.

471
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:24,640
In the future, I will never allow you to do that again.

472
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,100
In the past, when Wuji was alive,

473
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,820
I cared about his future.

474
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,620
I endured everything.

475
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,830
Now Ji'er is gone.

476
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:52,310
In this caged prison, there will no longer be anyone or anything

477
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,370
which you can use to force me.

478
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,390
Throughout your life,

479
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:11,900
whether it's about situations or people, you've always made the wrong judgement.

480
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,770
I'm afraid you're going to get disappointed this time again.

481
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,590
Wuji is still alive.

00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,250
♫ It mistakenly causes another miss to find no one ♫

487
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,420
♫ Roam around the world ♫

488
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:13,530
♫ Love and hate tease me ♫

489
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:23,420
♫ The hunger of a speeding pulse ♫

490
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,550
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

491
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:33,690
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

492
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:38,880
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

493
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,300
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫

494
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:01,270
♫ Only because of you, I let the fated life wave goodbye ♫

495
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:06,440
♫ Also only because of you, it lets me get saved ♫

496
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,580
♫ Roam around the world ♫

497
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:16,770
♫ Love and hate tease me ♫

498
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:26,620
♫ The hunger of a speeding pulse ♫

499
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,690
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

500
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,920
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

501
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,000
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

502
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,790
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫
