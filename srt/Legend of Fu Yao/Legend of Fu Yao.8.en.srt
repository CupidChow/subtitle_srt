00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,900
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,900
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,900
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,000
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 8 ~

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
Search!

23
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
Yes!

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,160
Hurry!

25
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,700
Walk faster! Walk faster! Go over there!

26
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,400
Hurry! Hurry! You, go over there!

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,000
Hurry! Go!

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
Hurry and leave!

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,400
Hurry! Behave!

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Hurry! Squat down!

31
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
This way!

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,390
Godfather, the carriage that escaped down the hill has been searched.

33
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,900
Heir Apparent was not there.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,500
It could be a trick of misdirection.

35
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,400
The way I see it Heir Apparent must be still at Mt. Mystic Soul.

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,600
Anywhere else that hasn't been searched?

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,270
Both the inside and outside of the mountain villa have been searched.

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,200
Yan Lie is also checking all the secret passages.

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,200
But there are no traces of Heir Apparent.

40
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,100
Now, there's only Medical Sage Zong's courtyard at the east side that hasn't been searched.

41
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,400
Stay and wait for orders.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,460
Mr. Zong.

43
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,000
It's rare that Prime Minister yourself comes to visit.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Paying a visit late at night is really not my intention.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,200
I would like to know if you have seen Heir Apparent.

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,800
A few days ago, Heir Apparent had called me in.

47
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Is that what you are inquiring?

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,000
Prime Minister asked you if you knew about the whereabouts of Heir Apparent.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,700
I do have some urgent matters.

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,600
Please ask Heir Apparent to come out.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,000
Although I met Heir Apparent a couple of times,

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,720
but we are not that close.

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,400
How is it possible for him to hide here this late at night?

54
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,300
Of course, Prime Minister may not believe what I've said.

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,800
If you want to search, go ahead and search.

56
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
How dare you to be so disrespectful to Prime Minister!

57
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,500
Restrain yourself!

58
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,000
If that's the case, excuse me for the disturbance.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
You people go into the house and search.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,800
The rest of you go search other places. Search carefully!

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, Official Yun!

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,900
You all right?

63
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,290
This is?

64
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,900
This is Jinxianshecao.

65
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,200
Reporting to Prime Minister, there's no one in the backyard.

66
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,400
- Continue to search.
- Yes.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Does Prime Minister know that nowadays Jinxianshecao is a precious herbal medicine?

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,900
Every year during the fall and winter,

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,300
you can only find a small quantity in the mountains here.

70
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,600
No, Prime Minister!

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,100
Jinxianshecao is extremely poisonous and the poison can spread very quickly.

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Am I being poisoned?

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
You traitor!

74
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,000
If you kill me, Prime Minister would have no one to cure him.

75
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,300
Yun Hen.

76
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,700
Mr. Zong, you are the medical sage.

77
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,500
This time, there won't be any mishap to me, the Prime Minister of Deep Water. Right?

78
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
This Jinxianshecao is toxic, but luckily, you only touched one leaf.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,200
You will be fine when the toxic blood all comes out.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,500
- Except—
- Except what?

81
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,300
Except the fragrance in this courtyard smells ordinary,

82
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,400
but actually it is the residual poison from the medicine I've been making for these past few days.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,100
Unless someone is highly skilled, I fear—

84
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,100
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

85
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,000
Reporting to Prime Minister, all of a sudden, he is not well.

86
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

87
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
As I've said, the fragrance is toxic.

88
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Within an incense stick of time, take a bath in clean water,

89
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
and drink plenty of water. He will be fine then.

90
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,400
Otherwise, even though I'm the medical sage,

91
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200
I won't be able to make a large quantity of antidote in such a short time.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Godfather, this—

93
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,700
This is all I can say.

94
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,000
The decision is all up to you, Prime Minister.

95
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,800
But if Prime Minister is still looking for that person

96
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,310
and if that person was hiding in here,

97
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,400
he was probably killed by the toxic fragrance already.

98
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,500
If you don't believe me, you can continue the search.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Mr. Zong, sorry for the disturbance.

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,300
Withdraw!

101
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,550
We are safe, right?

102
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
Thank you for saving us, Sir!

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,170
You are really brilliant, Sir!

104
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,800
They almost found us.

105
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
You gave it a shot and they had to withdraw quickly.

106
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,100
His given title, Medical Sage, was not given to him for nothing!

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,800
May I ask, Sir,

108
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,000
is the fragrance in this courtyard really toxic?

109
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
This—

110
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Is he going to die just to say a few more words?

111
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,500
This is the scent of Osmanthus.

112
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,200
It's really the scent of Osmanthus.

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,500
Only those evil minded people would think that the scent was toxic.

114
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,140
Did your wound burst?

115
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Zong Yue's medical skill is superb, but his temperament is very weird.

116
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,010
He never dressed wounds for women.

117
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,400
If not because of me today,

118
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,200
your arm would become useless.

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,690
Nonsense!

120
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,000
I never failed in treating wounds.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,200
Do you not know what "hear no evil" means?

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Lies are exposed so fast.

123
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Although it is exposed, I still want you to remember my kindness.

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,300
Yes, yes, I remember. I will repay you.

125
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,100
Why did you save me?

126
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,600
Because of Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

127
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Do you know about Breaking the Ninth Cloud?

128
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
It's the most wanted technique by all warriors in the Five Regions.

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,100
Do you also want to obtain Breaking the Ninth Cloud?

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,200
Don't think yourself above your business.

131
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,000
Although Breaking the Ninth Cloud is magical, it has no use to me.

132
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Even so, I can't let Yan Lie win.

133
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,300
Why?

134
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,800
Because Yan Lie and Qi Zhen ganged up together.

135
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,000
Like it says, "Enemies of enemies are friends."

136
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Since you are the target that Yan Lie wants to get rid of,

137
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,200
then you are the one I want to save.

138
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,000
What nonsense!

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,200
I'll believe you reluctantly.

140
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
I know you have saved me.

141
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,500
I will surely repay you for your kindness.

142
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,600
Although there's nothing I can do now, please remember,

143
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,200
one day you will surely need my help.

144
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
What are you doing?

145
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,600
I will remember what you have said today.

146
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,500
You!

147
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,480
Can you... help me with another favor?

148
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,010
When I was treating your wound earlier, I passed you my inner energy,

149
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,740
but you can only use it for four hours.

150
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,480
If you're going to use it, you have to grab the chance to do so.

151
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,580
How come you knew that I—

152
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,270
If you were not rushing to regain your inner energy,

153
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,300
why would your wound easily gape open?

154
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,640
If you're not in a rush to take revenge,

155
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,140
why would you be like this?

156
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,910
But I still have to remind you.

157
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,270
The clan's power behind Pei Yuan is extraordinary.

158
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,530
Do you... really want to do it?

159
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,220
I don’t care who her clan is.

160
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,800
I will never regret whatever I decide to do.

161
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,300
Well said.

162
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,490
Tomorrow, the water in the Mystic Soul River will rise.

163
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,120
It’s the best time to leave Mt. Mysitic Soul by flowing downwards.

164
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,270
I have prepared everything.

165
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:09,240
If you can catch up with me, we'll leave Mt. Mystic Soul together.

166
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,970
If you miss it,

167
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,300
you'll have to rely on yourself then.

168
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,200
Don't worry.

169
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,270
I'll definitely make it in time.

170
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,550
First Senior Brother, the people from the kitchen said you didn't eat dinner today.

171
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,750
Is it because the dishes don't suit your taste?

172
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,950
You see. I personally made some Fingered Citron Golden Rolls and Longjing Bamboo Shreds.

173
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,870
Hurry and try it. See if it suits your taste or not.

174
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,230
You worked hard, Junior Sister Pei.

175
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,560
But I’m not hungry now.

176
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,120
Take them away.

177
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,750
First Senior Brother, you're not even trying it.

178
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,220
Who are you mad at?

179
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,490
Junior Sister, you’re worrying too much.

180
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,680
I'm not mad at anyone.

181
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,100
Neither would I dare to be mad at anyone.

182
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,040
Then that means you're definitely angry.

183
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,110
Can it be that it's because of Fuyao?

184
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,930
The roads are slippery during this raining night.

185
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,390
Junior Sister, quickly return to rest early.

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,090
Senior Brother, why are you hesitating to say it?

187
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,910
Are you trying to ask if the disappearance of Fuyao has something to do with me?

188
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,030
I heard that Fuyao was pushed down the cliff by you.

189
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:20,510
Indeed, we can’t hide a secret in this world.

190
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,800
To be honest,

191
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,590
Fuyao learned Breaking the Ninth Cloud secretly and knew that she is guilty to the clique.

192
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,490
She jumped down the cliff herself.

193
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,570
No one forced her.

194
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,500
Could it be... Could it be that she escaped the prison by herself and jumped down the cliff by herself?

195
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,780
Indeed.

196
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,860
How is she?

197
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,570
Is she really dead? Yes?

198
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,530
First Senior Brother, it's better if you treat it like she's dead.

199
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:23,420
First Senior Brother, Teacher has decided the date for us to go to Capital Kun for our wedding.

200
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,760
What you should think about now is the future

201
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,810
not someone who died. Right?

202
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,100
It is time to think about your and my future well.

203
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,580
Senior Brother, what do you mean by this?

204
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,490
Marriage, marriage.

205
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,020
Since Junior Sister claims to always think for my sake,

206
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,230
I am overwhelmed by your love.

207
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,590
Senior Brother, you're being sarcastic.

208
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,940
Are you blaming me?

209
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,540
Can it be that all the things I did aren't for your and my future?

210
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,920
How could I blame you?

211
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,350
You’re Official Pei’s daughter, the Prime Minister's niece.

212
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,510
How would I blame you?

213
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:25,200
Senior Brother, have you ever liked me for real?

214
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,060
Junior Sister, go back and rest early.

215
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:15,900
Today, I got you some food from the doctor.

216
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,570
Look.

217
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
You must be itching to have these.

218
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,960
It's what you usually like to eat.

219
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,970
There's also wine.

220
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:34,650
You tell me, your person... If you're drinking, then you're drinking,

221
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,630
but you're always avoiding me.

222
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,650
What is it? Are you scared of me stopping you from drinking?

223
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,340
Or are you scared of me snatching away your drinks?

224
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,670
Today, we shall enjoy our drinks.

Actually...

227
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,170
Actually, I never thought that after I took part in the game,

228
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,020
there could be such dramatic changes happening here.

229
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,630
You tell me— You tell me... If I'd listened to your advice,

230
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,380
would it not have turned out like this right now?

231

It won't get Xiaoqi into troubles and you won’t—

Let's see where you'll run to.

234
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,070
You even climbed the tree, didn't you?

235
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,610
It's all my fault. It's all my fault.

236
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,450
Go.

237

Sorry.

I got you guys into trouble.

Silly child, what are you crying for?

There's something I didn't tell you about, right? Actually...

246
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,850
Actually, when you hit me with your poker before,

247
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,290
it was not painful at all.

248
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,970
I kept pretending that it hurt a lot.

249
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,610
Right now, I really hope

250
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:06,480
that you can hit me with your poker and tell me...

251
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,610
"Silly child, why are you so disobedient?"

252
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:35,650
I will remember the words that you told me.

Even though I don't know who I am

and why I have to unlock the seals,

255

but the world is so big, I should go take a look.

Tomorrow, I’ll leave here with Xiaoqi.

257

Uncle Zhou, take care of yourself here.

258

We'll come back often to visit you.

259

My biggest regret

260
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,910
is not being able to call you, "Father."

261

I hope from now on,

262
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,480
we will call each other father and daughter;

Kneel until you think it through.

- Withdraw!
- Godfather, are we just going to let him escape?

319
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,830
If he really wanted to escape, he wouldn't escape from here.

320

Inform everyone. Close every checkpoint.

00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,190
Yes.

325
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,610
It's almost four hours. Your inner energy is almost used up.

326
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,900
If we don't stop the bleeding immediately, your wound will rot.

327
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,010
Thanks. This wound is nothing.

328
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,080
Are you done finishing the matter that you have to finish?

329
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,020
Hurry and chase! Hurry!

330
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,920
They've caught up. Can you endure it?

331
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,800
- Yes.
- Let's go.

332
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,370
Prime Minister.

333
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,210
- Have you found the Heir Apparent?
- No, it's the Prefecture Princess. Prefecture Princess, she—

334
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,590
My face?

335
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,500
My face!

336
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,450
My face! My face!

337
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,430
All of you guys get lost! Get lost!

338
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,430
- My face!
- What's the situation?

339
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:36,750
She already saw the doctor.

340
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,590
The doctor said that Miss' injuries are nothing. It's just that—

341
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,220
It's just what?

342
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,350
It's just that her face—

343
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,570
Uncle, it’s Fuyao.

344
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,370
It’s that bitch who hurt me.

345
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,190
Kill her for me!

346
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:04,350
I must kill her!

347
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,790
As a Prefecture Princess, how can you be injured by a lowly slave?

348
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:15,630
If this was spread outside, there will just be laughter.

349
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,220
Until now, are you still blaming me?

350
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,610
Prime Minister.

351
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,880
Don't come over! Don't come over!

352
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,300
For this to happen in Mt. Mystic Soul,

353
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,460
how do you plan on explaining this to me?

354
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,240
Prime Minister, why don’t we talk outside so as to avoid disturbing Prefecture Princess.

355
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,160
Jingchen, you keep Prefecture Princess company.

356
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,640
Yes.

357
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,990
- Junior Sister.
- Don't come over! Get lost!

358
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,910
All right, all right. I won't come over.

359
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,570
- Get lost!
- All right.

360
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:17,890
Is it... Is it Fuyao who injured you?

361
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,750
She's not dead yet?

362
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,320
She isn't dead.

363
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,100
She's living quite well.

364
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,840
Are you especially happy?

365
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,600
She ruined me like this.

366
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,980
You can go find her.

367
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,990
You two can finally leave and be together!

368
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,420
That's not what I meant.

369
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,930
You say that with your mouth but you're laughing at me in your heart.

370
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,810
You’re laughing at me that

371
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,590
I want to kill Fuyao, this lowly slave, so badly,

372
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,450
but I am actually ruined by her.

373
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,590
You're hoping that she'll kill me with a sword

374
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,490
so both of you guys can be together!

375
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:16,340
What nonsense are you saying?

376
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,530
I'm talking nonsense?

377
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,300
Didn't you want to see me?

378
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,230
Do you want to see how many cuts she gave me underneath this face wrap?

379
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:33,830
Do you want to know how much my heart hurts? How much it hurts?

380
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,470
I'll take it off for you to look. I'll take it off for you to look!

381
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,370
- Junior Sister! Stop it!
- I'll take it off for you to look!

382
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,480
What's the point in torturing yourself like this!

383
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,870
I hate her so much! I hate her so much!

384
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,680
I hate her so much. Do you know?

385
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,460
I hate her so much!

386
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,300
Prime Minister, this happened too suddenly.

387
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,590
We, Mystic Soul Clique, didn’t protect her well.

388
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,260
Please punish us, Prime Minister.

389
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,230
This matter can be great or little.

390
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,460
Please explain, Prime Minister.

391
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,580
I’m suspecting that your Mystic Soul Clique is working with my enemies

392
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,420
to severely wound the Prefecture Princess and plot against the Heir Apparent.

393
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,570
That is heavy treason.

394
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,580
Prime Minister, please see the truth.

395
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,520
My Mystic Soul Clique has absolutely no thoughts of treason.

396
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,310
Of course, this may also be traitors in the palace conspiring with culprits,

397
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:44,910
wanting to kill the Heir Apparent, but being found out by the Prefecture Princess.

398
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:49,840
The Prefecture Princess got injured badly in order to save the Heir Apparent.

399
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,190
Prime Minister is wise.

400
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,150
I think this must be exactly what happened.

401
00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,060
Afterwards, everyone in your Mystic Soul Clique worked together to capture the culprit;

402
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,860
yet unfortunately the culprit had many comrades,

403
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
and in the end you were still late by a step.

404
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:11,660
Ultimately the Heir Apparent was taken away by the culprit, and even now there has been no trace.

405
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,150
Yes, I had set up checkpoints for all the paths in Mt. Mystic Soul.

406
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,870
I will definitely catch the culprit and find the Heir Apparent

407
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:23,080
to redeem ourselves to the Prime Minister, and redeem ourselves to the Imperial Court.

408
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,530
Clique Leader Yan, you’re indeed a smart person.

409
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,650
This incident happened in Mt. Mystic Soul.

410
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,310
If word of this were to spread out, to the Mystic Soul Clique,

411
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,020
there would be only harm and no benefits.

412
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,140
This is related to the state. Of course, I understand.

413
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,380
The less who know about them, the better.

414
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,930
I will leave the aftermath to you, Clique Leader Yan.

415
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,610
I understand.

416
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,040
Also,

417
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,220
Yuan’er was injured badly this time.

418
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,860
I wonder how Sir Yan feels about their marriage.

419
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,340
Prime Minister, you’re worrying too much.

420
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,710
Jingchen truly loves the Prefecture Princess.

421
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,930
No matter how bad the Prefecture Princess’ injury is,

422
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,330
his heart of marrying Prefecture Princess won't change.

423
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,290
It will be great then.

424
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,300
It will be great then.

425
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,540
You are already freezing so badly.

426
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,460
Come over and warm yourself up by the fire.

427
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,380
Come here.

428
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,020
Don’t think I’m weak now.

429
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,550
I still have strength to hit you.

430
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,920
I’m warning you, don’t take advantage of me.

431
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,200
Take advantage of you?

432
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,890
How come I feel it's like us falling in love with each other?

433
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,130
You didn’t do anything weird to me in the water, right?

434
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,180
You tell me.

435
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,360
What do you mean by weird things?

436
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,130
It seems like people are coming.

437
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:58,230
What are you doing? You!

438
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:00,000
Let me go!

439
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,940
Is this counted as a weird thing?

440
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,560
Thanks.

441
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:21,100
Someone is really coming.

442
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,020
Who would still believe you?

443
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,130
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

444
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,040
Xiaoqi? Xiaoqi!

445
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,000
Xiaoqi!

446
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,440
Older Sis Fuyao!
