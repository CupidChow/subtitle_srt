There are not that many people in the palace who can defeat Miss Fuyao.

It so happens that I’m very tired today.

I was thinking to summon the Lady here to sing some songs.

The Earth Absorbing Bell had been with you for some time.

166
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,260
It is connected to your blood and pulse.

167
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,480
Now it suddenly lost connection with you which is like pulling out your Inner Energy.

168
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,960
It’s not that serious like what you said.

169
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,930
Otherwise, Zhan Beiye wouldn’t give it to me.

170
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,860
"There's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip."

171
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,570
Of course, such an amazing Earth Absorbing Bell would, too.

172
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,900
- Hurt.
- I know, but you have to feel pain.

173
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,170
Only this can save your life.

174
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,230
Come here and search!

175
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,600
I think having a ghost is fake, but having an assassin is real.

176
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,010
Wait a minute! I've told you, no one came to our Intoxication Spreading House.

177
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,690
How would there be an assassin?

178
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,210
How do we know whether there is through your words?

179
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,790
We have to search through the whole Imperial Palace.

180
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,790
Of course, Intoxication Spreading House cannot be excluded.

181
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,140
- Our Lady has fallen asleep.
- We’re just following orders.

182
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,200
Stand aside!

183
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,270
You can’t go in!

184
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,690
- Lady—
- Let them in.

185
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,050
Lady Virtue, sorry for disturbing.

186
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,200
You’re just following orders.

187
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,810
How can we say that you disturb me?

188
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,430
Official, there’s nothing suspicious.

189
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,600
Official, nothing.

190
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,490
Then, go and search through the East Room.

191
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,940
I’m afraid that’s not good.

192
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,830
Lady Fair caught a cold.

193
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,070
I just wanted to go and see her.

194
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,330
But you’re making such a big mess and disturbing the Lady's recuperation,

195
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:51,760
you will be killed if His Majesty finds out.

196
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,150
There’s an assassin in the palace.

197
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,030
I have to make sure all the Ladies are safe.

198
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:00,060
If anything happens, we really can't bear the consequences.

199
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,610
Why are you hugging me like this?

200
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,040
I’m afraid you may faint if I don’t hold onto you.

201
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,430
I never thought I'd see you so obedient and nice in my life time,

202
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,780
being so weak like a girl.

203
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,550
This type of weak girl,

204
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,660
you have many of them in your harem.

205
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,160
Why do you think it's rare to have one?

206
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,530
But I only think you're rare.

207
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,600
Here. Get up.

208
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,200
What are you trying to do?

209
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,460
I’ll pass you some energy to reduce your pain.

210
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,400
Don’t.

211
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,470
Don't waste your energy.

212
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,220
It’s not worth it.

213
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,390
You're worth every best thing.

214
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,020
You’re treating me so nice.

215
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:25,010
Aren’t you afraid that I’ll stick to you, like Lady Precious, in the future?

216
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,850
I will be happy with it then.

217
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,490
But I have to remind you of one thing.

218
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,230
Do you know about the background of Lady Fair, the one you’re finding?

219
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,790
Lady Fair is the Prime Minister’s favorite goddaughter.

220
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,170
Official, you should be clear with it.

221
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,120
No doubt, being loyal to your duties is important.

222
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,130
I’m just afraid that—

223
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,940
I've received General Tang's help in the past.

224
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,900
Obviously, I’m not trying to hurt Lady Fair.

225
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,280
General Tang’s daughter was conferred Lady Precious.

226
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,930
Prime Minister’s goddaughter is Lady Fair.

227
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,370
But there will be only one queen.

228
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,850
If there’s anyone who didn’t understand, they might think that

229
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,670
you purposely placed Yuwen Zi into a difficult position because of Tang Zhirong.

230
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,450
What will the Prime Minister think if he hears about this?

231
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,960
Fine. If you’re still worried,

232
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,460
you can follow me to Lady Fair’s room and search.

233
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,690
This will clear your suspicion.

234
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,540
Thank you for your reminders, Lady.

235
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,870
We had finished searching through Intoxication Spreading House.

236
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,070
I’ll leave now.

237
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,880
Mister.

238
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,700
Both of you... Both of you are in the same group?

239
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,200
Don’t talk.

240
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,950
Rest well.

241
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,180
Why is she injured so badly?

242
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,450
Take good care of her.

243
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,630
Before I come back, she must stay alive.

244
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,080
Yes.

245
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,330
Where are you going?

246
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,620
I’ll go and help you to get the Earth Absorbing Bell back.

247
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:57,130
You just passed your energy to me. You’ll be in great danger if you go now.

248
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,050
I can endure this.

249
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:17,480
If there’s something I want in the territory of Five Regions, I will definitely get it.

250
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,570
You again.

251
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,350
You can fight after listening to me.

252
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,380
Why should I?

253
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,480
Because I know you’re First Princess, Megrez Empire’s Princess Virtue.

254
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,440
Who are you?

255
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,860
Did the Emperor of Megrez send you here to catch me?

256
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,300
Don’t worry.

257
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,730
I’m not here to catch you.

258
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,340
I just want to ask Senior to give me the Earth Absorbing Bell.

259
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,960
Why should I do as you wish?

260
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,310
Why should I accept your threats?

261
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:41,120
I’m telling you, the ones I hate the most for my whole life are Megrez's people.

262
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,160
What if I want to get it no matter what?

263
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,390
- Accept three punches from me.
- Okay.

264
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,860
You will definitely die if I punch you three times.

265
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,220
Whether I will die or not, that’s my matter.

266
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,390
If I accept your three punches, Senior will then give me Earth Absorbing Bell.

267
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:10,550
Are you doing this for that girl?

268
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,880
If I die, please pass the Earth Absorbing Bell to her, Senior.

269
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,530
Don't kill an innocent life.

270
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:24,070
It's a rare thing for you to be so sentimental and loyal.

271
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,910
If he was even half as sentimental and loyal as you back then,

272
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:39,530
I wouldn’t... I wouldn’t...

273
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,960
- Senior.
- I wouldn’t—

274
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,190
Do it now.

275
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,260
You took three punches from me and yet remain uninjured.

276
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,820
Thank you, Senior, for showing me grace.

277
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,530
Fine. Fine. Fine.

278
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,230
Why am I fighting with you juniors?

279
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,590
During this ten some years,

280
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,030
I've been practicing and cultivating in this limbo palace of Deep Water day and night.

281
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,530
I originally thought I had achieved great power.

282
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,560
I even thought to find you for revenge.

283
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,090
It's ridiculous.

284
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,700
I’ll give you this.

285
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,940
To me, it’s just useless steel.

286
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,380
Go ahead and leave.

287
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,430
Thank you very much, Senior.

288
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:14,210
Is he... okay?

289
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,920
He has 17 concubines now.

290
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,310
What do you think?

291
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:48,310
I just knew it. I just knew it.

292
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,590
Don’t worry.

293
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,960
Your Lord wouldn’t die so easily.

294
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,150
You're finally awake.

295
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,870
We got the bell back for you.

296
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,230
It's better to lie down, Lady Fair.

297
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,830
He? Where is he?

298
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,220
Mister returned to his palace after he dropped your bell off.

299
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,620
Is he okay?

300
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,940
What could happen to him?

301
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,810
How are you injured so badly?

302
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,800
There is such a master in the Five Regions.

303
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,360
It's the First Princess of Dense Beam Hall.

304
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,560
How is she so powerful?

305
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:02,070
Her own power isn't that powerful,

306
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:07,040
but her body is trapped under the Imprisonment Technique of the Firmament.

307
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,590
What hurt me was not her punches, but the Technique on her body.

308
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,110
What do you want to say?

309
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,640
Go ahead.

310
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:32,540
Mister has sacrificed much for Miss Fuyao.

311
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,290
I've never seen Mister like this before.

312
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,970
It's just—

313
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,420
It's just what?

314
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,830
Are you afraid that she'll ruin me?

315
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,270
Even you say that.

316
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:27,320
Then, I'll just let her leave.

317
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:29,370
Mister, you can't do that.

318
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:32,260
Miss Fuyao still can't leave the palace now.

319
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,050
You were the one who said she was in the way.

320
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,030
Now you are also the one who won't let her leave.

321
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,860
You tell me how I should act as your lord.

322
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,330
I've infringed you. Please forgive me, Mister.

323
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,870
- Haven't you infringed enough?
- Yes.

324
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,050
Even if I am infringing you, there are some things I must say.

325
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,170
Does Mister remember that

326
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,390
your father has repeatedly requested Mister to bring Earth Absorbing Bell back to Megrez.

327
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,700
Earlier, you clearly had Earth Absorbing Bell in your hands after receiving those three blows,

328
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,160
but you still want to leave this bell with Miss Fuyao.

329
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:17,650
I know you treat Miss Fuyao differently in Mister's heart.

330
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:23,140
Even if you let her leave, it's only because you don't want her to get involved in these dissensions.

331
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:28,040
But if Miss Fuyao left with the Earth Absorbing Bell,

332
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:33,370
then all your work in Deep Water will go to waste because of this situation.

333
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,420
Mister, please consider again.

334
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,030
You are the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

335
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,530
Only you can change the universe.

336
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,480
Find the girl with the Five-Colored Stone.

337
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,630
Or else, the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

338
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:59,890
Father isn't the only who asks me to be against Fuyao.

339
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,390
But Mister, you are a man with an engagement after all.

340
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,830
That's right.

341
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,960
That’s an engagement I asked by myself after all.

342
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,120
Please forgive me, Mister.

343
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,940
You are only telling the truth.

344
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,500
What's the crime?

345
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,590
Get up.

346
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,570
Thank you, Mister.

347
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,770
But Fuyao has nothing to do with all of these things.

348
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,960
It was I who insisted on dragging her in since the beginning.

349
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:47,530
Now let me send her away nicely.

350
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,240
Protecting her is my last resort.

351
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,040
Yes.

352
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,840
The sedative powder that Madam took should be losing its effect now.

353
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,950
She should be awake now.

354
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:20,310
With this kind of life, even if the city is ablaze with lights, what's the point?

355
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,880
Your Majesty.

356
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,690
I heard there were ghosts in the palace yesterday.

357
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,090
It has disturbed Your Majesty.

358
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:58,680
I heard that last night, a maidservant in the harem was scared by a rat.

359
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,280
It was a false alarm.

360
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,580
Didn't I already tell you?

361
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,210
In the future, before it's noon,

362
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,240
never wake me up and ask me to sign documents.

363
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,630
Your Majesty,

365
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,390
Lady Precious is awake.

366
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,010
Cao Cheng.

367
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,580
I'm here.

368
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,020
Relay this message.

369
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,850
Lady Precious is kind and well-mannered.

370
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,560
I like her very much.

371
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,020
Reward her three thousand rolls of brocade,

372
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,620
two hundred jade wares, one hundred gold bars.

373
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,370
I'm going to do it now.

374
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,600
Thank you for your rewards, Your Majesty.

375
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,080
Wow.

376
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,150
Why did you suddenly show up without making any sounds?

377
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,100
It's not that I didn't make a sound.

378
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,540
It's that you were preoccupied.

379
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,590
What's wrong? Are you waiting for someone?

380
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,720
It's such a big palace.

381
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,200
Who would I be waiting for?

382
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,530
I plan to go back after feeding the fish.

383
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,050
Really? Is that so?

384
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,900
Older Sister, go back with me then.

385
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,820
Okay.

386
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,050
Come.

387
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,610
- Your Majesty.
- Yes?

388
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

389
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,760
Isn't that the girl from the Prime Minister's home?

390
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,940
Your Majesty has a good memory.

391
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,840
I'm Yuwen Zi from Changning Manor.

392
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,970
Yuwen Zi?

393
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:25,340
Your Majesty, Older Sister Yuwen is conferred Lady Fair by you personally.

394
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,080
How could you have forgotten this?

395
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,320
No wonder.

396
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,770
I find her familiar.

397
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,780
With Younger Sister Zhirong always at your service,

398
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,370
naturally, you would forget me.

399
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,410
This—

400
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,440
Come.

401
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:57,150
I say, My Lady Fair, whoever I want to get close to

402
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,320
and whoever I don't want to get close to, it's not up to you to say.

403
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,730
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

404
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,510
Older Sister Yuwen is not good at talking.

405
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,020
She didn't mean that.

406
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,130
I remember that I rewarded you to live in the Intoxication Spreading House.

407
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:19,550
Yes, Your Majesty.

408
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,970
Didn't you always say that you lived too far away from me?

409
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,200
Intoxication Spreading House is the nearest to my place.

410
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,270
Relay this. Hand over Intoxication Spreading House to Lady Precious.

411
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:38,970
Let the inner palace arrange you both a different place to live.

412
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,690
Your Majesty, is this a good idea?

413
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,840
I accept your decree.

414
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,810
He is too much.

415
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:54,560
Although Yuwen Zi is a concubine's daughter from the Changning manor,

416
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,410
who in Capital Kun doesn't know that I took her in as my goddaughter and personally sent her to the palace?

417
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:07,720
How does Xuanyuan Min dare to use Tang Zhirong to pressure my goddaughter?

418
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,160
Isn't he slapping my face then?

419
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,340
Lady Precious is General Tang's daughter.

420
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:18,040
What His Majesty is eyeing is the military power over the 150,000 soldiers in Tang's hand.

421
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,760
But what's fortunate is that General Tang has always been loyal and devoted to you.

422
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,240
Loyal and devoted?

423
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,890
How would there be absolute loyalty?

424
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:29,360
There would only be everlasting benefits.

425
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:36,040
To add further, for the position of Deep Water's Queen,

426
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,500
no matter how loyal she is, she'll be tempted, too.

427
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,500
Don't be too disheartened.

428
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,160
Mister has his difficulties.

429
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,780
That Mister of yours has never followed the routine.

430
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,860
I can't be bothered with him.

431
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,580
That’s great then,

432
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:08,540
but Mister seems to really like that Tang Zhirong this time.

433
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,010
Whoever I want to get close to or whoever I don't want to get close to,

434
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,310
it's not up to you to say.

435
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,710
Is that so?

436
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,380
Does he like this gentle and weak kind of girl?

437
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,220
If not, then?

438
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,530
It can't be that you think the one Mister likes is you, right?

439
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,210
You don't need to beat around the bush.

440
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:01,290
If you have anything to ask, just ask.

441
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:05,260
I'm going to ask then.

442
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:09,040
How do you feel about our Mister?

443
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,510
I...

444
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:26,130
I don't know what his real identity is.

445
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,870
I think it has nothing to do with me, too.

446
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:32,030
I don’t want to have any connection with him,

447
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:35,990
because I think that your Mister is concealing a lot of things.

448
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,250
He has too many secrets.

449
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,110
But God likes to play this kind of prank.

450
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,930
Ever since I met him,

451
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,370
it seems that everything is related to him and

452
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,920
has a connection with him.

453
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,770
Slowly, I’m used to his existence.

454
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,440
I'm used to having him and also used to...

455
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,300
used to naturally thinking of him.

456
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,760
Then that's love.

♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

484
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,790
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

485
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,930
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

486
00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:27,220
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

487
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,570
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

488
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:37,720
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
