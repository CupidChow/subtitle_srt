♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,230
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,870
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,060
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,070
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,820
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,330
~ Episode 34 ~

22
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,100
The power of good and evil has always been mutually waxing and waning.

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,630
Now that there are abnormalities on all nations,

24
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,990
this kind of evil power must be not be your average kind.

25
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,730
I fear that we need all nations to unite to fight it.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,800
Empress, the immortal elixir for today has been made.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,910
I am not feeling very well today.

28
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,150
Just put it down first.

29
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,730
Empress has weak health.

30
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,000
His Majesty said that you must take this on time.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,870
May Empress not make things difficult for me.

32
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,200
It must be this medicine is too bitter.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,500
Empress Mother doesn't like to take it.

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,140
- Just put it aside first.
- But—

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,720
If anything happens, I will bear it.

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,920
Leave.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,450
Ji'er, your Emperor Father also has good intentions.

38
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,640
I'll just take it.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,540
Go now.

40
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,100
From now on, your life and death, your everything,

41
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:57,980
have nothing to do with Megrez.

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,590
Today, if there is no other matter,

43
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,920
let's disperse.

44
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,140
Your Highness Crown Prince.

45
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,420
Princess has been working for several days. You must be tired.

46
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,820
Go back earlier to rest.

47
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,730
I... have a small request.

48
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,440
Don't know if Your Highness will be willing to do me this favor.

49
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,890
The Megrez Imperial City is a place of sacred spirits.

50
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,010
I came here in a rush and wasn't able to go around.

51
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,160
Crown Prince Wuji knows this place the best.

52
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,850
Can you tour me around?

53
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,070
I've ordered my people that as long as you want to,

54
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,860
my people can accompany you to tour around anytime.

55
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,860
But... I just want that person...

56
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,050
that person to be you.

57
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,850
Princess, please conduct yourself with dignity.

58
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,410
How dare you pretend to be the princess of Plough?

59
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,250
Capture her!

60
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,370
Your Highness!

61
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,050
What is it, Jian Xue?

62
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,370
The person that Prince Assist said to be disguising as Folian is Fuyao!

63
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
You and Folian had colluded beforehand to harm me, am I right?

64
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,600
Stop with your nonsense.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,110
Hand me the Purple Phoenix badge.

66
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,750
I then grant you a full corpse!

67
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,000
You better check first if you've tied your belt well.

68
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,160
Emperor Father, this is all my fault.

69
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,780
I didn't consider thoroughly and delayed fetching Folian into the palace.

70
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,500
Fuyao didn't know about my identity.

71
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,800
She won't pretend to be someone just for this immaterial status, either.

72
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,630
Emperor Father, you are the Holiness of Five Regions.

73
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,460
You surely will not be unjust to an ignorant citizen.

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,390
Emperor Father, since I was little,

75
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,960
I have never asked you for anything.

76
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,290
But today... please be merciful and let her go.

77
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,130
If you want to punish anyone, I will bear them all.

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've already let her go.

79
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,640
But whether she can survive or not

80
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,760
will depend on her own fate.

81
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,470
- Mister.
- Fuyao is in trouble.

82
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,930
Immediately send out all secret guards to look for her.

83
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,330
Yes.

84
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,700
I already said everything that must be said.

85
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,860
If Your Highness can help me fulfill this matter,

86
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,950
and you're able to have your wish to become the Crown Prince of Megrez,

87
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:14,810
then the person I'm marrying will automatically be you.

88
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,730
It's a deal then.

89
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,670
Your Highness Prince Assist did everything to help me.

90
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,420
I will surely remember this favor.

91
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,740
For you, I will be there at your beck and call.

92
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,460
Even the person that you don't like,

93
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,630
I already eliminated her.

94
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,690
Shouldn't you do something for me?

95
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,790
That person is highly skilled in martial arts.

96
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,130
She knows unique skills.

97
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,720
Prince Assist, you also suffered in her hands.

98
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,520
You must know that just with your ability,

99
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,020
it's impossible to capture her.

100
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,610
If not because I made preparations beforehand

101
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,590
and asked Qiaoling to follow her all the time,

102
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:52,440
doing some tricks on her food,

103
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,000
it would have been questionable if Your Highness can still be standing here right now.

104
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,120
Fine.

105
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,640
Since Princess has this good foresight,

106
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,870
then I'm sure it is very easy for you to get Wuji, too.

107
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,940
You!

108
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,810
Princess, don't be angry.

109
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,990
I just feel sorry for you.

110
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,720
Since that Wuji is unwilling to marry you,

111
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,200
why still be nice with him?

112
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,730
Moreover, he's not the only royal descendant of the Megrez.

113
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,150
If you marry me,

114
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,980
I will surely not disappoint you.

115
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,610
Your Highness, you must have forgotten what I promised last night.

116
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,050
If you became the Crown Prince,

117
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,080
I will naturally not hesitate to marry you.

118
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,070
You just have to be that Crown Princess Consort?

119
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,550
Yes!

120
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,640
Since when I was little,

121
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:18,420
I was the most intelligent, most beautiful, and Queen Mother's most favorite daughter among my sisters.

122
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,100
But I...

123
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,380
just have to be a Second Queen Heir.

124
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,860
Just because I was born a year later than Feng Jingzhi,

125
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,640
the queen throne of Plough can't be mine.

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,420
All my life, I have never lost.

127
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:58,220
But only in this thing, no matter what I do,

128
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,270
no matter how I strive,

129
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,370
I will never win.

130
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,930
What can I do? Either...

131
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,130
I quietly be Plough's Second Queen Heir,

132
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,930
or... I become the most respected woman in the whole Five Regions.

133
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,890
Even the Queen of Plough must look up to me.

134
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:34,510
I want to become the Empress of Megrez!

135
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,740
I agreed before to collude with you

136
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,490
because you told me...

137
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,500
that you will become the Crown Prince.

138
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,140
Even if I love Wuji very much,

139
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,530
just to be this empress,

140
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,350
I can also sacrifice him.

141
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,650
But presently, Your Highness still hasn't become the Crown Prince.

142
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:16,180
Hence, the words which I said don't count.

143
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,650
What if I'm able to obtain the Crown Prince position?

144
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,420
If you're able to get it,

145
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,370
I'll be your woman then.

146

[Good Fortune and Peace Flourish Forever]

147
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,350
Mister!

148
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,540
How was it? Is there any news?

149
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,360
Someone captured Qiaoling, the maidservant by Folian's side.

150
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,520
After torturing and intense interrogation, she confessed that Fuyao was taken away by Prince Assist.

151
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,550
What other information were you able to get?

152
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,260
She also said that she poisoned Fuyao earlier. I fear that right now—

153
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,220
Mister, you must not! Mister, I know that you worry about Miss Fuyao.

154
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,130
It's just that Prince Assist has always been opposing you.

155
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,130
If you rashly go to Prince Assist's Manor now to get her,

156
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:26,620
I fear that you will incite a conflict between the royal siblings.

157
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,430
Royal siblings?

158
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,820
I kept giving way because I considered that we were royal siblings.

159
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,970
What underhanded matters has he done that I didn't know about?

160
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,310
But he dared to touch Fuyao today,

161
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,200
not talking about his reputation,

162
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,430
I won't even give him any last lining.

163
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,460
Although the Plough Nation has mountains of gold and silver, they don't produce jade stones.

164
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,790
I'm afraid you can't find another top-grade jade bracelet like this in the whole Five Regions.

165
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,480
Immediately send someone to deliver this to the official residence of Princess Folian.

166
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,140
Yes.

167
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,570
Aren't you going to hurry and leave?

168
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,070
Your Highness, I heard that Crown Prince has been searching the whole city for that fake Folian.

169
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,920
It has caused such an uproar.

170
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,760
Looks like Crown Prince cares a lot about this fake Folian.

171
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,770
Good.

172
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,330
I will surely not make the people that Wuji cares about have an easy time.

173
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,830
You were clearly trapped by my Soul-Locking Needle.

174
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,930
This is impossible. You were clearly trapped by my Soul-Locking Needle.

175
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,420
You're also heavily injured.

176
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,590
Impossible... Definitely impossible.

177
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,980
Impossible...

178
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,930
[Prince Assist's Manor]

179
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,330
Move aside!

180
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,210
Your Highness Crown Prince, without an imperial decree, you can't trespass into the Prince Assist's Manor.

181
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,750
If you insist on going in,

182
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,520
this... is breaking the law of Megrez royal clan. This—

183
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,030
Your Highness Crown Prince, if you continue to move forward, based on the rules of Megrez,

184
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:23,160
they... must block your path.

185
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,920
If you get hurt, I'll get killed.

186
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,080
Letting you in, I will also get killed.

187
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,520
Your Highness Crown Prince!

188
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,300
No!

189
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,950
Kill her!

190
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,000
Girl!

191
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,100
You're here.

192
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm here.

193
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,900
Girl...

194
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,400
Killing you will not be enough to dispel the hatred in my heart.

195
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,800
But letting you live... even for a moment,

196
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,000
I can't allow it!

197
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,100
Crown Prince, you must not kill the First Royal Son!

198
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
Move aside!

199
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,800
- Mister, calm down. Mister.
- Move away!

200
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Mister!

201
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,400
Verbal decree of the Lord Emperor,

202
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
His Highness Prince Assist...

203
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
- Mister, calm down!
- is asked to enter the palace for an audience.

204
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
- Hurry up. Hurry.
- Yes.

205
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,100
Hurry. Hurry.

206
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Mister!

207
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,500
Calm down!

208
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Emperor Father...

209
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Emperor Father, save me. Emperor Father, save me.

210
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Wuji... Wuji wants to kill me.

211
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Emperor Father!

212
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
If Wuji really did take the action,

213
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
the one being carried inside here would have been your corpse.

214
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,300
Emperor Father!

215
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,600
Do you know what you lack?

216
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,000
You want to be the Crown Prince.

217
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
That's not a bad thing,

218
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,800
but you are just not smart enough.

219
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,400
Wuji went to Firmament to train for ten years.

220
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,500
You thought you now have the chance and took great pains to win people's hearts.

221
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:20,200
But in the end, you lost in the hands of that fake Folian.

222
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Do you know what the royal clan puts importance on the most?

223
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,030
Reputation!

224
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,600
If this matter spreads across the world, spreads into our ancestral chamber,

225
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,100
First Royal Son,

226
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,300
how do you plan to continue living?

227
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,590
Emperor Father, you surely have a way. Right?

228
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,000
You surely have a way.

229
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,500
Just reluctantly continue living then.

230
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
After all, you're my son.

231
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,800
Emperor Father!

232
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,600
You must give me justice! You must give me justice!

233
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,000
Emperor Father!

234
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,300
She's out of danger for now.

235
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,970
Girl! Everything's fine.

236
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,400
I'm here.

237
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,800
Girl!

238
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Wuji, come out with me for a while.

239
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,060
How did she get injured so severely like that?

240
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,700
Zhangsun Pingrong was once a disciple of Starlight, one of the ten saints.

241
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,600
He learned some abilities, but I didn't give it much care.

242
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Unexpectedly, that he successfully learned this Divine Physician Starlight.

243
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,800
I was too careless.

244
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,890
This kind of martial arts has a unique poison.

245
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,000
Plus, the fact that Fuyao already had some poisons in her body.

246
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,900
For so many poisons combining inside one's body, usual people would have died.

247
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,800
Now, on the one hand, the seal poison in her body is gobbling up the other poisons.

248
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,900
On the other hand, the seal poison itself is getting stronger.

249
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,400
If we drag this any longer,

250
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I fear that—

251
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,010
You fear what?

252
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
What are you fearing? Say it!

253
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,900
I fear that...

254
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,800
I fear that her life will be in danger.

255
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,220
You surely have a way to cure it.

256
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,000
You surely have a way to cure it, right?

257
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,000
Young Lord, His Majesty left his meditation chamber earlier and went to man the Imperial court.

258
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,100
He also made a decree asking that you immediately enter the palace.

259
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
I've led my men to investigate it.

260
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,400
The person who harmed Prince Assist was indeed the person who disguised as Princess Folian.

261
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,080
Such a mistake happened because we were unable to provide thorough protection.

262
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,100
May Your Majesty forgive us.

263
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,200
Pretending to be the Queen Heir of Plough,

264
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,300
hurting the royal descendant of the Zhangsun royal clan,

265
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,000
this person... must die.

266
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
Informing Your Majesty,

267
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,400
I heard that Crown Prince has taken the female criminal away.

268
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I fear that this might taint the mighty reputation of the royal family.

269
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,100
I don't know what connection the Crown Prince has with this matter.

270
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,400
Official Duan, what do you mean by that?

271
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Are you suspecting Crown Prince of conniving with that female criminal

272
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,000
and planning to assassinate his own older brother?

273
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
General Lei, why get agitated?

274
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,400
I just said that the female criminal was taken away by Crown Prince.

275
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,800
Of course, there are matters in between that must be investigated and verified.

276
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,200
Since Prince Assist is hurt, we then must strictly punish the perpetrator.

277
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,000
We must not let the female criminal escape.

278
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,600
Arrest the female criminal and execute her first.

279
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,200
For the rest, let's just talk about it next time.

280
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,500
Your Majesty, this person is currently in Crown Prince's Upper Yang Palace.

281
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,110
What happened?

282
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:16,700
Do you not dare to go there?

283
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Emperor Father.

284
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,200
Your Highness Crown Prince, the female criminal who disguised as Princess Folian today has committed a grave crime.

285
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,000
I was ordered to arrest her and bring her to justice.

286
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,300
I heard that it was Crown Prince who took her away.

287
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,400
Fuyao is indeed in my manor.

288
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,500
But to arrest her or not, may Emperor Father wait a little while before making the decision.

289
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,200
I want to ask Emperor Father to have a private chat with me.

290
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,150
Get up.

291
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,850
Thank you, Emperor Father.

292
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,500
You must know about the matter of Prince Assist getting hurt.

293
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,800
There should be a lot of methods to resolve this.

294
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:30,600
But there is only one method that can end everything at once,

295
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,600
that is to execute this woman.

296
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
This way...

297
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,460
the truth will never be known.

298
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,800
To put it in another way, who will still care about the truth?

299
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,020
I know...

300
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,200
that the Megrez royal family must not have any scandal.

301
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
I also know that Emperor Father's heart is being sliced into pieces for learning that Prince Assist is hurt.

302
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,400
I also know very well that this matter has incited unrest and we must placate the hearts of the people.

303
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,600
Emperor Father can opt to not punish the perpetrator,

304
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,700
but you must not falsely accuse an innocent woman.

305
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,800
Innocent?

306
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,600
She was never innocent.

307
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,800
An ordinary woman from the normal class citizens

308
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,300
bewitched the Crown Prince of my Megrez Empire.

309
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Isn't that her crime?

310
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,800
Starting from the day that you liked her,

311
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
she already had committed a crime.

312
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,400
And the more you try to exonerate her now,

313
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,200
the heavier her crime becomes.

314
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Wuji...

315
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,800
Since you were little,

316
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,400
I've started to teach you

317
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:51,900
that an emperor must not have any weakness.

318
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,000
I've taught you military tactics

319
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,200
and the art of strategy, but I overlooked...

320
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,300
that there is love.

321
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,400
How many emperors, kings, generals, high ministers,

322
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,700
heroes, and warriors, all fell because of love?

323
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Fine.

324
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:20,000
Today, I'll get rid of this love for you.

325
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,600
You can hate or bear grudge against me.

326
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:34,200
Maybe, you'll eventually understand my painstaking efforts today.

327
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,400
This is for the million years of foundation of the Five Regions.

328
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,600
Emperor Father, you must not!

329
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,800
It's too late.

330
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,500
Stop right there!

331
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,300
If you go out these doors, you will regret it.

332
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,900
Emperor Father, forgive me.

333
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,200
- Crown Prince, please go back.
- Crown Prince, please go back.

334
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,820
I'm going to save someone right now.

335
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,000
Don't any of you stop me.

336
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,600
One person that blocks me, he becomes my enemy.

337
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,600
If a thousand men will block me, they will all become my enemies!

338
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,500
Your Majesty, the Crown Prince... the Crown Prince, he—

339
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,000
Crown Prince was able to break the guard's defense and will be leaving the palace soon.

340
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,520
[Upper Yang Palace]

341
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,700
- Crown Prince?
- How is Fuyao now?

342
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,600
She's not going to last long. Quickly take a look at her.

343
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,400
What do we do, Crown Prince?

344
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,200
Let's not waste time. Let's hurry and leave.

345
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,000
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

346
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

347
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

348
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,900
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

349
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,000
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

350
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,200
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

351
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,600
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

352
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,000
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

353
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,800
The matter today has created a lot of noise.

354
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
And now, I'm hastily leaving the city. Emperor Father will surely not tolerate it.

355
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,100
If there are any situations, you must immediately tell me.

356
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,000
Yes, Mister.

357
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,220
You also need to pay extra attention to Prince Assist and Folian.

358
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,300
I fear that they might cause trouble.

359
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:58,400
Once I'm gone, you will be working more.

360
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,700
Mister, no need to worry about me.

361
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,640
It's just that the journey this time is quite far.

362
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,000
You must take good care of yourself.

363
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,680
Miss Fuyao is a blessed person.

364
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,800
She will surely have her misfortune turn to blessing.

365
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,700
Go now.

366
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,800
I always thought that...

367
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,500
if I beg Emperor Father regarding Fuyao, he would surely spare her.

368
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,800
I never thought—

369
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,200
You belittled your Emperor Father.

370
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,300
No.

371
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,000
I placed too much importance on myself and that almost killed her.

372
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Don't blame yourself too much.

373
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,600
Fuyao's body has numerous strange poisons restraining each other to begin with.

374
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,120
They have long endangered her life.

375
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,800
Presently, the Starlight Passion Lockup Toxin of Zhangsun Pingrong came so fiercely.

376
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,800
That's why, she ended up unconscious.

377
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,570
I hope that we can successfully find the bugleweed on this trip to South Border

378
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,900
and rid Fuyao of the Passion Lockup Toxin.

379
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,360
Don't worry.

380
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,330
You have me.

381
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,100
