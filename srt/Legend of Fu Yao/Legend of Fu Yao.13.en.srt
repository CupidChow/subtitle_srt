00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,440
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,520
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,690
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,040
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,980
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,590
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,970
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,850
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,880
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,970
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,660
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,390
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,540
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,850
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,340
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 13 ~

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:42,170
Open the door!

23
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,870
Open the door!

24
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,940
- Open the door!
- Let us out!

25
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,420
Kill all of them with no exception. Release.

26
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,400
Prefecture Princess, bad news.

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,990
They have reinforcements.

28
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,970
They're just some commoners throwing their lives away.

29
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,110
- Send people to trap them. Don't ruin my big plan.
- Yes.

30
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,530
Go! Hurry and go!

31
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,920
If you have anything, just make it only between us.

32
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,750
Why are you killing the innocent?

33
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,280
I just like killing the innocent.

34
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,650
What can you do about me?

35
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,130
You can take my life right now.

36
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,620
They're nothing but lowly things.

37
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,960
What's the difference if they die early or die later?

38
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,340
But for you, dying won't be so easy.

39
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,400
How would I let you die that easily?

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,050
I will carve your face stroke by stroke,

41
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,200
and let you see your blood run dry drop by drop.

42
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,510
Listening to your begging. Watching you struggle.

43
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,560
How satisfying.

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,080
- Shameless.
- Go.

45
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,050
- You—
- How dare you.

46
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,070
Do you know what the outcome will be for harming the Prefecture Princess?

47
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,160
You—

48
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,560
Why did you think you could contend with the Prefecture Princess?

49
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,650
Have you ever thought about what status you have?

50
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,600
Can status determine everything?

51
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,040
Could it be that you're like the slaves here who think that by killing a noble,

52
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,900
you could have your day?

53
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,450
I just want to save my younger brother.

54
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,750
He's just a lowly slave.

55
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,750
So is this how you have always seen us?

56
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,180
Slaves are always slaves.

57
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,080
Whether at the Mystic Black Section or here, it is all the same.

58
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,790
Once I become King, there will only be more slaves not less.

59
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,040
This is the law.

60
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,780
So you were this kind of person.

61
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,410
Just take it as I've misjudged you before.

62
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,650
Take this slut down now!

63
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,710
Prefecture Princess, wait.

64
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,560
What does Heir Apparent mean by this?

65
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:45,230
Prefecture Princess, this girl goes against her superiors and should be punished by death.

66
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,700
Right.

67
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,310
Besides, the personal grudge I have with her must also be resolved today.

68
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,580
It's just so happened that

69
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,210
she and I also have a personal grudge.

70
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,270
Then it works out. Take her away.

71
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,660
Prefecture Princess, please hold.

72
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,910
What else, Heir Apparent?

73
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:14,860
Prefecture Princess, this girl had gone against her superiors in Mt. Mystic Soul many times.

74
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,760
Now she has also hurt me.

75
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,880
You tell me, how should I sentence her?

76
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,570
If Heir Apparent trusts me, then let me take care of it.

77
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,420
How could I dare to trouble you, Prefecture Princess?

78
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,840
I am like you, Prefecture Princess.

79
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,080
I must take revenge myself on my own grudges.

80
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,170
But this slut is naturally naughty and mischievous.

81
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,190
Wouldn't it make your hands dirty if you punish her yourself?

82
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:42,690
It is exactly her strong temperament that makes punishing her interesting.

83
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,110
Besides, I just saved you.

84
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,330
You should honor me, right?

85
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,050
Jiang Feng!

86
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,480
Heir Apparent.

87
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,260
Prefecture Princess, I'll take my leave.

88
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,590
Let's go.

89
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:21,290
Prefecture Princess, the others have escaped, too.

90
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,220
Useless thing. Why are you guys still standing here?

91
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,510
Hurry and chase after them!

92
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,770
Yes!

93
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,900
Stop following.

94
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,720
I'll leave her in your hands.

95
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,310
Fuyao.

96
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,080
Who are you after all?

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,610
That is not important.

98
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,380
What is important is that her staying with me is not safe right now.

99
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,510
I'll leave her to you, Prince Fierce.

100
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,670
I heard this morning that the whole Prime Minister’s garrison set off.

101
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,590
Such a big action.

102
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,880
The garrison protects the homes and the country.

103
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,460
The Slavefighting Ring is the royal family’s business.

104
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,190
It’s a must to protect it with the garrison.

105
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,740
But why did I hear that the garrison was not dispatched by Prime Minister personally?

106
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,660
These two hundreds soldiers were used just for you kids’ personal relationship.

107
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,260
Marquis Zhang is always good at distinguishing right or wrong.

108
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,620
Now, have you even learned to make groundless accusations?

109
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,610
The soldiers in the garrison are all carefully selected by Prime Minister.

110
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,540
When facing the unarmed slaves,

111
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,800
why did they become so weak and timid?

112
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:28,270
I heard that around 60 to 70 percent of slaves escaped from the slave market.

113
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,360
Do you think there’s someone creating difficulties

114
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,790
and secretly selling them later?

115
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,540
That will be a big business.

116
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,190
Marquis Zhang cares about it too much.

117
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,940
I believe the truth will be revealed very quickly.

118
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:52,260
By then, we will know who’s spreading rumors and making false accusations.

119
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,540
Prime Minister, don’t worry.

120
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,350
I will definitely work hard and investigate this case

121
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,220
to prove that Prime Minister is innocent.

122
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,150
Conforming to the Heaven’s way!

123
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,350
Presenting Xuanyuan’s royal bloodline!

124
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,290
Prince Xinnan’s son, Xuanyuan Hu,

125
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,630
as Deep Water Nation’s Heir Apparent.

126
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,830
He will take over the throne and be responsible for manipulating the water.

127
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,820
His Highness Heir Apparent is here!

128
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,980
May Heaven bless Deep Water. Heir Apparent will inherit!

129
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,030
Kneel down!

130
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,370
Bow!

131
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,700
Get up!

132
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,890
Bow again!

133
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
Get up!

134
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,900
Bow one more!

135
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,690
Done!

136
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,140
Mister once taught me to recognize celestial phenomena.

137
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,550
Do you remember one called Purple Forbidden Enclosure?

138
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,800
Does Heir Apparent know what Purple Forbidden Enclosure means?

139
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,300
Of course, I do.

140
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,140
Purple Forbidden Enclosure is not included in the zodiac and not listed among the Five Classical Planets.

141
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,890
That’s why it’s called the Planet of King.

142
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,350
I’m sure it is here to protect the prosperity of the royal clan of Deep Water.

143
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,940
Based on what Prime Minister sees, do you think what Heir Apparent said was right?

144
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,980
Heir Apparent has a facile imagination.

145
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:55,860
His being clever at a young age is indeed a blessing of Deep Water.

146
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,380
There will be a debut ceremony in the future.

147
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,610
It'll require everyone's support.

148
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,940
I hope that you will work in unity to manage it together.

149
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,360
We must maintain the glory of our Deep Water.

150
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,000
We are willing to be at Heir Apparent's call.

151
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,870
Praying ceremony for the new Heir Apparent ends now.

152
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,020
Safe journey, Heir Apparent.

153
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,410
Marquis Zhang, nice job.

154
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,360
You quietly protected the royal bloodline of Deep Water.

155
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,620
Respect. Respect.

156
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,780
I don’t deserve that.

157
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,020
Prime Minister is overpraising.

158
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,340
Marquis Zhang, nice job!

159
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,030
Fuyao, you’re awake.

160
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,590
Where is here?

161
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,800
Fifth Older Brother is staying here temporarily after the Official Post was burned down yesterday.

162
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,270
You haven’t eaten for a day.

163
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,330
Eat something first.

164
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,990
I’ll feed her.

165
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm not that weak.

166
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,470
I'll do it myself.

167
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,420
Be careful.

168
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,770
Fuyao, what’s happening to you?

169
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,230
I think I overestimated myself.

170
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,220
Just be at ease and let me take care of you.

171
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,120
How can you not be in pain?

172
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,070
You fought against thousands of soldiers and horses alone.

173
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,190
I assume even a piece of steel would be broken down,

174
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,980
not to mention your flesh.

175
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,020
Both of you were there when I was fighting?

176
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,760
After the Official Post caught fire last night,

177
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,490
we were hunted by some people all of a sudden.

178
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,060
We managed to escape.

179
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,600
We heard that soldiers from the garrison wanted to catch you.

180
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,040
Then we rushed to the slave market.

181
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,490
But we couldn't fight our way in at that time.

182
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,430
Fuyao, sorry.

183
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,950
If we could have arrived earlier,

184
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,390
you wouldn’t have been injured badly.

185
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,010
Stupid, am I okay now?

186
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,590
But, Fuyao, you were really very brave at that time.

187
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,470
So many soldiers were surrounding you,

188
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,210
you didn’t fluster at all.

189
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,780
Fifth Older Brother, am I right?

190
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,860
Your performance yesterday makes even us men feel humbled.

191
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,950
Are you looking differently at women now?

192
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,370
I can guarantee you that you are the coolest woman he has ever seen.

193
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,380
You talk less.

194
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,960
Let Fuyao rest more.

195
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,250
It’s okay.

196
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,230
I'm quite bored anyway.

197
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,690
It’s good if she’s here with me.

198
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,700
Boo!

199
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,890
By the way who was the person that you stabbed yesterday?

200
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,730
He’s a superior but self-centered bastard.

201
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,260
Really?

202
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,370
But I don’t think he looks like a bad guy.

203
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,170
If he hadn’t been there, I think you would have been taken away.

204
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,750
Maybe the three of us would have been taken away by the soldiers.

205
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,520
What are you talking about?

206
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,260
Fifth Older Brother was also there.

207
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,110
Am I right?

208
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,920
By the way, don’t worry about the matter of Earth Absorbing Bell.

209
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Rest well.

210
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,700
What do you mean?

211
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,040
The child with you was not the one who stole the Earth Absorbing Bell to start with.

212
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,240
I’m just afraid that he saw something he shouldn’t that night and was taken away by the others.

213
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,350
It turns out that you've known this since a long time ago.

214
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,740
Then why did you keep on restricting me?

215
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,220
I restricted you because I was afraid you would alarm them with your actions.

216
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,820
- You’re using me, aren't you?
- Yes.

217
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,230
I was wrong.

218
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,060
At the time, the matter was very important.

219
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,920
Before investigating everything clearly, Fifth Older Brother could only do this.

220
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,370
Fuyao, don’t be angry.

221
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,380
How could I have the mind to be angry at him?

222
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,170
Right now, I can only think of Xiaoqi.

223
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,350
My heart is restless without finding Xiaoqi.

224
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,500
Rest well.

225
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,360
Don’t think too much.

226
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,300
If you trust me, I can help you.

227
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,140
You should just find your Earth Absorbing Bell.

228
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,720
You don't have to worry about what happened to Xiaoqi.

229
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,340
Capital Kun is so big.

230
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,300
Finding a person by yourself alone isn’t easy. Think wisely.

231
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,330
I've thought it through.

232
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,120
I didn't dare to say this before, but after the incident last night,

233
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,060
I'm sure that I definitely can find Xiaoqi.

234
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,330
Is it still painful?

235
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,930
After being treated with your medicine today, I feel a lot better.

236
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,020
If I knew you would recover so quickly, I wouldn't have wasted such good medicine on you.

237
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,390
Mister, I just don't understand. Why did you do this?

238
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,140
You complain so much!

239
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,390
Softer!

240
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,240
So you do know pain.

241
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,680
Don't you think your master is quite strange?

242
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,150
Obviously, he's so skilled at martial arts; yet, still insisting on being stabbed,

243
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,610
and even bled and got an infection.

244
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,020
You tell me. Is it because your protection is lacking?

245
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,190
Mister, you are truly blaming me unjustly.

246
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,200
It's always Master ordering me to not take action unless he commands me to.

247
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,910
Otherwise, how could I let him be injured?

248
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,440
That's also true!

249
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,930
If he wanted to dodge, there would be no one who could hurt him.

250
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,760
In my view, this is a fever of the mind that resulted from love.

251
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,060
I think so, too.

252
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,320
What Mister said is correct.

253
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,090
You have to be careful from now on.

254
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,980
Be careful to become a sieve because of his poking.

255
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,330
Are you guys done?

256
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,030
Clothes!

257
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,040
So are you not even going to help me dress now?

258
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,430
Yes.

259
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,860
[Garrison]

260
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,800
Who allowed you to dispatch my garrison?

261
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,860
Currently, it's a troubled time of Deep Water.

262
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,020
How many eyes are watching me in the whole imperial court?

263
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,240
You have actually dispatched the soldiers and horses on your own.

264
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,650
You created such big trouble.

265
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,430
If it was something else, I wouldn’t take such a big action.

266
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,670
But what Yue’er wants to find is that slut who ruined my face.

267
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,500
Even if I need to dig the ground down one meter, I must find her.

268
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,430
It’s just a useless skin!

269
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,630
The wealth you wanted, the man you wanted to marry,

270
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,020
what are you lacking?

271
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:20,160
Everyone in the imperial court was making comments today.

272
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,790
How many people will impeach me tomorrow?

273
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,040
Have you ever thought of this?

274
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,930
Let alone all these things.

275
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,820
There’re hundreds of people in the garrison

276
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,160
whom I raised as henchmen personally.

277
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,900
With the trouble you've caused, the control of the garrison will soon be someone else's.

278
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,950
You are really harming me.

279
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,820
Uncle, please calm down.

280
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,260
I’m warning you. If you still can’t control yourself,

281
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,100
I’ll punish you as well.

282
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,130
Get out!

283
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,950
Mr. Yun, Master is really angry inside the room.

284
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,780
You have to go and urge him. Okay?

285
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,950
Mr. Yun.

286
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,760
Mr. Yun, please go and urge him.

287
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:31,010
Godfather, why are you so angry?

288
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,570
The chaos in the slave market has affected the Prime Minister’s Manor.

289
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,770
Don’t you know?

290
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,190
Godfather, your position is high with authority.

291
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,840
Having so many eyes looking at you is something you cannot avoid.

292
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,610
A troubled time.

293
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,300
Godfather, please calm down.

294
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,210
I heard from the garrison’s soldiers that Heir Apparent appeared there, too.

295
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,520
Heir Apparent?

296
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,710
Xuanyuan Min.

297
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,930
He’s in Capital Kun?! Where is he?

298
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:03,540
They said he left with a slave.

299
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,480
The garrison’s soldiers didn’t catch up with him.

300
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,060
A group of stupid men.

301
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,150
- Quickly bring people to investigate if there’s any conspiracy behind this.
- Yes.

302
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,830
What is the situation of Zhan Beiye?

303
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,650
No one’s alive among the assasins we sent yesterday.

304
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,190
The whole Official Post has burned down.

305
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,180
How is Zhan Beiye?

306
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,330
Not injured at all.

307
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,260
Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend is indeed not a commoner.

308
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,390
Don’t underestimate him.

309
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,980
Did he say anything?

310
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,820
Prince Fierce only asked people to inform us that the Official Post caught fire.

311
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,270
A few of his men died in the fire,

312
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:51,200
but he didn’t mention anything else.

313
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,100
I heard he’s staying in an inn for now

314
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,830
and only waiting for Prime Minister’s instructions.

315
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
Be careful.

316
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,040
I’m okay.

317
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,400
I'll show you some moves if you don’t trust me.

318
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,560
Wait, please don't.

319
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,500
If you hurt yourself again, the one looking after you will still be me.

320
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,000
I won't let you do that.

321
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,800
You don't need to hold onto me. I can walk myself.

322
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
No, no.

323
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,200
Thank you.

324
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Why are you being so courteous with me?

325
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,600
Let me tell you, I originally wanted to make some yummy food for you.

326
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,280
But recently, I can never find the time.

327
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,600
I tell you, I tell you. I want to make you a concoction of ten powerful tonics.

328
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,600
You will definitely recover really quickly.

329
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,600
I was just thinking, you don't often see your Fifth Older Brother.

330
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,400
You should make food for him.

331
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
- Right?
- Yes. That makes sense.

332
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,800
- We are almost there. Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

333
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,000
- No need to support me.
- Come on. I'll support you.

334
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,500
Did you say Xiaoqi is in the Prime Minister's Manor?

335
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,200
Actually, Xiaoqi and I have a special mark.

336
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,200
When I was at the city gate that day, I saw this mark on a carriage from Prime Minister’s Manor.

337
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,900
I didn’t catch up to the carriage.

338
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,500
But I can confirm that Xiaoqi was on that carriage.

339
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
What if it was Pei Yuan's scheme?

340
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,800
Xiaoqi and I made this mark after we left Mt. Mystic Soul. Unless—

341
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
Then there is only one possibility.

342
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,600
Pei Yuan has seen Xiaoqi in the Prime Minister's Manor.

343
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,100
So she mimicked Xiaoqi's mark and tricked you into going to the slave market.

344
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,900
Looks like Xiaoqi and Earth Absorbing Bell are both in the Prime Minister's Manor.

345
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,700
Why?

346
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:45,150
Speak!

347
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,840
Why?

348
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
Explain!

349
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Earth Absorbing Bell is a treasure passed down many generations of our Zhan Clan.

350
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,200
But it’s an evil thing as well.

351
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,530
It’s extremely cold.

352
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,800
It can send coldness to all human organs.

353
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,400
Only we, the bloodline of Zhan Clan,

354
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,900
will not be affected by this.

355
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,190
Do you mean that

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,600
the thief put Earth Absorbing Bell on Xiaoqi's body,

357
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,400
so the thief himself is not affected,

358
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
but the one which the coldness encroached on is Xiaoqi?

359
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm afraid the child was used for exactly this.

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,100
I want to enter the Prime Minister's Manor.

361
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,800
If you’re so impatient now,

362
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I'm afraid that you will not be able to save the one you want to save,

363
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,200
but will also drag yourself into the problem.

364
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Don't be hasty. I will go find some information first.

365
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,800
Godfather, what do you think?

366
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,000
The fight between Zhan Nancheng and Zhan Beiyan is a matter of Heaven Fiend.

367
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,700
It has nothing to do with our Deep Water.

368
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,000
And I've kept my promise.

369
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,700
I did my best.

370
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,800
Looking at the situation now,

371
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,400
what this King of Heaven Fiend hopes is for his brother to die,

372
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,000
but I want him to live.

373
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,700
So the King of Heaven Fiend will have some scruples about me.

374
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,800
We can get rid of the name of assassination as well.

375
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,700
Does Godfather mean that we have to treat him well?

376
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,800
Yes. Be careful. Treat him well.

377
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,200
Yes.

378
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,100
There is something I need you to do.

379
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,800
Please speak, Godfather.

380
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,400
Tie up and bring Xuanyuan Hui here.

381
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,300
But Xuanyuan Hui just became the Heir Apparent.

382
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,400
And I heard Zhang Henian keep sending people to protect him.

383
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,100
I’m afraid that this isn’t good timing.

384
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,700
Zhang Henian has pushed him up to the position of Heir Apparent.

385
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,200
Should I wait till he becomes a king?

386
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
I understand. I’ll do it now.

387
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,200
Come back!

388
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,900
Did I let you leave?

389
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,300
Do things carelessly in a rush? What impropriety it is!

390
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,900
Yes.

391
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,200
Don’t make any mistake again.

392
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,900
Yes.

393
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,540
You can leave now.

394
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,180
Old Master.

395
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
Miss Yuwen Zi who was sent from Yuwen’s Manor at the Northern Border

396
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
has entered Capital Kun. Where shall she stay?

397
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Do you even come to ask me this kind of question?

398
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,000
A girl from such a small family, just find a wing-room for her to stay.

399
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,200
Yes.

400
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,100
- Go out, go out.
- Yes. Yes.

401
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,880
[Capital Kun Inn]

402
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
Watch your step.

403
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,400
Customer, go in please.

404
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,190
Is there any news?

405
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,600
I’ve found out about everything.

406
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,200
People from Yuwen’s Manor in Changning used to be Qi Zhen’s distant relatives.

407
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,860
After Heir Apparent Wenyi got into trouble,

408
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,300
they were implicated and sent to a bitter cold place to serve a penal sentence.

409
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,800
Initially, Qi Zhen cut off their relationship.

410
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,480
But Qi Zhen is very superstitious

411
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,800
and cares a lot about the four elements of people's birth dates.

412
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
People say that the youngest daughter from Yuwen’s Manor in Changning, Yuwen Zi,

413
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,800
has an excellent birth date.

414
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,200
So, her family used a lot of money to persuade the people in Qi Zhen’s manor

415
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,000
and improved their relationship uneasily.

416
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,100
Currently, Yuwen Zi is on the way to Capital Kun and

417
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,600
will enter Prime Minister’s Manor a few days later.

418
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,200
Do you mean that you want me to pretend to be Yuwen Zi?

419
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Your age and height are similar to Yuwen Zi’s.

420
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,800
And Qi Zhen never got in touch with the adult Yuwen Zi before.

421
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,700
This can help you with hiding your identity.

422
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,300
But I met Qi Zhen before in Mt. Mystic Soul.

423
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,600
I have a solution for this.

424
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,300
Just...

425
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,170
Asking a tiger for its skin has many unexpected risks.

426
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,200
It has to depend on whether you have the guts.

427
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,600
We have no other method now.

428
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,000
What I'm asking you to do should never let the real Yuwen Zi mess my thing up.

429
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,800
The real Yuwen Zi has run away with her man in the middle of her journey.

430
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,100
The ones sending her were afraid to be killed and were keeping this quiet.

431
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,400
If not because of this, you wouldn’t have this opportunity, either.

432
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,500
But in order to look like the real one,

433
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,500
we have to beg one more person.

434
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,000
What? You want to change your face?

435
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I have to become Yuwen Zi if I want to infiltrate the Prime Minister’s Manor.

436
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Are there any difficulties?

437
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,700
Although our Face Changing Technique of Qiongye can make you look like the real one,

438
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,200
it has a fatal flaw.

439
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
What flaw?

440
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,400
After changing your face, it can only last for five days.

441
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,800
In order to not show the flaw, the spell has to be cast again.

442
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,700
Five days are enough.

443
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,910
What if the time is not enough?

444
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,500
What about me following you?

445
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,700
Then we can solve all the problems.

446
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,000
How can I accept your help?

447
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,810
If I can help you, I would not reject it.

448
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,800
But... But...

449
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,400
Fifth Older Brother begged me. You have to agree with one condition.

450
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,800
I will promise if it’s something I, Zhan Beiye, can do.

451
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,000
Never regret.

452
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,100
Just say anything you want.

453
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,700
I want Fifth Older Brother to kiss me.

454
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,400
Right now!

455
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,450
I'm sorry. That I can’t do it.

456
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,510
Fifth Older Brother is always very flexible.

457
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:38,000
You will definitely not scold me.

458
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,900
Never knew that Little Tail had such talent.

459
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,700
I’ve just escaped the tiger’s den and now I have to enter the wolf’s den.

460
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,600
Xiaoqi, you must not waste my hard work.

461

[Prime Minister’s Manor]

462
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,530
You’re Miss Yuwen, right?

463
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,400
Follow me.

464
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,000
This Prime Minister’s Manor is very luxurious.

465
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
No wonder people said Qi Zhen is so rich that he can take over the country.

466
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,570
This is the Prefecture Princess. Quickly step aside.

467
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,700
Miss.

468
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,200
Why are you so slow?

469
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,400
Miss, this miss looks familiar.

470
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,700
Oh, turn your face and let me have a look.

471
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,820
I asked you to turn your face. Do you hear me?

472
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,940
This is our Miss, Yuwen Zi.

473
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:43,720
Yuwen Zi, such an ugly name.

474
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,410
All right, don’t space out.

475
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,100
Follow me.

476
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,000
See, I said no one will recognize you.

477
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,780
Miss Fuyao has entered the Prime Minister's Manor.

478
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:05,390
I didn't go find her to teach her a lesson but she is showing up here herself.

479
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:08,350
As expected, nothing can escape your eyes.

480
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,160
I am just worried that your old wounds aren't even healed yet and you will be getting new injuries.

481

I will be the one in bad luck instead.

482
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:17,490
And are you so certain that I will definitely go find her?

483
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,190
What do you think?

484
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I am worried that she won't be able to take care of herself.

485
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,230
Will you turn away a dying woman?

486
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,630
Greetings, Butler Wei.

487
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,900
This is a room in the north garden.

488
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:52,300
Based on what Prime Minister said, you may temporarily live here.

489
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,870
If there's anything you need, you can ask for the head maidservant, Shi Nan.

490
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,060
Miss, please follow me.

491
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,170
Wait.

492
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,430
The rules of Prime Minister's Manor say that we won't use a servant from the outside. You may return.

493
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:08,420
But I have to take care of our miss.

494
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,210
All these rules were set by the Prime Minister.

495
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:15,470
We servants don't have a say in this.

496
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,700
Zhuzhu, go back and tell our parents.

497
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,250
I will definitely take care of myself. Okay?

498
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,100
Miss, you must take good care of yourself.

499
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,960
You must not look into water or mirrors.

500
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,490
Any reflective object will reveal your true form.

501
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,190
You must remember! You must remember!

502
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,140
I understand.

503
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,890
Miss, take good care of yourself.

504
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,800
Don't get skinnier, okay?

505
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,380
All right.

506
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,400
Let's go.

507
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,510
- You must remember!
- Go.

508
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,430
Miss, take good care of yourself!

509
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,160
Follow me.

510

[Marquis Wen Zhao's Manor]

511
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,230
[Prime Minister's Manor]

512
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:35,970
Zhan Beiye said the Earth Absorbing Bell must be hidden in a place where it can't be easily found.

513
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,130
What kind of place is considered a place where it can't be easily found?

514
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,270
Reporting to Prime Minister. Official Yun said the matter he has been dealing with has all been well handled.

515
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,610
He is on his way back.

516
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,200
- I get it.
- Yes.

517
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,020
If it weren't for that little pebble,

518
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,270
I would've been discovered by the guards on the night patrol.

519
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,660
Can it be that someone is guiding me?

520
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,140
Who is helping me?

521
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,240
[Yun Hen]
[Year: Xinwei, Month: Yimo]

522
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,800
[Yun Hen]

523
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,380
Mr. Zong.

524
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,730
Did Prime Minister find some treasures again?

525
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:49,360
And it looks quite heavy.

526
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,780
Just some mountain products sent by the subordinates.

527
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,420
Nothing special.

528
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,910
I see.

529
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,940
I still have to go see Prime Minister.

530
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,830
I will leave first.

531
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,750
Mr. Yun, may I ask how old you are this year?

532
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,960
Just passed 20.

533
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,890
Birthday on 8th of June (in lunar calendar).

534
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:15,170
How did you know?

535
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,050
It's nothing.

536
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,440
I already told you. Your injuries need quiet rest.

537
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,210
You didn't listen and you are even running everywhere.

538
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,700
In order to win you over, Qi Zhen really put in a lot of effort.

539
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,980
Look, a table full of delicacies from the land and sea.

540
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,200
They don't look like they can all be kept well under this season.

541
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,330
Prime Minister is treating you well.

542
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,400
From now on, my mouth is in luck.

543
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,970
Stop saying so much.

544
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,430
Why exactly did you hang on here?

545
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,650
Of course, it's because of you.

546
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,260
I am a patient. Of course, I need the medical sage to be beside me at anytime. Okay?

547
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:39,480
It can't be that you have fallen for the fierce miss who is pretending to be Yuwen Zi, right?

548
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,130
As Buddha says: Can't say.

549
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,710
These kind of words. Even if they came out of your mouth, I wouldn't believe them.

550
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,600
Tell me. What does that miss have on her

551
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,710
that you need to search for her despite all the risk?

552
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:01,720
As expected, nothing can escape your eyes.

553
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,300
What the girl is looking for just happens to be what I am looking for, too.

554
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:10,130
Earth Absorbing Bell?

555
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,720
Why are you asking if you already knew?

556
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,390
Here. Have some more. The chicken buttock that you like.

557
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,750
No need. Help me pack them up.

558
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,520
Jiang Feng wants it. I'll bring it for Jiang Feng.

559
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,130
That's strange.

560
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,730
Uncle Zhou clearly said this Five-Colored Stone is to unlock the seal.

561
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,480
Could it be that this place has something to do with the seal?

562
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,490
Stop!

563
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,480
