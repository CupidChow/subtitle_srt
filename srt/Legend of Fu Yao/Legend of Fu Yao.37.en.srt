2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,250
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,200
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,200
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,200
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,300
~ Episode 37 ~

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,510
The person you want to sue is in Deep Water.

23
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,600
This is Megrez.

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,000
You should lodge your complaint in Deep Water.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Official!

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,100
Although the woman is from Deep Water,

27
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,000
she likes to travel.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,700
And most recently, she's hiding within Megrez, right here In Yao City,

29
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,400
and this girl is a swindler of both love and money.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,000
It's hard to say whether there will be other victims like me in the future

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,200
Hope Official will consider the welfare of the citizens

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,300
and arrest this lady for trial as soon as possible.

33
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,000
- Tie Cheng.
- Here!

34
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
This person is disturbing official affairs. Drag him out!

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,470
- Drag him out?
- That's right.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,400
What's wrong?

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,260
This case is unique.

38
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,400
We'll try it next time.

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
O-Official.

40
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,180
Have a sip.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,400
Say, where did that Mr. Yuan come from exactly?

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,300
Why does Official Fu hate him this much?

43
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,720
Don't ask about this matter anymore.

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,600
Talk about it.

45
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,000
Look. That Mr. Yuan has extraordinary bearing.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
And his relationship with Mr. Zong is also-also very good.

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,600
Then... why does Official Fu hate him so much?

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,500
Talk about it. What's their relationship?

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,900
- Do you want to know?
- Yes. I want to know.

50
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,500
I want to know.

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
- The two of them—
- Have no relationship.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
Older Sis Fuyao.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,100
Official Fu.

54
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,000
- You're not allowed to gossip about me.
- No. No.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,300
We're not gossiping.

56
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,000
Official Fu.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What did you call me?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,200
No. Fuyao.

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,780
I see that you're not in a good mood today.

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,600
Why don't I take you to a place?

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,950
All right. I'm idle anyways.

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,600
Where are we going?

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,760
Look at today. It's cold and very foggy.

64
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,400
There must be a singing sand fairyland that can be seen outside the city.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
That is the best strange phenomenon that can be seen here in South Border during the winter.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,600
Why don't I bring you over there to look at it?

67
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,900
All right. Then, let's go.

68
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,000
- All right. Let's go.
- Hey!

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,400
Aren't you going to bring me along?

70
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,850
You traitor. Just stay here.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,300
Let's go.

72
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,610
Fuyao, listen. Listen, listen.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,300
This singing sand fairyland is so mystical.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,600
The sound it makes is more beautiful than a human singing.

75
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,000
But isn't this a singing sand fairyland?

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,200
We heard the singing sand, but where is the fairyland?

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,920
Sandsea Fairyland is in a higher location.

78
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,000
We must go there.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,500
Here. This way.

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,800
Slower, slower.

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
It's Mt. Mystic Soul.

82
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Although our South Border is desolate, Sand God is very powerful.

83
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,600
This singing sound fairyland is a spectacle bestowed by the heavens to us.

84
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,600
As long as it's in your heart, you can see the scenery that you want.

85
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,000
The South Border Sandsea understands the human heart the most.

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,500
The water curtain of Deep Water.

87
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,300
I'm not watching anymore.

88
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,600
Don't let him follow me, Tie Cheng.

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
All right.

90
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,720
Is there really a point to this?

91
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,600
Are you not afraid I'll hurt him?

92
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,100
Hey, it's not yet sure who will hurt whom!

93
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Tie Cheng!

94
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Let go of me! Let go!

95
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,200
Put me down! Put me down!

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,700
- What are you doing?
- Your injuries aren't fully cured, yet you act unreasonably like this.

97
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,600
How can I not feel for you?

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
Let go of me!

99
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,100
- Listen to me.
- Let go of me!

100
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,900
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me! Listen to me!

101
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,400
Liking you and chasing after you is my matter.

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Just like avoiding me and rejecting me is your matter.

103
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
If you don't want to see me, just directly tell me!

104
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,200
I, Zhangsun Wuji, from then on will disappear in front of you.

105
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,800
Is this what you want?

106
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,500
If so, tell me right now!

107
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,300
Let go! Let go!

108
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:00,300
♫ Even if there are tons of dangers up front ♫

109
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,000
♫ You've taken hold of tomorrow ♫

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,400
Why did you still come to pester me?

111
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,000
♫ With thousands of thoughts and emotions ♫

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The whole world clearly knows

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,200
you already have someone else in your heart.

114
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,400
Everyone knows...

115
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,500
that the Crown Prince of Megrez will be marrying the princess of Plough.

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:33,600
♫ Even if tomorrow is full of storms ♫

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,400
What if I say... What if I say that this is fake, then?

118
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,000
I already don't know which words of yours I can believe.

119
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
I don't know at all...

120
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
I don't know at all which words you say are true.

121
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,400
I don't even know who you are!

122
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:01,000
From Xuanyuan Min to Yuan Zhaoxu to Zhangsun Wuji,

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,200
I don't even know who you are.

124
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,400
No matter what identity I use to appear in front of you,

125
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,800
the me in front of you

126
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,300
is always the true me.

127
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,960
Or to put it another way,

128
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,460
ever since I met you,

129
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,600
I was no longer the original me.

130
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,300
That day...

131
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,820
That day I already saw everything in your father's meditation room.

132
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,100
Folian and you...

133
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,910
are very much in love.

134
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,500
Mystic spirit leaf...

135
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I've said before that the mystic spirit leaf can contain

136
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,800
all the truths in this world with no lies at all.

137
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,360
I just want...

138
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,790
I just want you to see my heart.

139
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
But you've said before that if one's memories are taken out,

140
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,000
it requires a huge price.

141
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:22,300
Compared to your trust, this price is worth nothing.

142
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,270
Empress Mother.

143
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,940
Ji'er, you're here.

144
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,620
Crown Prince Wuji, long time no see.

145
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,020
Princess.

146
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,600
I am Xuanji Folian. Crown Prince—

147
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,840
The Plough map concerns the life and death of Five Regions.

148
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,590
For Princess Folian to personally come to submit the map

149
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,010
and help resolve the urgent problem of the withering Winged Tree,

150
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,690
I thank you on behalf of the Megrez Imperial City.

151
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,220
This travel of mine isn't just for Five Regions.

152
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,420
It's more for Your Highness Crown Prince.

153
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,030
I also have waited for you for a long time.

154
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,180
Since all the members of the royal family are here today,

155
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,850
why don't we make good use of this good day

156
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:39,700
and make a decree about the marital alliance between Plough and Megrez and then promulgate it to the world?

157
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,610
Marital alliance? How come I don't remember?

158
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,560
The two of us had made a pact to get married. Have you forgotten?

159
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,830
Regarding the truth to this matter,

160
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,850
I still need some time to verify it.

161
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,420
In this unusual times,

162
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,940
I am willing to cancel my engagement with Megrez Crown Prince.

163
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,180
Folian already knew beforehand that Fuyao and you had a special relationship.

164
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,920
Hence, she was determined to destroy her reputation.

165
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,070
She set up this trap since the day she met her outside the city.

166
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,900
But inside your father's meditation room, I clearly saw...

167
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,440
What you've seen is what Emperor Father wanted you to see.

168
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,580
Could it be all fake then?

169
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,700
The most supreme ability in this world isn't having the most enemies killed,

170
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,030
but silently destroying a person's will.

171
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:56,820
In Emperor Father's place, everything has become mysterious principle.

172
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,660
In his place, you can see the truth or create an illusion.

173
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,740
I don't dare to believe it, but I have no choice but to.

174
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,110
Everyone thinks that Lord Emperor is focused on meditating, not caring about worldly affairs.

175
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:22,300
But in reality, it's just because he has seen too much of people's hearts

176
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,080
that he's unwilling to face the ugliness.

177
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,430
My Emperor Father is the person that I admire the most.

178
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,110
But since I was young, I knew that other than being my Emperor Father,

179
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,710
he is the Lord of Five Regions.

180
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,200
As the Lord of Five Regions,

181
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,230
there're things that he has to do.

182
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,590
Everything that he did is what he thinks is the most advantageous for the empire.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,950
But you are an exception.

184
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,760
An exception that I will never give up on.

185
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,950
Liar.

186
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,000
You liar.

187
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,820
What are you doing?

188
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,510
Don't move.

189
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Troublesome.

190
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,710
I like being troubled like this for you.

191
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,210
No one can rival you in sweet talk.

192
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,270
Maybe not.

193
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,300
That Tie Cheng seems very good in courting your favor, too.

194
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,150
You're jealous?

195
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm not.

196
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,350
I'm not worried that others will steal you from me, either.

197
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,680
Because I'm sure that I'm that person who treats you the best and the most worthy for you to entrust your life with.

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,830
If a person more suitable than me appears,

199
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:06,370
I will then try harder to do better than him.

200
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,030
Someone is coming from the southwest direction.

201
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,260
Brothers, everyone has worked hard today.

202
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,940
Each team performed very well.

203
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,560
Let's rest here tonight.

204
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,460
Just eat and drink all you want.

205
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,400
Let's continue to set out and hurry in our travel tomorrow morning. Okay?

206
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,580
All right! All right!

207
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,810
- Disperse!
- Okay!

208
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,060
Chigui?

209
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,500
You recognize him?

210
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,760
The First Boss of Black Tribe Gang.

211
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,790
Why did he come here?

212
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,280
He and Zhangsun Pingrong are secretly colluding.

213
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,810
Looks like the reason behind his secretly mobilizing his army won't be a simple one.

214
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,560
I have an idea. Why don't you and I—

215
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,000
No. For verification matters, I can do it by myself.

216
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,730
Just wait for me here. Okay?

217
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,040
- You think you're something because you're the Crown Prince of Megrez?
- You!

218
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,050
One with great power cannot defeat a local villain.

219
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,710
Understand?

220
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,700
All right. You won't listen to me anyway.

221
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,730
Let's go take a look together.

222
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,720
There's someone over there! Hurry!

223
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,710
Zhuzhu? Let's hurry and go.

224
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,310
Let's go.

225
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,500
- Zhuzhu.
- Older Sister Fuyao.

226
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Are you all right?

227
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,630
- I'm fine.
- We shouldn't stay here any longer. Let's quickly leave.

228
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,390
Let's go.

229
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,210
After not seeing you for a long time, you look pallid and thinner.

230
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,630
If your Fifth Older Brother sees you now, how sorry will he be?

231
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,400
You just know to mock me.

232
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,440
Have I become a lot uglier?

233
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,480
No, you look very energetic.

234
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
Wasn't it because I was worried about him?

235
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,970
That's why I look this haggard.

236
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,890
- You've been looking for him?
- Yes.

237
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,860
When did you lose him?

238
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,730
When he left Deep Water that day, I secretly followed him.

239
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,790
I thought he was going to Heaven Fiend.

240
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,650
I ever thought that he would go to the Geya Desert instead.

241
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,240
Geya Desert?

242
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,230
The most mysterious death desert of Five Regions.

243
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,990
Eight to nine out of ten people going there don't return.

244
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,820
The sandstorm was especially strong that day.

245
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,860
I then looked for a place to hide.

246
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,610
After the wind stopped, I came out to look again, but I couldn't find anything anymore.

247
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,290
Also, what's very weird is I couldn't get out of there and just kept circling around the same spot.

248
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,390
Later on, I had no choice for my food and my water supply was about to be used up.

249
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,210
I then thought of trying my luck in Rock City.

250
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,140
Maybe my Older Fifth Brother already went home.

251
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,570
But I never thought that I would get caught and taken home by my father while just traveling midway.

252
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,720
He insisted that I marry the son of our tribe's high priest.

253
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,470
Of course, I refused!

254
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,770
I then used death to threaten him.

255
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,090
He got scared.

256
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,150
I then got the chance to escape.

257
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,970
Then, Older Sister Fuyao, do you know my Older Fifth Brother's whereabouts?

258
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,520
I also have been thinking about him.

259
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,880
Why were those bandits chasing you earlier?

260
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,270
Those bandits are so petty.

261
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,630
I just stole...

262
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,100
Wrong... I just borrowed one horse from them.

263
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,090
And they sent so many people to chase after me.

264
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,150
Miss, are you from the Qiongye Tribe?

265
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,620
How did you know?

266
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,240
Did you see it clearly?

267
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Was it really that Yao City Magistrate?

268
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,770
I-I can't believe it, either.

269
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,100
I even looked at her a few more times.

270
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,340
It's her! I'm sure of it, Big Bro!

271
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,620
I shouldn't have let them go back then.

272
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,730
Whether they are Prince Assist's men, just one token can't explain it.

273
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,150
Even if they are, so what?

274
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,840
They kept foiling my plans.

275
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,080
Now, no one can defend her.

276
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,450
I'll lead some men to capture her now.

277
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,540
Forget it. Don't chase anymore.

278
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,950
What's the fun in doing small disturbances?

279
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,960
If we're going to give her a hard time, it should be in a grand manner.

280
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,500
It's indeed time for her to learn the might of our Black Tribe Gang.

281
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:37,920
All right!

282
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,060
And I was wondering why you were so smart to identify me as a member of the Qiongye Tribe,

283
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,630
so it's because of this sea bead.

284
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,640
What kind of tribe is Qiongye?

285
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,460
Qiongye is one of the most ancient tribes in the Five Regions.

286
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,640
Before, after Firmament won the war, the world was divided into five nations.

287
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,060
Other than the current Megrez, Deep Water, Heaven Fiend, and Plough,

288
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,370
Qiongye used to be a powerful nation.

289
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,750
And because of their very unique witchcraft technique, they had the power to replace the Megrez Imperial City.

290
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,550
How come only four nations are left now?

291
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,370
Afterwards, the kings of Qiongye's north and south tribes had some internal strife.

292
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,750
It caused the nation to split up into pieces.

293
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,460
My branch came from the mountain forest to begin with.

294
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:25,260
After the split up, we hid inside the mountain forest

295
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,140
and had no energy to care about the matters happening outside anymore.

296
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,220
Qiongye Nation can't become a nation anymore.

297
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,810
Miss, that one you have isn't a sea bead.

298
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,890
It's an internal energy pellet from an ancient mythical beast.

299
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,400
You're not an ordinary Qiongye tribe member.

300
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,740
How come you know everything?

301
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,700
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

302
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,250
What's wrong?

303
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,280
The Passion Lockup Toxin.

304
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,450
The Passion Lockup Toxin inside of you has relapsed.

305
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,870
Sit well.

306
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,730
Good thing that I'm not your enemy.

307
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:50,130
Or else, your gaze could have killed me.

308
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,590
You can choose to be my family then.

309
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,780
Who wants to be your family?

310
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:04,840
I can resist thousands of people by myself,

311
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,050
but you alone is enough to suppress me.

312
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,690
What you used earlier is the Soul Calming technique of Megrez, am I right?

313
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,040
The Soul Calming technique is a shared secret technique of Firmament and Megrez.

314
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,650
I know that there is only one person who can use it in the entire Five Regions.

315
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,300
You are the Crown Prince of Megrez, Zhangsun Wuji.

316
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,420
It's me.

317
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,870
Let me ask you. Do all foreign tribes deserve to die?

318
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:33,460
Are they mere trifle to you for you to casually trample on them?

319
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,410
I don't want to talk about these right now.

320
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,680
The poison inside you has been activated.

321
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,730
I'll take you to see Zong Yue now.

322
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,380
Come.

323
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,630
Don't leave.

324
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,060
Answer my question: Yes or no?

325
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,130
Little Tail, could there be some misunderstanding here?

326
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:50,590
Don't talk now.

327
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,870
Let's go!

328
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,440
Girl!

329
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,990
- You!
- Wuji, don't!

330
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,790
Fuyao, I didn't do that deliberately.

331
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,290
Fuyao, you are awake.

332
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,510
Do you still hurt?

333
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
I'm fine.

334
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,270
I really didn't do it deliberately.

335
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,660
I know.

336
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,700
Quickly think about how you'll repay me.

337
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,900
I'll do whatever you want.

338
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,200
Let me think about it then. It's been so long since I ate—

339
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,480
Haven't eaten the medicine prepared by Zong Yue.

340
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,770
I'm warning you. Don't decide on your own to protect me and get hurt.

341
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:58,230
If you are like this again, I won't forgive you and the person who created the trouble.

342
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,610
Come. Be careful.

343
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,640
I'll drink it myself.

344
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,550
I-I want to be alone for a while.

345
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,730
You two can leave me.

346
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,830
- Then rest well.
- Yes.

347
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,390
I never saw Little Tail that angry.

348
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,670
Wuji, regardless if there is a misunderstanding or grudge between you two,

349
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,210
I hope that you two can be well.

350
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,630
If I remember it right, your father's name is Yalan Zhi.

351
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,810
Your grandfather is Yalan Hezhen.

352
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,100
Your tribe is the descendant of Prince Chill Mount, Yalan Yi.

353
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,260
You must be his 45th generation descendant.

354
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,990
Am I right, Princess Yalan?

355
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,320
You want to kill me because of that past matter, right?

356
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,340
In the past, who was the one who incited the war between the North and South Qiongye?

357
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,320
Who offered to provide arms to the South King for him to battle his own brother?

358
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,210
And who sent the spy to infiltrate the North Palace to steal the marshal's seal and exile the respected North King?

359
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,370
It was me.

360
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,030
My dad was originally the most respected hero in our tribe,

361
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,300
but you drove him to hide in the mountain forest.

362
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,560
Even if he still is the North King,

363
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,710
in the hearts of the Qiongye people, he already isn't that hero who can do everything!

364
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,790
You destroyed him!

365
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,820
I couldn't consider your father's feelings.

366
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,880
Although it was not my intention for Qiongye to get divided,

367
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,170
in my eyes, there is only the interest of the Five Regions.

368
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,200
There isn't any interest of Qiongye.

369
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,710
Once you take over the throne of North King,

370
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,970
you probably will understand my painstaking efforts.

371
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,730
I don't understand any political tactics.

372
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,180
I only know that you are the enemy of our Qiongye Tribe!

373
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,030
I'm giving you this chance.

374
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:52,440
You can kill me now and I won't fight back.

375
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,640
I'm not going to kill you.

376
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,550
What can killing you do?

377
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,800
Qiongye is still that divided Qiongye.

378
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,110
It can't change anything.

379
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,000
If you inherit the North King throne,

380
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,940
will you think of a way to win over the people's hearts and rule over the whole Qiongye?

381
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,850
I surely will!

382
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,310
Okay.

383
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,430
I, Zhangsun Wuji, take an oath here.

384
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,200
After you've really grown stronger in the future and unite the Qiongye tribe,

385
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,830
if you still want to kill me,

386
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,740
I'm willing to fight with you and treat you as my real competition.

387
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,640
Before that, can we first put aside our personal grudges? Okay?

388
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,220
Master Sand God in heaven!

389
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,930
Please bless us peace!

390
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,770
The Worship Festival welcomes Master Sand God!

391
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,360
What have you done that you're being that fidgety?

392
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:31,810
Mister Zong, didn't Crown Prince give Older Sis Fuyao a lot of gifts last time?

393
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:34,130
I found this Imperial Mud Shop facial toner among them.

394
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,990
I heard that's its very good for a lady's skin.

395
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:39,220
Seeing how pallid Zhuzhu looked lately, this might be helpful for her.

396
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,180
You really know to borrow flowers to offer to Buddha?

397
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,570
It smells fragrant. Smell it.

398
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,240
Geya rose.

399
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,290
You can even tell by smelling?

400
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,210
There is also some blue skullcap, licorice, Michelia, and lilies.

401
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,110
Wow, your nose... you're indeed a medical sage.

402
00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,700
Quit smelling. How can they still do business if you find out their secret ingredients?

403
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,470
I just knew the main ingredients.

404
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,330
They surely have their unique secret formula.

405
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:10,600
How come it's so loud outside?

406
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,210
I don't know.

407
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,960
It seems that the citizens are worshipping the Sand God today.

408
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,870
Mr. Zong, give it back to me.

409
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,310
Never thought that the Worship Festival of this place is quite so interesting.

410
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:50,310
Good!

411
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,160
The Black Tribe Gang has been moving nightly.

412
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,190
A huge number of refugees and bandits in the southwest border got recruited by them.

413
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:59,460
Looks like this Royal Brother of yours can't wait anymore.

414
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,910
One: He is afraid that I'll get evidence to prove his collusion with the South Border bandits, so he wants to act first to get the upperhand.

415
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,870
Two: I came here by my own and didn't bring any army at all.

416
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,090
This is the best chance to eliminate me.

417
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,300
What do you plan to do?

418
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,090
The situation now isn't the same as before.

419
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,600
Since I left the Imperial city,

420
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,030
I fear that a lot must be happening there.

421
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,650
Those generals and ministers that sided with him aren't short-sighted people.

422
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,030
Looks like this Royal Brother of yours has really used serious tactics this time.

423
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,950
And now, you're in South Border.

424
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,200
Even if you try to devise strategies as countermeasures, I fear that you're too far to provide any influence.

425
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,390
When do you plan to leave?

426
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,120
Her situation lately isn't good.

427
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,590
She frequently treats me coldly.

428
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,700
Is her Passion Lockup Toxin really incurable?

429
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,900
The poisons in her body are very complicated.

430
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,860
Right now, we can only rely on drugs to suppress it and delay it.

431
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,550
Once it activates, unless we find the real antidote,

432
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,890
it will be a hopeless situation.

433
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,830
I will never let such a thing happen.

434
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,280
You now have something you're worried about.

435
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,410
Once you worry about her, she then will be your weakness.

436
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,540
Worrying and caring about her, she then becomes my weakness.

437
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:21,470
Wanting to guard her and be with her forever,

438
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,320
this weakness will become an armor.

439
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,140
I must become stronger

440
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:32,090
because suddenly, I have something that I desire;

441
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:36,130
a desire stronger than standing in the peak of power.

442
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,960
Good shot!

443
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,500
What do you mean by this?

444
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,590
Official Fu accepting my challenge is my honor!

445
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,130
Challenge?

446
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,380
Older Sis Fuyao, he wants to compete with you.

447
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,840
Competing with me?

448
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,770
Sure. It's been so long since I played this.

449
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,070
- Let's play then!
- What?

450
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,650
Fuyao, since I joined the Worship Festival Celebration, I have never lost.

451
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,800
If you make me suffer my first loss today,

452
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,230
you will have my life and soul!

453
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,030
That target is already full of arrows, how can you still hit it?

454
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,860
You indeed won over me!

455
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,030
Fuyao, I want to marry you!

456
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,230
- Huh?
- What?

457
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,880
Wh-What?

458
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,160
What did you say?

459
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,500
You agreed that if I lose, my life and soul will be yours.

460
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,420
No need for you to be that courteous.

461
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,910
What? Since you're able to defeat me, then you're more worthy for me to have.

462
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:28,240
My mother said that a man who couldn't get what he wants

463
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,130
isn't counted as a real man.

464
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,970
Thank your mother for me.

465
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,250
Who are you?

466
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:42,670
If I defeat you, will your body and soul be mine, too?

467
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,620
Right. Right. Wasn't that a rule that you said?

468
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,110
How about it? Dare to match?

469
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,800
Sure, let's match.

470
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,630
What's going on?

471
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,750
In winning a lady's heart, you don't rely on endless pestering.

472
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,200
Got it?

473
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,070
This is a competition for the most beautiful woman.

474
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,860
Why didn't you join?

475
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,730
I can't compete with them.

476
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:17,340
The winner this year is... Hu Sang!

477
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,070
She's actually very beautiful.

478
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,290
Yes, quite beautiful.

479
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,320
Today is the Worship Festival.

480
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,800
I heard that if you are able to get the handkerchief of a woman,

481
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,910
you can then openly marry her and bring her home.

482
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,560
Where's your handkerchief?

483
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,220
That...

484
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,630
You sure are a beauty.

485
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,840
I'll accept it for my big brother.

486
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,260
Why did he just leave?

487
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,490
I was wondering where you were hiding.

488
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,460
So you're here drinking wine alone.

489
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,150
Let me drink with you.

490
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,120
Getting angry?

491
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,200
Why be angry?

492
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,190
That girl was quite pretty.

493
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,960
Listen well!

494
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,980
You can run from me, reject me, but you have no right to hurt another person's dignity.

495
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,530
You don't have the right to interfere with another person's choice.

496
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,820
From Mt. Mystic Soul, to Deep Water, to Megrez, and then up to here,

497
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,350
I followed you all the way here.

498
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,880
Don't you see how I feel?

499
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,890
You clearly are willing.

500
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,480
Am I right?

501
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,370
Why then must you pick up a blade and keep stabbing and cutting?

502
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:56,100
Is it because I'm the crown prince of Megrez Empire?

503
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,550
What about Megrez's crown prince?

504
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,780
Is the Megrez crown prince that great?

505
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,780
I would be with you regardless of who you are.

506
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,370
Then why?

507
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,180
I need an explanation.

508
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,990
The wine is out. I'm going to get some.

509
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,920
Tell me! What are you afraid of?

510
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,790
"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

511
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,240
♫ What do you know? ♫

512
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,250
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

513
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:09,030
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

514
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,260
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

515
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,900
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

516
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,800
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

517
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,960
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

518
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,300
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

519
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:33,370
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

520
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:37,220
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

521
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:40,450
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

522
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:43,960
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

523
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,930
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

524
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,140
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

525
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:56,560
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

526
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,620
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

527
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:07,870
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

528
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,550
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

529
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:13,910
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

530
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,680
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

531
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,970
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

532
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,930
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

533
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,560
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

534
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,440
♫ Have someone's company♫

535
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,370
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

536
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:39,660
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

537
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,460
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

538
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:45,380
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

539

♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

540
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,700
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫
