00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,290
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,520
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,620
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,890
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,040
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,740
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,980
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,770
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,950
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,070
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,670
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,330
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,490
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:21,710
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:25,850
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,200
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,490
~ Episode 16 ~

22
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,160
Long time no see.

23
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,930
Senior Sister, it really has been a long time.

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,230
The grudge between you and I has nothing to do with other people.

25
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,370
Please let Xiaoqi go.

26
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,260
I am the one who sets the rules.

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,170
You don't get a say!

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Both of you must die!

29
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,090
Xiaoqi!

30
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,960
Xiaoqi!

31
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,620
Why is it you? Where is Xiaoqi?

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,700
You are about to die but still think of other people.

33
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,510
Today, you are doomed to die.

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,900
Who is it?

35
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,260
Come out!

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,610
Come out!

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,940
Why is it you again?

38
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,060
I should ask you the same question.

39
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,570
I've been nice and saved the beauty heroically.

40
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,800
You should at least thank me.

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,230
Sure.

42
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,790
A beautiful prefecture princess is now lying on the ground.

43
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,680
- Take her. Don't be shy!
- Naughty!

44
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,690
Let me ask you. Have you waited here for a long time?

45
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,590
You just waited for this moment so that I could thank you.

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,100
I want a whole lot more than just a simple "thank you."

47
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,410
I don't have time to chat with you.

48
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,300
I'm in a hurry to save someone.

49
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,860
If I help you find that person, can I ask you a favor?

50
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,540
- Xiaoqi! How's Xiaoqi?
- He's fine!

51
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,620
Once I cut the rope later, your side will drop.

52
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,850
I'll catch you.

53
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,680
Okay.

54
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't touch me!

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,570
Your tiny body is actually quite heavy.

56
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,190
- Xiaoqi, Xiaoqi!
- Older Sis Fuyao.

57
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,520
- I'm here.
- I knew you would come save me.

58
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,720
It's all because of this thing. I'll remove it for you.

59
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,690
- Wait!
- Why?

60
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,580
His life is now interlocked with the Earth Absorbing Bell.

61
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,110
If you take it away, he'll die.

62
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,890
Then what should we do?

63
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,650
Godfather.

64
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,190
Who told you to do this?

65
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,640
I just thought we should not keep Zhan Beiya alive.

66
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,990
After he escaped from the fire at the Official Post,

67
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,920
he remains a latent threat.

68
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,180
I worry that he may disclose your great plan.

69
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,010
It will hurt you and—

70
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,210
I've told you before,

71
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,840
this person can't be killed.

72
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,270
Not only can you not kill him right now,

73
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,970
but you also have to support him and provide all he needs.

74
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,680
The Earth Absorbing Bell is useless now.

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,640
If you kill him,

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,940
what else can I use to negotiate with Zhan Nancheng?

77
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,520
Therefore, what does Godfather mean?

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,040
About the mess in Heaven Fiend, I don't want to get involved.

79
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,360
I don't want to offend either of these two brothers.

80
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,110
If you killed him right here,

81
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,620
we would have trouble in explaining what happened to the Earth Absorbing Bell.

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,660
Now I understand.

83
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,880
Palace Leader has come.

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,290
I hope Xuanyuan Min can't get away this time.

85
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,150
What is this?

86
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,160
Take Xiaoqi and leave first. Leave the business here to me.

87
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,720
- What about you?
- Go!

88
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,200
- Don't die!
- Don't worry! I won't die so easily.

89
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,080
Let's go!

90
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,040
Xiaoqi, Xiaoiqi, Xiaoqi! Xiaoqi!

91
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,520
Fuyao!

92
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,220
Zhan Beiye!

93
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,130
How to remove the Earth Absorbing Bell?

94
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,320
- How is he?
- Fortunately, you have transmitted him your energy.

95
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,680
His life is saved.

96
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,300
Energy?

97
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,760
Help me guard us. I’ll remove the Earth Absorbing Bell.

98
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
All right.

99
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,960
Done.

100
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,690
Xiaoqi! Xiaoqi!

101
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,880
Xiaoqi!

102
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,370
Older Sis Fuyao.

103
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,980
Xiaoqi!

104
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,900
- Thank you.
- He’s injured because of the coldness of Earth Absorbing Bell.

105
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,580
I need to gather energies to heal him in order to speed up his recovery.

106
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,010
Please take care of Xiaoqi for a while.

107
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,480
Okay, be careful.

108
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I’ll come back in a minute.

109
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,230
I thought there was nothing you can’t do.

110
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,950
It looks like you still need my help.

111
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,160
Yes, I really can’t do this without you.

112
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,160
I ask you. Why did you let me stab you in the slavefighting ring that day?

113
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,080
If I didn’t do that, would you have stopped?

114
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,230
Your doing that makes me inhumane and unjust.

115
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,840
But people only remember your chivalrousness.

116
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,390
These leaves have become demons.

117
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,190
We can’t just fight over them like this.

118
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,350
These things have no blood, flesh or fixed composition.

119
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,910
Normal techniques can’t hurt them.

120
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,270
We've succeeded.

121
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,340
It’s difficult to fight against it this time.

122
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,780
Run! Quick!

123
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,070
Quick!

124
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,730
It's you?

125
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,420
If it weren't for her,

126
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,770
today would be your death day.

127
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,170
What happened?

128
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,130
Are you so worried about me?

129
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,120
I just wished you wouldn't die in the hands of someone else.

130
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,860
Your Majesty!

131
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,580
These people were not here when I was in danger and only rushed here now.

132
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,790
Since they’re here, I've found Xiaoqi and the Earth Absorbing Bell.

133
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,140
I’ll let you take care of the rest.

134
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,670
I’m leaving now.

135
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,300
If we act, we have to finish the drama.

136
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,320
If you leave now, who will act with me?

137
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,690
What’s happening?

138
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,220
His Majesty disappeared.

139
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,310
Why is His Majesty so slow?

140
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,400
Godfather, it seems that there is no sound and movement.

141
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,250
His Majesty cannot be... Can he?

142
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,730
Hurry up!

143
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,260
Hurry up! Send this lady away.

144
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,230
Your Majesty, what happened in the forest just now?

145
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,990
What happened?

146
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,980
Prime Minister, are you very unhappy with me being the king?

147
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,840
That’s why you ordered people to assassinate me in the forest.

148
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,350
Your Majesty, why did you say such a word?

149
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,020
Everyone can see that I’m loyal to Your Majesty.

150
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,400
Then, tell me. Why are there monsters in the forest?

151
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,140
If it was not for that girl who got injured on behalf of me, I would be the one dying.

152
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,080
Your Majesty,

153
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,860
the ones you met in the forest aren’t monsters or assassins.

154
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,550
They may be the Heaven’s Rule.

155
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,760
What do you mean?

156
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,310
I remember this is written in an old book.

157
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,310
When a new king takes over the throne of Deep Water,

158
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,280
he has to experience a test from the Heavens.

159
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,200
That test is called the Heaven’s Rule.

160
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,220
If you successfully passed the Heaven’s Rule,

161
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,570
the country will definitely be prosperous.

162
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,600
This is a very good fortune sign.

163
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
A good fortune sign.

164
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,210
Your Majesty is mighty.

165
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,370
Prime Minister, is what you said real?

166
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,830
Very real.

167
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,610
Good, it looks like the heavens are helping me with my position.

168
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,650
I don’t have to worry that people will covet my place anymore.

169
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,130
Of course. Of course.

170
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,650
Your Majesty, look. You came out without any injury, didn't you?

171
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,890
Oh, yeah. Prime Minister, the girl today did a great job.

172
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,890
Choose one day and send her to my palace, okay?

173
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,900
I’ll definitely fulfill your request.

174
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,860
But I don’t know where the girl is from, I—

175
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Prime Minister, she’s from your manor.

176
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,530
Why are you asking me?

177
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,890
My manor?

178
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,340
Godfather, what’s the matter?

179
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:57,750
When the manor in Changning sent the girl here,

180
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,950
they said her birth date was extraordinarily good.

181
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,090
I thought that was some nonsense and didn’t believe them fully.

182
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:10,620
After today’s happening, you know?

183
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,630
This is an overlord’s star.

184
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,730
Godfather, you planned to...

185
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,960
Today, we didn’t get to kill Xuanyuan Min.

186
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,020
Indeed, he’s not as simple as what we see from outside.

187
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,530
I think we have to slowly plan for our big plan.

188
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,730
Since Xuanyuan Min thinks Yuwen Zi saved him,

189
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,180
then this girl

190
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,450
is the best chess piece to be put beside him.

191
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,660
God’s will.

192
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,680
Fifth Older Brother.

193
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,900
- Has he become better?
- Yes.

194
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,200
His life is safe now.

195
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:46,900
Pitiful boy, being bullied in such a way.

196
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,420
He’s okay.

197
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,160
Now, the one who got in trouble is Fuyao.

198
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,700
Miss got everyone’s attention yesterday.

199
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,880
The Prime Minister will come and visit you personally later.

200
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,480
Miss, why don’t you prepare yourself?

201
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,870
What did you say? Qi-Qi Zhen is coming here personally?

202
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,390
Yes.

203
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,100
The veil isn’t that important.

204
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,320
It will be bad if you forget about your birthmark.

205
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,040
- How do you—
- I know Miss is generous.

206
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,610
Master has reminded me to take care of you on everything.

207
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,610
Who’s your master?

208
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,030
Is it Zhan Beiye?

209
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,820
Although everyone knows Prince Fierce is mighty,

210
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,370
comparing him to our master, I think he’s way more weaker.

211
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,770
Don’t tell me it's that liar?

212
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,000
Miss, stop asking. I won’t tell you anything.

213
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,300
Prime Minister is here.

214
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,310
Greetings, Prime Minister.

215
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,590
What’s the matter? Are you afraid of me?

216
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,330
Since I entered Prime Minister’s Manor,

217
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,750
this is my first time seeing Prime Minister.

218
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,170
Everyone says Prime Minister is a well-known important person.

219
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,810
I’m afraid that I’m not well-mannered enough and would surprise Prime Minister.

220
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,720
I see. What did they say about me?

221
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,620
Tell me.

222
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,150
They also said Prime Minister is a big hero of Deep Water.

223
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,650
If there was no Prime Minister, there would be no Deep Water today.

224
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,000
They even said,

225
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,860
I have a chance to enter Prime Minister’s Manor, is my fortune that I cultivated for years.

226
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,600
What’s the matter?

227
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,510
Doctor Zong from the manor said

228
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,020
I got an epidemic disease from the Hunting Field.

229
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,650
Once we get in contact, the disease will be passed to you.

230
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,390
I’m afraid that Prime Minister...

231
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,500
and my face is ugly with a birthmark on my face.

232
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,030
I’m afraid that it will shock you.

233
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,420
Even if a person has a beauty which can shut down the moon and put the flowers to shame,

234
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,520
she won't look pretty if she’s not talented nor kind.

235
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,790
I see you’re calm and well-mannered.

236
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,770
This isn’t a personality which we can find easily.

237
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,130
These are so much more important things than your beauty.

238
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,190
Prime Minister, thanks for your praises.

239
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,000
But, how brave are you?

240
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,990
You actually collaborated with culprits.

241
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,960
Collaborated?

242
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,340
Qi Zhen has discussed with his loyal officials that they want to select concubines for Mister.

243
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,120
Just that I didn’t expect that Mister would predict this and step in a step ahead.

244
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,610
I was planning to let him bully me,

245
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:50,860
and I just need to observe.

246
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,760
But after the incident in the Hunting Field yesterday,

247
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,230
I actually have a new plan which not only can mess Qi Zhen’s plans up,

248
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,900
but also keep the person I want.

249
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,270
I’m-I’m just a lowly girl

250
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,700
and staying in the manor everyday.

251
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,660
How do I dare to collaborate with anyone else?

252
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:21,710
Tell me. How did you save the King in the Hunting Field yesterday?

253
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,380
In the hunting ground yesterday,

254
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,870
I was just curious and wanted to have a look at the King’s face.

255
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,840
That’s why I entered the hunting ground.

256
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,660
Suddenly, strong wind blew and the leaves became the shape of a human.

257
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,490
- Really?
- What I said is the truth.

258
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,790
Those leaves which formed a human rushed towards me.

259
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,800
I was shocked and ran away quickly

260
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,170
and so happened to meet the King.

261
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,590
Then?

262
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:53,540
The human-like leaves rushed towards me and the King.

263
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,860
I was very shocked.

264
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,790
That time, who knows that His Majesty... His Majesty...

265
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,040
actually...

266
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,610
Actually what?

267
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,850
His Majesty actually hid behind me.

268
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,170
But I was too scared and didn’t know where to hide,

269
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,430
so I could only hug the King and wait to be killed.

270
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,260
Suddenly, I’m not sure how,

271
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,010
there shot a fire arrow and all the leaves were burned.

272
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,340
Did you see clearly who shot the arrow?

273
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,060
Because I just arrived at Deep Water not long ago,

274
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,140
I don’t know anyone.

275
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,860
But because I was shocked yesterday, so I fainted.

276
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,950
When I woke up, I was already here.

277
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,920
Is what you said real?

278
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,980
Everything is the truth.

279
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,690
It looks like there’s someone protecting His Majesty secretly.

280
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,160
This is Deep Water Nation’s luck.

281
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,470
It’s also your fortune.

282
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,670
His Majesty thinks you saved him.

283
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,590
He asked me to send you into the palace and become his concubine.

284
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,820
What virtue or capability do I have that—

285
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:03,880
Just remember, you have an overlord’s star’s fate.

286
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,310
You have to deal with big things in the future.

287
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,400
If both of us can collaborate,

288
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,540
that will be the great luck of Deep Water.

289
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,010
Do you understand?

290
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,090
His Majesty?

291
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,420
Prime Minister... Prime Minister, are you really thinking highly of me?

292
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,470
Yes, after you enter the palace,

293
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,680
I’ll make sure that you will become the queen of Deep Water.

294
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,360
But you have to understand that as I recommended you to the palace,

295
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,420
rewards and punishments all depend on me.

296
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,440
It’s my fortune to be able to share Prime Minister’s burdens.

297
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,890
After you enter the palace, I’ll take care of your family on behalf of you.

298
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:42,340
You don’t have to be worry.

299
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,120
Since now, you’ll be my goddaughter.

300
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,840
Yuwen Zi thanks Prime Minister on behalf of my family.

301
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,840
Since now, everything will...

302
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,890
everything will go just as Godfather’s plan.

303
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,090
I’ll order people to teach you about the manners in the palace these few days.

304
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,460
Kid, don’t disappoint me.

305
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,500
I won't.

306
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,070
Stand up.

307
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,960
The Earth Absorbing Bell is back to its rightful owner.

308
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,380
I've also found Xiaoqi.

309
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,030
Why do I need to stay here?

310
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,050
Miss, if you want to run away, I won’t be able to stop you.

311
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:39,940
I just hope that Miss will have some pity.

312
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,260
I would like to ask for your understanding.

313
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,350
Of course, I can’t leave.

314
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,700
If I leave, everyone who served me in this Prime Minister’s Manor

315
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,600
and the ones in Changning Yuwen’s Manor

316
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,080
will not be able to escape from this.

317
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,140
But—

318
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,250
But I can’t stay here just like this either,

319
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,720
and wait for Qi Zhen to send me into the palace.

320
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,130
I assume Miss already has a solution.

321
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,320
It’s okay, you can eat first.

322
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,790
Don't need to wait any more. Fifth Older Brother—

323
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,420
Eat slowly. I-I’ll give you the rice.

324
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,510
Eat slowly. Eat slowly.

325
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,640
There’re enough food here.

326
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,610
Thank you.

327
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,350
You really suffered.

328
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,870
Unexpectedly, you have suffered because of the Earth Absorbing Bell.

329
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,530
Look at you, so skinny.

330
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,430
I was afraid that you wouldn’t endure it.

331
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,730
- I’m okay. The problem is—
- All right. All right.

332
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,060
The problem is Older Sis Fuyao is stuck in Prime Minister’s Manor in order to save me.

333
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,840
So, I need to eat more.

334
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,250
After I’m full, I’ll have energy to save her.

335
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,970
Have you found a way to save her?

336
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,100
Although I was dizzy that time,

337
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,430
I remember the route to the Prime Minister’s Manor clearly.

338
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,180
I’m not talented, but my memory is good.

339
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,030
Don’t worry.

340
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,830
So, do you plan to enter the Prime Minister’s Manor and save her?

341
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,240
I wanted to do that, too.

342
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,100
Let’s do it together! Together! Together! Together!

343
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,140
What were you saying?

344
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:40,100
What can we say? Right?

345
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,650
Fifth Brother, you’re back? You must be hungry.

346
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,710
I’ll fill your bowl with rice.

347
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,980
I’m warning both of you.

348
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,330
Don’t go and create troubles.

349
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,820
Godfather.

350
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,070
How was it?

351
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,660
Prefecture Princess Pei Yuan said that she actually didn’t take anyone away from the water prison.

352
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:17,060
I wanted to ask her a few more questions,

353
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,170
but Prefecture Princess was very angry.

354
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,640
- I can only—
- Absurd.

355
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,860
What does she think my Prime Minister’s Manor is?

356
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,160
Spread the word, without my permission, no one is allowed to let Pei Yuan out of my manor.

357
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,970
Whoever disobeys, kill!

358
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,770
Yes.

359
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,200
I've ordered people to investigate as well.

360
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,580
Prefecture Princess Pei Yuan brought the kid from the water prison to the hunting ground at that time.

361
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,490
But not sure why, she was injured when she returned.

362
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,340
And there’s no news about the kid later.

363
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:52,310
Godfather, do you think that Zhan Beiye has taken the Earth Absorbing Bell back?

364
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,460
I guess the same thing, too.

365
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,840
Zhan Beiye's appearance that day was strange.

366
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,770
He spoke everything against me in front of Xuanyuan Min.

367
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:06,060
I fear that he has known the whereabouts of the Earth Absorbing Bell for a long time.

368
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,660
Never mind. Let’s observe how things will go.

369
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,160
Yes.

370
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
Now that you mention it,

371
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,340
there’s news from the palace.

372
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,100
They said Zhang Henian entered the palace by himself early this morning.

373
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,160
His Majesty summoned him.

374
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,400
- What?
- We are still not sure what they said.

375
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,770
But according to the spy from Marquis Zhang’s Manor who reported to us,

376
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,350
it had something to do with the pay and provisions of the soldiers in the eight garrisons.

377
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,400
Pay and provisions? Did they hear any details?

378
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,840
That... When Zhang Henian entered the palace,

379
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,500
His Majesty had all the servants sent away.

380
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,870
There is no confirmed news from the palace, either.

381
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,300
But, Godfather, don’t be worried, everyone beside His Majesty is our people.

382
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,310
You can just rest assured.

383
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,400
Rest assured?

384
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,690
I have been in the office for thirty-seven years and I've never had a restful day.

385
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,900
What your people saw was everything from the surface.

386
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,540
And what Xuanyuan Min is really thinking. I’m afraid that—

387
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:19,770
we can’t delay His Majesty's marriage anymore.

388
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Godfather, are you really going to use Miss Yuwen as your bet?

389
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:35,600
Stars have ten thousand phenomena, humans have thousands of faces.

390
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,300
How would it be enough if we only have one path?

391
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,580
All right.

392
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,990
We’re choosing concubines for the king.

393
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,570
It’s not a chance for you to earn money.

394
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:06,540
Every contestant’s person, background, age,

395
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,700
birth date, personalities,

396
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,930
every single thing is important.

397
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,070
We can’t be careless.

398
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,430
Look at this. Who is this?

399
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:16,600
Daughter of Jundong County Deputy.

400
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,530
Even such a lowly girl can take part in this?

401
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,480
Go down.

402
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,700
The time is here.

403
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,480
Put them in the storage.

404
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,660
These are the documents of all the selected Elegant Misses.

405
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,560
Among them, there is the candidate for the future queen of Deep Water.

406
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,670
Remember, you must make no mistake.

407
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,380
Yes.

408
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,970
So much kerosene. Where did you get it?

409
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,600
Tonight, there will be a fire here.

410
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,340
I’ll pretend to be a servant and leave.

411
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,190
There will be a burned corpse.

412
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,630
Then there will be a burned corpse in a room at North Park.

413
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,560
Since then, there will be no more Yuwen Zi in this world.

414
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,880
Indeed, Miss is thoughtful.

415
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,800
Even if I’m thoughtful, I still need your help.

416
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,690
Has Miss ever thought of visiting the palace?

417
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:35,260
Maybe it may be interesting there.

418
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,160
Let me go.

419
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,950
Godfather, these are the selected Elegant Misses.

420
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,450
The inner court made selections in advance of today.

421
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:12,350
The final selected Elegant Misses were recorded.

422
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:14,180
They are all here.

423
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:20,360
Qi Zhen is so impatient.

424
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,850
He employed people from the inner court so quickly.

425
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,240
All right.

426
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,400
Then, let’s have a look at the beauties who the Prime Minister has prepared.

427
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,150
State Depuy Lee’s daughter, General Ji’s niece.

428
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:46,260
You wanted to ask me if it’ll be problematic because of her background?

429
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,180
Godfather, you’re smart.

430
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,890
This girl has a good background.

431
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,490
She looks like a good choice,

432
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,890
but putting her onto the name list is only to fawn over her uncle.

433
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:01,700
That's all.

434
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,430
Once she enters the Harem,

435
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:12,340
don’t forget that her grandfather was Heir Apparent Wenyi’s important subordinate.

436
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,130
Heir Apparent Wenyi?

437
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,900
Gao Puruo, Prefect Xiping’s daughter.

438
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,870
Pretty and elegant, just like the Lilium Concolor.

439
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:33,600
Looks like the dawn snow without even applying powders.

440
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,390
Prefect Xiping, this old man,

441
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,690
has some age;

442
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,650
still thinking of multiplying his fief.

443
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,150
He would definitely not keep quiet when it comes to choosing concubines.

444
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,980
Jian Xue, Hanwen Institution’s Jian Sheng’s youngest daughter.

445
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,650
Clear and bright eyes, slim and tiny.

446
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,710
The waist is as...

447
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,820
Was this Jian Sheng Zhang Henian’s student in the past?

448
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,970
Then, Jian Xue is recommended by Marquis Zhang?

449
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,210
Yes, and also no.

450
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,200
Everyone knows Jian Sheng is promoted all the way up by Zhang Henian,

451
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,710
and is thought highly by him.

452
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,700
His daughter is selected as an Elegant Miss now.

453
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:34,230
Everyone would think she’s a chess piece of Zhang Henian.

454
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:38,880
Then, why does Godfather let her pass?

455
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,160
Of course, you don’t know.

456
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:46,430
Jian Sheng has become a chess piece in my hand.

457
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,810
Openly, I need to have my trusted subordinates.

458
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,620
Secretly, I need to have my people as well,

459
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,290
so that I can make sure that nothing will go wrong.

460
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,200
Godfather, you’re smart.

461
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,060
Then, Godfather, who do you want to be the Queen?

462
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,140
This is really a hard decision.

463
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,180
Whether Xuanyuan Min is really ridiculous or faking to be silly,

464
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:19,540
we must not be careless.

465
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,650
Mister, look at it.

466
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,810
Yes?

467
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,520
Mister, look at it.

468
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,360
General, Prefecture Prince, Marquis, Prime Minister,

469
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,120
the background of these Elegant Misses are better one after another.

470
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,640
I’m afraid that there may be countless connections behind them.

471
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,680
The harem is another battlefield for power to start with.

472
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,590
Don’t ever look down on these women's minds that hide under their silk dresses and hairpins.

473
00:36:55,590 --> 00:37:00,370
Sometimes, they will be the sharpest knife.

474
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,030
Mister, the knife you mean is?

475
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,420
I know in my heart which one.

476
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,460
It's just that I can control Deep Water,

477
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,250
but I may not be able to control her.

478
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,820
Mister, you mean is?

479
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,580
I've spoken too much.

480
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,330
East wind is blowing quietly.

481
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,860
There will be a big incident tonight.

482
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,970
Today’s weather is good.

483
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,180
I’ll present a big incident for the Prime Minister’s Manor.

484
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,770
The wind is strong tonight. Once the fire lights up, you just run away during the chaos.

485
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,870
Thank you, girl and your master.

486
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,120
- Hurry up and leave.
- Let's go!

487
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,280
On the fifteenth, the full moon is in the first heavenly stem position.

488
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,750
When I wear the Imperial Dragon Scales robe, bloody moonlight will fill the sky up. (T/N: bloody moonlight = rebellion)

489
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,320
What time is it now?

490
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,510
Fiftenn minutes left before midnight.

491
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,860
I’ve checked on the route to Imperial Qilin Stage.

492
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,390
Everything is fine. Mister can depart anytime.

493
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,000
Help! Someone please help! There’s a fire!

494
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,230
Someone. Someone please come quickly! There’s a fire!

495
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,390
Someone please come quickly! There’s a fire!

496
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,270
Someone please come quickly. Put out the fire.

497
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,840
Quickly put out the fire!

498
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,980
There is still such a mysterious and sophisticated thing in this world.

499
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,590
Heaven treated people well.

500
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:36,800
This Dragon Scale Armor is one of the four wonders of Five Regions.

501
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,810
There’s a rumor that says that after a battle in the heavens a long time ago, God surrendered four mythical beasts.

502
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:44,450
Then, in order to protect these hard-earned halcyon days,

503
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,720
he left four utterly precious wonders.

504
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,690
But, Mister, what exactly is this Dragon Scale Armor?

505
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:58,690
To many people, the Dragon Scale Armor is their everything.

506
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,490
Everyone wants to be strong and be free of all kinds of diseases and ailments.

507
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,470
These can all be done by Dragon Scale Armor.

508
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,920
No wonder people could do anything to get this Dragon Scale Armor for the past thousands years

509
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,170
and are willing to lose their lives.

510
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,560
Even the mighty Heir Apparent Wenyi couldn’t be spared.

511
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,960
I remember that a folk rumor in Deep Water that Heir Apparent Wenyi privately hid the Dragon Scale Armor

512
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,450
and was greedy over the throne; that’s why he was killed.

513
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:26,050
He, himself. even carried eternal infamy.

514
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:29,410
But there were also people saying that Heir Apparent Wenyi's high merits scared His Majesty.

515
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,780
It caused King Xuanyuan at that time to be jealous and suspicious,

516
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,620
so he made up a reason to frame him and kill him.

517
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,230
There are always a lot of sayings about this royal family’s secret.

518
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,000
Fifteen years has passed.

519
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,490
Who knows which is the truth?

520
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:50,690
Beside those who experienced it that time, no one else cared about it.

521
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,590
But... even people have forgotten about it,

522
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,600
the truth is always the truth.

523
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,110
There’s an assassin!

524
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,800
Quickly catch the assassin!

525
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,520
Hurry up and catch him!

526
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,400
Hurry up!

527
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:19,830
Hurry up!

528
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,770
Separate ourselves and search!

529
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,980
Few of you, go there!

530
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,220
Search carefully!

531
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,150
- It's me!
-  Hurry up!

532
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,970
This way!

533
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,440
Go and check there!

534
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,800
Search carefully!

535
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,460
Follow me!

536
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,380
Don’t let the assassin escape!

537
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,400
Hurry up!

538
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,420
- Where are we going?
- We can't delay. Leave quickly.

539
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,070
Okay.

540
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,100
Over there!

541
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:23,900
Fuyao!

542
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,580

♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫
