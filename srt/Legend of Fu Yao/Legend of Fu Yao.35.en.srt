00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,400
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,400
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,300
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,200
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,400
~ Episode 35 ~

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Official! The one in front is already Yao City.

23
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,600
The sky is about to go dark and that's when bugleweeds are most abundant.

24
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,900
I'll go look in the cliff over there. You all just stay here and wait for me.

25
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,800
Okay. Let's rest here and recondition ourselves for a while.

26
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Xiaoqi, quickly bring the water!

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,700
Okay.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,700
Here.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
Girl.

30
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
I once hoped...

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
that since we're fated to have a doomed love,

32
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,490
I'll guard by your side...

33
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,030
and fight destiny's arrangement with you.

34
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:21,400
I initially thought that I could get everything ready and live the rest of our lives in peace.

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,300
But I was too arrogant.

36
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,200
If I didn't fool you that I was Yuan Zhaoxu when we reunited...

37
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,900
I didn't tell you that I'm the Crown Prince of Megrez.

38
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,200
You are the Crown Prince? You—

39
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,900
His aide. I'm Yuan Zhaoxu.

40
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:53,100
If I didn't ask Zong Yue to hide this matter from you,

41
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,900
if I could have been more vigilant,

42
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,970
things might not have ended up like this today.

43
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,900
Liar.

44
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,720
Nothing you say is ever true.

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,240
I will never believe you again.

46
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,500
You liar!

47
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,900
Girl...

48
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,400
You're right.

49
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,800
I am a liar.

50
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
You suffered great pains because of me.

51
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,190
I beg you.

52
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,700
I beg you to wake up.

53
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,200
As long as you're able to wake up,

54
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,300
no matter if you hit or scold me,

55
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,760
I'll be happy to endure them.

56
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,200
As long as you wake up,

57
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,790
I will surely give you an explanation.

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Xiaoqi, come over here.

59
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,800
Mr. Zong, you're back!

60
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
How did it go? Did you find the herbs?

61
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,800
Do you want to save Fuyao?

62
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,230
Of course, I do!

63
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,600
Are you still a virgin?

64
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,700
Why are you asking that?

65
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,400
- Hold this.
- Okay.

66
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
- Give me your hand.
- Why?

67
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
Give me your hand.

68
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Zong, what are you doing?

69
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200
Do you want to help Fuyao or not?

70
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Of course, I do.

71
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
Lessen your nonsense then.

72
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,600
Zong Yue! No, Mr. Zong, I'll faint when I see blood.

73
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,500
Don't move!

74
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Mr. Zong, I really will faint.

75
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
Xiaoqi, come over here!

76
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,500
Crown Prince, think of a way.

77
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,300
Use mine.

78
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,300
Divide this bugleweed into 7 portions and make Fuyao drink them every 6 hours.

79
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,400
Mister Zong, after drinking that, Older Sis Fuyao will get better. Right?

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,800
Although this bugleweed is mystical, it can only provide temporary relief.

81
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
To completely cure her,

82
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,500
we must find that Divine Starlight Physician, Fang Yimo.

83
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
I saw a royal pigeon flying by earlier.

84
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,200
Are there changes happening in Megrez?

85
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I openly disobeyed Emperor Father's orders.

86
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,200
It's expected for Emperor Father to be very mad.

87
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Empress Mother now has sent out a huge army to find me.

88
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,000
She wants me to immediately return to the Royal Palace and apologize to Emperor Father.

89
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,900
I fear that it won't be as easy as apologizing.

90
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,700
Empress Yuan's rushing you to return must be because she wants your marriage finalized,

91
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,300
so you can firmly stay in your Crown Prince position.

92
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,000
You are the Crown Prince of Megrez.

93
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,300
The orders of your parents and the suggestions of a matchmaker aren't something that can be disregarded that easily.

94
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,600
That is not what I'm worrying the most about.

95
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,880
It's just a minor matter to get punished.

96
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,500
I just fear that Emperor Father will not let her off anymore.

97
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,800
Only by my returning can I ensure everyone's safety.

98
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
Moreover, Folian is still in the palace right now.

99
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,460
Why did Fuyao pretend to be her?

100
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,900
I must investigate that matter clearly.

101
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,710
I will not let anyone who hurt her go.

102
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,700
Don't worry.

103
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,990
You have me here.

104
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,200
Fuyao will be all right.

105
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,600
Girl, believe me.

106
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,500
We'll surely find a better way.

107
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Wuji is about to return.

108
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,600
Just stay here in the palace for a few more days.

109
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Thank you, Empress, for your care.

110
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,400
But it will take some days for Crown Prince to return.

111
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,020
I just happened to see some refugees arriving in the city.

112
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,400
I want to go help them.

113
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,500
It's rare that you have such a kind heart.

114
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,800
Okay then. As long as you stay here in the Imperial city, I'm at ease.

115
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,900
Your marriage with Wuji...

116
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,520
indeed should be finalized.

117
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,570
Mr. Zong, we've been here in Yao City for so many days.

118
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,990
How come Older Sis Fuyao is still not waking up?

119
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,330
Her poison was too strong. Bugleweed is half a medicine and half a poison.

120
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,180
One can't easily wake up from it like normal people do.

121
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,770
What? What should we do then?

122
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,960
Will Older Sis Fuyao not wake up anymore?

123
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,800
Mr. Zong, it's not that I don't believe you.

124
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,390
- I'm just a bit worried.
- Have you brought everything?
- Yes, I have. Let's quickly leave.

125
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,100
Don't worry. In this trip, I'm going to meticulously choose some supplements for Fuyao.

126
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,750
In a few days, she will naturally wake up.

127
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,680
Mister Zong, if you have any errands to do, just instruct me.

128
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,970
Although I'm not that smart, I will surely fulfill any task you give me.

129
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,350
Mother, let's leave quickly.

130
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,160
If we still don't, it will be too late.

131
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,640
- Our house is gone again.
- Mother.
- Auntie...

132
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,550
Sorry to bother you. May I ask what's going on?

133
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,770
- You must be an outsider, right?
- Right.

134
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,200
Quickly leave.

135
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,020
This Yao City isn't livable anymore.

136
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,140
- Why?
- That's right.

137
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,760
It's because of the Black Tribe Gang.

138
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,830
- Black Tribe Gang?
- Yes.

139
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,720
Black Tribe Gang has annihilated several villages.

140
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,640
Everyone is saying that soon they will be attacking Yao City.

141
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,460
This will soon become their lair.

142
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,970
No matter how remote Yao City is, it's still within the territory of Megrez Imperial City.

143
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,560
How could they dare to be so bold?

144
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,740
Within the territory of Megrez Imperial City?

145
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,550
Even if the Lord Emperor comes, it's of no use.

146
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,780
This Black Tribe Gang will go steal anything they lack.

147
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,460
In this place where there are barren hills and turbulent rivers,

148
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,750
the Black Tribe Gang sets up their foundation here.

149
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,920
Counting it, it has been several hundred years.

150
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,330
An army to put them down has been sent thirteen times during this period.

151
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,780
In seven of them, they claimed that they were already completely obliterated.

152
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,820
But in the end, what?

153
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,100
- Weren't they still back from the ashes?
- That's right.

154
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,770
The bandits are rampant and doing evil everywhere.

155
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,590
Isn't your Yao City Magistrate doing anything?

156
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,440
That Magistrate Su and the Black Tribe Gang are in collusion.

157
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,800
As long as they don't disturb their Su's Manor, that old man will not meddle in this matter.

158
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,450
Look at Yao City now.

159
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,250
What kind of life are the citizens living?

160
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,500
Stop talking. Let's quickly leave.

161
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Hurry up. Let's quickly leave.

162
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:43,380
Your Majesty, no matter how angry you are,

163
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,290
you still have to take care of your health.

164
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,370
Your Majesty.

165
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,830
Let me do it.

166
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,170
Your Highness Crown Prince, you're finally back.

167
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,850
Quickly convince His Majesty.

168
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,710
He hasn't eaten for so many days.

169
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,870
I am unfilial.

170
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,610
May Father punish me.

171
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,330
Punishing you is to make you realize your mistake,

172
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:55,210
but you totally don't know what you did wrong.

173
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,940
Before, even if you were unwilling,

174
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,530
you would never disobey me.

175
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,680
But now,

176
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,570
I fear that there isn't a Lord Emperor in your heart anymore.

177
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,180
In my heart, Emperor Father has always been the supreme

178
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,330
and venerated holy ruler of the Five Regions.

179
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,760
I also never had any thoughts of being disloyal or unfilial.

180
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,440
Haven't you done it?

181
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,380
You already fought your way out of Upper Yang Palace.

182
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,380
What else can you not dare to do?

183
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,250
Emperor Father, please calm down.

184
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,050
Since I started to remember, I was raised by my wet nurse.

185
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,480
The servants around me saw me as their master.

186
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,930
They dared not go beyond any limits.

187
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,990
Emperor Father has an imposing bearing.

188
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,500
Empress Mother distanced herself from me.

189
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,670
Older Brother and I had a barrier between us.

190
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,140
People with the same age as me just treated me as the Crown Prince.

191
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,590
It was hard to have any bosom friend.

192
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,190
People in this world only saw how honorable my identity was,

193
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,540
but they didn't know the lonesomeness of not being allowed to make any mistakes.

194
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,230
But Fuyao is different from all the ladies I've seen.

195
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,960
She's arrogant and unyielding.

196
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,910
She is smart and chivalrous.

197
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,110
I have never seen a person like that.

198
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,370
She's like another me that walked out of my heart.

199
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,250
Emperor Father...

200
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,900
I never thought of disobeying you because of her.

201
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:15,140
The more I never thought of giving up my future because of her.

202
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,600
But when I learned that you were having her executed,

203
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,770
I then realized that I can't lose her.

204
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,450
This is a love that I never experienced.

205
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,670
Emperor Father, you're right.

206
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:47,390
Love is indeed a sharp blade that can harm oneself.

207
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,520
But love made me become a person with heart and flesh.

208
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,560
For so many years, it was my first time feeling...

209
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,730
that seeing a person and being with her is this full of joy.

210
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,300
I never had anticipated for eternity...

211
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,060
by this much.

212
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:22,520
Emperor Father, I disappointed your trust!

213
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,370
I'm willing to accept any punishment!

214
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,780
But I beg you to let Fuyao go!

215
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,960
Even if you will lose the Crown Prince position?

216
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,930
Even if I will lose the Crown Prince position.

217
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,770
You're now a grown up.

218
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,100
Just do as you wish.

219
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,410
Princess Folian.

220
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,340
Crown Prince Wuji asks to see you.

221
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,850
Wuji?

222
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,740
It's you.

223
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,830
I just knew that you'd come to see me.

224
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,000
In your heart, you still have me for sure.

225
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,220
I heard a folk story recently.

226
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,130
I want to share it with you.

227
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,150
I like anything that you say.

228
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:52,380
This story talks about a girl who got lucky and obtained a precious treasure.

229
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,260
It's an anti-poison bead.

230
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,120
With this bead, she will never get sick or poisoned.

231
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,510
This girl then thought, "Since I'm different from others, why don't I do something more brilliant?"

232
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,680
Guess what she did.

233
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,180
She learned a witchcraft that can spread a deadly plague.

234
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,980
But she has that precious item.

235
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,800
No matter how deadly the plague is, it won't affect her.

236
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,660
From then on, she traveled the Five Regions to do good deeds.

237
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,890
People really treated her as a kindhearted Bodhisattva.

238
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,040
Coincidentally, I know this person.

239
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,570
Just to become a lotus-like holy and pure lady,

240
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,430
she always first committed a monstrously evil act and then pretended to practice good deeds.

241
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,610
People instead treated her as a live Bodhisattva.

242
00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:00,370
But I know how cruel and evil her heart truly is.

243
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:07,120
In this world, is there really such a sinister person?

244
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,800
It was also an eye-opener for me.

245
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,020
If I get the chance to meet this person,

246
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,170
I will surely give her proper guidance.

247
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,420
Since in this richly ornamented room,

248
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,510
someone is unwilling to face her true self in the mirror.

249
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,560
Fine then. Why don't we change to another venue?

250
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,170
Maybe you'll be more awake there.

251
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,580
Wuji, what are you doing?

252
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,590
Carefully look at it yourself.

253
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,330
Palaces and temples, thatched cottages and humble homes,

254
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,000
aren't these all mere worldly possessions which you can't bring along either at birth or at death.

255
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,320
There is Heaven and Earth.

256
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,650
There is this absolutely sincere heart of mine.

257
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:06,400
With these, what else must I fear?

258
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,290
You're indeed very correct.

259
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,810
I won't disturb your private meditation then.

260
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,990
Since you left, Fuyao persisted in taking her medicines and has greatly improved.

261
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,030
In a few days, she will be able to normally ambulate.

262
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,050
She will be exactly the same as how she was before she got poisoned.

263
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,600
It's just that the bugleweed is both a cure and a poison.

264
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,970
Although it can temporarily suppress,

265
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,760
to ensure that Fuyao is completely rid of it and her life won't get endangered,

266
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,970
we still need the unique antidote of Divine Physician Starlight.

267
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,690
Prince Assist surely has one or two of it. You must get it.

268
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,170
A few days ago, I asked someone outside the palace to buy me a lot of foundation and lipstick.

269
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,300
- Really?
- Right.

270
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,300
How dare you?

271
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,190
- You dare laugh at me?
- We dare not...

272
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,630
You dare to laugh at me?

273
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,420
Try laughing—

274
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,190
Who is it?

275
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,070
Wuji?

276
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,180
Rise first and leave.

277
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,990
Why are you venting your anger on the maidservents?

278
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,510
Maidservants?

279
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,760
I just have to vent my anger on them.

280
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,340
Do you know why?

281
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,560
It's because your girl harmed and destroyed me!

282
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,210
Harmed you where?

283
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:50,270
Destroyed you where?

284
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,360
You want to give it a try? I've died once.

285
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,790
I'm not afraid of death anymore!

286
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,810
Not afraid of death, is that it?

287
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,200
The Emperor has a decree.

288
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,530
Summon Crown Prince and Prince Assist for an audience.

289
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,460
The matter has passed.

290
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,290
But Wuji, you still won't stop.

291
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,440
You two are brothers with the same blood.

292
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,630
Pingrong has also suffered because of it, but you are still unforgiving.

293
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,480
It's not worth it, right?

294
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,770
Of course, I understand that all my actions are not worth it.

295
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,400
Even if there is any enmity between us brothers,

296
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,260
outsiders mustn't know about it.

297
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,570
Because Emperor Father said that reputation is the most important in the royal clan.

298
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,030
Hence, these past years, I've covered up older brother's ugly activities.

299
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,060
For example, raping female commoners, land grabbing and stationing of troops without permission.

300
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,360
Another example, conniving with the Black Tribe Gang and selling the nation for private gains.

301
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,570
Continue saying it.

302
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,640
Wuji...

303
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,740
Can you be obedient? You're still not fully recovered, so why did you sneak out again?

304
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,170
You're making us worry.

305
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,870
I'm about to have bed ulcers from staying in bed for too long.

306
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,770
Do you plan to take care of me for the rest of my life then?

307
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:23,940
But Mister Zong already said that you can't get blown by the wind, catch a cold, and get extremely angry.

308
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,510
- The more you can't be here getting blown by dust—
- Stop saying it.

309
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,690
You kept saying, "Mr. Zong, Mr. Zong."

310
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,430
Have you been with him for too long?

311
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,980
From now on, will you be talking weirdly like this?

312
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,970
I will not be like him.

313
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,590
Older Sis Fuyao, look over there. Isn't the village on fire?

314
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,070
Could it be those bandits again?

315
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,690
Hey, where are you going? Don't go. It's dangerous.

316
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,870
Wait for me!

317
00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:01,240
A few months ago, Emperor Father sent Prince Assist's army to South Border to annihilate the bandits.

318
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,910
In less than 10 days, a victory report came saying that the First Royal Son

319
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,950
was so valiant and mighty that he was able to suppress the Black Tribe Gang.

320
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,290
But from what I know, it wasn't like that.

321
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,450
Prince Assist and the head of Black Tribe Gang, Chigui, made a treaty

322
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,730
that in exchange of a thousand liang of gold and silver, 30,000 pieces of armor and swords

323
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,870
for the peace for half a year in the South Border.

324
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,480
In this half year,

325
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,130
Black Tribe Gang guaranteed to not attack any territory of Megrez.

326
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,570
But they didn't agree to not attack and loot the local area.

327
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:35,190
Now, I fear that the citizens of South Border are in the midst of an abyss of suffering.

328
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,600
Kill them all!

329
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,310
South Border is a border territory.

330
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:42,490
Since the Black Tribe Gang has flourished, wars there haven't stopped in these past one hundred years.

331
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,840
It has become a lawless place.

332
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,090
At an extremely harsh place like that,

333
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,970
it's not easy to survive already.

334
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,800
If an elite and strong group of bandits like that will be using the military equipment of the Imperial city

335
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,310
- to commit heinous crimes and prey on the citizens,
- Mother...

336
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:00,390
who else can provide justice for the citizens?

337
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,260
Who can care about their lives?

338
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,290
This move by Prince Assist may look wise.

339
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,350
One, he was able to maintain his reputation with a victorious return from battle.

340
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:21,970
Secondly, he was able to ask for a half year of peace in exchange for assistance.

341
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,530
Third, he and the leader Chigui made a pact

342
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:29,790
that if he ever tried to usurp the throne one day,

343
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,950
Black Tribe Gang would surely do their best to help him.

344
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,500
Where did you hear those?

345
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,250
Why do you make a false charge against me in front of Emperor Father?

346
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,750
Traitor!

347
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,010
Privately transporting military armor.

348
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,510
Harboring criminals.

349
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,520
You abandoned the lives of the citizens of South Border.

350
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,930
Your Highness, is this deal of yours quite a good bargain?

351
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,390
Is there really such a thing?

352
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,240
Emperor Father, I'm innocent!

353
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,550
Even if I'm that bold,

354
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,760
I dare not collude with the bandits.

355
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,150
May Emperor Father investigate it clearly!

356
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,130
Continue saying it.

357
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,910
This matter isn't just an internal affair of the royal clan anymore.

358
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,610
It concerns the crucial interest of Megrez Empire.

359
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,270
I earnestly ask Emperor Father to let me personally go to South Border and investigate this matter clearly.

360
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,870
Investigate it.

361
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,560
If First Royal Son is really involved in this matter,

362
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,880
for fairness, may I ask Emperor Father to allow me to commit Prince Assist for trial?

363
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,960
I will allow it.

364
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:43,670
Pingrong, for your stupidity, I can endure it.

365
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:49,040
For your arrogance, extravagance, and womanizing behaviors, I also tolerated them.

366
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,480
Betraying your country and conniving with the enemy?

367
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,340
I will not tolerate it!

368
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,290
Emperor Father.

369
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,230
Endure it a little.

370
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,130
Don't be afraid.

371
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,380
I came to help you.

372
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,400
Let me do it.

373
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,600
Don't be afraid. Let me help you.

374
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,560
Let me help you.

375
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,260
Don't be afraid... Come...

376
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,110
This Black Tribe Gang has been bullying us for so long.

377
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,030
Even if there are hundreds of people in our village,

378
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,170
not one dared to say a word about it.

379
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,900
If this continues, how are we still going to live in this village?

380
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:02,300
That's right. The village butcher killed one bandit.

381
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,760
Don't know when they'll be back to seek revenge.

382
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,250
If you can endure it, just do.

383
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,710
At most, we'll just suffer some losses.

384
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,080
If we go against them, none of us can rival with them.

385
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,660
That's right.

386
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:16,060
The more you grin and bear it like this, the more they will keep on bullying you.

387
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,210
Miss, there's something that you don't know.

388
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,230
Here in Yao City, the officials and bandits have colluded.

389
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,600
The evildoers can do whatever they want.

390
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,390
It's been lawless here for such a long time.

391
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:28,760
What's most important is for us to survive.

392
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,020
No law?

393
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,710
That's bad, indeed.

394
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,380
Wait here.

395
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,780
Hey, where are you going?

396
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:44,120
That bastard inside Yao City's local government office has been working against his mandate.

397
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,780
- I must go look and get us some justice.
- Hey! You...

398
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,900
Miss, you mustn't go!

399
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Fuyao!

400
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,000
Older Sis Fuyao, it's already so late.

401
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,530
People are definitely not going to care about you.

402
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,050
Let's hurry and go back. Okay?

403
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,880
Don't think I don't know.

404
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,610
You're making yourself look like some top that kept spinning,

405
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:11,970
all because you don't want to have the time to think about Crown Prince Wuji.

406
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,350
What are you talking about?

407
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,140
If you're not willing to wait then you can leave first.

408
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:17,640
I know that you're lying.

409
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,190
But the more you're like this, the more I can't leave. I must keep you company here.

410
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,150
- I don't want you to keep me company.
- I'm going to keep you company then.

411
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:27,620
Who is it?

412
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,550
It's in the middle of the night. Why are you drumming?

413
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,160
If you disturb our old master's sleep, you will surely suffer.

414
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,400
Where is your magistrate?

415
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,240
Official Su is asleep.

416
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,470
Hurry and get lost.

417
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,430
Quickly go and inform him! Or else, I'll trash your office!

418
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,730
No need to make a report.

419
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,010
Who is it?

420
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:56,810
You're so bold to insult the might of my office.

421
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,110
Are you treating my Megrez government as nothing?

422
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,780
You're the county magistrate?

423
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,560
Sorry for being disrespectful.

424
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,090
You know now to apologize for being disrespectful.

425
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:12,130
But I will not drop your crime of disturbing me just because of those words.

426
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,540
Tie her up for public viewing for three days.

427
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,710
Let this wicked citizen see the consequences of having no sense of propriety. Arrest her.

428
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,120
You are getting paid with government salary, but you bully and oppress the citizens.

429
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,550
What punishment should you receive?

430
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:25,530
You dare insult and scold me? Arrest her!

431
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,990
Hold up.

432
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,670
Official Su, I fear that you can't casually tie this person up.

433
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,210
Who do you think you are that you can instruct me on what to do?

434
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:38,790
Arrest him, too!

435
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,590
A personal bodyguard from Crown Prince's Upper Yang Palace coming here to Yao City.

436
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,190
Why didn't you inform us beforehand?

437
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,820
I really didn't know.

438
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,480
Sorry for being rude and offensive.

439
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,270
If there is anything, just tell her.

440
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,290
I'm just going to sit here and listen.

441
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,010
If needed, of course, I will truthfully report it to the Upper Yang Palace.

442
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,660
No need to be courteous.

443
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,950
It's not the time to be courteous right now.

444
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,230
Let me ask you this. The Black Tribe Gang is committing heinous crimes and is doing all kinds of evil.

445
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,510
Are you just going to watch and do nothing?

446
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,710
This... This...

447
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,210
The Black Tribe Gang is overwhelming in number and strength.

448
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,810
They are strong and valiant.

449
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,650
They also have heavy armor.

450
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,150
It's not wise to provoke them.

451
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,470
We should think of a way to stave it off.

452
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,040
Stave off?

453
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,850
You can still be like a coward turtle and stave it off here.

454
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,590
If they put a knife on your neck, can you still stave it off?

455
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:39,090
Seeing how the catastrophe is upon you, the citizens will soon fall into great misery.

456
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,090
As a human, how could you keep a blind eye?

457
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,860
As the local official of Yao City, how could you sleep soundly?

458
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,570
This... I'm already old.

459
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:54,110
If I'm able to contribute even a measly effort, I'm willing to risk my life for it. (sarcastically)

460
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,470
Official! Official...

461
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,250
What's the matter? Say it.

462
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,660
Say it. Hurry and say it.

463
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,130
Black Tribe Gang attacked Water Deal Village overnight.

464
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,420
- Where are you going?
- What are you doing?

465
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,150
I'm going to go look for them. Let me go!

466
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,690
- I want to save them!
- Fuyao, calm down.

467
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,470
What we should do now is think of a way to completely eliminate them.

468
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:19,330
The more you're rash, the more you're bringing the villagers a fatal disaster.

469
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,860
I'm been in office for so many years.

470
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,010
I was a coward and I helped the tyrants with their evil deeds.

471
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:39,260
I really have disappointed the sacred graces of Megrez and the citizens of Yao City.

472
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,730
Now, the special envoy of Megrez Imperial City has come.

473
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:49,710
From now on, any affairs of Yao City will be decided upon by the special envoy.

474
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,310
There is such a thing?

475
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,680
Official, what medicine did you give me?

476
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,870
If in three days, Official Su doesn't get any antidote, you'll be accompanying the citizens of Water Deal Village in their journey.

477
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,330
Speak. Are you going to send the soldiers or not?

478
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,550
Official, spare me. I can't disobey the orders.

479
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:15,040
We don't have enough army strength. We're not their competition.

480
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,580
That Black Tribe Gang is within the jurisdiction of Megrez.

481
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,210
Their whole gang should have been naturalized and registered.

482
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,430
Every year, they only have to pay taxes and grains for war needs, and never run amuck.

483
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:24,370
But now, not only did you not control them, you are even harboring them.

484
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,040
Are you not afraid that I will report this to the Megrez Emperor and let you get executed?

485
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,330
My talents are lacking and weak.

486
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,120
I'm willing to let a more able person to take over my position.

487
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,490
Please spare my life.

488
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,090
Why has our magistrate changed?

489
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,210
Yes. Yes.

490
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,590
Who is this person?

491
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,870
In the future, as long as I am here, no one can bully you guys.

492
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,390
Yao City's sky is your sky.

493
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:07,170
Yao City's land is your land.

494
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,440
Whoever dares to bully you all, I will surely make him pay double the price!

495
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,010
Good!

496
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,630
Take a good look.

497
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,970
"Folian...

498
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,680
was not kind and virtuous.

499
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,290
She has brought shame to the ancestors of the Five Regions.

500
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,470
She has brought shame to the several generations of ancestors of Xuanji.

501
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,470
Now is an unusual time.

502
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm willingly canceling...

503
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,030
my marital engagement with the Crown Prince of Megrez?"

504
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:36,540
Since that year that you came to Plough,

505
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:46,410
my heart only has Your Highness.

506
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:53,020
This kind of yearning is way firmer than you can imagine.

507
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:59,040
Even if you easily believed those... those slanderous lies of others,

508
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:07,870
insist on looking at me as some heartless, ruthless, and immoral person,

509
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:13,410
my conscience is clear,

510
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:16,640
and I'm not willing to just casually give up.

511
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,840
Wuji,

512
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,410
I won't give up on this engagement.

513
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,280
Oh?

514
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,310
Are you leaving again?

515
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,010
I just want you to meet someone.

516
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,600
Say it.

517
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,730
