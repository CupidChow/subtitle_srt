00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,400
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,300
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,900
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
~ Episode 60 ~

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,800
With the dignity of being the Empress, I beg you.

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,000
Empress, you must not!

24
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,500
Promise me, okay?

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,000
After all... After all, this will be Wuji's choice.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,700
I can't hinder him making his choice.

27
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
Even if his choice is wrong?

28
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,400
Even if his choice is wrong!

29
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,240
I think that Wuji knows more than you and I that

30
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,880
there are a lot of things in this world that you can't judge based on right or wrong,

31
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,000
but only via pros and cons.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,600
Hence, I can't interfere with his decision.

33
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,300
Sorry.

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,800
But do you know that there are some things that are destined to be wrong once you do it?

35
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,300
For this matter, he can't do wrong.

36
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,000
Empress, what's right or wrong has always been decided by you people.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
You've been making the decisions for him.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,600
Molding him according to the direction that you want.

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,800
Never asking him if he felt any pain, if he was willing.

40
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,300
Wuji is the most clear-headed and most responsible person that I know.

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,800
Every decision that he makes must be based on his own reasons.

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,400
Hence... Hence, I won't interfere with his decision.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
But do you know that only on this matter,

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,900
he really can't commit a mistake?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,700
What really is the reason?

46
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,400
Because...

47
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,070
Empress,

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,400
even if Wuji will indeed commit a mistake, I will bear the consequences with him.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,400
What he needs isn't a strategist but a companion.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,500
Hence... sorry.

51
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,120
Fuyao!

52
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,800
When did you come?

53
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,810
Enough for me to hear all of it.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,060
Thank you for understanding me.

55
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,740
Go and see your Empress Mother.

56
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,740
- I'll wait for you here.
- Yes.

57
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,040
Empress Mother.

58
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,430
Ji'er...

59
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,600
You've gotten thinner.

60
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
You're the one who has gotten thinner.

62
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,140
Emperor Father said that you've been praying in the temple for me these past days.

63
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,580
I've let Empress Mother worry.

64
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,380
I am unfilial.

65
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Quickly rise, my child.

66
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,800
It's just right for a mother to worry about her son.

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Have you been well in this journey?

68
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,700
I'm very well.

69
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,100
When they said... that you'd died in the desert,

70
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,800
I didn't believe it.

71
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,200
In this life, in this deep palace,

72
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,500
only you are my only worry.

73
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
If you're gone,

74
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,200
what's still the meaning of the long years I've endured here in this palace?

75
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
For letting Empress Mother worry,

76
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,440
I deserve to be punished with death.

77
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
Ji'er,

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,300
you will probably be staying a bit longer in the palace this time, right?

79
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,000
There is a lot that has happened in the imperial court.

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,200
I temporarily can't fulfill my filial duties by your side.

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Is this about Prince Virtue inciting a rebellion?

82
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,300
- Your Emperor Father wants—
- All these are court matters.

83
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,460
Empress Mother shouldn't get overly worried about it.

84
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,200
What if I beg you? I beg you don't—

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800
Empress Mother!

86
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:32,900
There are some things that shouldn't and need not be mentioned.

87
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,530
I know how to properly handle it.

88
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,000
May Empress Mother understand.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,600
- But—
- No buts.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,860
I always keep in mind my position as the crown prince and place the nation first.

91
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,800
May Empress Mother not worry.

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,900
No one can waver my determination of punishing the rebels.

93
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,630
It's already late.

94
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,000
May Empress Mother rest early.

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
I'll take my leave.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,100
No. Wuji!

97
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,800
If I tell you...

98
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,780
that he is...

99
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,100
that he is...

100
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,480
that he is...

101
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,700
- your—
- Greetings, Your Ladyship Empress!

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,800
His Majesty said that Your Ladyship will surely be very happy in reuniting with Crown Prince after a long time.

103
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,000
However, this kind of emotional fluctuation might harm your health.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,300
He especially ordered me to deliver a calming soup.

105
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,660
Empress Mother, take care of your body.

106
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,560
I'll take my leave.

107
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,280
I'll take my leave.

108
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,100
No!

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,900
Bodhisattva!

110
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Is it because I committed too many sins?

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,700
I beg you, Bodhisattva.

112
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,500
Don't let my Ji'er go to war.

113
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,800
No.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,370
I've let Prince Assist wait for too long.

115
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,500
Come, drink some tea to cool down.

116
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,390
Just for this tea, I've painstakingly waited for two hours.

117
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,000
I've been in my tent discussing some important military matters.

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Those are all grand matters that concern life and death.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,600
I can't disregard it.

120
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,600
I risked my life and brought 80,000 elite men to reinforce Royal Uncle,

121
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,800
but you instead deliberately neglected me

122
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,200
and embarrassed me in front the whole army.

123
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
By doing that,

124
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,400
aren't you afraid that I'll withdraw my army and put you in a difficult spot?

125
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,960
Don't forget.

126
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,400
You now have no retreat path.

127
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,760
Prince Assist, you've said it too seriously.

128
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,200
At present, there are so many people without a retreat path.

129
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,730
I fear that you are one of them.

130
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,000
You!

131
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,220
It's not my intention to belittle the people that you've brought.

132
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,030
It's just that we haven't started the war yet,

133
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:37,870
but only 60,000 men are left from your 80,000 army.

134
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,830
The change in number is really too great.

135
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:44,700
Since that's the case, why don't you just tie me up?

136
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,280
Use me to force the Imperial City to withdraw their army.

137
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,890
That is indeed a good strategy if we've reached the end of the rope.

138
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,910
You!

139
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:00,670
It's just that you've also lost the value of being a hostage now.

140
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,200
You devised many means to kill Wuji

141
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,900
and even harmed the person he wanted to protect.

142
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,060
Do you think that Wuji will withdraw his army just to save you?

143
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:20,650
As for that emperor of ours, I fear that what he cares about is only himself.

144
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:24,040
Do you think that the person Wuji hates is only me?

145
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,960
I fear that the person he hates the most is you.

146
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,400
Don't think that you're able to hide your affair with the mistress of Pure Mist Palace Hall so perfectly.

147
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,630
Let me tell you too that in the palace, there isn't a wall where gossip couldn't pass through.

148
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,190
I'm just reminding Royal Uncle...

149
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,720
to not be fainthearted and hesitate.

150
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,620
Since I've decided to rebel, there then won't be any room to be fainthearted.

151
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,730
Yes.

152
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,350
I indeed rebel because of that person in Pure Mist Palace Hall.

153
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,140
But if one day, I really have to face Crown Prince in the battlefield,

154
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,330
I will surely not be lenient, either.

155
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,720
You make it sound so pleasant.

156
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,100
But if you really kill her son,

157
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,910
aren't you afraid that she'll hate you forever?

158
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,590
Let her hate me then.

159
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,580
As long as she's by my side,

160
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,080
she'll eventually forget it.

161
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:45,420
In this world, it's impossible to have everything both ways.

162
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,710
In between you dying and I living,

163
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,430
there has always been just one choice.

164
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,190
Okay!

165
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,290
If Royal Uncle can really do what you said,

166
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,590
I'm willing to be at your beck and call.

167
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,690
Sure.

168
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,070
It's good that Prince Assist can be a sensible person.

169
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,800
Then regarding our initial arrangement in the palace,

170
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,490
it's time for them to make their move.

171
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,760
Your Majesty, your medicine is here.

172
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,960
Did they go there already?

173
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,040
Your Majesty, everything has been prepared.

174
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,970
Okay.

175
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,060
Okay.

176
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,390
Your Ladyship Empress, please come with us.

177
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,830
Was it he who told you people to fetch me?

178
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,940
How dare you!

179
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,390
You were not sent by him.

180
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,420
Capture the assassins!

181
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,380
Let's go.

182
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,060
Stop!

183
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,110
Let them leave.

184
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,710
I find this matter strange.

185
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,900
Are you talking about Prince Virtue's rebellion?

186
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,830
These past years, Prince Virtue has been careful and cautious.

187
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,300
He was able to handle internal and external affairs appropriately without any notable lapses.

188
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,410
For a person like that, if he doesn't have full confidence that he'll win, how could he suddenly rebel?

189
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,760
Why then, at this time, did he set up camp on the north bank of the river and isn't making any move?

190
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,130
Your Highness, I heard that assassins have appeared in the palace.

191
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,720
I just don't know the exact situation yet.

192
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,340
- Go and investigate it.
 - Yes.

193
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,570
Your Highness! Your Highness!

194
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,130
- Your Highness!
-Talk.

195
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,670
Empress is missing.

196
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,170
- What?
- For these past days,

197
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,890
Empress Kindness has always been in front of Buddha's statue praying to the ancestors to bless the Five Regions.

198
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,830
But just earlier, some assassins trespassed into the palace and then she went missing.

199
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,530
Could it be that the assassins abducted the Empress?

200
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,450
I'll go look.

201
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,330
Grand Teacher... please...

202
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,880
give me...

203
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,240
some...

204
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,660
some more time.

205
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,240
Time? There's no more time.

206
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,710
You are not wearing down my patience,

207
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,170
but are wearing down the fate of the whole world!

208
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,300
Megrez is currently in a crisis.

209
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,420
I can't hide in here.

210
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,930
If you keep hesitating and delaying it like this,

211
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,070
you will become the traitor who brought disaster to the Five Regions.

212
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:00,410
Just for one's selfish reasons, you messed up world order and treated human lives as mere trifle.

213
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,510
What's your difference with the Zhangsun Jia of Megrez?

214
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,980
Grand Teacher...

215
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,140
I beg you to give me some more time.

216
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,990
After placating the situation in Megrez,

217
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,670
I...

218
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:25,780
will return to accept my punishment.

219
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,440
Mister—

220
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,860
What's going on exactly?

221
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,360
I've never seen Mister this weak.

222
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,440
- How about I go to Plough now to invite Mr. Zong over?
- Don't panic first.

223
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,160
I've used my internal energy to treat him.

224
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,550
I just couldn't tell if it's an injury or poison.

225
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,290
We encountered this once while in Plough, but he wouldn't say a thing.

226
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,760
Then... what about Mr. Zong?

227
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,200
He was in Plough at that time, too.

228
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,620
He indeed knows more than I do, but he couldn't do anything.

229
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,640
What about Empress Yuan?

230
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,230
How many assassins were there?

231
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,930
They said that there were two groups.

232
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,330
- They probably acted separately but in sync with each other to cause a distraction.
- Two groups of men...

233
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,890
Well-trained and knowledgeable of the topography.

234
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,860
They were able to abduct Empress Yuan with accurate timing.

235
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,800
It means that they are from this palace.

236
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,530
Who could it be?

237
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:23,860
This... I also dare not make rash conclusions.

238
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,060
But—

239
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,560
Prince Virtue.

240
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,830
That is also what I think.

241
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,160
I got news from outside that the assassins went northward after leaving the palace and left the city very quickly.

242
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,590
They probably are heading to the rebel army garrison on the north bank of the river.

243
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,670
I fear that they will be using Empress as a hostage and blackmail Crown Prince to surrender without fighting.

244
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,100
- Mister, you must not!
- Get out of the way.

245
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
Mister! Mister! You must not.

246
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,770
If you leave the Imperial City, that's falling into their trap.

247
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,100
You clearly know that Prince Virtue's main target is you.

248
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,880
Why must you go along with his plan?

249
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,110
Are you really trying to be my enemy?

250
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,990
I've served the Upper Yang Palace for more than twenty years.

251
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,890
I always remember the words you told me.

252
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,390
One can do things that are deemed impossible,

253
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:29,400
but one mustn't do things rashly, disregarding the general situation, Mister!

254
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,860
You going into their trap alone is a thing that mustn't be done!

255
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,390
- I have to stop you!
- You!

256
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,600
Moreover, Prince Virtue's... Prince Virtue's target is you only!

257
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,390
He wouldn't really harm Empress Yuan and Miss Fuyao, Mister.

258
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,770
Your Highness Crown Prince.

259
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,500
Your Highness Crown Prince, His Majesty urgently asks to see you.

260
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,180
Emperor Father.

261
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,730
You're here.

262
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,690
Wuji,

263
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,050
I expected that Zhangsun Jia would rebel.

264
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,040
I also expected Pingrong would sail with the wind.

265
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:49,130
But I never expected that they would do something to your Empress Mother.

266
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,730
Wuji, has the army you mobilized arrived?

267
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:02,820
Probably by tonight or tomorrow morning.

268
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,940
Do you have any confidence that you'll win?

269
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,510
I've really now become alone.

270
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,090
Each one betraying and leaving me.

271
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:32,420
In the whole Five Regions, you're the only one left that I can trust.

272
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,470
Good thing, you're here.

273
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:41,270
Even if I... leave this world now,

274
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,050
I, at least, have a son that will send me off.

275
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,940
Emperor Father.

276
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,520
I can only trust you.

277
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:11,150
That year, at the hunting grounds,

278
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,450
Zhangsun Jia almost killed you with his arrow.

279
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,450
Only now do I understand that it might be destined

280
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:27,830
that only one can live between the two of you.

281
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,100
Life and death are fated,

282
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,650
but Emperor Father, don't worry.

283
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,420
My life will not end here.

284
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,400
I am old.

285
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,720
I can't even hold a sword.

286
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,780
Hold it well.

287
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,350
Set out for battle.

288
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:07,830
Kill Zhangsun Jia on my behalf.

289
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:15,870
Emperor Father, rebels and traitors should be executed.

290
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:18,060
I will not refuse such a duty.

291
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,760
It's just that—

292
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,430
What you're worrying about is your Empress Mother, am I right?

293
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,190
Sit down.

294
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,500
Wuji, so many years have passed.

295
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,530
There are indeed some matters

296
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,180
that there is no harm to let you know.

297
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:12,560
The Prince Virtue then and your Empress Mother were indeed a perfect couple that everyone envied.

298
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:21,070
That time, even though I loved your Empress Mother, too,

299
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,630
the two of them had mutual affection for each other.

300
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,040
I can't steal somebody's lover.

301
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:39,970
But if Empress Mother loves him,

302
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,350
why then did she?

303
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,320
That's right.

304
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,390
I also asked myself that back then.

305
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,320
Why then did she enter the palace?

306
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,600
I think it must be because... the status of being the Empress,

307
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,800
its reputation and might,

308
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,590
that is indeed being a mother figure of the world, being above everyone.

309
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,650
Who doesn't want to have it?

310
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,600
Just like that, she entered the palace.

311
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,310
She received a lot.

312
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,870
When a man obtains what he desires, he tends to desire more.

313
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:32,300
That time, I had to attend to state affairs day and night.

314
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,720
Maybe your Empress Mother feels that I've neglected her.

315
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,050
She bore discontentment.

316
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,560
Hence, she remembered the romantic times she had with Prince Virtue.

317
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,170
And the Prince Virtue at this time,

318
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,980
took advantage of your Empress Mother's little trust in him,

319
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:57,500
used her to secretly poison me.

320
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,860
Emperor Father.

321
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,700
Good thing.

322
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,010
I was fortunately saved.

323
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:19,230
But my health can't endure any more exhaustion.

324
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,170
And every day,

325
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,430
I can't attend the court and just stay here in this meditation chamber to cultivate inner energy pills

326
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:31,900
to resist the poisons that they've given me that are still inside my body.

327
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,190
Days then went by one by one just like that.

328
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,730
You then...

329
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,340
were in Firmament training and hadn't returned.

330
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,160
Pingrong, on the other hand, wasn't fit to bear any important responsibility.

331
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,630
Who then could I tell it to?

332
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:55,590
Thus, I could only pretend that I know nothing.

333
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,090
After telling you all this,

334
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,980
don't get mad at your Empress Mother.

335
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:10,700
She is after all a woman I loved.

336
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,360
After all, she gave birth and raised you.

337
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,530
You should also forgive the mistakes she committed.

338
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:25,420
But your Royal Uncle, Zhangsun Jia, I can't tolerate him.

339
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,510
You know what to do, right?

340
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,520
Emperor Father, don't worry.

341
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,400
I understand what I should do.

342
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:46,380
Remember my words.

343
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,040
This Zhangsun Jia is more adept in tactics than you can imagine.

344
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,220
You must be very careful when you meet him in battle.

345
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:00,170
But I don't care what price you have to pay, what means you must use, or how many casualties you may incur,

346
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,820
I only want you... to personally kill him.

347
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:18,070
You must promise me...

348
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,370
that you will personally kill him,

349
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:25,690
or else, I will not die in peace.

350
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,560
I... will obey your command.

351
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,510
Go now.

352
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,340
Emperor Father, take care.

353
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,020
Yi'er, you have suffered.

354
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,240
A'rong?

355
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:55,760
- Get out!
- Yes!

356
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,820
How come it's you, A'rong?

357
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,670
You still know that my name is A'rong?

358
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:21,720
Do you still remember... that I'm your wife?

359
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,170
My nickname...

360
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,550
only you can call it.

361
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,760
But now, you're not qualified to!

362
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,780
It's been so many years.

363
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,300
Have you been well?

364
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,410
I didn't die.

365
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,100
Tell me. Is that good or not?

366
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,990
I know that you hate me,

367
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,800
but the person I clearly rescued was—

368
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,100
You clearly rescued that bitch, am I right?

369
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,490
Are you very disappointed now?

370
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:07,790
A'Rong, you shouldn't be here.

371
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:11,690
- Yi'er, she—
- Don't mention her in front of me!

372
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,690
I won't tell you where she is

373
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,400
even if you kill me.

374
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,320
How could I kill you?

375
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,000
You are, after all, my wife.

376
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,600
Wife?

377
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Have you really treated me as your wife?

378
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,010
No.

379
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
You never did.

380
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,400
From the start,

381
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,400
you were just faking your affection.

382
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,200
In your heart,

383
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,490
there was never a position for me!

384
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:07,700
From the start, I shouldn't have believed your lies.

385
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:10,000
I shouldn't have married you.

386
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,200
In your heart,

387
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:17,400
I'm just a replacement, a cover, a stupid woman that you can use anytime!

388
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,400
When I married you then,

389
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,900
I indeed had intentions to win over the support of Deep Water.

390
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,200
But even so, I never treated you unfairly.

391
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,600
The status and glory you deserved.

392
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,100
I... gave them all to you.

393
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,800
It was you who requested to leave.

394
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,600
I requested to leave?

395
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,700
Did you think that I took Lian'er with me and left

396
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,800
all just because I learned about your affair with that woman?

397
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,870
You don't know.

398
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,200
You don't really know what happened!

399
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,800
You don't know what happened to Lian'er!

400
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,600
You don't know how I survived that time!

401
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,420
What happened?

402
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What really happened?

403
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,900
What's still the point of saying all these?

404
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,000
Yes, I forgot.

405
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,500
You once were the top fighter of Megrez.

406
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,800
Even if I spend so much effort these past years and learn as much magic as I can,

407
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,600
I will never be able to defeat you.

408
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,800
Yes, I'm an assassin.

409
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,530
I failed.

410
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:54,500
You decide on my punishment.

411
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,520
Fine.

412
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,500
Now is not the time to reminisce.

413
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,230
Just rest here.

414
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
Do you have any news about them?

415
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,800
I've meticulously asked around. There is indeed no news about Ms. Fuyao,

416
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,860
but the rebel army indeed abducted a woman.

417
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,200
Prince Virtue ordered that she be treated well.

418
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,500
They will never dare to neglect her. Maybe, it's Empress Kindness.

419
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,000
What's going on? I heard that you abducted the wrong person.

420
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
How could you commit such a huge blunder?

421
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,300
Leave now.

422
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,000
Xu Lai, you leave, too.

423
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,740
I have to ask you then.

424
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,000
All the palace spies were arranged by you.

425
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,730
Only you and I know about the whole plan.

426
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,000
How could they have abducted the wrong person?

427
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Are you then suspecting me of covertly informing Emperor Father of our plans?

428
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Isn't that it?

429
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,430
I've staked all my possessions and my life on you.

430
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,600
You're actually doubting me?

431
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,200
A smart gambler will never stake everything on one person.

432
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,300
What do you mean?

433
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,000
If you don't believe me, why then did you make an alliance with me?

434
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,540
What are you trying to do?

435
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:50,020
I really didn't leak any information!

436
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,600
At this point, it's already not important who leaked the news.

437
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:06,200
Now that we failed, we won't have another chance to enter the palace.

438
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,800
We can only attack.

439
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,000
If we win, I will still have a chance to save her.

440
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,200
If we lose, then don't bother discussing anything anymore.

441
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,800
Attack?

442
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,510
The 80,000 army of the Liu Family in Changhe are still on their way here.

443
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,600
We haven't finished stocking up our military provisions.

444
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,300
If you attack now, isn't that suicide?

445
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't need to explain things to you.

446
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,900
Even if I don't attack, the army of Megrez is already on their way.

447
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,940
I won't force you to stay.

448
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,600
Just do as you please.

449
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,400
If I knew that you would commit suicide, why did I side with you?

450
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,100
Get out!

451
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
What do we do now?

452
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,320
I was so wrong about him.

453
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,000
He is a total lunatic!

454
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,300
He will surely lose this battle. We mustn't get involved in this mess.

455
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,100
What you mean then, is...?

456
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,840
Pack up our things and leave.

457
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,600
What is this place?

458
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,500
It's no use.

459
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Don't waste your energy.

460
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,300
Empress. This?

461
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,200
This is the most important secret chamber of Megrez.

462
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,800
The ones binding our body

463
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,600
are also the Imprisonment Chains that are the hardest chains to be broken here in Megrez for hundreds of years.

464
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,400
Since he wanted to lock us in here,

465
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,000
he then was sure that we wouldn't be able to escape.

466
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,000
In here, even if you hurt your throat from shouting, no one will hear you.

467
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Whether we live or die,

468
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,700
it's all according to his whim.

469
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:48,600
As long as he doesn't say it, then no one will ever know that we're here.

470
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,700
Prince Virtue looked like a person with high morals,

471
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,100
yet he actually is this despicable!

472
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:57,600
He even treated you like this.

473
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:02,830
Do you really not know who abducted you?

474
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:10,800
Do you not understand who is the true mastermind behind all this?

475
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,900
Prince Virtue.

476
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,210
Prince Virtue isn't his competition.

♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

485
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,800
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

486
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,900
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

487
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,800
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

488
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,000
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

489
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,600
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

490
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

491
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,600
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

492
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:05,000
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

493
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,200
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

494
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

495
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,400
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

496
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,200
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

497
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

498
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,700
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

499
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,200
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

500
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,200
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

501
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,000
♫ Have someone's company♫

502
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,800
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

503
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

504
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,000
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

505
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫
