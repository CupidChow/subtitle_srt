00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,350
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,730
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,880
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,650
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,520
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,070
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,710
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,750
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,900
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:02,020
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,630
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,420
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,460
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,760
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,350
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,460
~ Episode 45 ~

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,920
Throughout your life,

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,890
whether it's about situations or people, you've always made the wrong judgement.

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,440
I'm afraid you're going to get disappointed this time again.

25
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,480
Wuji is still alive.

26
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,320
Is it true?

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,260
Where is he? I want to see him.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,650
I beg you, let me see him. Where is he?

29
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,470
There's no hurry.

30
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:27,510
When it's time for you to see him, you will then see him.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,270
Why?

32
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,120
Why are you so evil?

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,070
Stay alive.

34
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,930
Live well.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,300
Why?

36
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,050
Why do you have to torment me like this?

37
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:52,620
Why?

38
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,630
Tell me. What is Zhangsun Pingrong's real intention?

39
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,640
He's hiding the Earth Absorbing Bell and trying to avoid seeing me.

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
This is Rock City.

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,220
This is Rock City of my Heaven Fiend.

42
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,710
If he pushes me to the point that I can't bear anymore, I'll go catch him.

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,910
Since that day after the Sky Gate Ruin, Prince Assist has been sick.

44
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,100
All day long he passes gas. It smells awful.

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,290
He can't even leave the house.

46
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,210
Should we wait a few more days?

47
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,490
I don't give a damn if it smells awful.

48
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,050
It's none of our business even if he farts himself to death.

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,260
But if he keeps holding on to the Earth Absorbing Bell,

50
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,450
then he deliberately makes things difficult for me.

51
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,630
Royal Older Brother, but no matter what, he's still Prince Assist of the Imperial City.

52
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,670
I'm going to wait just one more day.

53
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,490
If we still can't get the Earth Absorbing Bell back,

54
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,180
he will lose his Prince Assist title, too.

55
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,760
Your Majesty.

56
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,150
- Your Majesty.
- Have you gotten to see Zhangsun Pingrong?

57
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,600
Prince Assist... he already left Rock City.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,180
I asked you to keep a close eye on him, but you let him escape?

59
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,340
I, your servant, am guilty and deserve death.

60
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,200
But... But Prince Assist left behind a letter.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,990
Crown Prince Wuji took the Earth Absorbing Bell.

62
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,160
Go and search.

63
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,330
I'll go immediately.

64
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:29,740
You didn't know that while we were inside Sky Gate Ruin,

65
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,880
that Zhangsun Pingrong was scared to death.

66
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,630
I just scraped a tiny bit of soil and gave it to him, and told him that it was a deadly poison.

67
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,060
And so he begged me to give him the antidote badly.

68
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,510
I just scraped this teeny-tiny bit of soil.

69
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,900
Hello, Wuji.

70
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,930
Your medicine, drink it when it is still warm.

71
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,510
His hand is not fully recovered. Let me help him.

72
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,770
How can I let you do such a trivial thing?

73
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,060
Also, it is improper for men and women to touch each other's hand in passing objects.

74
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,270
Prince Zhan's hand injury is not yet healed. He needs people to wait on him.

75
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,520
Let me do it then. Let me do it.

76
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,090
I—

77
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,570
Here, Prince Zhan, drink your medicine.

78
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,590
Drink it.

79
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,740
Drink it. Here. Drink it.

80
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,990
Just let me do it myself.

81
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,370
Look, Prince Zhan's hand is healed.

82
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,770
He can take his own medicine now.

83
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,910
I've practiced martial arts since I was young.

84
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,040
This little injury really means nothing.

85
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,970
- Looking back, I—
- That's good.

86
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,010
Since your hand injury is now recovering,

87
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,440
I hope you don't mind if I take Fuyao outside for a little while.

88
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,810
Sit.

89
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,060
Are you jealous?

90
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,910
Who says that?

91
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,550
That's right.

92
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:43,700
You, Crown Prince Wuji, have always been such an arrogant person since when you were little.

93
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,960
You wouldn't get jealous easily.

94
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,990
That's what you said.

95
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,860
But let me tell you. I'm a person who likes to get jealous and I'm also narrow-minded.

96
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,500
No one can touch the woman I love.

97
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,980
Really?

98
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,990
Yes.

99
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,760
I was just looking after him.

100
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,420
The person who should look after him,

101
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
shouldn't be you.

102
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,890
I know that.

103
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,870
It's just because Zhuzhu has been sick lately.

104
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,450
So it's my turn to do it.

105
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,140
Otherwise—

106
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,020
Do you also feel it's strange?

107
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,820
Wait.

108
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,280
Is it that we haven't seen her since we came back from Sky Gate Ruin?

109
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,590
Based on her feelings toward Zhan Beiye, it's impossible for her to stay in her room for this many days and not come out.

110
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,320
- Xiaoqi!
- Yes?

111
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,250
Have you seen Yalan Zhu?

112
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,930
I'm in a hurry to deliver the medicine to Mister Zong. I'll get going now.

113
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,520
Wait a minute.

114
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,890
I asked you if you saw Yalan Zhu. Why did you run away?

115
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,330
I'm really in a rush to deliver the medicine to Mister Zong.

116
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,550
I'll make the delivery first and then talk to you.

117
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm asking you if you've seen Yalan Zhu.

118
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,860
What has happened?

119
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,120
Nothing really. Zhuzhu... she might be sleeping.

120
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,430
She has slept for several days.

121
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,820
She's not in her room, right?

122
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,250
What's wrong?

123
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,830
What happened?

124
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,890
Go save Zhuzhu quickly.

125
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,910
In order to save General Zhan, she blinded herself.

126
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,360
What?

127
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,580
General Zhan didn't wake up on his own.

128
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,480
It was Zhuzhu who used some kind of spell to wake him up.

129
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,150
But she is now blind and she won't let me tell anyone.

130
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,690
Are you saying that just to save someone, she used their tribe's protocol?

131
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,840
The Qiongye protocol can only save others but not themselves.

132
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:00,290
It's extremely dangerous to use it. She made a bet on her own life to save Zhan Beiye.

133
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,820
Zhuzhu!

134
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,290
- Zhuzhu!
- Zhuzhu!

135
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,810
Zhuzhu.

136
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,360
Zhuzhu.

137
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,210
When you see this note, you will surely know what happened.

138
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,290
It was all my own decision which had nothing to do with anyone else.

139
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,290
Please take good care of Fifth Older Brother for me.

140
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,950
If he asks about me, just say something has happened in my tribe. I'm taking my leave now.

141
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,600
What should we do, Older Sis Fuyao?

142
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,300
"I'm taking my leave now. Don't come find me."

143
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,630
- "Hope to see you again."
- I'm going to find her.

144
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,490
- Older Sis Fuyao!
- Five Regions is so big. Where do we go to find her?

145
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,070
Do we not want to go find her because Five Regions is big?

146
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,460
Teacher and Teacher's Wife, a lot of soldiers have shown up.

147
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,680
Go and guard Zhan Beiye's room.

148
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,130
You must not let them find Zhan Beiye.

149
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,980
Greetings, Your Highness Crown Prince.

150
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,160
My courtyard is small and couldn't accommodate so many people. Have to let you suffer then, Prince Eternal.

151
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,820
Crown Prince, you're funny.

152
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,970
When Royal Older Brother learned that Your Highness Crown Prince was actually staying in such a remote place,

153
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,430
he was struck with fear.

154
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,820
He especially asked me to rush here and invite you to rest in the palace.

155
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,860
Are you here to look for me?

156
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,990
Indeed.

157
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,680
You have so many people coming here all of a sudden.

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,530
How could Zhan Nancheng be the one in fear?

159
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,010
It should be me.

160
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,100
Royal Older Brother was just thinking that your safety should be ensured.

161
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,160
I appreciate it.

162
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,670
Then, may Crown Prince come with me to rest in the palace.

163
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,320
Heaven Fiend is a bitter cold nation, but we shouldn't make Crown Prince suffer.

164
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,970
Please.

165
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,780
Does Zhan Nancheng really want to see me?

166
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,340
Return and tell your Royal Older Brother that Prince Assist is my older brother.

167
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,140
He is also the first royal son of the Megrez royal clan.

168
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,890
I am very much at ease to let him handle the communications with Heaven Fiend.

169
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,720
As for me, no need for the Heaven Fiend King to worry anymore.

170
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,000
Crown Prince, you're being funny.

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,240
In Royal Brother's eyes, of course, you are several times more important than Prince Assist.

172
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,620
It's just that Prince Assist, he—

173
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,660
You don't want to say it.

174
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,560
I understand.

175
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,380
Go back and tell your Royal Older Brother

176
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,120
that my matter with Prince Assist has nothing to do with him, so he can be at ease.

177
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,590
You can now leave.

178
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,010
Your Highness Crown Prince, it's just that—

179
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,960
What? Is there still something else?

180
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,110
His Highness Prince Assist has left Rock City.

181
00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,540
He instructed before he left that he already handed the Earth Absorbing Bell of our Heaven Fiend to you.

182
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,810
Why did he give me that item?

183
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,810
How come I don't remember?

184
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,120
Your Highness Crown Prince had to attend to so many affairs every day.

185
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,290
How could you remember such a trifling thing?

186
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,730
But this item is very important to us.

187
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,450
May Crown Prince return it as soon as possible.

188
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,530
There's an assassin!

189
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,680
If there's an assassin, aren't you going to hurry and capture him?

190
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,770
If anything bad happens to Crown Prince, none of you can live! Hurry!

191
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,780
- Yes!
- Stop!

192
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,460
I've lived here for so many days and it was quite peaceful.

193
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,630
How come upon the arrival of Prince Eternal, assassins couldn't contain themselves anymore, either?

194
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,150
Who's that blind to risk his life at this time?

195
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,130
Could it be Prince Eternal has some other arrangements?

196
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,770
For Crown Prince to say that, you're asking for my life.

197
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,650
It's just that we saw an assassin entering here.

198
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,770
I was just afraid that you'd get harmed.

199
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,490
Hence, I ordered the search.

200
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,670
Prince Eternal, you've misunderstood.

201
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,480
With so many of you coming here, you indeed should take a good look.

202
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,610
Since that's the case, just go pull out the people you're searching for and wanting to capture.

203
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:11,340
May Prince Eternal also help me verify what's really going on.

204
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,800
Tie Cheng, come here!

205
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Lead them to search.

206
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,190
Why are you still standing there?

207
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,110
Prince Eternal wants to capture the assassin.

208
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,420
You must help them do a thorough search.

209
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,690
I understand.

210
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,360
- Come with me!
- Let's go!

211
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,960
Thank you, Your Highness Crown Prince.

212
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,220
What should we do?

213
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,600
If they discover that General Zhan is here, they surely will arrest him.

214
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,450
Of course, we couldn't let them take General Zhan away.

215
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,570
Isn't Crown Prince Wuji the crown prince?

216
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,350
He could have just directly made that Prince Eternal leave.

217
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,140
Why did he still let him in?

218
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,380
If worse comes to worst, we'll just fight it out with them.

219
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,020
- Go there to look!
- Yes!

220
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,640
There! Look there!

221
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,190
- Yes!
- Hurry! Hurry up!

222
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,850
There's none.

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,120
Who's staying in that room?

224
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,830
That is Crown Prince's room. You don't have the right to search it.

225
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,220
You!

226
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,630
Stop! I'm talking to you. Did you hear me?

227
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,560
There can't be any assassins hiding in there, right?

228
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,570
- What assassins?
- Get out of the way!

229
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,820
- Go there.
- There's no one here.

230
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,440
There's no one here.

231
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,220
Go there!

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,620
- There's no one here!
- Everyone, search well!

233
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,860
Below the bed, ceiling, search everywhere!

234
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,010
We indeed became invisible.

235
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,600
They can't see us, but we can see them.

236
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,160
There is no one here. Withdraw.

237
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,890
Withdraw!

238
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,380
Reporting. We didn't find anyone.

239
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,420
Teacher.

240
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,830
- Where's the assassin?
- We didn't find anyone.

241
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,190
What if something bad happens once they leave?

242
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,100
Should I blame Prince Eternal for being incompetent or you for being blind?

243
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,540
You didn't see it clearly and you just randomly shouted!

244
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,440
You've caused us to disturb His Highness Crown Prince!

245
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,360
Prince Eternal, forget it.

246
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,870
If you have any free time in the future,

247
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,580
you're welcome to come here.

248
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,260
If you really want to capture someone,

249
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,510
you should do so. Right?

250
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,940
Since Crown Prince wants to enjoy a quiet time alone more, I'll report it to my Royal Older Brother.

251
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,270
I'll take my leave.

252
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's go!

253
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,460
Wait!

254
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,320
If Prince Eternal returns empty-handed, won't your Royal Older Brother scold you?

255
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,870
Look at my brain. I finally remember it now.

256
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,550
My older brother indeed handed me an item.

257
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,470
Give it to me.

258
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,030
Is it this?

259
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,520
It's fake! Fake!

260
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,970
Those Zhangsun people are all evil people!

261
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:47,110
From the one up to those below, all are assholes!

262
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,010
All of them are!

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,670
These two treasures are indeed mystical.

264
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,370
I just discovered it these two days, too.

265
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,710
As long as you handle it properly, it can create a bewitching effect.

266
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,950
But the duration is a bit short.

267
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,850
For the Heaven Fiend's Double Sound, combining both would actually lead to invisibility.

268
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,900
The greatest martial arts techniques and energy in this world couldn't compare to an item that turns something into nothing.

269
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,390
Ignorance is the greatest enemy of mortal people like us.

270
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,020
Good thing that important items like those are with us.

271
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,840
If it got taken away by that Zhan Nancheng, I don't know what could have happened.

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,490
What's wrong with all of you?

273
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,490
Is there something on your mind?

274
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,150
Oh, right. Where is Yalan Zhu?

275
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,410
How come I haven't seen her?

276
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,620
Hey. Where is Yalan Zhu?

277
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,630
Something came up in Qiongye and she was asked to go back.

278
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,910
She'll be back in a few days.

279
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,630
Qiongye?

280
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,150
Yes.

281
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,660
Qiongye is very far from here.

282
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,050
She is alone. I hope she'll be fine.

283
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,950
That's right.

284
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:12,810
I hope she'll be fine.

285
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,560
Royal Older Brother, could Prince Assist have already taken the real Earth Absorbing Bell away?

286
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,440
Compared to Zhangsun Pingrong being greedy,

287
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,530
I believe more that it was Zhangsun Wuji who is excessively clever!

288
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,840
How come he is still alive?

289
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,030
If he died, everyone would have been happier.

290
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,760
You brought so many people with you in going to him this time.

291
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,670
Did you really find nothing?

292
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,770
This... we searched the whole place.

293
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,520
We indeed didn't find Zhan Beiye.

294
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm thinking. Maybe we got the wrong tip?

295
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,640
Or maybe he really died in Mt. Great Vast.

296
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,200
Bullshit!

297
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,480
Now that Zhangsun Wuji is still alive, things will just get worse.

298
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,580
Tell me. If a person is able to survive Geya Desert,

299
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,370
can we handle him?

300
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,480
But he also need not help Zhan Beiye.

301
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,800
Initially, he indeed didn't need to.

302
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,480
But now that he knows about our relations with Prince Assist,

303
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,890
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

304
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:32,300
It is now reasonable for Crown Prince to help him.

305
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,930
Maybe Royal Older Brother is just over worrying.

306
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,790
I think Zhan Beiye doesn't have that capability.

307
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,970
Really?

308
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,400
I suddenly remembered one thing.

309
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,790
Eight years ago, an assassin infiltrated the palace.

310
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,680
It was Zhan Beiye who saved you, right?

311
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,250
You two actually have a good relationship.

312
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,600
King Father was still alive then. I never had any wild ambitions.

313
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,880
I also treat all my brothers equally.

314
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,040
Treat your brothers equally?

315
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,420
Hence, when you suggested that I let him take the Earth Absorbing Bell to Deep Water,

316
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,900
it has now become harder for me to capture him.

317
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,360
Royal Brother, you've wronged me!

318
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,960
I was just worrying about Zhan Beiye having a deep foundation and great prestige here in Heaven Fiend at that time.

319
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,790
Sending him to Deep Water was just to find a chance of officially accusing him for a crime.

320
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,530
Royal Older Brother knows about this very clearly.

321
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,060
I don't have any other meaning.

322
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,630
After all, we're the ones with the same mother.

323
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,590
How could I suspect you?

324
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,480
If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have gotten through all the trouble.

325
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,880
I should have just looked for a reason to directly kill him.

326
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,650
That would have saved me a lot of problems.

327
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,860
I was the one who is incompetent.

328
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,000
I deserve to die for it.

329
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,800
If you know that you were wrong, you then should make up for it.

330
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,220
What was that...

331
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,600
Are there still Prince Fierce allies in your hands?

332
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
Yes.

333
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,800
Although they are Prince Fierce's old subordinates,

334
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,200
they are in high positions and related to a lot of people.

335
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,700
Unless we have no other choice, they shouldn't be touched.

336
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,600
Prince Fierce's old subordinates can't be touched?

337
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,400
Who says so?

338
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,140
Capture them all.

339
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,600
Execute everyone above the age of 16.

340
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,000
For the little ones, exile the males and sell the females to the brothels.

341
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,600
I don't believe

342
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,500
that our Fifth Younger Brother will just stand and watch all this.

343
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,880
It is indeed no big deal for the government to lose some important subjects.

344
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,000
It's just that...

345
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,300
If Crown Prince is really helping Zhan Beiye,

346
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,200
aren't we openly contradicting him if we do this?

347
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,810
So what if he is the crown prince of Megrez?

348
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,400
This is an internal affair of Heaven Fiend.

349
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,600
His arms aren't that long.

350
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,990
Everything here in Heaven Fiend is my call.

351
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,500
It's now four days.

352
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,800
We've searched all the inns here in Rock City.

353
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,080
Where exactly has she gone to?

354
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,400
Could it be that she has left the city?

355
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,430
I already assigned my scout to the city gates.

356
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,800
If she has left the city, I should have received a message.

357
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
What's the news then?

358
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,800
Sometimes, no news is good news.

359
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,900
Don't get overly worried.

360
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Move aside! Hurry!

361
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,600
Isn't that Official Liu?

362
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
- Why? Why is he in such a tragic state?
 - Move aside!

363
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,190
Official Liu has been in office for so many years.

364
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,800
He has always served for the citizen's sake.

365
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,600
Where can you still find an official like that?

366
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,830
- Indeed.
- Hurry up!

367
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,400
- What's really going on?
 - Hurry up!

368
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,100
- Hurry up! 
- Have you all forgotten?

369
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,770
- Official Liu is an old subordinate of Prince Fierce.
 - Hurry up!

370
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,400
- How could he be spared?
- Hurry up!

371
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,200
You said it right.

372
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,900
Prince Fierce is highly loved by the citizens.

373
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,600
Tell me. How could he not bear grudges?

374
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,800
Only by eliminating his old subordinates can he feel at ease.

375
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,660
- Prince Fierce was so valiant.
- Hurry up! What are you doing?

376
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,800
He drove those barbarians out of our nation.

377
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,920
He Is very loyal and benevolent.

378
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,400
- He empathizes with the people.
 - Get out of the way.

379
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,500
- How come a virtuous prince like that gets to receive this much injustice?
 - Move out!

380
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,200
Heaven is really blind.

381
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,600
[If you want to see me, let's meet tomorrow morning at Unshakable Cliff Ridge]

382
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,070
General, you're making me feel too embarrassed.

383
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,000
You even are personally changing my dressing.

384
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,200
For just one trip in Mt. Great Vast, we lost so many men and you lost your arm.

385
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,600
And now you're telling me that you couldn't bear for me to take care of you?

386
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,300
I was actually very worried about you before.

387
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,730
My fate is good.

388
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm still alive.

389
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,800
But the lives of those brothers of ours, I will surely have someone pay for them.

390
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,100
Even if I have to die, I have no regrets in following you.

391
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,990
No regrets?

392
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm currently full of regrets.

393
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,200
How come I was so fortunate to have a group of loyal men like that?

394
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,100
And Fuyao.

395
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,000
If not because she stayed by my side those few days and kept talking in my ears,

396
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,200
encouraging me to continue living,

397
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,800
I think I might have given up.

398
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,800
Zhan Beiye! Are you stupid?

399
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,000
Let me tell you that while you were unconscious,

400
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,830
the person who had been by your side,

401
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,800
the person who kept talking to you,

402
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,020
the person who watched you from day to night wasn't Fuyao.

403
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,400
It was Yalan Zhu!

404
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
You even are thinking of someone else?

405
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,500
You think that it was very fortunate of you to survive, is that it?

406
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,000
Have you thought about Yalan Zhu?!

407
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,110
What being brave and chivalrous?

408
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,000
What about being able to discriminate between kindness and hatred?

409
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,500
I think that you're just a completely ungrateful bastard.

410
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,500
Do you know that just to save you,

411
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,400
Zhuzhu sacrificed her eyes?

412
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,800
She can never see again. She can never see again!

413
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,000
What did you-you say?

414
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,600
Yalan Zhu turned blind just to save me?

415
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,180
If you cared about her for even a little bit,

416
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,200
you wouldn't have let her suffer so much.

417
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,900
She said that as long as you can live, even if her life would be endangered,

418
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,060
she was willing.

419
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,990
Where is she?

420
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,300
Where?

421
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,800
General, she was worried that you'd feel guilty, so she left without telling anyone.

422
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,000
Actually, she's the person that actually saved you.

423
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,400
You're fine now? You are?

424
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,700
Why didn't you all tell me?

425
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,560
So, you already know.

426
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,230
These are Zhuzhu's wishes.

427
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:14,000
Her considerations are also our considerations.

428
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,280
- Prince Zhan!
- Listen to me.

429
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,300
If you really care about her, then don't play with your life.

430
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,170
Do you know how much Zhuzhu gave up for you?

431
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,800
She used her own eyes in exchange for your life.

432
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,630
Prince Zhan, don't act rashly.

433
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,400
We've already searched the whole Rock City. There are still no traces of her.

434
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,500
Then go out of the city to search!

435
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,600
Listen to me!

436
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,700
We already know now where to find her.

437
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,970
No matter where she is...

438
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,200
I have to personally fetch her.

439
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,800
You have just recovered. You—

440
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
I think, it's also good to do that.

441
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,600
This matter started from him and should be ended by him.

442
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,950
Today, just let me go with him.

443
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,700
You–

444
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,500
Okay.

445
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,000
Then promise me that no matter what happens, bring Zhuzhu back here alive and well.

446
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,890
Say it.

447
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:15,700
You deliberately had Fuyao leave us two, so you must have something to say to me.

448
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,600
Prince Zhan indeed is a straightforward person.

449
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,400
I will be frank then.

450
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,600
With your present situation, if you want to protect others,

451
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,840
you should first make yourself invincible.

452
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,200
Am I right?

453
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,700
The Dark Storm Cavalry has set up camp outside, away from Rock City.

454
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,200
You are being treated as a traitor and are wanted in the whole Five Regions.

455
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Now, Imperial Concubine Jing is being held in the palace and can't escape.

456
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,700
Your old subordinates and friends in the city are being exterminated.

457
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,500
Are you still going to continue sitting and waiting for your death?

458
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,000
No matter how much you say, if you're unable to protect yourself, then all are just paper tigers.

459
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Each of us has our own destiny.

460
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:02,700
Whether you're willing or forced, this destiny will never change.

461
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,600
Just like with Yalan Zhu who you're about to see now. Your feelings for her are still the same.

462
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,200
If you're unable to make a decision, you will just have a guilty conscience towards her forever.

463
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,720
I received secret information from the palace.

464
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,200
Imperial Concubine Jing will get executed before the Tomb-Sweeping Day.

465
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,340
You two wait here for General.

466
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,000
Even if I lose my life,

467
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,400
I still have to charge into the palace and bring Imperial Concubine Jing back here.

468
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,860
Stay calm first.

469
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,500
Even if you enter the palace now, you won't be able to do anything.

470
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,600
Listen. What they want is Zhan Beiye.

471
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,800
As long as Zhan Beiye is still alive, Imperial Concubine Jing is a very important hostage for them.

472
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,300
They won't do anything to her.

473
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,140
Are we then just going to watch like this?

474
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,050
Don't get agitated first.

475
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,030
Let me think of a way.

476
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,490
There must be a way.

477
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,000
This is Yalan Zhu's personal belonging.

478
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,290
So that's what's going on.

479
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,900
When you go to Illusion Palace later,

480
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,700
tell the servant maid that you'll meet there, that you've been here.

481
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,900
[Illusion Palace]

482
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm Zhan Beiye from Heaven Fiend.

483
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,800
I was fortunate to have received your guidance to come here yesterday.

484
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,800
May Palace Leader Fei Yan fulfill my wish.

485
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,650
How did you know about my teacher?

486
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,200
I've been to this Illusion Palace before.

487
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,700
Oh?

488
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
How come there's only you?

489
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,000
Where is that woman?

490
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,710
You are not Fei Yan.

491
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,000
How then can you help me find the person I'm looking for?

492
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,880
I'm asking you a question.

493
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,000
How come that woman didn't come?

494
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,600
Please ask your teacher to come out.

495
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,430
Don't even think about it.

496
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,800
Unless that woman personally comes here,

497
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,800
or else the person you're looking for won't live past three days.

498
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,200
You! Hand her to me!

499
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,100
You mere mortal...you dare to behave atrociously here in the Illusion Palace?!

500
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:01,560
Yalan Zhu!

501
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,650
Don't worry. She is not dead yet.

502
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,840
Don't. Don't.

503
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,250
I beg you.

504
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:16,650
Don't kill her. Don't kill her.

505
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:20,920
Oh? Are you begging me right now to not kill her?

506
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,230
Don't kill her.

507
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,380
Then, I will kill her right now.

508
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,300
Don't!

509
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,670
Have you had enough?

510
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,700
Yalan Zhu.

511
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,070
You finally appeared.

512
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,510
Let them go.

513
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,440
Are you butting into others' business again?

514
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,150
Taiyan.

515
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,850
Yalan Zhu.

516
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,280
Fifth Older Brother.

517
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,420
Fifth Older Brother,

518
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,360
is it you?

519
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,850
Yes.

520
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,120
It's me. It's me.

521
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,090
I can't this time.

522
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:30,920
I am acting on behalf of Teacher.

523
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:35,160
Your teacher cannot possibly mean for you to kill them.

524
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,940
I was left with no choice.

525
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,880
Teacher wanted to get acquainted with that Fuyao through her.

526
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,000
But the wrong person came today and said the wrong things.

527
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,300
So, they must die.

528
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,830
What kind of teacher takes someone's life to get acquainted with another one?

529
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:54,140
So evil!

530
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,070
I'll say it one more time: let them go.

531
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,730
- Based on what?
- Based on the fact that your teacher is my teacher's junior.

532
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,610
I'll beg for forgiveness later.

533
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,610
Zhan Beiye, leave with Yalan Zhu first.

534
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,380
- Then you?
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

535
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,920
You can't go!

536
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,790
I hope that when I see you again, you won't be so stubborn.

537
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,920
That Fuyao is the person you are looking for!

538
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,420
Do you really not know that when you left,

539
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,060
Lama Heavenly Secret had given you orders.

540
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,890
Have you been the Crown Prince of the Megrez for too long

541
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,460
and forgotten your other identity?

542
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,350
That is you are a student of Firmament.

543
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,790
It's none of your business.

544
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,790
Don't forget the person that Firmament is asking you to find!

545
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:32,270
You are the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

546
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,460
Only you can change the universe. Find the girl with the Five-Colored Stone

547
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,240
or else the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

548
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,460
What are you thinking about?

549
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,850
Thinking about you.

550
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,710
To celebrate Zhuzhu coming back, I'll invite you to a drink.

551
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,170
Okay.

552
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,590
Here.

553
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,360
Hey, have you ever thought about who you really are?

554
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

555
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,870
Nothing. Just randomly asking.

556
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,300
I have thought about it.

557
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,350
When I was little, I was so curious about my background.

558
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:14,090
Because my parent left me when I was young.

559
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,970
If it wasn't for Uncle Zhou saving me, I might have died.

560
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,940
You wouldn't have been able to meet me.

561
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,430
That, how old were you then?

562
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,730
Five or six.

563
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,550
- Five or six?
- Yes.

564
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:38,440
By then, you should be able to remember things.

565
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,950
Do you really not remember anything before Mt. Mystic Soul?

566
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,320
Maybe I was a little dumb when I was a kid.

567
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,990
I don't remember anything before five or six years old.

568
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,490
Why did you suddenly ask about this?

569
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:01,070
I wanted to say a unique lady like you

570
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,730
must have extraordinary parents, too.

571
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:12,130
Let me tell you. When I was little,

572
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,580
I actually thought that.

573
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:20,430
I feel that my parents might be some unspeakable big shots.

574
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:23,480
And then because of some unspeakable reasons,

575
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,130
they left me in Mt. Mystic Soul so my identity could be hidden.

576
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,790
Maybe they are doing something very great.

577
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:34,420
Suddenly one day, my parents will come back and say,

578
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,710
this entire Mt. Mystic Soul is yours.

579
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,880
Then, later, I told my thoughts to Uncle Zhou.

580
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,990
He started lecturing me.

581
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,280
He said, "You don't go to work, and you—"

582
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,370
And then he said that the Mystic Black Section are all suffering children.

583
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,200
If it wasn't that a family was starving,

584
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,830
why would they throw their children here to suffer and serve others?

585
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,720
So I thought,

586
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,960
I am just a child of a poor family that was lucky to have lived.

587
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,000
Then have you... ever blamed your family?

588
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,040
Um...

589
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:44,450
I think,

590
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,160
my parents might have had their predicaments, too.

591
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,490
Otherwise, why would they not want someone as pretty as me?

592
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,800
But their identity is no longer important to me.

593
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,540
I don't think about it anymore.

594
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,560
It was Uncle Zhou who raised me single-handedly.

595
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,060
So to me, he is my family.

596
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,870
- Hey.
- Yes?

597
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,670
What are you thinking?

598
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,220
I was wondering why you weren't drinking.

599
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,860
Let's drink.
