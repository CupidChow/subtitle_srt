00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,370
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,490
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:23,350
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,880
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,900
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,510
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,570
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,130
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,770
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,870
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,920
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,090
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,640
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,320
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,480
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,590
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,850
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,180
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,420
~ Episode 7 ~

22
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Was Breaking the Ninth Cloud recorded in a book?

23
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,560
This is Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

24
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,100
Father!

25
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,590
Right.

26
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,370
We, Mystic Soul, were originated from Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

27
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,520
Back then, the founders of Mystic Soul Clique

28
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,800
got a few pages on the inner methods of Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

29
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,490
Within a few months, they become famous heroes in different places that shook the world.

30
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,230
Then, they created what is the Mystic Soul Clique now.

31
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,990
Later, after being passed over a few generations, those pages disappeared.

32
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,450
Breaking the Ninth Cloud disappeared then.

33
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,800
Then, how come it was me who got to learn it?

34
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,380
Uncle Zhou, hurry and leave.

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,760
As long as I stay here, they won't do anything to you.

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,040
Since I've come, I don't plan to leave.

37
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,490
Come with me.

38
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,180
Let's go.

39
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,550
Something happened!

40
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,030
- Hurry and report to the Clique Leader.
- All right.

41
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,070
Where is this?

42
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,200
This secret path can reach outside.

43
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,970
If we leave like this, what about Xiaoqi and the rest?

44
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,170
Don’t worry, Xiaoqi is waiting for you down the mountain.

45
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,230
Hurry and go. They'll catch up soon.

46
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,740
Go!

47
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,600
Uncle Zhou!

48
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,760
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou!

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,400
- Uncle Zhou!
- Child.

50
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,890
- Uncle Zhou!
- Child, stop trying.

51
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,540
There must be a way! Uncle Zhou!

52
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,280
Child, listen to me.

53
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,350
You were born as a non-ordinary person.

54
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,530
Uncle Zhou, stop talking.

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,250
When you were born, you already had Five Seals on you.

56
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,430
Listen to me. Listen to me.

57
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,000
If these Five Seals were never activated,

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,050
you initially could live peacefully for your whole life.

59
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,910
But, unfortunately, you mastered Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

60
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,060
And this Inner Power and Technique of Breaking the Ninth Cloud

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,020
conformed to your inner vital channels.

62
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,320
These Five Seals were then activated.

63
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,200
And this also destined your fate in the future.

64
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,860
Uncle Zhou, Uncle Zhou.

65
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,170
No, you can’t, Uncle Zhou.

66
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,270
Child.

67
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,960
This is Five-Colored Stone.

68
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,990
When I saw you that year, it was hanging on your neck.

69
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,110
Now, I return it to its rightful owner.

70
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,430
Wear it and go to all the nations of the Five Regions.

71
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,000
There will always be a place with a condensation of spiritual influence.

72
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,300
Five-Colored Stone will help you to reach there.

73
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,650
- and remove the seals for you.
- Uncle Zhou!

74
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,300
Uncle Zhou!

75
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,800
- Uncle Zhou.
- That's all that I can tell you.

76
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,210
You have to find the other answers yourself.

77
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,140
Nothing will happen to you, Uncle Zhou.

78
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,770
Nothing will happen to you.

79
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,800
It's all right. Endure it a bit more, Uncle Zhou.

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,520
Child,

81
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,240
do you know that I usually hit you and yelled at you,

82
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,130
but in my lifetime, you're my biggest...

83
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,060
biggest pride.

84
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,100
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou...

85
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:31,300
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou!

86
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,760
Uncle Zhou!

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,420
Uncle Zhou!

88
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,970
Uncle Zhou.

89
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,540
- All right.
- Official Zhang.

90
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,530
I have to enter the palace. Hurry up and bring me to the king.

91
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:18,860
King, the sky roof of Imperial Qilin Stage has cracked open.

92
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,600
I’m afraid Capital Kun will be drowned in water.

93
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
King, please take care of your body.

94
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,230
We, Deep Water, can’t survive without you.

95
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,200
Retribution... This is retribution!

96
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,530
Hurry up.

97
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,010
Prime Minister, nice shot.

98
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,150
Heir Apparent, do you want to come and warm up your body as well?

99
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,460
Prime Minister, no.

100
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,910
It's better for you to do this kind of tiring and sweaty work.

101
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,670
I'll just let it pass.

102
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,840
An urgent letter from Capital Kun.

103
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,150
Prime Minister, is this letter from Capital Kun asking me to go back to the Capital and inherit the Heir Apparent's position?

104
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,900
Stay calm, Heir Apparent.

105
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,130
If we have to return to the Capital, I will inform you.

106
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,700
But this—

107
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,750
Heir Apparent, please.

108
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,520
Prime Minister, you still haven’t told me what’s written on—

109
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,270
Send Heir Apparent to his room safely to have some rest.

110
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,330
Heir Apparent, please.

111
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,800
The weather is so good.

112
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,300
Why do I have to rest?

113
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,190
[Prime Minister, I have been attending by the King's side lately. The King is in a critical state. He eats little and often spits blood.]

114
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,920
[The imperial doctor told me privately that the King is at his last hour. I'm writing you in hopes that you'll have some arrangement early.]

115
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,410
Godfather, is there something serious happening in Capital Kun?

116
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,820
The king can’t live for too long.

117
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,660
I’m afraid once the king dies, the whole Capital Kun will be—

118
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,070
I’ll prepare people and horses.

119
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,330
Let’s return to Capital Kun immediately.

120
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,230
Is there any news from Fei Yan?

121
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,300
Let's wait.

122
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,600
But, Godfather, if no one stations in Capital Kun, I’m afraid Deep Water may be drowned in water.

123
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,360
I know.

124
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,890
If we don’t have Water Manipulation Technique, we can’t protect Capital Kun.

125
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,590
If there’s no Capital Kun, the whole Deep Water will be destroyed.

126
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,200
Could it be that I traveled so far to here just to help an idiot Heir Apparent to be enthroned

127
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,940
just because he has the Xuanyuan family’s blood?

128
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,380
Could it be that only he can be the king of Deep Water and save the citizens of Deep Water?

129
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,790
What do people’s lives and Deep Water's fate

130
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,770
have to do with me?

131
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,650
But, Godfather, you’re the Prime Minister.

132
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:20,690
I'm already sick of just being the Prime Minister who is below one person and above the rest!

133
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,400
Having my power today,

134
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,770
even if he’s the Megrez emperor of the Five Regions, I wouldn’t even care.

135
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,160
How can I submit to just a measly King of Deep Water Nation?

136
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,710
Godfather, in a great disaster, no one can escape unscathed.

137
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,120
That's the excuse of a weak one.

138
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,260
Remember. If the heavens will try to kill me, I will go against it.

139
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,490
Who said only the Xuanyuan bloodline can be the king of Deep Water?

140
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,110
Wait with me here.

141
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm waiting for a chance even if I have to bury the whole Deep Water for it.

142
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,430
Let me ask you. What's the present situation of Five Regions?

143
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,120
The present situation remains turbulent.

144
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,970
All nations are ready to fight against each other.

145
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,420
What about the situation at Deep Water?

146
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,230
The situation is very complicated.

147
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,910
A palace plot will be triggered at any moment.

148
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,030
Then, what about the recent conditions of us, Mystic Soul?

149
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,640
We are not as good as what we used to be.

150
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,680
Our Mystic Soul had lost Breaking the Ninth Cloud for a very long time.

151
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,660
We are now just an empty skeleton.

152
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,530
It's fine if the Breaking the Ninth Cloud had never appeared,

153
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:15,430
but Fuyao surprised everyone in the Hunting and Fighting Game now.

154
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,230
I’m afraid that others started eyeing it now.

155
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:22,530
Whoever gets Breaking the Ninth Cloud first

156
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,730
will get the first strike during this chaotic world.

157
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,330
Chen’er will work hard and will not let Mystic Soul Clique down.

158
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,040
I won't let Father down.

159
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,090
Well said.

160
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,210
Whether we, Mystic Soul Clique, can recover the past glory,

161
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,720
it’s all depending on this Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

162
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,340
Father!

163
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,110
These are all useless things and weeds.

164
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,090
What I want is a living Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

165
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,260
Fuyao trusts you.

166
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,330
Only you can make her take this medicine.

167
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,710
But this is... this is Spirit Breaker Powder.

168
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,500
Right. An hour after she swallows it,

169
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,840
whatever you want to know, she will tell you honestly,

170
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,050
big or small.

171
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,390
But after one hour...

172
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,740
Her spirit and soul will both be lost.

173
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,810
She will then become...

174
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,560
a pile of rotting meat forever.

175
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,150
You should end the slave servant you know since your youth by yourself.

176
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,630
This is my punishment for you.

177
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,990
This is also a chance for you to prove to Mystic Soul Clique’s ancestors that

178
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:16,230
you are able to bear the heavy duty of reviving Mystic Soul.

179
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,230
- Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou!
- Run!

180
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,090
- I'll pour you some more.
- I'll do it.

181
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,510
I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

182
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,970
You were born as a non-ordinary person.

183
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,500
You already had Five Seals on you.

184
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,410
This matter is not up to you to decide.

185
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,200
They are not something you can survive from with your measly martial arts.

186
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,000
Uncle Zhou, don't worry.

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,500
I will definitely accomplish the mission.

188
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,970
Have a safe journey.

189
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,260
Are you thinking about how to report to your Emperor Father on the fulfillment of one's duty?

190
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,710
You’ve been reminding me the whole day that I’m Crown Prince Wuji, Crown Prince Wuji.

191
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,960
My mission is to stop the turmoil in Deep Water

192
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,810
so I can return Megrez to report to Emperor Father on the fulfillment of my duty.

193
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,500
Calluses are forming in my ears already by listening to this.

194
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,450
Then, I have to remind you some more.

195
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,560
Have you thought about

196
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,950
why Qi Zhen is not willing to depart to Capital Kun?

197
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,240
Qi Zhen will definitely not leave for Capital Kun right now.

198
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,190
He has sent men to look for Illusion Palace.

199
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,950
He wants to ask for the Palace Leader Fei Yan, doesn't he?

200
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,480
He painstakingly concealed his intentions for ten years

201
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,070
and killed Heir Apparent Wenyi who was like his older brother.

202
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,580
Are these all for the throne of Deep Water?

203
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,270
Now he is limited to the Water Manipulation Technique of the Xuanyuan bloodline.

204
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,590
So he has to support me to be enthroned for nothing.

205
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,450
Tell me. Will he be happy with it?

206
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,300
Is his asking for the Palace Leader Fei Yan only to obtain the Water Manipulation Technique?

207
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,750
The whereabouts of the Palace Leader Fei Yan has always been mysterious.

208
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,670
Although she has a palace in Linzhou,

209
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:21,090
most don't know that it is just an illusion.

210
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,630
Exactly. If Linzhou can have its Illusion Palace,

211
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,760
how come it can't appear here in Mt. Mystic Soul?

212
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,320
If Palace Leader Fei Yan really agrees with his request,

213
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,420
your life will be in danger then.

214
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,780
It's good that you know.

215
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:41,370
Just for your Xuanyuan clan, I've over-exhausted myself.

216
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,430
I already have no connection with the Xuanyuan clan.

217
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,680
You know very well what I'm after.

218
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,540
All right, all right, all right.

219
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,630
Consider it like I said the wrong thing.

220
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,610
How come you always like to square accounts in every detail?

221
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:11,110
If I wasn't like this, would I have survived until today?

222
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,040
Don’t worry.

223
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,550
Both of us will definitely live longer than that old man.

224
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,590
Fuyao! Fuyao!

225
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,200
If she really escaped,

226
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,610
that would also be great.

227
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,250
It would also be great.

228
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,170
Bribing the guards to drag me here.

229
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,420
Senior Sister Pei, you really racked your brains.

230
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,150
Clique Leader keeps you for Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

231
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,670
Do you think he cares about your life?

232
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,250
My letting you die now is giving you a straightforward manner of dying.

233
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,130
You should thank me.

234
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,450
Even if I wanted to die, it wouldn't be today.

235
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,620
It's not up to you.

236
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,270
Senior Sister Pei, you won't be able to kill me like this.

237
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,700
I know you have abilities but don't forget

238
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,490
that I braved the punishments from the Clique Leader

239
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:56,530
and the blames from First Senior Brother to tie you up here today.

240
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,660
I won't let you go back alive that easily.

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
- A'Lie!
- Yes!

242
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,800
Xiaoqi!

243
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,510
- Older Sis Fuyao!
- Xiaoqi, you!

244
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,120
Older Sis Fuyao, don't bother about me. Hurry and leave! Hurry and leave!

245
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,710
Either you die or he'll die.

246
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,880
Fuyao, you choose yourself.

247
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,330
Older Sis Fuyao, don't listen to her!

248
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,440
Don't fall into their trap!

249
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,610
Why must the grudges between us involve others?

250
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,700
Don't say that it's one person.

251
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,590
If I have to involve the life of every lowly slave in Mystic Black Section, so what?

252
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,930
- You!
- Hurry and leave.

253
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,890
Are you not happy with this?

254
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,440
Let’s see if you’re faster or if my sword is.

255
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,340
Older Sis Fuyao, don't worry.

256
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,230
I will never drag you down. Leave!

257
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,360
I can't leave!

258
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:59,380
Earlier Uncle Zhou had lost his life because of me.

259
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,040
More so, I can't let anything happen to you.

260
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,780
So, you have to stay alive

261
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,860
so as not to make his painstaking efforts go in vain.

262
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,630
Xiaoqi!

263
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,760
You're seeking your death!

264
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,900
- Xiaoqi!
- I’ll fulfill your wish.

265
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,840
Wait a second!

266
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,750
My life is yours.

267
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,900
Whether you want to kill me or not, it all depends on you.

268
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,190
Godfather, there is news from Palace Leader Fei Yan finally.

269
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,910
Hurry and get prepared.

270
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,390
Yes.

271
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,560
Even the heavens are helping me.

272
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,620
Fuyao, don't blame me for being cruel.

273
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,570
The only person you can blame is yourself.

274
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:21,340
You shouldn't have come to Mt. Mystic Soul.

275
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,160
First Senior Brother has agreed to the engagement with you.

276
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,260
Why do you still have to kill me?

277
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,700
Do you think that I want to dirty my hands?

278
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,160
It's all your fault.

279
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,800
Why didn't you die nicely during the Hunting and Fighting Game?

280
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,950
Why did you have to steal the show in front of everybody?

281
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,880
If you don't die,

282
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,940
First Senior Brother will have you in his mind for his entire lifetime.

283
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,250
Do you think that even if I die,

284
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,490
First Senior Brother would have you in his heart?

285
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:50,810
Thinking about a dead person

286
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,630
would be better than thinking about an alive person.

287
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,300
Are you jumping or not?

288
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,940
Don't!

289
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,580
Don't agree to it, Older Sis Fuyao!

290
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,010
Okay, I can promise you to go die.

291
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,630
However, you also have to promise me to let Xiaoqi go.

292
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,780
Also, everyone in Mystic Black Section.

293
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,030
If just you alone die, everyone else can live.

294
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:29,260
Remember your words.

295
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:33,910
If you break your promises, I won't let you off even when I am a ghost!

296
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,650
Don't! Older Sis Fuyao!

297
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,190
Don't!

298
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,970
Xiaoqi,

299
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,420
live well.

300
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,730
Don't! Don't!

301
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,030
Don't!

302
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,960
Falling from such a high cliff, Fuyao will definitely be dead this time.

303
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,440
This lowly slave is very cunning.

304
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,530
That she is able to simply jump down

305
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,720
must be because she must think that she knows the terrain of Mt. Mystic Soul very well

306
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,800
and she still has a chance to live.

307
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,820
Unfortunately, I already planned everything.

308
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,200
I don't believe that this time she can still stay alive.

309
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:17,130
I am curious to see, if I break my promises,

310
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:21,500
how would a dead person like her take revenge on me?

311
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:26,030
- Throw him down!
- Yes.

312
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,450
Xiaoqi!

313
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,510
Godfather, I have scouted the terrain of this area.

314
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:54,570
The sun, the moon, the hills, the bodies of water, and even the grass and the trees

315
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,580
all fit the criteria for the appearance of the Holy Palace.

316
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:02,510
Mt. Mystic Soul is a mystic land of the Five Regions to begin with.

317
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,100
The last bloodline of the Royal Xuanyuan Clan came from this exact place.

318
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,520
I believe Palace Leader Fei Yan's holy palace will appear here, too.

319
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,480
It seems that I've made the right bet.

320
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,000
Yun Hen, have you taken care of everything?

321
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,120
Everything has been taken care of.

322
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,940
We've set up barriers around the area.

323
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,810
I have appointed a lot of guards at each checkpoint.

324
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,690
Even the people from Mt. Mystic Soul won't come to interrupt.

325
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:32,470
It should be almost time.

326
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,930
The king of Deep Water Nation is approaching the end of his life.

327
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,070
The Capital of Deep Water, Capital Kun, is infected by disasters of water.

328
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,580
If I am able to master the Water Manipulation Technique,

329
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,470
the troubles of Deep Water Nation and the suffering of the citizens in Capital Kun

330
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,670
will both be resolved.

331
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,740
Only the bloodline of Xuanyuan can manage the Water Manipulation Technique.

332
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,830
This is the rule that has been present since the establishment of the Five Regions.

333
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:04,250
Is the reason you want the Water Manipulation Technique for the kingship or the citizens?

334
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,630
Kingship.

335
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,080
I want to be the king of Deep Water.

336
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,660
All of the requests require cost of the same price.

337
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,370
Time rotates. Everything changes.

338
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,980
The reason that Palace Leader has the face right now

339
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,700
is probably because of the lifespan of the royalties, right?

340
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,480
Palace Leader, no need to be anxious.

341
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,920
I have everything you want

342
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,890
as long as you help me to fulfill my wishes.

343
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,330
All right.

344
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,330
I will help you to fulfill your wishes.

345
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,350
On the day of the red moon, using the Earth Absorbing Bell as a token,

346
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,010
using the blood of Xuanyuan as guide, and sacrifices to the heavens and the earth,

347
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,680
you can then master the Water Manipulation Technique

348
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,250
and be comparable to anyone of the Xuanyuan bloodline.

349
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:25,980
Palace Leader Feiyuan, you indeed live up to your reputation.

350
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:30,580
If you gain something, you must lose something.

351
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:33,520
Remember your promises.

352
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,760
Everyone says Mt. Mystic Soul is known as the paradise

353
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,390
where people improve their health and build their characters.

354
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:56,650
I didn't expect that they would be this cruel and ruthless.

355
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,120
They didn't even let go of a girl.

356
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:02,970
If everyone were as compassionate as Heir Apparent, the world would be at peace.

357
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,980
Medical Sage, you are flattering me. Please.

358
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,800
How dare you, guys!

359
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,460
You can't find her. Why did you bring me here?

360
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,200
Senior Sister Pei.

361
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,080
Reporting to Clique Leader, the paths down the mountain, the forest, and the rivers have all been searched.

362
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,180
There was no sign of Fuyao.

363
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,330
Reporting to Clique Leader, the bottom of Mt. Mystic Soul, the canyon, and the cliff have all been searched.

364
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,590
We did not find Fuyao.

365
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:30,770
Reporting to Clique Leader, within the mountain, Mystic Main Section, and Mystic Black Section have all been searched.

366
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:32,950
There was no sign of Fuyao.

367
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,280
Continue searching.

368
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,990
If she is alive, I want to see her; if she is dead, I want to see her corpse.

369
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,010
Yes.

370
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,720
Teacher, I know my mistakes.

371
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:56,560
Are you just so unable to endure it?

372
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,730
That slave servant is going to die sooner or later.

373
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,320
Do you know what you did will destroy my plan?

374
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,600
Teacher, don’t be angry.

375
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,600
I've set up traps under the cliff.

376
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,530
She would not survive even if she were extremely capable.

377
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,300
I want her alive.

378
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,190
She is able to give you the Breaking the Ninth Cloud that you want if she’s alive.

379
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,270
But even if Breaking the Ninth Cloud is good, if the cultivator doesn’t have good luck

380
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,820
and has no one to appreciate it,

381
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,430
then that is just having the techniques in vain with no place to show.

382
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:25,290
What exactly are you trying to say?

383
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,840
What Teacher is doing is all for Senior Brother.

384
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,530
No matter if it’s Breaking the Ninth Cloud or the Hunting and Fighting Game,

385
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,590
you’re laying down a path for Senior Brother. Are you not?

386
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,030
And I’m going to marry Senior Brother soon.

387
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,110
Whatever Teacher wants to give to Senior Brother, I can give all.

388
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,730
Of course, I know you're for Jingchen's good.

389
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,200
I also appreciate the Prime Minister’s appreciation.

390
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,650
But a person must have achievements, whether it's true nepotism or fated chance.

391
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,320
In the end, he still needs to rely on his own skills.

392
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,240
In this world, there isn't anything that can forever stand and not fall.

393
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,640
More so, no one can live by their own luck forever.

394
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,950
When you can’t rely on either of these,

395
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:04,460
you still have to rely on yourself in the end.

396
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,370
Breaking the Ninth Cloud is the chip for Jingchen to be able to rely on himself in the future.

397
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,760
Do you understand?

398
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,370
Teacher, why are you worrying about these?

399
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,360
Even if every dog has its day,

400
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,390
based on the foundation, power and influence of my uncle and Pei family in Deep Water Nation,

401
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,120
whatever Teacher is worrying about will never happen.

402
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,650
That’s enough.

403
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,660
I won’t fuss about this anymore.

404
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,340
But you have to remember,

405
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,360
you must not let Jingchen know that you forced Fuyao to jump off the cliff, to prevent creating other issues.

406
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,810
Of course, I understand this.

407
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,160
Go back then.

408
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,350
No matter if Fuyao is alive or dead, don’t meddle with this matter anymore.

409
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,830
- But, Teacher—
- You, listen!

410
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,380
Even if you are already married to Jingchen today,

411
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,730
even if Jingchen has become the Clique Leader,

412
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,980
issues of Mystic Soul Clique are Mystic Soul Clique's after all.

413
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,930
They have nothing to do with you and your uncle.

414
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,350
Yes.

415
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,160
Miss.

416
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,390
It's only a lowly life. Why does it become my fault?

417
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,460
Say! Did I do wrong because I killed Fuyao?

418
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:21,020
Whatever Miss does or says are all correct.

419
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,450
What right or wrong do you know?

420
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:24,960
You only know to repeat uncritically what others say.

421
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,930
No use at all!

422
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,280
Why are you standing there? Are you feeling wronged because I hit you?

423
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,980
Tiantu.

424
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,190
Zigong.

425
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,510
Shaohai.

426
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,590
Quze.

427
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,180
Turn around and have your back toward the window.

428
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,980
Move all the Qi in your body towards Kunlun and Zhaohai.

429
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,830
Where is Xiaoqi?

430
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,020
He’s okay. But he needs some rest.

431
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,960
I already ordered people to send him to a safe place.

432
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,530
Thank you for saving us.

433
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:43,050
You don’t have to thank me.

434
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,290
I did not save you by my own will.

435
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,710
I just tried my best to do what was entrusted to me by others.

436
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,790
Do you mean—

437
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,760
Besides that busybody, who else will do this?

438
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,680
Why did he save me?

439
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,790
Right, he can’t even protect himself.

440
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,870
Why does he still meddle in other's affairs?

441
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:05,830
Can’t protect himself?

442
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,260
Godfather.

443
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:21,160
Use the fastest eagle to send this letter to Heaven Fiend Nation.

444
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,910
- Heaven Fiend Nation?
- Yes.

445
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:27,110
You must personally hand it to the King Zhan Nancheng of Heaven Fiend Nation.

446
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,350
I want to borrow his Earth Absorbing Bell.

447
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,850
Earth Absorbing Bell?

448
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,600
That’s Heaven Fiend Nation’s treasure.

449
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,980
I know.

450
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,820
I’ll exchange it with something he cares about the most.

451
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,950
I’m not afraid that he won’t lend it to me.

452
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,280
Yes.

453
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,590
"In the day of the red moon, using the Earth Absorbing Bell as a token,

454
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,950
using the blood of Xuanyuan as guide."

455
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,340
Do you understand what Palace Leader means?

456
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:57,100
Using the blood of the Xuanyuan clan as an offering to the heavens and earth on the night of the red moon,

457
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,620
using the Earth Absorbing Bell to lure his spiritual sense into my body,

458
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,700
I can then master the Water Manipulation Technique.

459
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:09,110
From that day on, I won’t have to follow those bullshit rules about the inheritance through bloodlines.

460
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,330
I will become the king of Deep Water Nation.

461
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:15,610
No one can stop me again. Understand?

462
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,850
Cage Xuanyuan Min.

463
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,550
Starting today, until the night of the red moon,

464
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,780
you cannot let him escape from your sight for a single minute.

465
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,230
Yes.

466
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:32,960
Never make any mistake.

467
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,680
I haven't seen you for a few days. Your skills have improved a lot.

468
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,820
Secret Guard Jiang Feng greets Crown Prince Wuji.

469
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,080
Did anyone see you?

470
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,580
No.

471
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:29,000
What's the situation outside?

472
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,920
Just like you predicted, Qi Zhen has met with Palace Leader Fei Yan.

473
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,080
I heard that just by offering the blood of a Xuanyuan bloodline,

474
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,660
using the Earth Absorbing Bell of the Heaven Fiend Nation to transfer the spiritual sense,

475
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,500
then it can transfer Xuanyuan clan's Water Manipulation Technique to Qi Zhen.

476
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,250
When I was on my way here, I saw that Qi Zhen’s people were rushing towards here.

477
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:48,600
I’m afraid that they may hurt Your Highness.

478
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,190
I've predicted that he would attack.

479
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,370
I just didn't expect him to be so impatient.

480
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,910
All right.

481
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,650
Move according to our plan.

482
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,170
Yes.

483
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,390
You’re Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez Empire.

484
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,700
You're the future heir apparent to the throne to manage Five Regions.

485
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,000
Your mission is to pacify the uprisings in the vassal states without shedding any blood.

486
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,790
Father, are they going to hurt the Heir Apparent?

487
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:51,220
Heir Apparent.

488
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,080
Heir Apparent.

489
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,700
Open the door.

490
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,510
Search.

491
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,170
Official Yun, there was a carriage that busted through our barricade.

492
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,280
That’s the Heir Apparent. After him!

493
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,770
Pretend that you never saw this and this never happened.

494
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,900
I don’t care about what Qi Zhen is thinking.

495
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,970
We both must just understand one thing.

496
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:20,450
We have made our bet on Qi Zhen.

497
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,590
We can only hope that he wins.

498
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:27,860
Without using any soldier, I can still pacify the uprising in the vassal state.

499
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,990
Qi Zhen, the best part of the play is coming soon.

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

501
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:55,500
♫ What do you know? ♫

502
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,490
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

503
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,320
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

504
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,560
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

505
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,130
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

506
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:14,080
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

507
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:17,130
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

508
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,520
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

509
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:27,670
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

510
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,560
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

511
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,760
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

512
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,220
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

513
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,170
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

514
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,390
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

515
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:51,830
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

516
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,870
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

517
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:02,050
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

518
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,840
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

519
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:07,920
♫ Cne is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

520
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,990
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

521
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,210
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

522
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:20,230
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

523
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,830
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

524
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,660
♫ Have someone's company ♫

525
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,690
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

526
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,830
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

527
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,730
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

528
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:39,770
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

529
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:42,700
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

530
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,980
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

531
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:52,460
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

532

♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
