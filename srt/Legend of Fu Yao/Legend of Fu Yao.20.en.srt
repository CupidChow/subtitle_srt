00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,560
Second Mister.

23
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,640
Mr. Qiu, you– !

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,240
Second Mister...

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,150
Second Mister, I drag out an ignoble existence till now

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,990
just to let Mister know who your enemy is.

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,430
You can never be softhearted and light-handed;

28
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,360
more so, you can't name the villain as your father!

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:10,330
Otherwise-Otherwise, Heir Apparent won't be able to rest in peace in the heavens, Second Mister.

[Heavenly Peace Gate]

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,220
Isn't the new king a bit too careless?

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,450
Choosing consorts is a matter of great importance, yet he acted in such an unbelievable manner.

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,230
Are we going to support such a careless man?

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,090
If this continues, what might Deep Water turn into?

35
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,320
In the past, I thought that this king was young and overly playful.

36
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,440
But this is just a puppet Qi Zhen is using to control the imperial court.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,540
However, looking at the past few days,

38
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,140
there seems to be another arrangement hidden under all this ridiculousness.

39
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,520
Look at this! Look at this!

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
This is the plot you've planted!

41
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,800
Oh, my Prime Minister!

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,360
Prime Minister, where did you find that Xuanyuan Min?

43
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,970
Of all the matters he could have muddled with,

44
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,790
he had to muddle with the important matter of the internal palace choosing consorts.

45
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,220
Now, he conferred the titles in public and only excluded my daughter.

46
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,630
If Ruo'er really lost her chance to enter the palace,

47
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,220
I, Prefect Xiping, will never accept it!

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,120
Elegant Misses entered into the palace today.

49
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,970
If the past rules and logic were followed, no unexpected troubles should have arisen.

50
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,470
But His Majesty came up with a new idea which is just to have something different.

51
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,770
With a sudden change,

52
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,940
we, as his subjects, had no way to stop him.

53
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,670
Prime Minister,

54
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,800
you were the one in support for that youngster to take the throne.

55
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,570
If you wash your hands of this matter

56
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,290
and hand such a big Deep Water to a nitwit to mess with,

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,630
then you will definitely be censured in the future.

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,000
Prince, that's an overstatement.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,640
My Ruo'er failed to be chosen.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,500
Yet the daughter from the Tang family, Tang Zhirong, was kept!

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,990
Prime Minister, say,

62
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,920
in terms of appearance and family background, what is my Ruo'er lacking compared to her?

63
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,310
If Prime Minister isn't calculating Tang Bonian's 150,000 soldiers

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,960
and even his highest merit from restraining the bandits in the southwest,

65
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
Prime Minister is thinking that winning over the support of the Tang family is the best plan.

66
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,700
Wait a minute.

67
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,000
It is true that Tang Bonian has over 100,000 soldiers under his control.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But who in the whole imperial court doesn't know that

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,820
the one with the greatest power and military strength is you, Prefect Xiping?

70
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,590
If I were to rely on someone, I would rely on you.

71
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:03,220
The choosing of the consorts was entirely chosen by spinning the jade spinner.

72
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,450
Prime Minister, I already have 13 sons.

73
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,890
But I have only a daughter, Ruo'er.

74
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,700
I bear the pain of parting with her to send her into the palace.

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,690
My Ruo'er must become the queen in the future.

76
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,530
Today has been a thoroughly unlucky day!

77
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,550
We, Xiping Prefecture, have always been one of the most prominent families in the Deep Water.

78
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,240
We have never lost the King's favor.

79
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,940
Which king didn't bond with our family by marriage?

80
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,560
Which Deep Water king doesn't have the blood of our family flowing in him?

81
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,860
Prefecture Princess, please cease your anger.

82
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,460
Don't get yourself sick from being angry.

83
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,330
Talking about loyalty,

84
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,630
talking about glory,

85
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,840
who is comparable to our Xiping family in Deep Water?

86
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:05,630
Everyone says that I was born to be the queen!

87
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,300
But now, why don't I even have the qualification to enter into the palace?

88
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,350
No way. I must find my father to think of a solution.

89
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,990
The title of Lady Precious, Virtue, Virtuous, Fair are not all confirmed today.

90
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,940
There is also room to discuss the candidate for the queen.

91
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,590
Internal affairs in the palace are trivial.

92
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,350
Changes are common.

93
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,500
Prince, cease your anger. Return for some rest first.

94
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
Leave this matter to me.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,820
I've promised you before. I surely won't break my word.

96
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,700
Prime Minister!

97
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,220
Come in.

98
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:48,350
Official, this is an imperial edict that was just delivered.

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,390
I'll say what I have to say about today's matter here.

100
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,510
If Ruo'er doesn't get chosen and disgraces our Xiping Prefecture,

101
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,940
I naturally won't care about other people's reputations.

102
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,810
Your Highness, please stall.

103
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,350
This imperial edict states, that His Majesty had conferred Prefecture Princess the title of Lady Virtuous.

104
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:19,200
I believe your manor must have also received this edict now.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,580
It really...

106
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,030
It really is my Ruo'er.

107
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,560
Now Prince can rest assured, right?

108
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,860
What does the Prime Minister mean by that?

109
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,670
Isn't it your wish for your daughter to be conferred?

110
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,030
If Prime Minister already had this planned,

111
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,060
why did you have to make it troublesome for me and my daughter?

112
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:52,160
Could it be Prime Minister wanted to show off your powers to us Xiping Prefecture

113
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,270
or were you afraid that I wouldn't be like Tang Bonian, following Prime Minister's lead?

114
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,970
Prince, where did you come up with that?

115
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,090
His Majesty suddenly changed his mind.

116
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,470
Even I also just got to know of this just now.

117
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,670
Moreover, I've always seen Prince as a close friend.

118
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,900
How is it possible for me to use intrigue and tricks?

119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,860
I hope so.

120
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,950
If Prime Minister has the heart to play tricks and pick on me being incompetent,

121
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,940
I will never leave the matter alone.

122
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,190
Prince, you've overthought.

123
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,950
I'm taking my leave.

124
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:41,880
If it weren't for him having control over massive military forces and might be of use to me,

125
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,830
I would never let a prince with a different surname arrogantly boss me around.

126
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,820
Was there any news about why His Majesty suddenly changed his mind again?

127
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,160
No.

128
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,770
The imperial edict has been delivered to the Prime Minister's Manor.

129
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,840
Prefect Xiping was also present.

130
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,700
What was Gao Hao's reaction?

131
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,600
As Mister anticipated, he seemed angered when he left the Manor.

132
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,430
It's just that since you knew Qi Zhen and Prefect Xiping have collusion between them,

133
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,090
why did you still confer Gao Puruo as a Lady?

134
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,400
Isn't that like raising a tiger to one's detriment?

135
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,330
Gao Song is a man with short temper who is overly skeptical.

136
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,310
He also has the strategical advantage of having control over the southwest border.

137
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,400
He's used to being arrogant and oppressive.

138
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,540
Although he and Qi Zhen have colluded, they are also cautious of each other.

139
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,290
I let his daughter fail to be chosen this time so that he could vent his anger.

140
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,660
Only with this venting,

141
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,590
would the animosity between them grow stronger.

142
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:57,270
But he has vented, yet you're still going to let this kind of woman into the palace.

143
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,560
Could the Mister be thinking, too?

144
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,760
What are you thinking?

145
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,480
I heard that woman Gao Puruo's personality is the same as her father's.

146
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Not putting a woman like that in the harem,

147
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,100
isn't that too unfortunate?

148
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,460
Making a great fuss.

149
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:29,140
We can only find an opportunity if they make a fuss.

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,720
Mister, well done.

151
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,250
Kill two birds with one stone.

152
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,410
Stand upright.

153
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,540
Are you too into acting?

154
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,070
Yes.

155
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
- This way, please.
- Yes.

156
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,420
Old Master, General Tang Bo Nian's disciple requests for your audience.

157
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,170
- Allow him in.
- Yes.

158
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,930
Please come in.

159
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,350
Your inferior hereby greets and pays his respects to Your Prime Minister on behalf of General Tang Bonian.

160
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,670
General Tang has shown brilliant military service.

161
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,340
He is a hero of Deep Water.

162
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,550
You don't need to conduct yourself with such formality.

163
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,170
For this trip to the capital,

164
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:48,490
General explicitly told me to let you know that he is greatly indebted to you who is as a second parent to him.

165
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,940
He is tied up by his duties and can't personally come here this time.

166
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,550
He specially ordered that I must have good etiquette.

167
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,410
This is a present I brought for Prime Minister to show his filial piety.

168
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,350
We hope Prime Minister will readily accept this gift.

169
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,950
He indeed is very considerate. You can get up.

170
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,730
Thank you, Prime Minister.

171
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,940
Our General said that he's been stationed at the border for all year round.

172
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,520
About the matters pertaining to the imperial court, he really doesn't know much.

173
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,660
Miss was chosen to enter the palace this time is all thanks to your recommendation.

174
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,180
If later on, our Miss gets blessed with the King's favor,

175
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,220
we definitely won't forget the favors you've done on our behalf.

176
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,740
Since she is General Tang's beloved daughter,

177
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,830
of course, I would do my best to help.

178
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,770
Then, we'll rely on Prime Minister.

179
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,130
If Prime Minister doesn't have any other orders for me,

180
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,880
then I will take my leave and report back to the General.

181
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,500
Tang Bonian's response was really fast.

182
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,090
There is a matter I need you to take care of.

183
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,360
By that time, Prince Wenyi's manor was already under surveillance

184
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,980
not even a fly could escape.

185
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,630
In order to preserve you two brother's lives,

186
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,960
Heir Apparent instructed me to go see Qi Zhen

187
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,440
and had me promise to write a report about his rebellion.

188
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,890
Based on this report,

189
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,120
I had gained Qi Zhen's trust;

190
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,790
and in exchange, was given a task of collecting all the corpses from the manor.

191
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:42,570
So I was able to secretly save the lives of both misters

192
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:48,710
and save one branch of the Deep Water royal bloodline.

193
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,390
Heir Apparent...

194
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,050
Heir Apparent had an illustrious name and was victorious in every battle.

195
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,670
But in the end...

196
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,150
he fell into the villains' trap and was framed for treason.

197
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,760
The last order he gave me was all for the sake of preserving his own flesh and blood.

198
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,150
Now, you take a look...

199
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,750
you take a look at the man strutting around in the Prime Minister's manor.

200
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,610
He is still alive!

201
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,600
What is the world coming to?

202
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,480
If I were somewhat capable,

203
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,860
even if I dig his heart out, that wouldn't appease my hatred!

204
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,210
What are you thinking about?

205
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,080
Don't you hurry up to work?

206
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,410
Godfather, I will go do it this instant.

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,630
Selling buns!

208
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:10,310
Hot steamy buns!

209
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,090
[Pleasing Wind Restaurant]

210
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,020
Mr. Zong has come!

211
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,910
I've only not been here for a few days, but Pleasing Wind Restaurant actually became this festive and busy.

212
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,310
Thanks to the owner to use Five Regions renowned Wuba City Gather.

213
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,210
The ad was posted in the whole city that morning.

214
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,450
The chef came that very afternoon!

215
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,890
Look, this is the ad.

216
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,830
If you need a housekeeper, carriage or anything, just go through this agency.

217
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,700
Talking about our chef, don't see that she is young.

218
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,740
But her skills are extraordinary.

219
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,380
As you see, just in these few days, our Pleasing Wind Restaurant has been full all the time.

220
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,640
We're fully booked until the middle of next month.

221
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,620
It's only because Mr. Zong has such a status and position,

222
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,380
the owner especially ordered us to keep a good spot for you.

223
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,860
This way, please.

224
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,340
There's nothing better in life than delicious food.

225
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,400
Pleasing Wind Restaurant was able to hire such a chef.

226
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,730
It'll definitely be the best restaurant in Capital Kun.

227
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,890
- That's right. Please.
- Here. Here.

228
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,360
What would you like to eat, Mr. Zong?

229
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,950
I'll get a serving of sweet and sour shrimp.

230
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,590
Sir, you must be psychic!

231
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,300
This sweet and sour shrimp is exactly our chef's specialty.

232
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,190
Please wait a moment. I'll bring it right up.

233
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,540
Qi Yun?

234
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,300
It really is her.

235
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,720
Older Brother Yue, what are you eating?

236
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,550
- Sweet and sour shrimp.
- I want some, too.

237
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,210
Nope, this is all mine.

238
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,260
Older Brother Yue, you're so mean.

239
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,500
In the future, I will finish all the best food in Capital Kun.

240
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,570
I won't leave you any.

241
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,880
Her incurable disease is actually healed?

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,720
- Guests, how are you enjoying your meal? 
- Have one sweet and sour shrimp!

243
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,760
- It's really good.
- Yes.

244
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,860
Your sweet and sour shrimp.

245
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,410
- You can try our sweet and sour shrimp next time. It's especially delicious.
- Enjoy your meal.

246
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,430
- Okay.
- Okay.
- This dish is quite good.

247
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,210
Who is the chef here?

248
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,890
Okay.

249
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,370
Who is the chef here?

250
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,570
I am, why?

251
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,290
Miss, come with us.

252
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,890
Why should I go with you?

253
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,520
Then, we have no choice but to offend you.

254
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,500
Master Officials, could this just be a misunderstanding?

255
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,330
This here is our newly hired head chef. You—

256
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,800
Get lost!

257
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,680
- Take her away.
- Stop!

258
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,520
Official Yun.

259
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,630
I came late. We've alarmed you, Young Miss.

260
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,020
Please forgive us.

261
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
Come on, Older Brother Yun Hen!

262
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,750
I've only hid for a few days and you've found me.

263
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,120
This is not interesting at all!

264
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,070
Yun'er, it's time for you to come home.

265
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,000
That miss seemed like she came from an impressive background.

266
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,470
Wasn't that Official Yun, from the Prime Minister's manor?

267
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,720
- Was it?
- It was...

268
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,660
- What do you guys think?
- It really is so pretty.

269
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,010
Here inside the palace is actually quite interesting.

270
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,550
Every imperial concubine.

271
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,710
Every imperial concubine was born and raised in a prestigious family.

272
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,550
You all are beautiful with virtue and talent.

273
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,370
However, inside the palace is different from the outside world.

274
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,750
The rules here are strict and serious.

275
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,780
So I invite each of you, starting from tomorrow, to start learning the proper palace etiquette.

276
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:07,080
This is a high grade facial serum, concocted with a unique blend of ingredients specially made for the harem.

277
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,700
It represents His Majesty's kind and considerate intention.

278
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,240
He hopes that after you use this, you will all glow with youthfulness and health.

279
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,550
- Thank you, His Majesty.
- Thank you, His Majesty.

280
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,130
Then I invite every imperial concubine to follow me to Clear Goose Palace.

281
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,990
The palace has prepared each of you a living quarters.

282
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,690
Do you think there might be a trap?

283
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,700
We can live anywhere,

284
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,140
but why must we all be crammed in the back of the palace?

285
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,550
This Clear Goose Palace is the main residence of the harem.

286
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,450
Elegant Misses were selected to be concubines.

287
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,020
Of course, everyone has to live here.

288
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,090
Although the harem is a general term,

289
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,620
there're actually a big differences.

290
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,960
Queens from all generations live in Forever Excellent Palace Hall.

291
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,970
Favoured consorts live in Pleased Lady's House and First Brocade Park.

292
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,270
So if you're neither the queen nor a favored consort,

293
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:56,040
and have no family members or sponsors to support you, what happens then?

294
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,240
- Then they'll be grass widows.
- What?

295
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,300
Say, how come men can have so many concubines, but women can't?

296
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,560
Miss, don't ever say this kind of thing again.

297
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,850
It's true though!

298
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,170
You tell me how one man will have time for all these women.

299
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,600
Accepting so many women into the palace, but then ignoring them.

300
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,290
Wouldn't that ruin their lives forever?

301
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,190
- Miss, don't say that!
- What?

302
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,770
I think I just saw right over there...

303
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,430
a multicolored phoenix fly by.

304
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,760
Right, right, right, it just flew by... just flew by.

305
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,190
- I don't see it.
- That's right.

306
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,970
This multicolored phoenix is the mythical beast of Plough.

307
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,670
Miss Yuwen must have seen wrong.

308
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,450
Oh, I saw wrong. I saw wrong.

309
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,560
Every imperial concubine.

310
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,980
This is Forever Excellent Palace Hall.

311
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,560
Out of all of us,

312
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,040
the one most blessed with the best luck is you, Older Sister.

313
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,150
I've heard my father say that your father is our Deep Water's bigger-then-life, powerful, renowned General.

314
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,030
And now, you're also conferred the title of Consort Precious.

315
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,580
This Forever Excellent Palace Hall will definitely belong to you in the near future.

316
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,690
To be able to protect over Deep Water is also our Tang family's glory.

317
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,220
This Forever Excellent Palace Hall is the private living quarters of the Deep Water Queen.

318
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,060
How could I be blessed with such glory and favor?

319
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,490
As for Miss Jian Xue,

320
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,700
her father, Official Jian Shen, was the cream of the crop personally promoted by Marquis Zhang.

321
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,190
It is said that the God of Wisdom Star shines upon him.

322
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:49,130
Of course, Miss Jian is beautiful both inside and out.

323
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:51,710
You definitely have such huge potential.

324
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,560
I—

325
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,450
Miss Yuwen is Prime Minister's goddaughter who he took under his wing.

326
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,260
Having such a godfather as the backer,

327
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:08,010
everything will surely go smoothly in the future.

328
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,190
If it really plays out like the way you've just described,

329
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,530
then I will definitely treat everyone to a drink.

330
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,160
Everyone look, who is that?

331
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,600
And why is she even sitting in a sedan chair?

332
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,260
Yeah. Why can she sit in a sedan chair?

333
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,430
Your Majesty personally delivered an imperial edict to confer me as Lady Virtuous.

334
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,580
Right, he even granted me a sedan chair.

335
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,400
What?

336
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,020
Did you all have to walk over?

337
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,660
Such a far distance, you must be tired.

338
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,470
You didn't expect this, did you?

339
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,810
You're right.

340
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,100
If it wasn't for the luck that the red mark brought for you that day,

341
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,680
how would His Majesty know you were so beautiful and attractive?

342
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,410
You– !

343
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,760
You– !

344
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,240
Someone come! Someone come!

345
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,660
This one dared to hit me!

346
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,760
Someone come to arrest her!

347
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,930
Which eye did you see me hit you?

348
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,090
Do you have evidence?

349
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,490
- You– !
- You have just entered the palace and already make such a fuss.

350
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,580
Did you want His Majesty to hear of this?

351
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,210
I see that you don't want to keep the conferred titles you just received.

352
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,280
His Majesty's consorts should be intelligent, kind, well-mannered and virtuous as the top criteria.

353
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,150
A few sisters' virtues are really an eye-opener.

354
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,590
Who are you? Who are you to frighten us?

355
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,430
Then continue making a fuss.

356
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,240
His Majesty...

357
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,130
His Majesty's temperament is hard to grasp.

358
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,840
If we were to really anger him,

359
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,320
what are we to do?

360
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,430
At the worst, we could all surrender our titles.

361
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:38,490
Let's go and explain it to the King.

362
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,610
As if I'd be bothered with you.

363
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:46,120
The King's imperial edict is here.

364
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,110
Mistress, your living quarters have been arranged.

365
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,310
The imperial edict hereby announces!

366
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,540
Lady Precious, Tang Zhirong, has been assigned to Forever Excellent Palace Hall.

367
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,520
Lady Virtue, Jian Xue, has been assigned to Angelica Wisteria House.

368
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,960
Lady Fair, Yuwen Zi, has been assigned to Intoxication Spreading House.

369
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,580
Vibrant Miss, Fu Jiayi, Na Lanjing, Chen Xiangxie,

370
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,930
Zhang Wanting, Liu Jueqi will be assigned by the Imperial Business of the Inner Palace.

371
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,360
That is all from the King himself.

372
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,220
Thank you for the King's holy grace.

373
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,270
What about me? Why didn't anything on this give me an accomodation?

374
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,680
This... Lady, I am only here to deliver the message.

375
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,570
I didn't know you weren't included.

376
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,970
What do you think you are?

377
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,000
- How do you do your job?
- I–

378
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,300
I am Lady Virtuous that His Majesty himself personally conferred.

379
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,780
What's your name? I must ask my father to punish you thoroughly!

380
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,840
My Lady, please don't be angry.

381
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,480
This... There's another hall that's empty.

382
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,610
How about you put up with that one first?

383
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,580
Put up?

384
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,360
Am I someone who can casually put up with things?

385
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,830
Hurry and go get it done! If you don't do it well,

386
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,230
see whether I'm going to beat you to death!

387
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,770
Yes. Yes.

388
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,720
My Miss is living in the Intoxication Spreading House.

389
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,450
That's not bad.

390
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,460
- Let's leave.
- Yes.

391
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,560
Hey! Halt!

392
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,500
Why couldn't I be the one to live in Forever Excellent Palace Hall?

393
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,320
Tang Zhirong is only a concubine's daughter of General Border Security.

394
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,700
If she can live there, why can't I?

395
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,910
You all tell me. Shouldn't I be the the one living in Forever Excellent Palace Hall?

396
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:48,650
On the day the tortoise celebrated its birthday, guess who came?

397
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,990
A monster.

398
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,340
A tortoise is celebrating his birthday?

399
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,050
Let's leave.

400
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,090
You're calling me names!

401
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,640
You!

402
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:08,920
Old Master! Old Master! Miss is back.

403
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,010
Do you still remember to come back?

404
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,870
You don't want me to? I'll leave then.

405
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,290
Miss, look, you've come back,

406
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,150
so don't act willfully anymore.

407
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,200
Back then, you said you were going to go out to see the world.

408
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,160
This one trip took three years.

409
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,800
As your father, my hair has turned gray from worry.

410
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,000
Then why did you capture me to bring me back?

411
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,980
I'll come back when the time is right.

412
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:47,910
If I had known, I shouldn't have come back to Capital Kun.

413
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,410
First Miss, what kind of angered words are you saying?

414
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:57,500
Let me tell you. While you were travelling through the Five Regions to learn cooking,

415
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,290
you have never been picked on, have you?

416
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,950
I was naturally born cute.

417
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,290
Of course nobody would pick on me.

418
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,100
Miss, you don't know this,

419
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,510
it was all because Old Master always had someone following behind you.

420
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,960
He was worried that you were bullied.

421
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,730
You're the Old Master's precious.

422
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,790
He didn't allow anything small to happen to you, Miss.

423
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,410
For the sake of his hard-worked efforts,

424
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,270
don't blame Old Master anymore. Okay?

425
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,930
All right, all right. I've come home anyway.

426
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,260
But...

427
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:46,520
Father, if you want me to stay here obediently, promise me a few things.

428
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:52,360
As long as you're happy, anything will do.

429
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,780
- Then, you won't force me to study the noble etiquette anymore, will you?
- I won't.

430
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:59,220
You won't force me to meet with sons from wealthy families, either?

431
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,090
Who cares about them?

432
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,420
- Really?
- Of course.

433
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:08,940
As long as you stay at home obediently, I'll promise you anything.

434
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,690
Father,

435
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,810
Yun'er is at fault.

436
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,450
I won't ever run amuck anymore.

437
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,910
When you were outside these three years,

438
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,930
I have never stopped worrying about you.

439
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,830
Do you know that?

440
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,220
I'm sorry, Father.

441
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,740
All right.

442
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,150
All right. All right.

443
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,440
Father is still the best.

444
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,140
Yes, of course.

445
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,980
As long as you come back and have not run amuck,

446
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,490
I am happier than anything.

447
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,950
Take a guess what's inside this box.

448
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,360
It wouldn't be an accessory you bought for me, right?

449
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,390
Woah!

450
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,190
It's Hua Hua!

451
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,140
Hua Hua!

452
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,620
I saw you cried for many days after the one from before went missing.

453
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,510
I found a new identical one.

454
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,020
It just loves going inside the box.

455
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,230
All right, all right. Your grandmother misses you.

456
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,320
Go greet her now.

457
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,270
Hua Hua.

458
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,720
Why are you just idling there? Come with me.

459
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:16,080
Welcome, Madam.

460
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,690
Forego the formalities. You may all get up.

461
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,970
Thank you, Madam.

462
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,790
[Intoxication Spreading House]

463
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:38,440
Although it's a little plain, it's very peaceful and will be a great place to stay.

464
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,250
Older Sister.

465
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,590
Greetings to you, Older Sister.

466
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,190
Miss Jian Xue.

467
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:47,390
Miss Gao insisted that she must live in Forever Excellent Palace Hall.

468
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,560
It's not good for Younger Sister Tang to suffer,

469
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,600
so I agreed to move out of my place instead.

470
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,130
Don't know if Older Sister would mind sparing me a guest room?

471
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:00,660
This place is so spacious; so not even just us two, it could fit even a couple more people.

472
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,310
You can choose any room; small or large.

473
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:29,620
Never would have thought that in just such a short time,

474
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,120
Gao Puruo was able to have a comeback.

475
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,090
Now that she's here, the future will bound to be a mess.

476
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,640
Gao Puruo is the daughter of Prefect Xiping.

477
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,490
How many queens and consorts have all hailed from the Gao family?

478
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:43,620
Naturally, she won't be out of the game so easily.

479
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:48,090
Look at how each and every one of the misses yesterday looked naive, simple and pure yesterday.

480
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:51,350
Which one of their backs isn't supported by the might of an official from the previous reign?

481
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,390
Miss, you must be careful.

482
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,640
Their fights have nothing to do with me.

483
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,580
I am okay as long as I can get what I want.

484
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,430
Is that so?

Is Lady Fair here?

486
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:23,540
Older Sister, I heard that Older Sister Yuwen moved here.

487
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:26,100
I then thought to come and visit.

488
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,430
And by the way, I brought some little things for Older Sister.

489
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,420
Send them all in.

490
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:39,440
I... This... I have troubled Younger Sister.

491
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,080
I thought there was something wrong.

492
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,440
I thought you were also going to move into my shabby quarters.

493
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,770
I-I just wanted to become closer to Older Sister.

494
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,400
I won't beat around the bush with Older Sister.

495
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,380
That year, it was because of the Prime Minister's recommendation that my father was able to become a military officer.

496
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,260
Given this chance to enter into the palace, it was all the Prime Minister's benevolence.

497
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,500
So from the looks of it, we can technically be considered sisters who both came from the Prime Minister's Manor.

498
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,130
That is true, that is true.

499
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,780
If-If Older Sister does not mind,

500
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,980
why don't you come live with me in Forever Excellent Palace Hall?

501
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,290
If I move over,

502
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,210
who knows how the miss from Prefect Xiping's Manor might react?

503
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:31,320
I'll just live here. At least, I can take advantage of the peace and quiet here.

504
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,990
That's good, too.

505
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,720
Then, what about that Older Sister?

506
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,940
I dislike noise. This place is quite nice.

507
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:44,390
Oh, perhaps I'm just being too nosy.

508
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,800
Since there is nothing else, I will take my leave.

509
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,210
Older Sister, if there is anything you need, please never be too courteous.

510
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,660
Oh, right.

511
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,100
This hairpin here, was crafted by the top of the top craftsmen of Deep Water.

512
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,230
It goes really well with Older Sister's complexion.

513
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,770
I bought it especially from VIP Shop.

514
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,340
I hope Older Sister will accept it.

I have burdened Younger Sister.

516
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,620
Older Sister, the palace is vicious.

517
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,830
Older Sister must act with caution.

518
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,480
Both of us got into the palace because of Prime Minister's recommendation.

519
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,190
This gives us all the more reason to look out for each other.

520
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,840
Then I will not bother Older Sister further.

This truly is gifted by a rich family.
