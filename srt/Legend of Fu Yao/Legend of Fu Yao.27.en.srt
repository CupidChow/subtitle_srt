♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:23,000
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,300
~ Episode 27 ~

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,980
Tang Bonian was born as a commoner.

23
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,900
He is a very cautious person.

24
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,400
To let him lead an army of 50,000 back to the capital just based on a letter from Capital Kun,

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,900
my guess is he won't easily set out and will try to verify it.

26
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
If we want to remove this doubt from him,

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
then we need a trusted aide of the Prime Minister

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,800
to personally tell him that everything is true.

29
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
And that person is you.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,000
Mister Yun, please.

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,200
- Mister Yun.
- General Tang.

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,800
Sorry for not giving you proper respect.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,900
- Inside please.
- Please.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,300
Mister Yun, it has been two years since we've last met.

35
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,400
Mister, you've become more muscular and taller.

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
General Tang still is very energetic.

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,500
Godfather said, with you here,

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,500
the southern border will be in peace for a hundred years.

39
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,800
I've aged. I've aged. I'm no longer that useful.

40
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
- Please.
- Please.

41
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,900
My small place is at least 300 li from Capital Kun.

42
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,600
Mister, you personally came here.

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
If I had known, I would have sent someone to receive you.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,900
This is Godfather's meaning.

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,200
Before I left, he specifically instructed to not let anyone notice me.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I also just received Prime Minister's letter.

47
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,500
The letter said for me to lead my men back to the capital.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,800
This... are there any movements going on at Captial Kun?

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,300
I came for this matter.

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,800
There are some words that are inconvenient for the Prime Minister to say in a letter.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,400
Hence, he sent me to travel day and night to personally explain them to you.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,600
What orders does the Prime Minister have?

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,200
The Prime Minister said,

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,400
that we can proceed with the plan that we've been devising for so many years.

55
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,860
Want an uprising?

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
So, for General entering Capital Kun with your men, it must be done secretly.

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
We have to take them by surprise.

58
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,600
According to the Prime Ministers orders, you will first lead 50,000 men.

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,400
The remaining 100,000 men will be the back-up.

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,000
Divide into three groups, three different routes, to create an enclosure formation.

61
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,300
General, just 30 li more forward and we will be within the territory of Bright District.

62
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,600
Do you think we should continue marching, or... ?

63
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
The messenger I sent to deliver a letter to Rong'er hasn't returned up to now.

64
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,200
What is the situation in Capital Kun exactly?

65
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,600
I don't have any idea at all.

66
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,400
But didn't the Prime Minister say in the letter that everything has been appropriately prepared?

67
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
Let's wait a little more.

68
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,500
The day before yesterday, Father suddenly sent me a secret letter.

69
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,800
He said that Prime Minister ordered him to lead 50,000 men from his Border Security Troop to set out northwards.

70
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
But Father was worried there was something wrong,

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,700
and especially asked Rong'er to inquire about the matter.

72
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,940
Really?

73
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,220
Do you know what it connotes for a border general to lead his army towards the capital without any permission?

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
Treason.

75
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,900
It's good as long as you understand.

76
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Your Majesty, I know very well that this is a capital crime of execution of the whole clan.

77
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
Although my father is confused,

78
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,800
I as a daughter cannot be confused with him.

79
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
How should I respond to this letter?

80
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,500
I ask for Your Majesty... Your Majesty's guidance.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,100
What a smart lady.

82
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,860
But it's a pity you were born in the wrong family.

83
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,200
I know very well about Tang Bonian's every move.

84
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,000
But you, with you being this understanding and reasonable,

85
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,030
instead got dragged into this rebellion case.

86
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,200
It's a pity.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have thought it through.

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,780
I already married away from the Tang Family.

90
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,800
I am not a part of the Tang Family anymore.

91
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,400
Now Your Majesty's safety is also my safety.

92
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Your Majesty's enemies are my enemies.

93
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,700
I-I ask Your Majesty to take into consideration my loyalty and spare me.

94
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I don't want to die.

95
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,900
What are you crying for?

96
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,000
Your father's Border Security Troop is the state's elite army.

97
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
If we're able to take them without shedding any blood

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
and cut off a wing of Qi Zhen at the same time,

99
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:02,810
I shall heavily reward you.

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
What Your Majesty means is... ?

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,100
What did you say?

102
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,100
I will inform father...

103
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:36,300
that the Prime Minister... has properly arranged everything.

104
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,300
Let him enter the capital assuredly.

105
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,710
The crime of a father doesn't apply to his daughter.

106
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,500
Rong'er, I understand your actions today.

107
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,640
I also have my plans.

108
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Thanks, Your Majesty.

109
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Bestowing Lady Precious Tang Zhirong as the Lady of the Forever Excellent Palace Hall.

110
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:44,600
The grand wedding ceremony is set on the auspicious nineteen day in the tenth month.

111
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
She's also being granted the title Queen Zhaoyuan.

112
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Spread this decree to the whole Deep Water.

113
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
Father, don't blame me.

114
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
You had a heroic reputation, but you followed the wrong master.

115
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,500
Hence, regardless if your plan succeeds or not, you will get killed.

116
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,630
But I just want to continue living with dignity.

117
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,000
There's an ambush!

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Hurry and retreat! Be careful, there's an ambush!

119
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
Retreat!

120
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,370
Why hasn't Mister gone to visit Miss Fuyao these past few days?

121
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,460
When did you become this meddlesome?

122
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,370
Why should I go and visit her every day?

123
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
Could it be that you are still in a fit of pique at Miss Fuyao?

124
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,530
In a fit of pique?

125
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,490
Am I person that casually expresses his temper?

126
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,070
Before Mister has always been good in devising strategies.

127
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,500
Everything is under your control.

128
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,620
I haven't seen Mister be like this before, either.

129
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,250
But... ever since Miss Fuyao appeared,

130
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,100
Mister has become more humane.

131
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,770
Are you saying that I wasn't like a human in the past?

132
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,410
I don't dare to.

133
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,580
This girl is too stubborn.

134
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,360
After being lectured by her that day, I was indeed unhappy.

135
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,000
You, say.

136
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,530
Am I a person that likes to control people's hearts and use their trust?

137
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,780
That is because Mister is wise.

138
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,990
But I just refuse to use her.

139
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,710
That's why Mister did everything to let Tang Zhirong be the Empress.

140
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:05,750
Deep in Mister's heart, you actually care about Miss Fuyao a lot.

141
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,500
You are afraid that she'll get dragged into Deep Water's misfortune.

142
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,890
Was I becoming too kind with you lately?

143
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,340
Why are you so talkative?

144
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,380
I'll go to the inner court now to get my punishment.

145

[Prime Minister's Manor]

146
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,460
Godfather!

147
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,010
The rumors are true.

148
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,100
Tang Bonian indeed personally led 50,000 men from Border Security Troop to rush to Capital Kun.

149
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
This time, he has prepared enough military provisions himself

150
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,010
and traveled throughout the night.

151
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,310
He even avoided the cities and took the mountain path.

152
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,860
Is Tang Bonian trying to rebel?

153
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,940
I've secretly contacted the spies we have in the Border Security Troop.

154
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,960
But—

155
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,120
Say it!

156
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,700
There is no news at all.

157
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,230
I fear that they might have been removed a long time ago.

158
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:40,410
Looks like he has been planning this for a long time.

159
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,010
I sent someone to secretly look for him,

160
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,120
but up to now, he hasn't returned.

161
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,450
Could there be another reason behind this?

162
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,550
A hidden reason?

163
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,090
The reason is he has been using his daughter to secretly communicate with Xuanyuan Min

164
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,880
and has betrayed me a long time ago!

165
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,650
No wonder that despite so many women in the harem,

166
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,550
he only favored Tang Zhirong.

167
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,510
Yesterday, he even conferred the queen position without any reason at all.

168
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:16,600
I fear that these 50,000 men from Border Security Troop have sided with Xuanyuan Min.

169
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,090
What do we do?

170
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,210
Without this 50,000 men, won't your grand ambition—

171
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,650
Yun Hen, the arrow is already on the bowstring. We must fire it.

172
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:31,610
I'll have to rely on you.

173
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,820
Don't worry, Godfather.

174
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,310
Wait a second.

175
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,220
Let me think about it again.

176
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,690
You may be excused first.

177
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,140
Yes.

178
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,660
When you go back, stay by Qi Zhen's side like how you used to.

179
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:17,360
What Qi Zhen must pay us back is not only his own life.

180
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:33,140
[I will wait for Prime Minister at Sunset Bridge in Forever Water around 7:45 p.m. on the ninth of this month.]

181
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,450
[Winged Tree symbol]

182
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,990
Since I'm planning a grand game, why would I bet on just one pawn?

183
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,570
Your Majesty.

184
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,100
What's the matter? Say it.

185
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,660
This—

186
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,980
Your Majesty, why don't I leave first?

187
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,800
It's okay.

188
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,020
Just be frank.

189
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,420
Rong'er isn't an outsider.

190
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,940
Yes.

191
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,910
General Border Security Tang Bonian has led 50,000 of his men to enter the capital without permission.

192
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,950
I already knew about this.

193
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:49,110
But halfway, they all disappeared.

194
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,540
Really?

195
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,430
Rong'er, what's wrong?

196
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,150
I'm just... I'm just...

197
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:22,480
worried for Your Majesty.

198
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,540
I indeed am worried.

199
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,800
How could an army

200
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,900
just disappear?

201
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:37,010
Can it be the Prime Minister, he—

202
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,830
Qi Zhen also sent a huge number of men to search for them.

203
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,080
It's just that there are still no traces of them up to now.

204
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,000
Where is Tang Bonian now?

205
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
He has already been locked up.

206
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,080
What we sent are all reliable master fighters.

207
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,970
They left no trace at all.

208
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,060
Qi Zhen's men will never find General Tang.

209
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,700
Watch him well.

210
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,240
Yes.

211
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,860
Do you know why I locked Tang Bonian up?

212
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,460
Father... is guilty.

213
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,400
It's true that he's guilty, but it's not enough to get executed.

214
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,400
But if Qi Zhen finds him,

215
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,040
then your life cannot be preserved, either.

216
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,620
Do you understand?

217
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,090
I understand.

218
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,360
Mister Yun.

219
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
T-This... what's going on?

220
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,850
Why did you come just now? Where is this place?

221
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,500
Hurry and let the Prime Minister come and save me.

222
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,240
We haven't met in fifteen years.

223
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,060
General Tang, I reckon that you've been well.

224
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,770
Who are you?

225
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,570
Qilin Dragon Tattoo?

226
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,080
You are... you are First Mister?

227
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,320
Impossible. Impossible.

228
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,430
That time in Heir Apparent Manor, you already—

229
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,840
Already got killed by you guys, is that it?

230
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,970
Good thing, the heavens' law shines on everything.

231
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,830
I still have to thank General Tang's oversight back then

232
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,450
and let me keep my life.

233
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,620
Mister Yun, what's going on?

234
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,610
Mister Yun?

235
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,860
I forgot to tell you.

236
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,670
His surname is also Xuanyuan.

237
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,170
Heir Apparent Wenyi's two sons are standing in front of you now.

238
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,990
General Tang, what other words do you have to say?

239
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:23,420
The wheel of fortune turns!

240
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,980
It looks like my return to the capital this time was actually a trap set up by you.

241
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:43,790
That's also good. Both Misters,

242
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,290
are you here to demand me of my life or to seek revenge?

243
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:50,810
I want to know the truth.

244
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,990
Truth?

245
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:02,050
Heir Apparent Wenyi was indeed framed with the crime of rebellion.

246
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,970
Was it Qi Zhen who did it? Say it!

247
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:16,560
That time, Heir Apparent Wenyi successively pacified uprisings and eliminated bandits.

248
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,440
In terms of managing capability and martial arts skills, no one can be his equal.

249
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,450
Technically speaking, this was Deep Water's great fortune.

250
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,050
But... Renzhong was old.

251
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,020
He wasn't close with this eldest son anymore.

252
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,220
The one he cared more about was the youngest son that kept appearing in front of him.

253
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,700
Is it the past king, Xuanyuan Ren?

254
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,110
Indeed.

255
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,540
The more powerful Heir Apparent Wenyi became,

256
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,690
the more doubtful Shenzong became.

257
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,690
Qi Zhen was just a lieutenant then.

258
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,900
He chose to stand with Xuanyuan Ren and plot for him.

259
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,800
As long as he was given a chance,

260
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,800
he would say bad things about Heir Apparent Wenyi in front of Shenzong.

261
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,770
Afterward, he even helped Xuanyuan Ren fabricate the evidences of Heir Apparent's rebellion,

262
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:26,540
things like training a personal army to force the king's abdication,

263
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:32,890
setting up his sibling, and embezzling money.

264
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:39,680
Also, poisoning the previous king, all these were fake.

265
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,130
All were part of Prime Minister and the previous king's scheme.

266
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,110
Qi Zhen and Heir Apparent were sworn brothers.

267
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,690
Why did he harm him?

268
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,230
Prime Minister is a person greedy for power, while Xuanyuan Ren is a gullible person.

269
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,210
He also wasn't that skillful.

270
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,460
Following the Prime Minister would obviously be much easier.

271
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,680
Moreover, have you two heard about the Dragon Scale Armor?

272
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:19,290
Could it be that he didn't take the Dragon Scale Armor as his own only after harming the Heir Apparent?

273
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,860
It's quite the opposite.

274
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,060
They exactly were aiming for the Dragon Scale Armor.

275
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,490
That's why they wanted Heir Apparent to die.

276
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,860
Why?

277
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,390
The Dragon Scale Armor is a mythical item.

278
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,330
Of course, everyone wants to have it.

279
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,700
No, that is not the reason.

280
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,010
First Mister, stop interrogating.

281
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,590
I've said what should be said.

282
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,020
It was for his daughter, Qi Yun. Right?

283
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,270
Just let us bear all the crimes.

284
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,440
Your generation is innocent.

285
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,390
Yes.

286
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:22,100
But those seventy-eight lives that tragically died that night,

287
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,580
what crime did they commit?

288
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:31,620
I'm the one who is guilty.

289
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,480
I'm....

290
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,330
A life for a life. A blood grudge should be paid with blood.

291
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,400
That night, there were several innocent lives that were lost.

292
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,830
For this sin, I'm unable to wash it off even for several lifetimes.

293
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,870
But being able to see you two today, knowing that you two are still alive,

294
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,380
I actually feel a bit relieved.

295
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,530
Before, I was afraid of death.

296
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,190
I was afraid that I couldn't even be a ghost when I reached hell.

297
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:10,390
But after saying all these words today,

298
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:20,040
I hope that the God of Death can diminish my sin a little.

299
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:27,310
Since the day you agreed to become Qi Zhen's lackey,

300
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:32,550
you should have known that you'd committed an unforgivable sin.

301
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,400
I've brought all of these to myself.

302
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:52,060
I, guilty Tang Bonian, am willing to die to pay for my crimes.

303
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,810
Killing you will just dirty my hands.

304
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,240
I'll let you have a whole corpse.

305
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,820
Both Misters,

306
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,130
take care.

307
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,220
Father!

308
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,620
We've been in Deep Water for at least a hundred days, right?

309
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,450
Counting it, it's been four months.

310
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:55,490
From midsummer to autumn. It will be winter soon.

311
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:01,580
This green pond in front of us will then become frozen in less than ten days.

312
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,880
The scheduled date will be happening soon.

313
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,260
Deep Water is an unbounded deep pool.

314
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,730
It's time to bring closure to the matters here.

315
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,660
Mister, do you already plan to make a move?

316
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,490
You tell me, what is the purpose of everything that I've done here?

317
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,940
I—

318
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,010
Forget it.

319
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,470
I've long understood the principles of what should and shouldn't be asked.

320
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,510
What's the difference if you know it or not?

321
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,470
Your Majesty, Marquis is here.

322
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,940
- Your Majesty.
- Marquis, please sit down.

323
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,580
Yes.

324
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,750
What does Marquis think about General Border Security Tang Bonian?

325
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,390
General Tang is meritorious for suppressing bandits for so many years.

326
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:09,610
Of course, he is an important trusted aide of the government.

327
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:19,070
A few days ago, didn't you say that your Garrison Eight is short of men?

328
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,800
Now that the borders are stable,

329
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,530
there aren't any wars nor bandits causing troubles.

330
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,170
Why don't I transfer 50,000 men from Border Security Troop to you.

331
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,490
You'll manage them for Tang Bonian for now.

332
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,910
Won't this-this incite dissatisfaction from other court officials?

333
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:37,310
I fear that others will complain that I'm greedy for power, seeking personal gains, and hiding selfish intentions.

334
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,890
It was you who asked for men from me.

335
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,340
Now, it's also you that's being overcautious and prefers to maintain a good name.

336
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,090
If you don't want them, then forget it.

337
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,650
Anyway, they are all soldiers of Deep Water.

338
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,540
Placing them anywhere is the same.

339
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,890
I'll obey Your Majesty's orders.

340
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,820
Marquis, the air is cold during the night.

341
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,410
You are already old.

342
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,910
Your body cannot take this coldness.

343
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,760
Cao Cheng, go and get a warm blanket.

344
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,620
- This—
- Yes, Your Majesty.

345
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,820
- Marquis.
- Your Majesty, you mustn't.

346
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,900
Marquis, quickly get up.

347
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,950
Currently, this royal palace isn't that safe.

348
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,540
I have so many spies around me.

349
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,400
There are some words that I say for them to hear.

350
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,660
And there are some accusations of misconduct and sowing of suspicions that I might need your help with.

351
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:45,270
I am slow-witted.

352
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,740
I fear that a huge misfortune will happen to Deep Water soon.

353
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,190
First Royal Son.

354
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,300
Prime Minister, you're being too courteous.

355
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:37,590
I initially was just an idle person without any involvement with the state affairs of Deep Water.

356
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:41,940
I only wanted to sing songs and meet new friends.

357
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,850
Who would have known that fate would make a fool of me and would throw me into this thorny royal throne?

358
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,200
How am I capable for it?

359
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,020
Your Majesty, if you have any orders,

360
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,420
I won't refuse them and will willingly offer my life as a sacrifice to fulfill it.

361
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,030
There are powerful subjects in the inner court eyeing covetously.

362
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,210
There are also relatives of the harem fighting openly and covertly.

363
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,960
I'm in the middle of this which exhausts me very much.

364
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,020
What if one day, there is someone in the government that couldn't bear my existence and they incite an uprising,

365
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,860
the ones that will suffer are the thousands of citizens of Deep Water.

366
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,900
Who dares to?

367
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,310
I've thought it through.

368
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,140
Rather than waiting for a rebellion, why don't I take the initiative and give up my throne?

369
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,910
Maybe I'll be able to maintain peace that way.

370
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,830
Although there are powerful court subjects that are causing disturbances and banding together for selfish reasons,

371
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,670
it still hasn't reach the point for the court to collapse.

372
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,590
Even if there is someone that's planning to rebel,

373
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,520
I have 100,000 men in my Garrison Eight,

374
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,250
plus forty-three people in my manor.

375
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:36,270
Even if I have to fight until my very last man,

376
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,000
I am swearing to guard the Xuanyuan royal bloodline until I die.

377
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,280
Marquis, please sit down.

378
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,700
Just take it as for Deep Water.

379
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,900
You should take good care of your health.

380
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

381
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,600
When I said I would give you 50,000 men from Border Security Troop, you hesitated.

382
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,200
Why?

383
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,600
Are you concerned that Qi Zhen would suspect something,

384
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,400
or are you afraid of criticism from the imperial court?

385
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,500
That Your Majesty trusts me so much

386
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,000
is my blessing.

387
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
But I already have 100,000 men of Garrison Eight.

388
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,400
Our Deep Water only has 450,000 men on the regular list.

389
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,800
If Your Majesty were to send me another 50,000 soldiers,

390
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,400
raising an army is minor, but governing them isn't.

391
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,800
The pros and cons involved with it are complicatedly intertwined.

392
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
Besides,

393
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,400
there are a lot of dukes and meritorious subjects in the imperial court.

394
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:44,000
I fear that it isn't yet the right time for His Majesty to divide the military strength.

395
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
What timing?

396
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,400
Do you think I am trying to undermine Qi Zhen's military strength

397
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,800
in order to secure my place on the throne?

398
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:08,700
I just pity those elite soldiers that Tang Bonian painstakingly trained will be fighting with their own compatriots.

399
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,000
Why then did you say that a misfortune will be happening soon?

400
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,800
You also know about Qi Zhen's intentions without me mentioning it.

401
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,380
He's already past 50.

402
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,400
I fear that he won't wait any longer.

403
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,500
My conclusion is

404
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:34,000
that he'll force an abdication to get the throne.

405
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,010
The state affairs of the Megrez Imperial City are complicated.

406
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,800
First Royal Son also manages an army outside of the imperial capital.

407
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,200
For you to still travel far to come here, I feel so overwhelmed.

408
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,090
Stop giving me nonsense.

409
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,000
I still have to rush back before daybreak.

410
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,670
Be direct to the point.

411
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:52,000
You want the throne of Deep Water, am I right?

412
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,100
Right. The throne of Deep Water.

413
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,800
I will help you in getting the throne of Deep Water.

414
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,600
But in the future, when I compete for the crown prince position of Megrez,

415
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,700
you and your Deep Water must completely be on my side.

416
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,800
First Royal Son, don't worry.

417
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,600
By then, I will surely do my best to assist you.

418
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,900
As long as you loyally follow me,

419
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,200
the whole Deep Water will be yours in the future.

420
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,700
Not only that,

421
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:26,500
I will even think of a way to inform Emperor Father to make you an official king.

422
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,800
Thank you very much then, First Royal Son.

423
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,000
It's just that...

424
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,800
if Crown Prince Wuji learns about this,

425
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,200
with his personality, will he—

426
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
Who were you...

427
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,900
talking about?

428
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,600
I have said too much.

429
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,000
With Megrez Imperial City behind us,

430
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,700
I don't think anyone will be so bold to incite an uprising.

431
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,000
Even if there's someone seizing Deep Water,

432
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,200
Qi Zhen still won't be able to take the throne of Deep Water.

433
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
The Megrez Imperial City...

434
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
So what if there is the Megrez Imperial City?

435
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,600
The emperor and crown prince of the Imperial City are still just mortal beings.

436
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,100
They can't live forever or stay young.

437
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,400
As long as one is human, you will have selfish interests.

438
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,200
You will have a weakness.

439
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,900
How sure are you that the decision of the Imperial City will be appropriate?

440
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Your Majesty,

441
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,800
how could you say such seditious words?

442
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,100
Megrez Imperial City has ruled over the Five Regions.

443
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,700
His Majesty Father Emperor is a true son of god sent to rule the world.

444
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,700
Crown Prince Wuji is even a wise and rare talent.

445
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,000
With the Imperial City keeping the different nations in the Five Regions at bay,

446
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,600
no matter how great a person is in Deep Water,

447
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,200
as long as he isn't in the Xuanyuan royal bloodline,

448
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,400
doesn't have the skills to manipulate water,

449
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,000
he then can never be king.

450
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,600
What if the Megrez Imperial City acknowledges the legality of the party seizing power?

451
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That so-called bloodline,

452
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,900
so-called water manipulation technique, will all just be empty words.

453
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,100
By then, no one will be able to restrict Qi Zhen.

454
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,300
Impossible.

455
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:44,170
This is a secret letter I've received this morning.

456
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Someone from Megrez Imperial City secretly entered Deep Water.

457
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
This is for...

458
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,400
to see Qi Zhen?

459
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Indeed.

460
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,400
This person was wearing luxurious clothing and riding a fat horse.

461
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,500
I even heard that there is a unique symbol on his horse's saddle.

462
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,600
Marquis, try guessing what this symbol looks like.

463
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,930
What you're thinking about is right.

464
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,100
It is exactly the Winged Tree symbol.

465
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,800
They are people from the royal family of Megrez.

466
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,600
Could it be...

467
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,470
Qi Zhen is really staking everything

468
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,200
to rebel?

469
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,200
First Royal Son, let me lay the cards on the table today.

470
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,700
I am rebelling not because of a sudden impulse or am getting reckless out of desperation.

471
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:45,700
I've planned this for a long time and I've made full proof arrangements.

472
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Tell me about them.

473
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,000
Deep Water has a total of 450,000 soldiers on the list.

474
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,200
Me and my trusted aides have 200,000 men.

475
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,900
We still can get the soldiers under Prefect Xiping.

476
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:01,400
Other than that, I've also had an agreement with Heaven Fiend King Zhan Nancheng.

477
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,000
If he sent out his army to help me, I'll give him Mt. Great Vast.

478
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Also, with your great help,

479
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,200
how can this matter not succeed?

480
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,900
If that is the case, how come you're not making any move at all?

481
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,400
In battle, speed has always been a soldiers's asset.

482
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,940
Delaying will only lead to unexpected consequences.

483
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,600
You're not hurrying to prepare your uprising

484
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:27,200
and why waste time here?

485
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,600
First Royal Son, there's something you don't know.

486
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,400
I'm waiting for the right time.

487
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,980
We have no more time.

488
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,390
We must act first to get the upper hand.

489
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
What should I do?

490
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,300
There is no news about Tang Bonian until now.

491
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,100
I want you to lead Deep Water's most elite 200,000 soldiers

492
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,300
to ensure the preservation of the Xuanyuan royal bloodline.

493
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,200
Marquis, please.

494
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:13,740
Your Majesty,

495
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,600
you're taking so much trouble for this.

496
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I have enjoyed so many graces from the Xuanyuan royal family.

497
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I've been in the government for so many years, doing my best all the time and not daring to have any negligence.

498
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,800
I am now very old.

499
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,000
I've already brought honor to my ancestors and have descendants.

500
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,800
I already profited enough from my life.

501
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,200
Now that someone is attempting to rebel and my Deep Water is in trouble,

502
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
I'm willing to risk this old life of mine

503
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,100
to pledge to fight to the death in protecting the royal court,

504
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:59,200
and to pledge to fight to the death in protecting the Xuanyuan royal bloodline.

505
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,880
The grand wedding day.

506
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,420
Please explain.

507
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,400
Based on Deep Water's rules,

508
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,300
after Xuanyuan Min decides who the queen will be,

509
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
there will be a grand wedding ceremony.

510
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:31,800
60% of my garrison and Zhang Henian's Garrison Eight must be given to form the Deep Water King's own royal army.

511
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,600
That's a total of 150,000 soldiers.

512
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,000
We can't neglect it.

513
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,600
You're already a person planning to rebel.

514
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,800
Do you still worry about that puppet Deep Water King coming to take your power away?

♫ What do you know? ♫

517
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,400
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

518
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,200
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

519
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,400
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

520
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,200
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

521
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,000
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

522
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,200
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

523
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,600
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

524
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,500
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

525
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,400
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

526
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,600
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

527
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:50,200
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

528
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,200
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

529
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,300
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

530
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,500
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

531
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,200
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

532
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:14,000
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

533
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,800
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

534
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

535
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,800
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

536
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,200
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

537
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,900
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

538
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,800
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

♫ Have someone's company♫
