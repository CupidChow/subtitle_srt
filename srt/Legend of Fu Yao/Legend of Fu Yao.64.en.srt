♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,480
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,330
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,920
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,710
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,450
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,970
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,690
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,880
♫ True love won't run short ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

~ Episode 64 ~

22
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,230
I've visited Winding Mind Nunnery.

23
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,280
Although it's a bit shabby,

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,590
it has a rare sense of quiet.

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,290
Empress Yuan...

26
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,920
is doing quite well.

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,940
When Prince Virtue Manor was raided,

28
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,070
I secretly left a couple of robes often worn by Prince Virtue.

29
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,730
If you still want to establish a tomb with just his clothes in it,

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:35,220
it might become useful.

31
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,050
I actually knew all along

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,630
that they couldn't sever their affection for each other.

33
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,350
In Empress Mother's heart, there is only him.

34
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,560
To say that I never doubted my identity,

35
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,230
that would be sheer hypocrisy.

36
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,910
But the more I doubted it, the more I couldn't dare touch the issue,

37
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,870
the more I was unwilling to investigate the truth.

38
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,350
Emperor Father was a loving father to me,

39
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,510
a strict father.

40
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,090
He was the person in this world...

41
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,710
that I trust the most and was closest to.

42
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,790
I once thought that even if I was not his real son,

43
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,430
our father-son relationship had crossed beyond blood relations a long time ago.

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,420
I never... I never cared for the throne.

45
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,190
I just didn't want to disappoint him.

46
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:18,440
But I didn't expect that inside Emporer Father's heart,

47
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,920
what was hidden in his heart was only hate.

48
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,500
Only hate.

49
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,400
Your Emperor Father doted on you because you're good.

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,640
He hated you also because you're good.

51
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,650
[Memorial Tablet of the Deceased Lord Emperor Zhangsun Jiong]

52
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,780
It's just that your Emperor Father is a pitiful man after all.

53
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,600
Everyone has choices,

54
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,220
but he deliberately chose a path without an end,

55
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,380
and he dragged everyone else along.

56
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,110
But now, the lies and the truth,

57
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:20,000
the good and the bad, you've known them all.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,620
So there is still time for everything, right?

59
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,620
Still time?

60
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,750
There's no more time.

61
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,810
Everything has happened.

62
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,790
When have I ever had a choice?

63
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,760
The person who I thought loved me actually hated me badly.

64
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,370
The person that I hated the most...

65
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,450
would actually sacrifice his life for me.

66
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,800
Tell me. What are all these exactly?

67
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,040
Wuji,

68
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:17,850
even if the whole world betrays you,

69
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,490
I will not betray you.

70
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,590
I will always stay by your side.

71
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,850
I won't leave you.

72
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,430
You don't know...

73
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,930
what you will be facing in the future.

74
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,930
Of course, I know.

75
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,520
From Mt. Mystic Soul, I walked all the way here.

76
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,730
I have walked from the littlest me to the me today.

77
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,070
I know that all of our experiences are a type of training.

78
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,950
Maybe the heavens have decided what kind of people we will be a long time ago and

79
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,880
what kind of mission we will have.

80
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,190
Hence, all the separations, the grudges and revenge which we've experienced

81
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:23,050
are all layers of armor that the heavens put on us.

82
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,910
So that when our real fate comes,

83
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,950
we'll become stronger and unafraid of anything.

84
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,850
Wuji,

85
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:48,740
you are the smartest and bravest person I have ever met.

86
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,300
Nothing will knock you down;

87
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:59,400
not in the past, not now, and not in the future.

88
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,790
But the Five Regions cannot be chaotic now.

89
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,230
Megrez cannot be chaotic.

90
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,110
Your people need you.

91
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,950
I also need you.

92
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,250
[Libation]

93
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,530
You are right.

94
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,260
A king...

95
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,770
has no...

96
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,010
right to be sad.

97
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,790
I'm here.

98
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,960
Greetings, Your Majesty!

99
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,590
The sovereign descends to his state!

100
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,270
The world will become wealthy and strong!

101
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,270
What should we do?

102
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,470
If we weren't elders of the Firmament,

103
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:20,510
who would have thought that the rock of sealed Di Feitian actually hides under this Evergreen Shrine?

104
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:26,510
I feel that this thousand-year-old seal cannot restrain him anymore.

105
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:32,100
I called everyone here today to discuss this matter.

106
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,490
Now, the power of Di Feitian is making waves.

107
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,930
That remnant sense in Young Phoenix Lake can't be guarded anymore.

108
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,610
There must not be any problem with this other half in front of us.

109
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,730
All of you are descendants of the elders of ancient Firmament.

110
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,030
If we unite our forces to reinforce the seals,

111
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:55,160
only then can we prevent a catastrophe in the world.

112
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,420
Although we were all given a heavy task of guarding this remnant sense,

113
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,790
the dark power inside this sealed rock has been getting stronger every day.

114
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,350
I'm afraid that our spiritual power of illusion is not a match.

115
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,820
What you mean is... ?

116
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,700
The four of us can unite our nascent souls to suppress the dark power and enhance the seal.

117
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,110
But while this method can temporarily avert crisis,

118
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,880
it can't forever eliminate future trouble.

119
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,960
We can only leave it up to fate.

120
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Since this is our life mission,

121
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,030
then let us begin.

122
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:10,390
We've spent half of our lifetime's cultivation.

123
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,230
From now on,

124
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,130
we have become useless people.

125
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,060
Don't we still have Wuji?

126
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,170
Has he found the female demon?

127
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:37,490
If this remnant sense stirs again now,

128
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:46,040
I fear that only Wuji can save the citizens of this world.

129
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,660
Wuji, have you seen all?

130
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,890
Have you seen all?

131
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,680
It's not that I want to force you to kill her.

132
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,210
The life of everyone in this world is now hanging by a thread.

133
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,530
There's no more retreat path.

134
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,350
Bring her back here to Firmament.

135
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:16,190
Only by destroying the female demon and Di Feitian together

136
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,360
can Five Regions be saved.

137
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,220
Fuyao...

138
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,880
What should I do to make Five Regions peaceful and secure?

139
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,200
What should I do...

140
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,590
so that you'll be safe and sound?

141
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,640
The predestined one of the Mystic Spirit Leaf is just by your side.

142
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,690
Kill him and then no one in this world can harm your life again.

143
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,310
If you don't kill him, you are then destined to continue walking down this hardest path.

144
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,750
Why are you standing here alone?

145
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,370
Be careful in catching a cold.

146
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,490
I see you haven't slept for several days.

147
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,920
There's nothing better than you finally being able to sleep.

148
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,310
When I was little, I would frequently stand here to watch the sunrise.

149
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,630
When the sun rose,

150
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,830
this palace also seemed to have become warmer.

151
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,830
The difficulties in this world, the viciousness of the human heart,

152
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,800
became just moments of trifle matters.

153
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,690
When I was little,

154
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,320
I also liked standing on top of Mt. Mystic Soul to look at the sun.

155
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,960
Even though there are thousands of hatred and grievances in this world,

156
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,930
and those numerous things that you can pick up but are unable to put down,

157
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,720
the sun never bothered with these.

158
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,190
Every day, it will still repeatedly follow its path.

159
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,890
Every day, it will rise as usual.

160
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,520
It's easy to guard the rising and setting of the sun.

161
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,980
It's hard to guard a human heart.

162
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,100
Who made a human heart the easiest thing to change in this world?

163
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,900
I have always believed that there are no obstacles in this world that can't be surpassed,

164
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:42,450
no land that can't be flattened, no grudges that can't be cracked by hacking through it,

165
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,980
only human hearts that can't be guarded.

166
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,310
Do you know

167
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:03,490
I remembered that when I met you in Mt. Mystic Soul's Hunting and Fighting Game for the first time,

168
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:07,890
I kept thinking, "Who is this person?

169
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,130
How come he is harming me, but also helping me?"

170
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,080
I still hadn't understood it when I reached Deep Water.

171
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,730
That time, I was thinking that I must remove that man's mask and look at him clearly.

172
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,010
Who are you exactly?

173
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,390
Why are you helping me?

174
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,070
I’m the one who saved you.

175
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,960
You just need to remember this.

176
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,050
Who on earth are you? Liar!

177
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,390
You'll know when I take off my mask one day.

178
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,260
We ended up on this journey where we went through so many things together.

179
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,830
I can see you now more clearly,

180
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,450
but I seem to be unable to see myself clearly anymore.

181
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,890
From the queen of Deep Water to the queen of Plough,

182
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,490
who among them is the real me?

183
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,050
You only need to remember that you're my Fuyao.

184
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,460
All other things are not important.

185
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:42,820
Wuji, you tell me if there is this kind of Five Regions.

186
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:48,330
There is light and equality everywhere.

187
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,370
Even if there is unavoidable darkness,

188
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:58,970
are there still people who are working hard for this light and equality?

189
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:11,190
If I'm gone one day, can you promise me

190
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,600
to become an emperor like that and give them the best kind of Five Regions?

191
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,830
Where are you going?

192
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,190
Promise me first.

193
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,100
Tell me first.

194
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,760
Look at how anxious you are.

195
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,990
Where can I go?

196
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,900
I'm the queen of Plough.

197
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,720
My citizens are still waiting for me.

198
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,840
It is because of drags like you guys that I wasn't able to fully have some enjoyment.

199
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,990
Once we're done with these matters, I must take a good look at the whole Five Regions.

200
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,090
I'll go enjoy all those places I want to go to.

201
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,440
- Go to—
- I'll accompany you.

202
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,250
On this journey,

203
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:23,530
you have suffered a lot.

204
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,390
Because we each have things we're supposed to do

205
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,200
and responsibilities that we can't abandon.

206
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,990
The thing I can't bear to leave behind is you.

207
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,630
If, in the end,

208
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:16,190
the tragedy is final and unable to be reversed,

209
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,940
I just want to be like how we are now,

210
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,310
keeping you company forever.

211
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,260
You are the mastermind that will bring disaster to the Five Regions.

212
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,830
Only with you truly dying,

213
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:47,060
can the citizens of this world escape another apocalypse of a purgatory on earth.

214
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,450
Wuji, you must kill her.

215
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:01,460
It can only be you! It must be you!

216
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,260
The new emperor ascends to the throne!

217
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,340
May Five Regions be prosperous forever.

218
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,340
Subjects, please take your bow.

219
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,470
The new emperor ascends to the throne!

220
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,470
May Five Regions be prosperous forever!

221
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:43,160
My subjects, rise.

222
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,010
Thank you, Your Majesty!

223
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,940
According to the former emperor's will, his funeral and burial are to be done in a simple manner.

224
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,080
Presently, major state affairs are pressing.

225
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,330
Duan Tong, order the inner court to take note of this.

226
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,990
The winter solstice is an auspicious hour for an important person to enter the gates of heaven.

227
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:06,910
During the winter offering ceremony in Mt. Green Bead, Emperor Ruizong will be buried.

228
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,570
I am accepting the decree.

229
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,710
Your Majesty, when the new emperor of Megrez ascends to the throne,

230
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,800
he must send out an imperial envoy

231
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,010
to go to Firmament and accept the conferment decree.

232
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,970
I've listed down several possible candidates.

233
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,960
May Your Majesty read it.

234
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,670
No need.

235
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,260
I already have a candidate to send to Firmament.

236
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,170
Yuan Bao, do you know that

237
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,700
Firmament has set up a death method for me?

238
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,710
Not only do they want my life,

239
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,850
they even want Wuji to personally kill me.

240
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,950
Of course, I know that Wuji won't.

241
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,990
It's just that if he doesn't kill me,

242
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,510
that's equivalent to killing millions of people.

243
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,510
Others don't know, but do you not know?

244
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,850
If the female demon doesn't die, Five Regions will suffer an apocalypse.

245
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,370
All those happenings before have burdened him in a way that's beyond what he can bear.

246
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,350
My heart aches for him.

247
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,760
How can I let him live within self-blaming and guilt for the rest of his life?

248
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,910
But I can't let Five Regions be in chaos just because of me, either, right?

249
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,350
Hence, I've decided to go to Firmament.

250
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,410
Yuan Bao, I know that you're the most outstanding of them all.

251
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,250
Before, when Wuji was on the verge of life,

252
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,030
you were still able to find him and save him.

253
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,350
This is my hair.

254
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:08,150
I'm handing it to you.

255
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,690
I hope that one day, no matter where I am,

256
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,870
you can bring Wuji to find me.

257
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,510
If I'm unable to win,

258
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,590
I hope that you can bring Wuji to personally kill me.

259
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,450
I have only this one request.

260
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,390
Please promise me.

261
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,630
Wuji, in one's life, there are more important things than one's wishes.

262
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,690
Those deep loving and completing others, forgiveness and giving up,

263
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,240
sacrificing and understanding, easily abandoning and working hard to obtain,

264
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,170
those things are what you all have written in my bloody and tearful life course,

265
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:08,130
forever illuminating and lighting my forward path.

266
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,150
Without you, without you all, I wouldn't have been able to walk to where I'm now.

267
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,480
I can't disappoint this borrowed life.

268
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,710
I can't forget the sacrifices and efforts that you all have done, either.

269
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:23,830
Now, it's impossible for me to get rid of these imprints.

270
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,980
They may look like light, weak, and powerless, but they are actually strong like a boulder.

271
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,590
No strength can brush them off.

272
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,950
How long can one life last?

273
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,390
Being able to meet you is already my good fortune.

274

How can I not come?

318
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:37,340
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

319
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,290
While in the palace of Plough back then, I committed that kind of mistake.

320
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:45,680
I said that I'd take you away, yet I caused you to fall into a trap.

321
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,540
When I rushed back, everything was too late.

322
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:55,530
From that day on, I swore to myself

323
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,850
that I wouldn't let myself face another late situation like that.

324
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,570
I don't want to face situations of having no news like that again.

325
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,130
I will strive for everything that I should strive for.

326
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,140
I don't want regrets to fill the rest of my life.

327
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:17,780
The preceding several decades of regrets are already too long.

328
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,400
From now on, wherever you go,

329
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,120
I will be there.

330
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,470
Hey,

331
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:46,550
just let me accompany you like this.

332
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,970
Since this is predestined, we should go on this journey together.

333
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,340
Whether it's fated,

334
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,350
or that the mandate of heaven can't be disobeyed,

335
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,780
if this is what we should bear,

336
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,440
let's face it together then.

337
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,330
Grand Teacher, Senior Brother Wuji has reached Misty Sea in Fufeng.

338
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,830
He also brought a lady with him.

339
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,100
I got it.

340
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,060
You may be excused.

341
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:16,030
You still understood your role.

342
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:20,830
The female demon still needs to come back.

343
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,600
Grand Teacher, Senior Brother Wuji, he...

344
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,590
- What about him?
- He—

345
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,570
Just say it.

346
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,090
He covered up his tracks.

347
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:36,140
We are unable to find him.

348
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,270
Disobedient disciple...

349
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,230
Good. Good.

350
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,360
It's good that you have come here.

351
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,300
The Illusion Palace has been waiting for you two for a long time.

352
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,380
Find them.

353
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,690
Isn't this your Upper Yang Palace in Megrez?

354
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,430
You can say so.

355
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,940
Did you construct another one here based on the image of your Upper Yang Palace?

356
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,400
Everything here in Firmament is life-like and illusion-like.

357
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,350
Everything you're seeing now may not be true,

358
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,300
and those that you can't see may not be false.

359
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,100
I created this place using all that I've learned for ten years.

360
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,050
It can count as the safest place in Firmament right now.

361
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:50,660
Spending ten years to build a house that's familiar to you.

362
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,320
You must have missed this place the most.

363
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:59,390
When I arrived in Firmament, I was still very young.

364
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,380
The rules here are very strict.

365
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,690
It's rare to have any co-disciples to keep me company.

366
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,820
As time goes by, it can't be helped for one to feel homesick.

367
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,130
Ten years are more than enough to change a person's way of thinking.

368
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,760
Since I'm unable to go back, I can only think of a way to not forget.

369
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,700
That's right, too.

370
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,630
You were after all just a child then.

371
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,130
Even if you're God's favored one in the eyes of other people,

372
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,550
you surely would feel lonely, too.

373
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:40,080
But you had to pretend to be strong and were unable to say a lot of words to others.

374
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,710
This must be the only place where you can remove your mask.

375
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,650
If that time there was a person like me by your side,

376
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,040
always pulling you here and there to look and play, you surely would have been happier.

377
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,920
It's not yet too late.

378
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,120
Yes.

379
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,350
Among the thirty-three levels of skies, the level of being separated is the highest.
(There are thirty-three levels in Buddhism.)

380
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,070
Among the 404 illnesses, being lovesick is the most painful.

381
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:38,210
So, Crown Prince Wuji can also write such a heart-wrenching poem.

382
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,920
Okay, already.

383
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,000
You better explain it to me.

384
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,790
Which senior sister or junior sister broke your heart that you pitifully wrote those kinds of words?

385
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,500
What?

386
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,990
Being jealous?

387
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,590
Why would I?

388
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,330
Really?

389
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,890
I am indeed jealous.

390
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,830
You're mine.

391
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,900
How could you think about others?

392
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,060
How could you—

393
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:56,390
This is your first time... saying that I'm yours.

394
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,310
You are indeed mine.

395
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,560
You are forever mine.

396
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,040
Grand Teacher, Palace Leader Fei Yan of Illusion Palace asks to see you.

397
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,590
Fei Yan?

398
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,240
Although my Evergreen Shrine and Illusion Palace are both in Firmament,

399
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:13,020
we never had any interaction for hundreds of years.

400
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:16,870
Why is Illusion Palace asking to see me at this time?

401
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,710
Then, I'll go reject her.

402
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,580
Wait.

403
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:25,780
Illusion Palace was also established by our ancestral teachers.

404
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:32,730
In terms of seniority, Fei Yan of Illusion Palace is higher than me by a lot.

405
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,040
We are currently in the critical time of determining the survival of Five Regions.

406
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,660
She might have an important reason for suddenly visiting.

407
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,270
There's no harm in meeting her.

408
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,400
Yes, I understand.

409
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,160
Grand Teacher always says that the mundane world is just as transient as a fleeting cloud.

410
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,470
What the students of Firmament strive for is eternity.

411
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,260
The secular world for me was initially just

412
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,490
a responsibility that I have to do as the crown prince of Megrez.

413
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,470
Until I met you, when everything changed.

414
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:19,000
Every time I bumped into you, every moment of it, I felt so happy,

415
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,950
but they were so short.

416
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:30,100
Because of you, I learned to love this secular world.

417
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,920
And also because of you, I wanted to live a long time for the first time.

418
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,700
I know you are determined to die in coming here.

419
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,860
I also know that the death of an individual compared to that of all lives in this world is just measly.

420
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,890
But if this person is you, I can't.

421
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,160
- Wuji—
- Fuyao.

422
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,340
As long as there is even a tiny chance,

423
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,230
I will choose to live together with you.

424
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:22,000
I don't believe there is any law of nature or great righteousness that would require the sacrifice of an innocent life to be saved.

425
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,160
If it really can't be prevented,

426
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,970
then let's die together.

427
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,400
I have never believed that there were any obstacles that couldn't be surpassed.

428
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,020
Even if this is my fate, I won't resign to it.

429
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,200
Okay.

430
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,660
It's Fei Yan.

431
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:18,920
We've just arrived in Firmament for more than two hours,

432
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,930
yet Illusion Palace has sent out so many scouts.

433
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,430
I'll go look for my Grand Teacher first.

434
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,490
- I'll go with you.
- No.

435
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,260
Grand Teacher wants to capture you.

436
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,690
I can't let you walk into his net.

437
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,130
If I don't go with you, will your Grand Teacher let you off?

438
