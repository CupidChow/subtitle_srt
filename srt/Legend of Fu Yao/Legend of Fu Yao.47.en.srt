00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:12,380
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,520
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:23,630
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,860
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,970
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:39,840
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,720
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,810
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,930
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,550
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,310
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,360
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,430
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:25,780
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,120
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,610
~ Episode 47 ~

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,790
3,000 against 300,000 is indeed a recipe for failure.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,170
You must borrow some soldiers.

24
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,310
But in this vast Five Regions, from whom will he borrow them?

25
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,940
Aren't you the Crown Prince?

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,920
Can't Megrez help in this matter?

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,070
Although Megrez Imperial City reigns over the Five Regions,

28
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,770
it doesn't have the right to meddle with the internal affairs of each nation.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,080
It's easy for me to lend him an army,

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,060
but they will just get blocked outside the gates if we're unable to get the military tally of Heaven Fiend.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,730
Where can we an borrow some soldiers within Heaven Fiend then?

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,090
Prince Zhan, are we thinking the same thing?

33
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,720
It looks like that I must go visit Geya once more.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,460
You mustn't!

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,290
This—

36
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,370
The Dark Storm Cavalry I saw in the Ice Land last time wasn't coincidental.

37
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,580
Those 3,000 were just the lead.

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,460
I want to go and bring back all the Dark Storm Cavalry hiding underground.

39
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,420
What's the story behind the Dark Storm Cavalry hiding underground exactly?

40
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,570
During the Firmament Great War back then, the Dark Storm Cavalry was the elite force that faced the enemy first.

41
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,050
But a portion of them got bewitched with abundant gold as bribes.

42
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,860
They betrayed Five Regions at the last minute and almost tilted the war situation.

43
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,740
After the war, this portion of Dark Storm Cavalry traitors disappeared into Geya completely.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,690
Afterwards, the Dark Storm Cavalry of Heaven Fiend was given an additional duty of keeping watch.

45
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,420
Because Grandmaster Zhou was framed,

46
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:27,960
the whole Dark Storm Cavalry almost got annihilated fifteen years ago.

47
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:33,050
Only the remaining 3,000 to 4,000 people protected Geya for generations,

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,450
but they totally don't have the power to resist.

49
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,760
What item then are they keeping watch?

50
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,680
They betrayed Five Regions, betrayed their own lineage.

51
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,300
But they didn't know that the price for betraying would be...

52
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,760
being confined by Firmament Magical Power and never being allowed to leave.

53
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,600
They got trapped inside Geya for generations like prisoners.

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,830
Calculating it, they have been tormented for thousands of years.

55
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,920
Geya Desert is a strange place to begin with.

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,850
Adding the imprisoned Dark Storm Cavalry frequently appearing and vanishing within it,

57
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,480
legendary rumors in the Five Regions also gave them the name of "Secret Army."

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,320
But since you took away these Dark Storm Cavalry that were camped in there,

59
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,640
doesn't that mean that no one is keeping watch of them already?

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,140
The Blue Dragon Wildness Sword is indeed the critical item that can control and command the Secret Army.

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,200
Now that this sword has resurfaced, they surely won't dare to make rash moves.

62
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,140
But they won't stay silent for too long, either.

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,790
You're going to meet the Secret Army?

64
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,410
You can't go! You mustn't!

65
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,880
The Secret Army is just a story to fool children.

66
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,930
No one has seen them at all.

67
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,960
Also... Geya Desert eats people.

68
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,580
You can't just risk your life like that!

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,440
What Princess said is right. The Great War happened thousands of years ago.

70
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,190
We aren't really sure if that Secret Army is true or not.

71
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,810
Even if they are, what have they turned out to be now?

72
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,670
- Recklessly going there is too dangerous, General.
- It will be fine.

73
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,320
Heaven Fiend Secret Army in Geya Desert,

74
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,140
I actually can confirm that they do exist.

75
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,650
Yes, I have seen them.

76
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,900
The rumor about me almost losing my life in Geya Desert is true.

77
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,150
The rumor about me developing the strange petrifying disease wherein my body became rigid like iron is true, too.

78
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,630
Good thing, I always brought the cosmic silk bag that Teacher gave me.

79
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,290
Hence, I was able to contact Firmament during emergencies.

80
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,790
Yuanbao was also able to transport through it and get me the berry.

81
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:31,130
That time, Yuanbao left for a long time and I was in a state of almost dying.

82
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,400
At that moment, I saw the Secret Army.

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,790
Good thing, Yuanbao returned just in time, that's why I survived.

84
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,960
Actually, after the great battle in Yao City,

85
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,550
Zhan Beiye and I also went to Geya Desert in our dream.

86
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,570
I also saw them.

87
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,840
I then must go.

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,860
Even if those things do exist,

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,390
you also said that they are being restricted by a magical power.

90
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,770
If you go, can you guarantee that you'll be able to subdue them?

91
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,180
I—

92
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,730
You two...

93
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,750
You two aren't certain.

94
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,750
Am I right?

95
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,520
The person who has the right to make this decision is only you.

96
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,650
I might not be able to subdue them.

97
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,240
I might not be able to return alive, either.

98
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,290
But this is the only way.

99
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,600
Enough...

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,740
Enough...

101
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,950
Didn't I already say that I'm resolute in walking down my path and taking back my possessions?

102
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,850
Then no matter how huge the difficulty is, I must continue walking forward.

103
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,460
Okay.

104
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,920
I have the Zhan clan blood within me.

105
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,860
I then have my destined duty.

106
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,180
Even if there is just a minute chance, I still must not disappoint those brothers that have died for me,

107
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,520
those people who are living well for me.

108
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,720
- Am I right?
- Right!

109
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:50,870
Since you've made your decision, I will draw a guide to the Secret Army based on my memory.

110
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,270
Let's not waste time.

111
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,200
Make preparations as soon as possible.

112
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,540
Okay.

113
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,760
Since that place is very dangerous, we'll accompany you to go.

114
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,670
Don't rush. We still have other things to do.

115
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,520
Add three more levels of defense based on what I said earlier.

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,070
Make the time of locking the palace gates earlier to 5:00 p.m.

117
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,360
After sunset, anyone entering and exiting the palace gates must be reported to the inner court.

118
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,410
I understand.

119
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,200
Just to eliminate the old subordinates of Prince Fierce,

120
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,840
we've arrested a lot of high ministers of the imperial court.

121
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,110
This includes generals who hold important military power; hence, a lot of military posts are now empty.

122
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,490
Shouldn't we stop already?

123
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,410
Of course, we can't.

124
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,430
I will never give Zhan Beiye any chance.

125
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,630
But now that Gu Lingfeng is dead,

126
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,970
who then must lead the Gold of Heaven Fiend inside the palace?

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,370
Could it be Younger Brother Heng has such thoughts?

128
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,420
I have shallow abilities and am unable to bear such a huge responsibility.

129
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,040
The Gold of Heaven Fiend are the most important guards of the palace.

130
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
They must be reforged.

131
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,830
I must reselect a commander that will truly follow my orders.

132
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,810
Do you mean to let me approach Zhan Nancheng?

133
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,960
Zhan Nancheng is a very cunning man.

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,610
Even if we are able to obtain several more thousand soldiers, we might still not be able to win.

135
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,870
We must put in a person that can win his trust to work in collusion with us from the inside for our plan to perfectly work.

136
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,230
But sneaking into the palace isn't an easy task.

137
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,740
What can I do?

138
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,620
Gu Lingfeng has just recently died.

139
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,840
The commander position of the Gold of Heaven Fiend is now open.

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,850
Based on their customary rule, they will be selecting one soon.

141
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,890
That time is your best chance.

142
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,460
What you mean is I will disguise as a man,

143
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,420
risk the danger of getting hurt to join some selection,

144
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,640
and then take over the Gold of Heaven Fiend?

145
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,920
Correct.

146
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,250
If I indeed got selected,

147
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,940
must I fawn on that old man Zhan Nancheng, too?

148
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,410
You're just going to watch that on the side?

149
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,730
Are you going or not?

150
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,120
Going.

151
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,480
Let me tell you that Zhan Nancheng is a very petty person.

152
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,510
Especially, he likes to loot the treasures of others.

153
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,980
How could he then spare the things that I like?

154
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,900
By then, we just have to play some little tricks and we will surely succeed.

155
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,750
It's starting...

156
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,520
This is the venue for the official registration for the

157
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,100
competition to select the next Generalissimo Black Tortoise, the commander of the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

158
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,930
Today is the auspicious day to register.

159
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,760
May you heroes register now to join the competition.

160
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
We don't have any pen and ink here and we won't examine you.

161
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,660
No matter what method you use,

162
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,830
as long as you're able to engrave your name on those ice blocks,

163
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,740
- that will then serve as a proof of a Black Tortoise Contract.
- How could anyone write their name on that?

164
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,060
- Whether you live, die, win or lose, you can't break the contract anymore.
- Let's go give it a try.

165
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,130
I'll go first!

166
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,190
- Someone has gone up.
- That's right.

167
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,810
If you really are able to win this competition and get conferred as Generalissimo Black Tortoise,

168
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,710
you then will be commanding the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

169
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,400
That's an honor that will last throughout your generations.

170
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,630
Of course. Generalissimo Black Tortoise is the highest form of honor here in Heaven Fiend .

171
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,640
If you're able to obtain it, your descendants need not already worry about their source of living.

172
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,570
Even if you have to risk your life in exchange for it, it's worth it.

173
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,980
[Zhao]

174
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,890
I'll go up and give it a try, too.

175
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,400
Royal Older Brother, I've personally delivered the invitation to Crown Prince, inviting him to enter the palace

176
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,040
and be the judge for the selection of the Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

177
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,500
Prepare some rare items, too, and deliver them to him.

178
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,000
Before, just because of that Zhangsun Pingrong, we've offended him.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
We must exert some effort to curry his favor.

180
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Then, regarding Prince Assist?

181
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,100
What about it?

182
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,900
We've made a pact with him.

183
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,300
So what?

184
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,700
There's no such thing as an eternal ally.

185
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,200
Didn't he come here just because of the Earth Absorbing Bell?

186
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,600
Whoever is beneficial to me, then he's my ally.

187
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,800
If Zhangsun Pingrong doesn't understand that,

188
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,600
he shouldn't make false hopes of getting this crown prince position anymore.

189
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,800
Before,

190
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,700
it was my mistake to put my bet on Zhangsun Pingrong.

191
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,200
Now, I must pay a higher price

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,000
to make up for this mistake.

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,600
And if we want to defeat Crown Prince Wuji,

194
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,900
we then must first get near him.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,200
Will he be able to carve his name?

196
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
Even this one is competing, really?

197
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,800
Good! Good!
[Jiang Feng]

198
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,600
Never thought that this guy who looked this gentle and weak,

199
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
actually has such deep internal energy.

200
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,740
Jiang Feng!

201
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,800
Why did you leave without saying a thing?

202
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
Why are you hiding from me like this?

203
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,900
Crown Prince is a very busy man.

204
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,700
How could I dare disturb you?

205
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,500
If I have wronged you, you can directly tell me.

206
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Why must you use this method to spite me?

207
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,800
If you join the selection for the commander of Gold of Heaven Fiend, you will be facing danger.

208
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,000
I indeed want to risk danger.

209
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Even if I lose my life because of this,

210
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's way better than being called as someone serving by Crown Prince's side.

211
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,870
I've been learning martial arts since I was little.

212
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,000
I have always had the dream to become a great commander.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,030
If you're unable to give me that chance,

214
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,100
don't hinder me then.

215
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
If there's no other matter,

216
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,700
I'll take my leave.

217
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,800
What is the relation of Jiang Feng and Crown Prince?

218
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Jiang Feng!

219
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,800
No matter what their relationship is, looks like he has connections.

220
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,000
This competition won't be a simple one.

221
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,810
General, it's already late.

222
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,720
We should set out.

223
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,200
Come out!

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,130
Stop hiding!

225
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,990
I just knew that you'd follow me.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,670
I'll take you with me from now on.

227
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:25,900
Being a woman, leaving you alone is too dangerous.

228
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,800
You're willing to let me follow you?

229
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,200
I also never disliked that you did.

230
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,030
It's just that this journey is too dangerous.

231
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,600
I don't want to drag others into this.

232
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
It's not dragging.

233
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,440
Fifth Older Brother, be at ease.

234
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,900
I will surely not make you worry.

235
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,100
Let's go.

236
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Fifth Older Brother...

237
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,800
From now on, I'll celebrate your birthday for you.

238
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,800
Everyone in the Five Regions knows about Royal Older Brother's might.

239
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,600
The commander selection for the Gold of Heaven Fiend has caught great attention.

240
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,300
There are already almost 500 brave men who registered.

241
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,500
There are even foreign ones who are joining.

242
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,400
But that person that I'm giving importance to is refusing to accept my invitation.

243
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,000
It is indeed strange that Crown Prince refused to attend such a bustling event.

244
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,300
What could he be planning?

245
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,200
He is refusing to stand on my side, but he insisted on staying here in Rock City.

246
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,800
I then must always worry about his safety here in Heaven Fiend for I might get in trouble with it.

247
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,000
I actually heard some rumors.

248
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,800
Crown Prince actually went to the registration venue.

249
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,400
His purpose was to look for a person.

250
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Who?

251
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,800
This person is called Jiang Feng.

252
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
He's one of the competitors.

253
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,600
I heard that in front of so many people,

254
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,000
Crown Prince was urging this person to go back for he is worried that his life will be endangered.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,700
The two of them were pulling and pushing. They are quite intimate.

256
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
What's his background?

257
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,200
I've investigated it.

258
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,800
This person is a member of the Crown Prince's Secret Guard.

259
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
He has accompanied him since he was little and never left his side.

260
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,500
Technically speaking, the Secret Guard of the Imperial City comes and goes like a shadow,

261
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,200
but only this person has won the trust of Crown Prince and is highly favored.

262
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,000
He always stays by his side.

263
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,920
I had to put on an act with him every day.

264
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,400
It's more tiring than martial arts training.

265
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,800
It's all because of your rotten idea.

266
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
If you do this again, I won't play with you anymore.

267
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,400
If you're unable to endure it now, expect worse in the future.

268
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,800
Older Sis Fuyao, Mr. Zong is back!

269
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,600
Mr. Zong.

270
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:06,600
Doctor, it's fine that you left without any notice.

271
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,800
You even had to return in such a silent manner.

272
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,200
Aren't you afraid that this place is a trap set up by Zhan Nancheng?

273
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
You came back just to die.

274
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,400
When I returned, there were spies everywhere.

275
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,440
I'm sure that they have long known that I was here.

276
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,260
That's great then.

277
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,000
Out of a moment of anger, this Jiang Feng joined the competition.

278
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,700
He cares a lot about this person?

279
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,900
From the looks of it, he indeed does.

280
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,870
Good.

281
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,700
How did it go?

282
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,400
Qi Zhen has escaped.

283
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,400
Has Yun Hen pardoned him?

284
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,800
That's not the case.

285
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,800
He was unable to kill him at that time and said he'll just imprison him forever.

286
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,900
Although I was against it, I couldn't force him to kill anyone.

287
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,700
It's just that not long after getting imprisoned, news of Qi Zhen being sick came out.

288
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,580
A wise man loves people based on proper moral standards.

289
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,600
A short-sighted person loves others without any principles.

290
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,280
This is not being kind.

291
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,800
It's being weak.

292
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
You two brothers have different standpoints.

293
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Qi Zhen for you is an arch enemy.

294
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,200
But for Yun Hen, it's eighteen years of love and care.

295
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,700
Revenge must be sought, but a debt of gratitude must be repaid, too.

296
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,210
Repaying a debt of gratitude?

297
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,600
He indeed is repaying his debt of gratitude.

298
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,800
What about Qi Zhen?

299
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,000
I fear that he's hiding in the dark and just waiting for a chance to make a comeback.

300
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,500
With Yun Hen having such a personality, how could he bear the burden of being king of Deep Water?

301
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,800
No one was born to kill.

302
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,000
There are some walls that he must run into by himself.

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,600
Until one day, when he's badly beaten, when he knows how to feel pain,

304
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,830
he will then understand.

305
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,460
I still hope that things will go smoothly for him.

306
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,100
What is your plan then?

307
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,020
I won't be able to be at ease until Qi Zhen is killed.

308
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
How about this?

309
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,300
Rather than sitting back and waiting, why not lure him into your lair?

310
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
What do you think?

311
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,830
You get to have three lifetimes of misfortunes if you meet the wrong person.

312
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:33,410
- You're saying that Mr. Zong will be joining that commander competition, too?
- Yes.

313
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,700
You will go act as Jiang Feng and then you two deliberately pretended to be very close,

314
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,800
so as to attract that Zhan Nancheng's attention, right?

315
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,400
Why then is Mr. Zong going?

316
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,210
Why are you so stupid?

317
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,080
Think about it again.

318
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,800
Was he afraid that you'll get hurt during the competition, so he sent Mr. Zong to save you?

319
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
You're so stupid!

320
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,500
Isn't that it?

321
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,100
Think about it. I'm Jiang Feng.

322
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,800
- I'm a Secret Guard.
- That's right.

323
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,090
For so many years, I've quietly stayed by Crown Prince's side.

324
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,500
I don't have any official title nor prestige.

325
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,600
I even have to watch some Medical Sage of Five Regions

326
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
stealing my only best friend, the Crown Prince, away.

327
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,100
Hence, I felt so disappointed.

328
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,700
I felt so depressed.

329
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,000
You got jealous of them, so you left Crown Prince.

330
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And at this time, that Zhan Nancheng surely will want to get you on his side.

331
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,800
Correct. I was jealous.

332
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:39,400
Hence, me changing to another job, dissatisfactions and grievances will become reasonable now. Right?

333
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,600
Okay now?

334
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,500
What about me?

335
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,300
What will I be portraying? Have you already made the arrangements?

336
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Portray what? I'm going, too.

337
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,200
How come you're always around?

338
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Oh, you two...

339
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,000
can portray the tree by Crown Prince's side.

340
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,100
The auspicious time has arrived!

341
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,930
Crown Prince Wuji really won't come?

342
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,750
The carriages I've sent to fetch him are still waiting.

343
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,150
I don't know if he'll be able to come today.

344
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,070
I've done everything that I should do.

345
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,910
I didn't lack in gifts or official writings.

346
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,600
If he wants to put on airs, why must he do it right under my sight?

347
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,740
Is he deliberately embarrassing me?

348
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,470
Where are they?

349
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,450
What's the content of the first round?

350
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,370
Hunting kill.

351
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:20,000
Since the day of the registration,

352
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,160
all the people who left their names on the registration wall have been given a white belt.

353
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,790
Today, they will become the assassination target of the highly skilled secret guards of the city.

354
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:34,980
I've sent an order that anyone with such a mark mustn't be kept alive.

355
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,470
Whoever is able to safely arrive here will be considered to have successfully escaped the assassination attempt.

356
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,810
Only those that are able to enter the Chill Palace Hall alive will be considered to have passed this round.

357
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,690
Who are you? Who sent you?

358
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,800
This is the selection competition of the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

359
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,650
We've received orders to assassinate all contestants.

360
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,020
Only those survivors who can enter the Chill Palace Hall will join the second round of competition.

361
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,660
How many people have survived?

362
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,950
Only about 10%.

363
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,620
May Mister quickly rush towards the Chill Palace Hall.

364
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,530
They all just came here to Heaven Fiend to seek an official career.

365
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,540
They never offended anyone.

366
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,420
Why must their lives get treated as if they have no value?

367
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,440
It's just a competition.

368
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,620
Why must they use such a ruthless method?

369
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,760
Ruthless? Anyone who will say such a word

370
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,610
is either a child still feeding on his mother's milk,

371
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,160
or someone who doesn't know what being a Gold of Heaven Fiend is.

372
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,540
Our Gold of Heaven Fiend has always been people who have climbed out of a pile of corpses.

373
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,490
Which commander hasn't stood in a pool of blood?

374
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,000
Of course, I understand that.

375
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,090
That's why I especially arranged for this first round.

376
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,400
Younger Brother Heng, you really know me.

377
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,730
The first important duty of a commander of Gold of Heaven Fiend is to stay alive.

378
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,160
If those competitors don't even clearly know that,

379
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,240
then they deserve to die.

380
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,790
What Royal Older Brother said is so right.

381
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,220
- How long must we wait before this place gets lively?
- Very soon.

382
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,720
After the incense has completely burned, the gates of Chill Palace Hall will be closed.

383
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,190
Even if they survive,

384
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,180
but are late in entering this place,

385
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,580
they will also get eliminated.

386
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:35,660
Crown Prince Wuji has arrived!

387
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:05,000
I thought that Your Highness Crown Prince disliked our Heaven Fiend for being a harsh and ragged place;

388
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900
hence, I wouldn't be able to make you come here today.

389
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,110
The King of Heaven Fiend is showing great hospitality to invite me here.

390
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,550
How could I not come?

391
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,970
Please.

392
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,550
Crown Prince, are you waiting for someone?

393
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:20,980
Greetings, Your Majesty!

394
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,380
Greetings, Your Majesty!

395
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,120
I think no one can cure my illness anymore,

396
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,260
unless it's Zong Yue.

397
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,730
All of you are highly skilled martial artists.

398
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,460
All also came here for the commander position of the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

399
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,690
I won't say much anymore.

400
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,600
The person who wins today's competition here

401
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,860
will become the new commander of Gold of Heaven Fiend

402
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,310
and will be conferred the title Heaven Fiend Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

403
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,000
He will forever enjoy wealth, fame, and glory!

404
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,360
I meticulously designed your competition today.

405
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,320
Don't disappoint my effort.

406
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,970
Get up!

407
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,290
Qi Yun? Why did she come?

408
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,190
This is a treasure of our Heaven Fiend.

409
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,960
Today, I want to ask you all to help me get it.

410
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,260
Whoever among you will be able to bring it out of there first,

411
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,690
he then is the victor.

412
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,240
But once the lighted fire cut off the rope

413
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,820
and the treasure falls, then for the competition today,

414
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,630
I will be considered the victor.

415
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,800
This is the venue for your competition for today.

416
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,990
If you want to get this treasure, you must get out of that area.

417
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,360
But if you are touched by a sword, you'll also be considered to have lost.

418
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,140
If you get stabbed by it,

419
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,650
I don't need to say it anymore.

420
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,370
Start!

421
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,570
The competition starts now!

422
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,130
Crown Prince looks as if you know someone among them.

423
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,150
He has stayed by my side since he entered the palace at age 5.

424
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:18,140
After being together for so long, it can't be helped to have developed some affection.

425
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,870
Recently, we had some minor conflict and he insisted on coming here to join with the fun.

426
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,390
If he does create any trouble, hope Older Brother Zhan can forgive him.

427
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,030
Is it that mister with box-like prints on his clothing?

428
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,020
Indeed.

429
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,450
- Who then is this one?
- Zong Yue.

430
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,450
The Medical Sage, Mr. Zong?

431
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,950
He is also my longtime friend.

432
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,520
One is a close childhood friend.

433
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,210
One is a good friend that I completely trust.

434
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,210
Who should I support to win then?

435
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,080
Crown Prince is such a loyal friend.

436
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,030
That is a good thing! That is a good thing!

437
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,520
I'm not your competition.

438
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,550
Just do as you want.

439
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,690
I'm Tang Yizhong from Plough!

440
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,050
Thanks.

441
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,420
Older Brother Yue.

442
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,020
Mr. Zong is already famous throughout the Five Regions.

443
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,960
Why must you compete with nameless younger ones like us

444
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,260
for a position that you don't really care about?

445
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,500
I thought you were some great person.

446
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,840
It's just one of the secret guards by Wuji's side.

447
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,140
You said it right. I indeed don't care about this position,

448
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,380
but I just don't want you to win it.

449
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,990
You're not my competition.

450
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,690
Give up.

451
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,770
That is exactly what I want to say, too.

452
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:05,060
Older Brother Zhan, I have something to request today.

453
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,460
Can you just let both of those two win?

454
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:10,880
If they continue to fight like this, I fear that one of them might get hurt.

455
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,660
No need!

456
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,450
I don't want to earn my achievement through Crown Prince's charity.

457
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,960
Jiang Feng, you—

458
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,330
Zong Yue!

459
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,540
Good!

460
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,360
Little Ye.

461
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,550
Little Ye.

462
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,770
Imperial Concubine Jing.

463
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:56,970
- For a competition that I meticulously designed,
- Get up.

464
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,180
only by putting in a live person will it become more interesting.

465
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,150
If I came late and didn't catch her, what then?

466
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,580
- She'd die.
- You—

467
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,180
What? You have an objection?

468
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,580
Your Majesty, why didn't you say so earlier that the treasure hanging earlier was a woman.

469
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,960
Because I extended my arms earlier, I almost fractured it.

470
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,610
If I got hurt because of her, Your Majesty, your gains would not make up for your losses.

471
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,520
What you said is indeed right.

472
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,070
Good thing, you're all right.

473
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,930
Since you're the winner of today's competition, I will do as I said and confer you the title.

474
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:44,500
This time, I should lead you two to see our Gold of Heaven Fiend.

475
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,480
What? What does Crown Prince mean by that?

476
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,780
This person is a member of the Secret Guard of Megrez Imperial City.

477
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,080
He has been with me for so many years.

478
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,940
We're like real brothers.

479
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,540
Hope Older Brother Zhan won't steal another person's treasure.

480
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:59,310
I am just doing things based on the rules.

481
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,520
We can't aggrieve this Sir.

482
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,420
Crown Prince, you promised me before that if I win today's competition,

483
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,900
I get to decide if I'm going to leave or not.

484
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,950
I did promise you, but I never expected that you'd win.

485
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,020
- I never—
- You never gave me any importance.

486
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,370
That's right.

487
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,750
I came from the common people class of a nameless reputation.

488
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,020
Other than being a person that has kept you company since childhood, I am nothing to you.

489
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:31,050
In the end, I couldn't compare to that medical sage.

490
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,790
Why must you be like this?

491
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,540
The competition for the commander of Gold of Heaven Fiend didn't spring up because of a personal whim.

492
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,740
The news has already been spread.

493
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,590
So many eyes in the Five Regions are watching.

494
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,640
I must still determine an outcome.

495
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,100
- Zhan—
- Also,

496
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,760
this secret guard that has served Crown Prince has outstanding bravery and is an elite and talented youth.

497
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,250
It's also rare that he was born to be this handsome.

498
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,080
Today, there were so many skilled warriors in here, but he was still able to win against everyone.

499
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,100
Your Highness Crown Prince has trained him well.

500
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,380
It would be disrespectful for me to decline such a huge benefit.

501
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,610
Thank you, Your Majesty.

502
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,930
In the palace this morning,

503
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:03,690
if not because I was thinking of helping Zhan Beiye fulfill his grand plan, I would have killed that asshole.

504
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,390
It's right that you endured it.

505
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,840
Good thing, Zhan Beiye wasn't around today.

506
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,730
If he saw that Imperial Concubine Jing got...

507
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,780
I can't really imagine it.

508
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,950
That is how vicious Zhan Nancheng is.

509
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,670
He has a purpose for putting Imperial Concubine Jing in such danger.

510
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,970
He is too sinister.

511
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:27,200
If Zhan Beiye were here, he would have rushed to save her.

512
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,980
By then, he would have fallen into his trap.

513
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,690
We must hurry and help Zhan Beiye take back his throne.

514
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,690
While that Zhan Nancheng is on the throne, I then can't stop feeling disgusted.

515
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:37,140
Of course.

516
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,970
Once you take over the Gold of Heaven Fiend,

517
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,300
you then will be able to have access to all the secrets of the Heaven Fiend Palace.

518
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,910
Zhan Beiye will be leading his army outside.

519
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,270
We must rationally coordinate with him.

520
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,010
But you must remember one thing, no matter how much you hate Zhan Nancheng,

521
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,770
you must continue playing your act.

522
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,140
If you're able to get his trust, you'll be able to clutch at his throat then.

523
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,540
Don't worry.

524
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,040
With you, Crown Prince Wuji, and Medical Sage Zong Yue around,

525
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,570
I, this Jiang Feng, will easily become a favored subject of that Zhan Nancheng.

526
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,260
Zhan Nacheng has always been very suspicious of everything

527
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,290
and everyone other than himself.

528
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,940
Even if Fuyao is able to earn his favor,

529
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,060
it will still be hard for her to get full military power over the Gold of Heaven Fiend.

530
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,290
What's important now can be divided into two steps.

531
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:37,660
First step, we must make Zhan Nancheng truly trust her.

532
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,370
Second step, we must make this guy have no one to trust.

533
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,870
Hey, do you have a problem?

534
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,900
Nothing.

535
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,500
There is a tea house over there that's very refined.

536
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,520
Let me take you there to look.

537
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,260
Walk well!

538
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,210
This. How did I teach you?

539
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:23,770
No discipline at all.

540
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:28,810
Yo, Eunuch Li, why must you still personally come here?

541
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,110
Don't mention it. Another eunuch serving His Majesty has died.

542
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:34,570
Eunuch Hua, quickly fill it up.

543
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,040
Don't cause any delay in serving His Majesty.

544
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,100
Jeez, these kids have just entered the palace.

545
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,820
They haven't learned the rules yet.

546
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,430
This one looks very quick-witted.

547
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:55,500
He then.

548
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,020
No, this kid has just entered the palace for three days.

549
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,480
He only knows to do some chores.

550
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,010
What if His Majesty gets mad about it—

551
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,740
There is a eunuch serving His Majesty dying every several days.

552
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,730
How can we use our people?

553
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,810
These newbies are the most suitable choice.

554
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,030
When one dies, we'll just hire a new one.

555
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,610
It won't be that emotionally painful to us, will it?

556
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,760
Okay. I understand this.

557
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,290
You! Quickly follow Eunuch Li to serve His Majesty!

558
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,790
Quickly!

559
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,750
- Hurry up!
- Yes.

560
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,730
Go!

561
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:47,000
Keep up!

562
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,800
No discipline at all.

563
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
