00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,340
♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,500
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,170
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,920
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,920
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,700
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,810
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,820
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,570
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,250
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:13,390
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:21,510
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,760
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,460
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,410
~ Episode 62 ~

22
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,290
Your Highness Crown Prince!

23
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,580
His Majesty said that you must personally kill the traitor of the royal clan!

24
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,370
Announce it to the world to serve as a warning!

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,090
You still came.

26
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,060
In today's battle, no matter who wins,

27
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,630
the two of us are going to fight for who lives.

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,380
There's one thing that you must promise me first.

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,550
This mess all started with me.

30
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,460
I will bear all the crimes.

31
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,140
It has nothing to do with others.

32
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,380
It has nothing to do with the brothers that're behind me right now.

33
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,120
Give them a chance to survive.

34
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,470
Give them their deserved future.

35
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,260
I promise you.

36
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,740
Okay.

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,980
- Come then.
- Wait.

38
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,460
- Where are they?
- Who?

39
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,410
The people you care about are also the people I care about.

40
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,510
I never did and never will hurt them.

41
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,690
Your sword skills were once one of the most outstanding in Firmament.

42
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,500
It's just that I never had any chance to duel with you.

43
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,090
Today, I hope you can open my eyes.

44
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,740
Fuyao, you give it to me. Give it to me.

45
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,970
Give it to me! You give it to me!

46
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,910
Fuyao, give it to me.

47
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,750
- Give it to me! Fuyao.
- Empress, listen to me.

48
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,810
I already suffered the pain of not being by the side of the person I love for the rest of my life.

49
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,120
I surely can't let my son suffer the same torment.

50
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,790
Empress, listen to me.

51
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,280
There are millions of women here in Five Regions, but only you are Wuji's mother.

52
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,800
No, listen to me. Give that to me.

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,030
You think of a way to quickly find Wuji and let him... let him come save me.

54
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,090
Let him know about the entire truth here.

55
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,490
Empress, if only one person can leave between us today,

56
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:11,520
it should be you.

57
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,960
I've been training in martial arts since I was little.

58
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,930
I've also taken in a lot of poisons recently.

59
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,740
They not only didn't kill me, they even improved my inner energy.

60
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,050
Don't worry.

61
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,230
The poison here won't harm me.

62
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:27,700
If you go out now, you still have a chance to bring Wuji back to save me.

63
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,330
Don't, Fuyao!

64
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,080
No! Fuyao!

65
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,930
Fuyao...

66
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,410
Fuyao? Fuyao? Are you all right, Fuyao?

67
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,690
- Fuyao.
- I'm fine.

68
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,860
- I'll take you to escape with me.
- Impossible.

69
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,520
He... will never let us leave together.

70
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,720
Quickly go. Look for Wuji to save me.

71
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,900
You must endure. We will surely return to save you.

72
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,170
Hurry. Quickly leave. You quickly leave.

73
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,630
You? You saw it, right?

74
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,840
I know that you can see it.

75
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,330
You... what you wanted to kill...

76
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,540
wasn't any of us.

77
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,770
I know... what you want to kill...

78
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:49,610
is Wuji's kind heart.

79
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,190
I am just... an outsider.

80
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,620
I carelessly, carelessly disturbed your plot.

81
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,630
Now... Now, I'm dying.

82
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:21,430
I hope... I hope that you can let Wuji off.

83
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,820
Let him...

84
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,080
Let him maintain a bit of kindness,

85
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,770
because...

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,900
because you are his most respected person.

87
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:52,670
Wuji...

88
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,110
His Majesty asked us to wait for you here and escort you to the place where you want to go.

89
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,890
The place where I want to go?

90
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,790
You indeed are able to predict everything.

91
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,070
Zhangsun Jiong, no matter how much we struggle in this lifetime,

92
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,770
we won't be able to escape this death game of yours.

93
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,600
If there really isn't a chance to turn around this hopeless situation, I will admit defeat.

94
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,930
Since you know where I'm going,

95
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,120
let's go then.

96
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,980
Your Majesty,

97
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,890
the carriage of Empress Yuan has now headed in the direction of the north bank of the river.

98
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,600
What about the other one?

99
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,320
She probably... won't last long.

100
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,790
With what I've done,

101
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,860
was I too ruthless?

102
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,560
Your Majesty is the emperor of Five Regions.

103
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,330
Everything, from rewards to punishment,

104
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,270
is all for the sake of Five Regions.

105
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,480
Being ruthless is also for the sake of Five Regions.

106
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,780
I also had the fortune of training in Firmament.

107
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,490
But I never thought that our sword technique would be this similar.

108
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,930
It's just that I'm a bit old now.

109
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,430
Firmament teaches sword technique and also inner technique.

110
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,480
How come Royal Uncle only remembered the stances of the sword in your hand,

111
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:47,060
and forgot the principles of a ruler and his subjects, the courtesy between brothers?

112
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,280
The courtesy between brothers?

113
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,700
Your Majesty, Official Duan sent a message

114
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,160
that the rebel army has surrendered.

115
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,190
Prince Virtue has been captured alive by Crown Prince.

116
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,190
Has Crown Prince made his move?

117
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,770
Crown Prince said that Prince Virtue is, after all, a member of the Megrez imperial clan.

118
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:29,700
He's going to leave the decision on how to handle him with you.

119
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,330
Send my order.

120
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,040
Execute him right there and then.

121
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,680
- Yes.
- Hurry.

122
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,370
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Rest for a while.

123
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:42,360
- Han Lin, don't mind me. Go and spread my decree.
- Your Majesty.

124
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,040
Execute immediately.

125
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,650
Yes.

126
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,820
Deliver it! Make it fast!

127
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,480
Fuyao.

128
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,490
Uncle Zhou.

129
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,320
Yes.

130
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,830
- Uncle Zhou.
- Yes.

131
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:28,570
Am I... dead, Uncle Zhou?

132
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,670
With me around, you won't die.

133
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,670
Uncle Zhou,

134
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,620
you're real.

135
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,340
Uncle Zhou,

136
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,430
you're not an illusion...

137
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,900
No, no, this is not an illusion.

138
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:07,240
When we were in Mt. Mystic Soul,

139
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,170
everything that you saw were visions that I wanted you to see.

140
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,600
There are still a lot that you don't know.

141
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,020
Let me slowly tell them to you. Okay?

142
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,060
Uncle Zhou,

143
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,240
my... my journey was really a tough one.

144
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:31,870
- It was really so tiring.
- Yes.

145
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,810
Every time... that I feel that I can't hold on anymore,

146
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,830
I would think... I really want to return to your side.

147
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,810
I so want to return to the carefree days in Mt. Mystic Soul.

148
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:53,500
But I know... that you're not around anymore.

149
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,000
I can only persist on my own.

150
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,780
Uncle Zhou, I really miss you so much.

151
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,240
I really miss you so much.

152
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,730
Child, listen to me.

153
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,890
Since you left Mt. Mystic Soul,

154
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,090
I have always been by your side looking out for you.

155
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,070
Everything that you've gone through and those that you'll still be experiencing,

156
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:31,810
no one can see it more clearly than me.

157
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,380
Although you didn't sense it,

158
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,040
I also never interfered with your choices,

159
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,280
but, child, I did see all those pains and sufferings that you went through.

160
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,360
For you to be able to reach this point, I actually am very happy.

161
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,650
Being able to see you again, all those sufferings are worth it.

162
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,860
Don't leave me anymore, okay?

163
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,880
I won't leave...

164
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,060
Uncle Zhou, I need to save someone right now.

165
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,620
I... want to be by his side.

166
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,360
Listen to me.

167
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,340
Your life is hanging by a thread now.

168
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,600
Why are you still thinking of other people?

169
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,700
- But Wuji, he—
- I know.

170
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:38,630
Wuji's Emperor Father wants Zhangsun Jia dead.

171
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,700
He wants Wuji to bear regrets for the rest of his life.

172
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,740
You want to stop this, am I right?

173
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,990
Uncle Zhou, how come you... ?

174
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,620
But with how you are now, you can't go anywhere.

175
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,500
Why can't I, Uncle Zhou?

176
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,260
This is a trial that you and Wuji are destined to go through.

177
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,930
You must face it.

178
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:05,650
Moreover, your body is very weak right now.

179
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,650
Uncle Zhou, I must go save Wuji.

180
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,230
He needs me!

181
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,710
If I can't even control my own fate, why don't I just die?

182
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,210
- Be obedient.
- Uncle Zhou, I surely...

183
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,850
Fuyao.

184
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,830
If I don't interfere now, you'll die from Zhangsun Jiong's poison.

185
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,450
If I interfere, I then must ask the help of the Herding Spirit God,

186
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,010
and you won't be able to escape your fate anymore.

187
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,750
Deep Water's Imperial Qilin Stage.

188
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,600
Heaven Fiend's Sky Gate Ruin.

189
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,820
Plough's Young Phoenix Lake.

190
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,260
Fuyao, three out of the five seals inside your body have been opened.

191
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,750
Before you go to Firmament, this fourth seal belongs to Megrez.

192
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,700
Now, it will be opened, too.

193
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,060
So, you're the one predestined by the five-colored stones.

194
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,660
Initially, you were just an ordinary human.

195
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,730
You could have lived your life in an ordinary manner.

196
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,520
But fate has other plans for you.

197
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,330
A thousand years ago, Five Regions was in a muddled warfare.

198
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:41,870
Although evil fire Di Feitian had been defeated,

199
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,250
he didn't disappear because of it.

200
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:50,180
Some of his remnant blood coagulated and formed the five-colored stone.

201
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,910
It is the five-colored stone that's guiding you to break your seals.

202
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,730
Once the five seals are broken,

203
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,190
Di Feitian will completely wake up.

204
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:15,790
Di Feitian's remnant sense has been ready to make trouble and is calling for you,

205
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,060
turning you into the female demon that will bring disaster to Five Regions, step-by-step.

206
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,090
It was your existence

207
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,600
that gave Di Feitian the chance to make a comeback.

208
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,790
The moment you break the five seals,

209
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,780
will be the day he wakes up.

210
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,540
You are the mastermind that will bring disaster to the Five Regions.

211
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,280
Only with you truly dying,

212
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,820
can the citizens of this world escape another apocalypse of a purgatory on earth.

213
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,700
And in this world,

214
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,550
only one person can truly destroy you.

215
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,630
Who is this person then?

216
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Now, the evil fire power inside your body has become stronger.

217
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Only he can truly destroy you

218
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,840
and forever turn you into smoke and ashes.

219
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,450
Never endangering the mortal world again.

220
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,000
He is the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf.

221
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,860
This Mystic Spirit Leaf is with me all the time.

222
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,200
If you can take this away from me, I'll help you break the seals.

223
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,440
♫ What do you know? ♫

224
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,290
When did you steal it?

225
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:35,190
No matter what, a win is a win.

226
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:38,130
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

227
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,250
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

228
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,900
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

229
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,760
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

230
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,000
I'll wait for you to find me.

231
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,360
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

232
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,590
♫ What do you use ♫

233
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,410
You finally came to find me.

234
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,060
♫ If there's no sickness ♫

235
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,190
- You—
- Where's my mystic spirit leaf?

236
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,480
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

237
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,140
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

238
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,290
Mystic Spirit Leaf.

239
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,490
I've said before that the mystic spirit leaf can contain all the truths in this world with no lies at all.

240
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,970
I just want you to see my heart.

241
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,020
This contains something very important to me.

242
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,670
My present, past and future are all in here.

243
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,550
Now I give it all to you.

244
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,710
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

245
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:48,150
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

246
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,360
It's indeed you.

247
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:55,590
So, we are destined to have a tragic love fate.

248
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:00,240
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

249
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,310
Are you now ready to accept all these?

250
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,050
In this life, when did I have the right to choose?

251
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,600
My life and death don't concern just me.

252
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,880
If my death can bring peace and stability to Five Regions,

253
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,390
I don't have any more regrets, either.

254
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,170
Uncle Zhou, who are you really?

255
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:53,620
I... am... the second among the ten saints of Five Regions,

256
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,790
Shengling.

257
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:01,490
All my life, I traveled the world and didn't care about worldly matters,

258
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,540
but I just happened to discover you by the riverside.

259
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,300
That time, that five-colored stone was wrapped around your hand.

260
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,410
I know what the appearance of the five-colored stone means,

261
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,530
but out of a moment of kindness, I didn't kill you.

262
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:31,590
I kept feeling that your life shouldn't be decided by others.

263
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:38,360
Hence, you brought me to hide in Mt. Mystic Soul.

264
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,380
Yes.

265
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,570
Mt. Mystic Soul's spiritual energy can restrict the evil fire power inside your body.

266
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:48,930
This way, you can totally live your life in an ordinary and peaceful manner.

267
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,190
But I didn't want to live like that.

268
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:07,620
Uncle Zhou, going through this journey, I never regretted it.

269
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,160
Although this journey was very dangerous,

270
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,010
I met the person that I love the most.

271
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,190
I saw the best scenery here in Five Regions.

272
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,620
Even if I will eventually die, I am now content.

273
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,800
Fuyao,

274
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,980
do you still remember this?

275
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,390
This is the way which God chose for me.

276
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,150
He will definitely cover for me.

277
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:42,030
I know. I can’t stop you, either.

278
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,450
But if you're going, you can't go empty-handed.

279
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,540
Take this.

280
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,360
Who cares about their famous or precious swords?

281
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,470
They surely will not be as easy to use as this poker.

282
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,990
- Do you know how to swim?
- I know a little.

283
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,940
That is your poker?

284
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,050
This is Evergreen Wooden Dagger from Firmament.

285
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,590
A dagger from a thousand year old wood.

286
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:47,780
I have nothing that I can gift you.

287
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,860
Just keep this dagger then.

288
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,420
The predestined one of the Mystic Spirit Leaf is just by your side.

289
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:04,930
Kill him and then no one in this world can harm your life again.

290
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,680
If you don't kill him,

291
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,390
you are then destined to continue walking down this hardest path.

292
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,810
Fuyao, I've said what should be said.

293
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,980
The choice is in your hands.

294
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:19,920
I won't interfere.

295
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,400
Fuyao, it's getting late.

296
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,350
No!

297
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:36,390
Earlier, I already gave you my lifetime of cultivation,

298
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,000
all because of ten years of raising you.

299
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,730
A day as a teacher, a lifetime as a father.

300
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,550
Let's separate here.

301
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,800
We will never see each other again.

302
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,170
Uncle Zhou.

303
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,710
Uncle Zhou!

304
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,570
Mister, the messenger from the palace has arrived.

305
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,680
Say it. What is the instruction?

306
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,330
His Majesty said that Prince Virtue has committed an unpardonable crime.

307
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,300
He should be executed in front of the army to warn them from imitating him.

308
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,930
He also said that you must do it yourself, which will give out a stronger warning.

309
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,820
Mister, you don't need to wait any longer.

310
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,340
Jiang Feng.

311
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,700
I'm here.

312
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,700
- Go prepare some food and wine.
- Yes.

313
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,590
Reading the imperial decree.

314
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,070
As written on the decree, Prince Virtue, Zhangsun Jia,

315
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:29,730
has entered and served the government for more than thirty years.

316
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,530
On the outside, he was a remarkable talent of the government.

317
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,270
But in reality, he competed for fame in the court and for his own gain in the world.

318
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:42,450
He arrogated power, stationed troops for his own use, harbored a desire to wreak havoc, and attempted to rebel.

319
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,550
He desired to use an uprising to offend his emperor and threaten the government and ancestral shrine of the Zhangsun clan.

320
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:50,160
An ungrateful rebel, he was disloyal and unfilial, merciless and unrighteous.

321
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,740
He brought trouble to the nation and endangered the citizens.

322
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,010
He has committed the most heinous crimes.

323
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,190
He cannot be tolerated.

324
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,870
Based on the information sent to me, this criminal is an immoral person.

325
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,830
There has never been a person as bad as him.

326
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,010
I had the Crown Prince supervise state affairs so that he can establish an honest and mighty prestige.

327
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:17,310
I order Crown Prince Zhangsun Wuji to immediately personally behead this criminal in front of the army

328
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,460
to serve as warning to those who will follow and let the future generations see it.

329
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,240
That's all.

330
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,630
Disloyal, unfilial, merciless, unrighteous,

331
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,050
committing a heinous crime?

332
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,840
Royal Older Brother,

333
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,400
how were you able to say such kinds of words?

334
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,190
For these past years, for Megrez, I hung my heart on my sleeves and showed devotion.

335
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:01,630
For you, how many dirty things and messes had I blocked out?

336
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,660
In the end, I actually would end up...

337
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,970
end up being the worst kind of person ever.

338
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,150
One can always trump up a charge if he wants to condemn someone.

339
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:19,350
If I leave this life of mine to you,

340
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:28,870
how many unbearable things are you still going to scatter on my corpse before you will feel content?

341
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,300
Treacherous person, don't you dare make disrespectful remarks!

342
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,420
You dare curse Lord Emperor of the inner court here?

343
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,920
What?

344
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:44,930
Why doesn't Official Duan just add a few more crimes on that decree?

345
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:46,950
I already am going to leave a bad name forever.

346
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,680
Will I still care about a few criticisms from young blood members of the inner court like you?

347
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,280
Official Duan, you have no more business here.

348
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,570
Please leave first.

349
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,730
His Majesty asked me to stay here and observe the execution.

350
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,640
I dare not be lax in my duty.

351
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,740
May Official Duan wait on the side then.

352
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,370
Just watch.

353
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,160
Crown Prince achieved merit by pacifying the uprising and personally executing the rebel.

354
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,110
You will obtain the best prestige in this world.

355
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,300
You will also obtain the best public support.

356
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,750
Look.

357
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,160
All these are your subordinates.

358
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,410
In the future, they will also become your citizens.

359
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,940
If my head can gain Crown Prince a formidable reputation in the army in exchange,

360
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,270
it is worth it.

361
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,190
It is worth it.

362
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,370
I lost to Zhangsun Jiong.

363
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,400
I surely have my discontentments.

364
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,410
But losing to you—

365
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,860
Even if what you said is all right,

366
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,890
they are all still useless.

367
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,610
Maybe, after several thousand years,

368
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:12,490
my name will be ranked as top among the executed rebels of Megrez,

369
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,780
but may Your Highness Crown Prince remember this.

370
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:23,130
My, Zhangsun Jia's, whole life has been straightforward and upright.

371
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,930
I did everything for the sake of the citizens of this world, sincerely and honestly.

372
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:30,530
I have no guilt in my heart.

373
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,050
Do the execution!

374
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,390
Stop!

375
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,450
Greetings, Empress.

376
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,160
Why did you come?

377
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,850
Empress Yuan, your status is very noble.

378
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:11,560
But at this moment, you lowered down yourself and came here to send off a treacherous rebel.

379
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,400
If this gets out, it will bring disgrace to the imperial clan.

380
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,970
Your Highness, please ask Empress to leave immediately.

381
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,950
This is too scandalous.

382
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,670
If Emperor Father asks,

383
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,950
I'll bear the consequences.

384
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,210
Why must you do this?

385
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,260
I am a person that's about to die.

386
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,380
How am I worthy for you to exert anymore effort?

387
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:00,490
