00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,370
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,530
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,500
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,920
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,660
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,540
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,080
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,730
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,910
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,050
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:06,620
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,350
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,390
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:21,450
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,780
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,340
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 53 ~

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,060
Are you trying to kill me from anger?

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,970
You don't know how to do anything.

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,280
How are you going to get married?

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,590
How will you be Zhan Beiye's wife like this?

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,540
Who said I am going to get married?

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,220
I have done everything I can.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,320
I want to live my own life now.

29
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,610
Looks like I was wrong about you.

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,550
I originally thought that you were a girl who dared to fight and charge for what she wanted regardless the difficulties.

31
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,630
Only such a person can match Zhan Beiye.

32
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,800
I didn't think that you were this childish.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,640
Just refusing to do things because you don't want to.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,540
You even cry and sob all day.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,020
You're like some bitter wife.

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,840
With your appearance now, you totally aren't compatible with Zhan Beiye.

37
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,930
Moreover, you are even blind.

38
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,610
So what if I'm blind?

39
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,600
Do you think people who can see like you are really living in a clear manner?

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,720
Let me tell you that I live with a clearer mind than people like you who can see!

41
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,490
Although I cannot see every little detail in front of me,

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,540
I can clearly see those sinister scheming thoughts of yours!

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,340
When did I have sinister—

44
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,400
What's the benefit of learning all of this needle work, books, and painting?

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,880
What's the benefit of learning these?

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,970
I, Yalan Zhu, have traveled throughout Five Regions and have never seen anyone who has won the world with these!

47
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,510
Zhan Beiye is the king of Heaven Fiend!

48
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,920
His task is to maintain the peace for the citizens of Heaven Fiend!

49
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,610
These stale books will not help him!

50
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,090
Do you know what Zhan Beiye needs? Yes?

51
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,540
Do you know? Those ladies with good virtues and are good looking?

52
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,890
Do you think they are qualified to be with him?

53
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,480
Totally not! Bullshit!

54
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,030
What he needs is a person who can give up her life for him and is able to prioritize the general situation!

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,210
And I, this blind person, am indeed very suitable for him.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,750
Impressive reasoning!

57
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,700
But if not because I abducted you,

58
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,550
you probably would have escaped from the palace now. Am I right?

59
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,070
You said you can do anything for Zhan Beiye,

60
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:44,890
but you're just bluffing! You're actually scared!

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,740
You just want to run away.

62
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,390
I am not scared! I don't want to run away!

63
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,590
Even if there's only a little bit of hope, I will not give up loving him. Not at all.

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,080
But if me liking him is burdening him and making him sad,

65
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,090
then I'd rather leave him.

66
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:19,400
Everything I have done for him was so that he can become the person he wants to be.

67
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:24,110
I don't understand anymore.

68
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,730
You blinded your eyes for him,

69
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,840
but you want to avoid him now?

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,100
Are you treating or tormenting yourself as some game or a means to earn a living?

71
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,690
I don't want to use these to force him.

72
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,550
If he were to accept me only because he feels guilty,

73
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,240
then everything I've done for him will lose its meaning.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,330
I don't want him to live in such an exhausting manner.

75
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,480
Neither do I want to occupy his everything.

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,760
I just want to happily look at him

77
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,510
continuing to live every day and that's enough.

78
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,250
I never regretted anything.

79
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,010
If he gets tied down because of these blind eyes of mine,

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,060
that is being too cruel to him.

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,630
I have my pride.

82
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,560
He has someone he likes.

83
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,360
I want to fulfill my wishes,

84
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,700
also his.

85
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,710
Are you saying then that this little scoundrel Zhan Beiye doesn't want to marry you?

86
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,360
The person he loves...

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
isn't me.

88
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,490
Fifth Older Brother.

89
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:16,820
♫ Long for a young man who forgets the date of his return ♫

90
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,890
♫ Wait for the moon to shine and then see, ♫

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,280
Why are you guys being like this?

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,420
I can't take it...

93
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,850
I searched for you for a long time,

94
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,080
just to tell you that the person I love,

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,180
the person I want to marry, that person inside my heart...

96
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,050
is you.

97
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,190
♫ Wind dances and forest movements chase away oceans and rivers ♫

98
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,980
♫ We see another young man returning to his hometown ♫

99
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,710
But... I—

100
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,960
It was me who was too foolish.

101
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:07,580
Only now did I realize that without you, I won't be able to live even for a day.

102
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,930
Not because you risked your life for me, enduring the hardship of wandering around for me,

103
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,800
it was because...

104
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,360
♫ We hold one another back ♫

105
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,130
...you planted a seed in my heart.

106
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,630
It has budded.

107
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,090
It has grown, and it grew with me.

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,950
Without it, I would never have hopes.

109
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,860
You only have one choice now.

110
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,150
Follow me forever.

111
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,390
♫ Your young face shows that you have no lover ♫

112
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,760
♫ Whom will I wait to go see bright flowers in full bloom together? ♫

113
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,360
♫ I've seen through the world and hate I love you too late ♫

114
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,370
♫ To understand cause and fact is extremely arduous ♫

115
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:18,590
♫ How much I want to look back that once we were ordinary? ♫

116
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,850
♫ We hold one another back ♫

117
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,730
♫ Hold back ♫

118
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,130
Do you have any lead?

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,010
Plough is the most reclusive and most mysterious nation.

120
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,190
They usually act very cautiously.

121
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,300
I've reviewed this letter for several days and can understand 70 to 80% of it now.

122
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,500
But if I want to understand it further, I must continue to investigate.

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,590
Hence, you asked Tie Cheng to look for that Owner Fu.

124
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,090
He probably knows something.

125
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,760
Maybe.

126
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,520
Greetings, Your Highness Crown Prince.

127
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,360
Rise to speak.

128
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,120
Are there any strange movements in Plough lately?

129
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,790
The trading between the nations in Five Regions had always been stable,

130
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,040
but lately, there were changes.

131
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,990
There are more and more items in the market now,

132
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,310
but the price of food keep falling.

133
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,840
Technically speaking, a cheaper price is a good thing,

134
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,220
but we all know that this matter isn't that simple.

135
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,660
I fear that some problems have occurred with the source.

136
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,370
A lot of grain, but less money?

137
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,790
It isn't due to excessive supplies,

138
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,910
but because there are less monetary coins?

139
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,710
Indeed. If this continues, it will lead to a great disaster.

140
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,080
Are there any strange situations in Young Phoenix Lake?

141
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,270
There are rumors that the Lava Waterfall of Young Phoenix Lake is about... to dry up.

142
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,740
We mustn't easily believe hearsay like that.

143
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,590
Unless Five Regions falls, or else, that waterfall will never disappear.

144
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,790
I instead think that if there are strange occurrences in Plough, it must be man-made.

145
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,520
Is the queen of Plough doing well lately?

146
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,320
A few days ago, I received a letter from home

147
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,960
saying that the queen is severely ill and the people in the palace are in a state of anxiety.

148
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,070
People who want to usurp the throne are each coming up with evil schemes.

149
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,510
As for how it is now, I can't be sure anymore.

150
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,980
How long ago was that letter?

151
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:50,410
Honestly, there are only two passes, Assist and Rocky, left open for traffic in Plough Nation only.

152
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,110
All letters must first pass through government inspection.

153
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,620
Hence, it's been quite a long time since I received any news.

154
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,410
Okay. If there are any strange situations, immediately report it to me.

155
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,900
Yes.

156
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,420
From the looks of it, trouble will be happening in Plough soon.

157
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,370
This letter only mentioned that the queen is very sick and the people are in danger,

158
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,420
but it didn't mention about the magma drying up.

159
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,460
That person earlier is a long term spy that I've placed in Plough.

160
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,030
His words are trustworthy.

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,580
If what he said is true, then this matter isn't that simple.

162
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,620
What's the relation of this lava with the money?

163
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,470
All coins in Five Regions are produced by Plough.

164
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,910
The main raw material for it is the Gold Magma of Young Phoenix Lake.

165
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,320
When Five Regions was initially established, Plough had a contract with other different nations

166
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,690
that unless there is war and Five Regions falls,

167
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,160
the position of Plough in driving the economy of Five Regions will never waver.

168
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,630
These past years, carts of coins have been transported from Plough to other areas of Five Regions.

169
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,650
There have never been any lapses.

170
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,160
Plough is the lifeline of Five Regions.

171
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,310
Even the Megrez Imperial City doesn't have that kind of power?

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,980
Looks like I have to make a trip to Plough.

173
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,730
Did you get any lead with the person who wrote the letter?

174
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,220
Jiang Feng said that the letter was discovered in my room.

175
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,400
It was clearly for me.

176
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,500
You said earlier that the people of Plough are in danger.

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,830
Then... will that Folian also ask for your help?

178
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,940
Since that's the case, the more I should go and take a look.

179
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,360
Oh...

180
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,020
Let's go together.

181
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,830
Teacher.

182
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,500
It looks like this old man has fallen asleep.

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,450
It's better for us not to disturb him.

184
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,060
It's just that... too bad for this good wine.

185
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:41,190
We shouldn't let it be pitiful...

186
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,260
Not pitiful at all.

187
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,460
Teacher, I just ascended to the throne.

188
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,060
There are a lot of state affairs to manage.

189
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,640
I can't stay here to keep you company anymore.

190
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,530
Today, I especially came here to bid you farewell and thank you for taking care of Yalan Zhu on my behalf.

191
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,580
Leave.

192
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,740
I feel annoyed when I see you. Quickly leave.

193
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,200
Teacher.

194
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,460
Teacher, I understand your thinking.

195
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,870
You abducted me just to stimulate my discontentment.

196
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,130
You hoped that I can persist in staying by Fifth Older Brother's side.

197
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,660
I know that you did that for our sake.

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,680
Who said so?

199
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,090
In his heart, I don't exist.

200
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,560
Why would I then do things for his sake?

201
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,700
Teacher, I—

202
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,830
What I?

203
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,430
Teacher...

204
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Teacher, you have always been in Fifth Older Brother's heart.

205
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,520
He has always respected and admired you.

206
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,660
But Teacher, you know that he has a stupid mouth.

207
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,990
He couldn't say any jokes to amuse you.

208
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,130
But it's fine. From now on, I'll be the one to say them.

209
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,260
Also, when you told me before that you were his teacher,

210
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,170
I did doubt it, but I immediately believed afterwards.

211
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,820
Because I know that you have good martial arts skills, invincible to swords and spears.

212
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,420
But you have a wound behind your right ear.

213
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,790
Hence, you fear people who would pinch your ear.

214
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,760
Am I right?

215
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,060
The reason that I knew about this

216
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,560
is because there is a very ugly warming cap inside Fifth Older Brother's palace.

217
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,210
But he treats it like some precious treasure.

218
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,290
Afterwards, I asked him about it.

219
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,530
He told me that it was a cap that you've worn for a long time.

220
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:39,420
It was to cover the wound on your right ear.

221
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,720
Also... Also, when he was still training with you,

222
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,740
he accidentally fell off Ice Cliff.

223
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,470
It was you who risked your life to save him and got hurt because of it.

224
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,240
He even told me that you have a 100% victory record.

225
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,400
You never lost in all your fights.

226
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,950
That is indeed true.

227
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:02,480
But you got hurt because of him.

228
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,610
Hence, Teacher, Fifth Older Brother has always cared about you.

229
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,810
Jeez, you better not tell anyone about these things.

230
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,590
If these get out, my reputation will be tarnished.

231
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,060
People will be laughing at me.

232
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,510
Let me tell you this. You're not allowed to say one more word of it.

233
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,720
If you dare say them again,

234
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,620
I will immediately throw this stinky rascal off Ice Cliff.

235
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,800
- Teacher!
- Teacher, you—

236
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,780
What Teacher? Quickly leave.

237
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,670
I don't want to see you two. Leave.

238
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:37,540
Teacher!

239
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,050
Teacher!

240
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,140
Wait!

241
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,790
Wait!

242
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,420
I was focused on drinking and almost forgot the most important matter.

243
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:13,200
You little scoundrel, although I don't like you,

244
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,550
but you have now ascended to the throne and became the king of Heaven Fiend after all.

245
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,230
You're about to marry and have children.

246
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,590
As your Teacher, I have to be part of it. Right?

247
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,390
I actually don't have anything good to gift you,

248
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:34,600
but this wife of yours is indeed very adorable.

249
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:38,820
I'll pass to her a martial arts technique then.

250
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,400
Treat it as my gift for your wedding.

251
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,450
After raising you for a long time, I just raised a money-losing commodity again (refers to a girl in ancient times since they are married off).

252
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,400
Fifth Older Brother, I can see you.

253
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Fifth Older Brother, I can see now.

254
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,230
Really?

255
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,920
Good.

256
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,510
Thank you, Teacher!

257
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,770
Aren't you going to hurry and leave?

258
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,310
- You're back.
- Yes.

259
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,280
Lei Dong didn't do anything to you, right?

260
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,110
No, he didn't. Look. I'm all right.

261
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,580
You?

262
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,260
Your eyes...

263
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,840
You can now see?

264
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,490
It was all thanks to Teacher.

265
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,810
I'm too happy.

266
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,790
I was even worried... that old man would do something to you.

267
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:33,900
Never thought that Zhan Beiye had such a powerful teacher. He didn't even tell us.

268
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,330
I also never expected it.

269
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,160
Teacher was quite strange initially.

270
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,360
Later on, after being with him for quite some time, I realized that he was a very nice person.

271
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,300
My Little Tail is back.

272
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,860
This is great.

273
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,970
Older Sister, why are you dressed like that?

274
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,860
Do I look like Zong Yue with this get up?

275
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,120
You do, but you look prettier than him.

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,850
Of course.

277
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,460
I'll be staying by Wuji's side,

278
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,760
so it's more convenient to disguise as that Medical Sage.

279
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,140
But... where are you two going?

280
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,810
Something happened in Plough.

281
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,150
We're going there to check it.

282
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,290
Are you leaving now?

283
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:24,600
Fifth Older Brother has just become the King of Heaven Fiend and you also has just became Prefect Vast.

284
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,550
Why must you leave now?

285
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,970
We must personally check the matters in Plough.

286
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,760
You two are... ?

287
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,550
We heard that the magma in Young Phoenix Lake is dwindling.

288
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,960
What?

289
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,010
This matter surely didn't come from nowhere.

290
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,390
I must personally investigate it.

291
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,790
Do you need me to do anything?

292
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,630
Plough is the money lifeline of Five Regions.

293
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:01,490
If anything bad happens to it indeed,

294
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,680
I fear that someone will use this opportunity to cause trouble.

295
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:08,520
If it can't be helped, I need Heaven Fiend to help in preserving the peace.

296
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,590
Try your best to avoid any wars or conflicts.

297
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,990
Okay.

298
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:18,930
For this matter, my Heaven Fiend will never decline.

299
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,500
But...

300
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,030
why must you take Fuyao with you?

301
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,020
What if an unforeseen event happens in Plough?

302
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,730
Aren't you placing her in danger?

303
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,900
I can't decide for that.

304
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,530
My own desire is of measly strength.

305
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,500
Fuyao has her own choice.

306
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,510
That stupid Zhan Beiye took so long to realize your good traits.

307
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:57,250
Let me tell you. Don't be too good to him.

308
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,350
The more you submit to him, the more he'll ignore you.

309
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,650
If he dares to bully you, immediately tell me.

310
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,560
I'll beat him up for you.

311
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,150
Yes.

312
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,600
After going through so much, I only know one thing.

313
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:17,330
He surely will not disappoint me.

314
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,020
Don't worry.

315
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,600
But for you two, I can't stay by your side anymore.

316
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,810
You must be careful. Do you hear me?

317
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,010
Yes.

318
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,540
Nothing bad will happen to us.

We still have to return to attend your wedding.

General Zhan is a good man.

321
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,600
You surely will not suffer if you go with him.

322
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,840
Also, living in this palace will surely be better than wandering outside.

323
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,690
You finally have a home.

324
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,410
Oh, right. When we were in Deep Water before,

325
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,650
you told me that the stir-fried maythorn with sugar here is the best.

326
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:56,070
We had to face a lot of battles and chaos along the way, so I didn't have the time.

327
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,990
Here, I bought some for you.

328
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,230
You take care, too.

329
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,690
Yes.

330
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,880
It's getting late.

331
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,060
You must be careful.

332
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,230
Take care.

333
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,500
It's near.

334
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,880
It's getting nearer.

335
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:56,610
You finally are going to that place.

336
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,470
This is your fate.

337
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,940
No one can change it.

[Gathering of Eminent People]

339
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,420
Never thought that a city-state like this would exist here.

340
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,130
Did you find out anything?

341
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,820
There is indeed a problem with the Lava Waterfall of Young Phoenix Lake.

342
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,400
If this continues, I fear that it will dry up very soon.

343
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,850
Will it affect the Five Regions?

344
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,560
If the output of the Lava Waterfall decreases,

345
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,150
this will incite plundering of mines and hoarding of food and money.

346
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,350
By then, Five Regions will be in shock and will be in an irreversible hopeless situation.

347
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,650
Have you heard it? All minters of Young Phoenix Lake have been arrested!

348
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,580
Is that right? Really? They have all been arrested?

349
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:09,170
Indeed. Let me tell you,

350
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,460
can't you see those Purple Cloak out in the streets capturing people left and right?

351
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,200
Who is the Purple Cloak?

352
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,390
They are a military power that loyally serves the royal family of Plough.

353
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,180
Hence, this Purple Cloak capturing people

354
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:26,780
is probably a way of the royal clan to cover up the secrets of the Young Phoenix Lake.

355
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:31,640
The Plough royal clan knows that something bad has happened,

356
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,800
but they haven't reported it to Megrez Imperial City and keep covering it up.

357
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,110
There must be some unspeakable secret behind this. Right?

358
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,460
There is one more possibility.

359
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,560
Maybe the queen of Plough doesn't know anything and is now just a figurehead.

360
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,820
Hey, let me read that letter again.

361
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,970
Hence, for matters like that,

362
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,160
we should talk less about it.

It's indeed different.

366
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,960
The totem of Plough Nation is the phoenix.

367
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,380
As long as you're a citizen of Plough Nation,

368
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:23,520
you can come up with different designs based on the phoenix.

369
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,940
This is of the same principle with the Ice Land Eagle of Heaven Fiend and the Dragon Scales of Deep Water.

370
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,370
Hence, here in Plough,

371
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,310
there are numerous similar but also totally different phoenixes.

372

Yes.

Hey!

374
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,400
Do you still remember the image of the phoenix totem you're looking for?

375
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,600
How did you know that I'm looking for a phoenix?

376
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,290
Or else, what?

- I don't remember anymore.
- Move aside!

Okay already. Let's not talk about it anymore.

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,850
Get out of the way.

- Arrest him.
- But Official,

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,830
Zhu San has a mole on his forehead.

This person has none.

389
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
- It's better to wrongly capture 3,000 than let go of one.
- Yes.

390
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,940
May I ask what crime we've committed?

391
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,980
It has nothing to do with you.

392
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,620
Move aside.

393
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,240
Can you just capture people without evidence?

394
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,970
Is there still any law?

395

Who gave you such boldness to fight with my Purple Cloak?

401
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm just exchanging some moves with them. I don't harbor any evil intentions.

402
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,490
Exchanging moves?

403
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,920
Fine then. Let me be the one to battle with you.

404
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,930
You dare be frivolous with me?

405
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,330
I think you don't want to live anymore!

406
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,200
Arrest him!

No...

How did you know?

473
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,880
How did I know?

474
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,260
Who doesn't know?

475
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,570
Even Yuan Bao noticed it.

476
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,610
No way...

477
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,500
Yalan Zhu also knows herself.

478
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,420
I... this...

479
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,020
Your Highness, I have leads on the matter you asked me to investigate.

480
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,610
There are 127 people listed as minters in Young Phoenix Lake.

481
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,280
In our several surprise raids, we've captured 126 people.

482
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,230
One is missing.

483
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,300
Who?

484
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,440
A worker handling the chores.

485
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,860
Because of a personal matter, he asked for a leave of absence from his superior.

486
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,320
Hence, he wasn't on site when we did the arrests today.

487
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,880
Useless.

488
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,480
The changes in Young Phoenix Lake have great implications.

489
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,030
No news must get out.

490
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,930
Everyone who might know about it mustn't be left alive.

491
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,730
I understand.

492
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:05,410
Hence, we've found the home address of this worker.

493
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,330
Misters, you don't have any wine to drink anymore, right?

494
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,930
I have a lot of wines here.

495
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,460
Just drink as much as you want.

496
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,360
Thanks. Let's drink together.

497
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,220
You two must have come from afar.

498
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,710
That's right.

499
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,300
It was really hard to get in here.

500
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:34,800
With such a huge Plough, there were only two passes.

501
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,180
And upon entering, there were Purple Cloak members everywhere.

502
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,720
Did anything bad happen?

503
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,160
Nothing much.

504
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,250
It's just that the people above gave an order,

505
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,180
telling us to stay indoors for it's very chaotic outside.

506
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,540
If we don't have anything important, we shouldn't casually leave Plough.

507
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,010
- How come I heard that something bad has happened in Young Phoenix Lake?
- Thanks.

508
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,530
You mustn't casually say such things.

509
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,740
You'll get killed because of it.

510
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,950
Everything here is going smoothly.

511
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,490
What bad thing can happen?

512
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,090
You probably just heard some made-up stories.

513
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,220
Don't believe them. Let's drink. Let's drink.

514
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,260
It's getting late.

515
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,410
You two better rest early.

516
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,130
Okay. Thank you for your wine.

517
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,370
This freak weather of Plough is unbearable, Older Sis Fuyao.

518
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,490
Is he asleep?

519
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,620
He's always tired every day for thinking about so many things and he even had to protect us two.

520
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,490
He must be too exhausted.

521
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,160
Let him have a good sleep under such weather.

522
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,480
Wuji... Wuji, what's wrong?

523
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,830
Older Sis Fuyao, why is he perspiring a lot?

524
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:49,490
What's wrong, Older Sis Fuyao? What's wrong with him?

525
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,350
Since I gave you these orders, how come there are still no results?

526
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:11,120
It was you who brought this kind of punishment to yourself.

527
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,120
I can't help you.

528
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:46,760
Once this young girl bearing the five-colored stone breaks her five seals,

529
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,790
she will completely become a demon.

530
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:54,420
Di Feitian will also get reawakened because of her.

531
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,240
By then, darkness will cover up the entire Five Regions.

532
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,890
You are very weak and very helpless.

533
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,430
But who told you to be the one predestined by the Mystic Spirit Leaf?

534
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:17,370
For the Five Regions, you have no retreat path, Wuji.

535
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:22,700
If the female demon isn't eliminated, the world will end.

536
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,260
Wuji, you must kill her.

537
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,660
You must kill her.

538
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,360
Kill her...

539
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,160
The essential Qi inside him is in disarray.

540
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,200
If this continues, I don't know what can happen.

541
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,080
I'll immediately use my energy to nurse his essential Qi.

542
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,310
In this time period, there mustn't be anyone or anything that will disturb us,

543
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,730
or else, we both will be in danger.

544
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,230
Okay.

545
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,400
Help me go put the lights out and close the doors.

546
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,100
Make sure to guard well.

547
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,680
Remember the words I said earlier.

548
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,000
Be careful, Older Sis Fuyao.

549
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,960
No, they can't be disturbed right now.

550
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,460
It's fine, Older Sis Fuyao. It's the Purple Cloak. They are looking for someone.

551
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,180
They'll leave once they don't see him. Don't worry.

552
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,260
Don't kill me!

553
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,800
Chase after him! Go!

554
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,190
Are there still any members of their household?

555
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,890
The Li family is a rich family in this manor.

556
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,330
Today is his son's wedding day.

557
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:51,930
There should be two more people in here.

558
00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:54,800
Then don't leave anyone alive.

559
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:16,150
