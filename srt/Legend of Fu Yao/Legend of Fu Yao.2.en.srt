♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,540
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,660
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,860
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,900
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,550
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,070
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,740
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,790
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,970
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,360
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,480
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,880

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,510
~ Episode 2 ~

22
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,100
Your Highness, the King has conferred on you Heir Apparent of Deep Water.

23
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,780
Is this for real?

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,930
What do you think?

25
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:00,350
Great. Great.

26
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,510
I'll be this king then.

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,950
Why did godfather spare his life?

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,870
And even let him become the heir apparent?

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,250
This person is just an idiot. It can't be that godfather—

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,900
Yun Hen, have you taken care of the matters that I ordered for you to handle?

31
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,670
All of the troops in the capital have complied to your order to stay put.

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,790
How is the king?

33
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,720
Ever since taking the medicine, the king has been in a lethargic sleep.

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,090
I am afraid that it's hard for him to wake up again.

35
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,730
But the imperial doctor said that he will definitely live until the day of the heir apparent's enthronement.

36
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,050
- It's just that—
- It's just that

37
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,830
you don't know why we are so close to succeeding,

38
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,120
and yet I am stopping all of a sudden. Right?

39
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,330
You must have your reasons.

40
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,470
I've put so much effort into planning for this long,

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,930
and yet I overlooked this only matter.

42
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,850
Even if you killed me,

43
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,470
when the throne is empty, then the royal power of Deep Water

44
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,550
will once again go back and belong to Megrez Empire.

45
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,040
What did you say?

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,450
If the royalties die off, then the nation will also be over.

47
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:55,090
Those are the original rules set for the five regions.

48
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,020
How would an outsider like you know about it?

49
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,150
Today, if our Xuanyuan clan dies off,

50
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:10,640
Deep Water will then become a swamp nation.

51
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,020
Since we haven't gained the Water Manipulation Technique,

52
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,730
we are only left with the choice of supporting this idiot heir apparent currently.

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,670
About his background, have you investigated thoroughly?

54
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,280
I already appointed people to inquire all about it.

55
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,460
They say that this Xuanyuan Min has had a wealthy and comfortable life since he was little.

56
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,400
After the death of the old prince, he would either just go around singing,

57
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,160
or hang out and gamble with a pack of rogues.

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
The vast wealth of his family was gone just like that,

59
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,830
and he even has quite a few debts.

60
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,100
A useless prodigal son like him;

61
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:03,290
theoretically, is most fitted for the position of an heir apparent.

62
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:09,730
It's just that this person is probably not as simple as what we see.

63
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,730
Does godfather still have doubts about him?

64
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,780
The Xuanyuan clan are born with the ability to manipulate water.

65
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,180
I've tested it earlier.

66
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,620
However, about this simplest Water Manipulation Technique,

67
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,330
aside from Xuanyuan clan,

68
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:24,670
if you learn a bit of Firmament Technique, you would be able to show it, too.

69
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,710
Now, the bloodline of Xuanyuan will be terminated soon.

70
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,360
We can only leave him in the position of the heir apparent.

71
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,650
Appoint someone to find out if there is any news with Fei Yan again.

72
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:40,560
Yes.

73
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,050
Remember.

74
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,510
Before getting any additional information,

75
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,810
this Xuanyuan Min must not go to Capital Kun to ascend to the throne.

76
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,510
Yes, sir.

77
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,260
Doing laundry as a punishment to me?

78
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,670
A great opportunity for me to test out if this machine that I just made works well.

79
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,680
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

80
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,070
Hurry! Hurry!

81
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,900
- Hurry and go save Xiaobai!
- What happened to Xiaobai?

82
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,940
He got sick again! He has been mumbling for most of the day.

83
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,060
If this continues...

84
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,350
Let's hurry and find someone to take a look at him, okay?

85
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,220
I will go find First Senior Brother!

86
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,860
Why would First Senior Brother care about things like this?

87
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,310
Let's think of another way.

88
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,300
I think if this goes on, he won't make it through tonight!

89
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,160
Don't speak nonsense!

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,740
I'll think of a solution. You guard here.

91
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,990
You can't be going on the mountain to pick that flower, right? That flower is—

92
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,530
Lower your volume!

93
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,760
You can't! You can't!

94
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,010
You know already that the flower grows on the forbidden cliff.

95
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,000
Aside from the leader and a few elders, no one else is allowed to go!

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,410
If you get found out, you will be in big trouble! Not even First Senior Brother can save you then!

97
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,100
And you know how dangerous that place is!

98
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,020
Stop talking!

99
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,890
This isn't my first time to the forbidden cliff!

100
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,430
Do you not want to save Xiaobai's life?

101
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,910
Guard here! I will be back soon!

102
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,240
Don't you know the rule of first come first serve?

103
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,690
My rule is that it belongs to the person who gets it first.

104
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,000
The Kung Fu taught by Mt. Mystic Soul is not that great after all.

105
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,420
You!

106
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,250
This forbidden cliff of Mt. Mystic Soul does eat people!

107
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,150
They are just a few vines.

108
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,290
Do you really think I can't get out?

109
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,220
Why don't you try then?

110
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,550
There are a lot of birds and beasts around here.

111
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,960
In a bit, they will come and have you as a big meal.

112
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,970
All right. Let's say I lost.

113
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,150
May I ask what I need to do in order for you to save me?

114
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,360
It would have been much better if you were this obedient before.

115
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,680
If you give me the flower now, then I will save you.

116
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,360
Why should I believe you?

117
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,430
Why should you believe me?

118
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:51,010
Do you have anything to bargain with me?

119
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,120
All right. I am dying no matter what.

120
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,690
Then why don't I just eat this Baizhi Orchid now?

121
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,210
Don't!

122
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,560
I will save you then!

123
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,300
Hurry!

124
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,360
- Catch it!
- Come on.

125
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,210
Use some strength!

126
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,470
Use your strength!

127
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,860
I am using my strength!

128
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,710
How come you fell down?

129
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,140
I just saved you earlier.

130
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,060
Why are you taking revenge?

131
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,830
You were the one who let go.

132
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,110
Did I do anything?

133
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,440
I didn't do anything.

134
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,290
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a second!

135
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,900
Can you leave the flower behind?

136
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,440
Girl, there is no room for you to negotiate.

137
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
You won't be able to sell this flower for a lot of money.

138
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm using it to save someone's life.

139
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,250
You're on your own. Good luck. See you.

140
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,020
Come back!

141
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,330
Bastard! Come back!

142
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,090
Come back!

143
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,680
Leave the flower behind! Bastard!

144
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,370
The Hunting and Fighting Game concerns the grand future of our Mystic Soul.

145
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,310
Have you thought it through?

146
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,380
Of course, I understand its importance.

147
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,100
Please rest assured, Father.

148
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:38,240
In this competition, the different skilled warriors and nobility from the five regions will all gather here.

149
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,390
You will be the clique leader of Mystic Soul Clique in the future.

150
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,030
Romantic follies will only drag you down.

151
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,350
You should weigh it yourself.

152
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,260
Father, you're overthinking.

153
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,550
Although I've always shown excessive care towards Fuyao,

154
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,810
she is still just a slave from the Mystic Black Section after all.

155
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,590
The pros and cons behind this,

156
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,810
I understand.

157
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,350
[Hunting and Fighting Game]

158
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,190
This Celestial Fangding is a mythical item left by the ancient people.

159
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,110
It will only be taken out and offered during the once-per-eight-year Hunting and Fighting Game of our clique.

160
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,840
I've long heard that Mt. Mystic Soul is hiding a lot of skilled fighters.

161
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,510
That the Hunting and Fighting Game is an exciting and spectacular event.

162
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,460
Us coming this time is a coincidence.

163
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,680
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

164
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,920
At that time, all the Wulin personage of Deep Water will come here to watch the game.

165
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,070
Since I was here in time for it, of course, I mustn't miss such a grand event.

166
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,560
I'll stay a few more days then.

167
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,980
I think Heir Apparent will be interested in this, too.

168
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,600
It's also good to see the different noble warriors of Mt. Mystic Soul.

169
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,550
Godfather, will we really stay here?

170
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,580
But the capital has sent news

171
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,600
that Zhang Henian, Liu Songmin, and other people are making strange movements.

172
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,740
I fear that trouble might erupt.

173
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,010
Let it erupt then!

174
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,690
Only when chaos starts will we know the intentions of the different parties.

175
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,310
Am I right?

176
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,550
Who can be used by me and who must die,

177
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,010
it will be very clear by then.

178
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,610
Pei Yuan asks to see the Prime Minister.

179
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,420
I failed to welcome Prime Minister during your arrival.

180
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,350
Please forgive me, Prime Minister.

181
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,230
There are no outsiders here.

182
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,710
Just drop the troublesome formalities.

183
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,640
Thank you, Uncle.

184
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,900
I know. What are you anxious for?

185
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:30,770
I've followed your instructions to use my identity as a disciple of the sect to win over jianghu warriors to our side.

186
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,290
You've worked hard these few years.

187
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:35,080
You did quite well.

188
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,870
This is what I should do.

189
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,850
Moreover, this Mt. Mystic Soul is indeed a rich land that's full of illustrious heroes.

190
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,150
My trip here wasn't in vain.

191
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:48,080
I fear that there's another person that made your trip here not in vain. Am I right?

192
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,340
Uncle, you're mocking me again.

193
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,900
I've known early on that you were here.

194
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,480
You just waited for a few minutes and you're already being impatient.

195
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,260
Why are you so dirty?

196
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,520
Quickly go down.

197
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,740
Don't dirty my straw mat.

198
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,840
It's all because of this.

199
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,990
It is indeed a rare item. I exerted a lot to get it.

200
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,040
If it were a normal item, how can it be needed by you?

201
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,580
Open your mouth.

202
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,180
Catch it.

203
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,480
Swallow it directly.

204
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,230
You've become slower.

205
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,290
It's just getting into a forbidden cliff, why did you spend so much time?

206
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,980
Good thing you came back in time.

207
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,020
If you came back later, then this flower would have been useless.

208
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,330
I encountered a troublesome girl.

209
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,050
Did you get rid of her?

210
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,380
Since she can enter the forbidden cliff, she must be a disciple of Mystic Soul.

211
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,740
Aren't you afraid that she'll recognize you?

212
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,020
I think she's quite interesting.

213
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,350
This doesn't seem like you.

214
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,540
Okay already. Let's not talk about that anymore.

215
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,560
How many days will it take for this Baizhi Orchid to work?

216
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,740
You can try it now.

217
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,340
It indeed worked.

218
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,890
Who told you to splash water on my floor?

219
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,120
Your inner energy will be a bit messy these next few days.

220
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,680
Be careful.

221
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,730
Although this Baizhi Orchid can only provide some superficial effects,

222
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,280
it's enough to fool Qi Zhen.

223
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,380
He already tested me last time.

224
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,470
Good thing I was able to resolve it using Firmament Technique.

225
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,250
But with his paranoid character,

226
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,680
I fear that he'll do more tests when we reach Capital Kun.

227
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,070
Don't worry.

228
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,830
I'll keep you company.

229
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,890
I, the Heir Apparent, will then take my leave.

230
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm leaving.

231
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,790
By the way, there's something else.

232
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,320
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

233
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,610
Hey... I'm talking to you.

234
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,210
You shouldn't burn logs like that.

235
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,310
- You should put in more logs. Okay?
- Okay...

236
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,610
- Put more.
- I know already.

237
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,680
Hurry up! Hurry up! Okay?

238
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,560
Fuyao!

239
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,390
Where did you go?

240
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,380
How did you end up like this?

241
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,270
I tripped and fell over there.

242
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,590
Trip and fall? How can you end with this state just by tripping and falling?

243
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:38,310
Really. It really hurts.

244
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,660
Did you cause trouble again?

245
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,610
- I didn't.
- Tell the truth.

246
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,400
- I wouldn't.
- If you don't say it, then I'll hit you!

247
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,420
Uncle Zhou! Uncle Zhou! The front manor is rushing us again!

248
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,250
They said the banquet is starting soon and want us to start serving.

249
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,620
- Right...
- Let's hurry, Uncle Zhou.

250
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,700
Did you hear? The banquet is starting soon.

251
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,870
Hurry and go serve.

252
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,810
- Hurry and go change your clothes.
- I'll change.

253
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,700
- You, also hurry up.
- All right. Immediately.

254
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,250
Did you all hear that?

255
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,350
- The banquet will be starting soon?
- Older Sis Fuyao, how about it? Did you get the flower?

256
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,850
- Don't mention it.
- Why not?

257
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,720
Don't mention it!

258
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,630
Did you all hear it? Be nimble!

259
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,390
Then, what about Xiaobai?

260
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,230
[Mystic Soul Heights]

261
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,390
Your Highness Heir Apparent and Prime Minister came here to our Mt. Mystic Soul.

262
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,290
It is my honor and our Xuanyuan's great fortune.

263
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,360
Let me offer you two a toast first.

264
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,400
Clique Leader Yan, cheers.

265
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,490
Heir Apparent.

266
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,810
Heir Apparent, Your Highness.

267
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,700
Drink!

268
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,260
Is everyone offering a toast?

269
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,190
Just drink as much as you like.

270
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,370
- Teacher.
- Father.

271
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,550
Why are you so late?

272
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,240
First Senior Brother went to check the food for the banquet earlier.

273
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,030
Hence, we got delayed.

274
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,490
May Teacher forgive us.

275
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,040
My son caused us to delay.

276
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,190
May Prime Minister and Heir Apparent forgive him.

277
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,880
Let me introduce them, this is—

278
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,060
Greeting, Uncle.

279
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:33,320
Yuan'er, after not seeing you for so many years, you've grown more energetic.

280
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,380
A few days ago, your aunt was asking

281
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,690
when you will meet her again.

282
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,030
So Prime Minister is your uncle.

283
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:48,120
Prefecture Princess, I wasn't able to give you proper treatment.

284
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,630
Teacher, what are you saying?

285
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,100
Since I've joined Mystic Soul Clique,

286
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,570
there then isn't a Prefecture Princess here, but a teacher and a student.

287
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,780
Uncle, don't mind it.

288
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,350
Hey, for whom was this banquet today set up for?

289
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,250
It's quite grand.

290
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,350
Important people from Capital Kun, one Prime Minister and the other one is the Heir Apparent.

291
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,910
There's even an Heir Apparent?

292
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,670
I heard that he was the son of the original Prince Quandu in our prefecture.

293
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:40,960
The son of Prince Quandu?

294
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,160
How come it sounds so familiar?

295
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,650
Junior Sister, so you're Official Qi's niece?

296
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:54,900
How come you never mentioned it before?

297
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,480
What's there to mention?

298
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,180
I came here to learn skills.

299
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,400
It's not important what my identity or status is.

300
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,270
In front of you, I am still me.

301
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,750
Come, First Senior Brother.

302
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,210
- I give you a toast.
- Come.

303
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,660
- Clique Leader Yuan.
- Prime Minister.

304
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:17,690
How old is your son?

305
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,250
My son is about 20 years old.

306
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,740
Is he married?

307
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,290
- Not yet.
- I see. Here.

308
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,860
Prime Minister, you must enjoy yourself to your heart's content today.

309
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,590
You mustn't leave until you're drunk. Okay?

310
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,930
Clique Leader, you are being so polite.

311
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,420
I heard that he was the son of the original Prince Quandu in our prefecture.

312
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,360
Do you know about first come, first serve?

313
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,750
My rule is that it belongs to the person who gets it first.

314
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:03,090
Save me. I'm the son of Prince Quandu, Xuanyuan Min.

315
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,020
Save me.

316
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,920
Something's off.

317
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,460
Heir Apparent is so elegant and handsome.

318
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,350
Even our slave maidservant here can't take her eyes off you.

319
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,350
Hey, girl!

320
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,780
Come here.

321
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,460
Pour me some wine.

322
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:55,810
Do you know how to serve people?!

323
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,940
These clothes... I must change them.

324
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,970
Hey, girl! You caused this trouble.

325
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,930
Come help me change my clothing.

326
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,700
Hurry and go.

327
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,830
That person over there. Go and get me some clothes.

328
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,410
Go!

329
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,640
You.

330
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,270
Come in with me.

331
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,670
Close the doors.

332
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,660
After parting at the forbidden cliff, we meet again.

333
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,190
What is Heir Apparent saying? I don't understand it.

334
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,490
Are you just really smart or faking to be naive?

335
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,770
I know already.

336
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:40,590
Heir Apparent must have met my twin.

337
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,580
She's naturally mischievous and naughty.

338
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,130
If she has offended you,

339
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:48,420
may you forgive her.

340
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,550
Heir Apparent...

341
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,740
Twin sister?

342
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,280
You're able to make such a lie?

343
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,340
Heir Apparent, could it be that...

344
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,770
you can't tell any differences between us?

345
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,100
Damn girl, do you even have such a move?

346
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,980
I already told you that here in Mt. Mystic Soul, there are traps everywhere.

347
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,450
Do you really think that this is an ordinary room?

348
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,080
It is indeed you, little trickster.

349
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,820
Whether I'm a trickster or not, we can't be sure.

350
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,650
But you... surely are a fake.

351
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,870
- Really?
- Yes.

352
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:57,580
You probably don't know that only I saw the real Heir Apparent.

353
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,710
If I tell them now your real identity,

354
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,660
guess if you'll be able to leave this mountain alive.

355
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:08,790
What you said is right.

356
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,930
Why don't we make a deal?

357
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,100
Originally, if you didn't provoke me, I wouldn't provoke you, too.

358
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,870
We would both be all right.

359
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,580
But who told you to steal my Baizhi Orchid?

360
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,580
Do you just want the Baizhi Orchid back?

361
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,060
- Where is my flower?
- I ate it.

362
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,160
Your Highness Heir Apparent, I've brought you your clothes.

363
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,410
Hey...

364
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:41,290
If you go out now and expose me, won't you achieve great merit?

365
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,110
I still want my flower back.

366
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,790
I won't bring myself trouble.

367
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,110
Your Highness Heir Apparent, please hurry and change your clothes.

368
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,190
They are still waiting for you in the front hall.

369
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,580
- What are you doing?
- You're very smart.

370
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,900
Too bad, your skills are still too shallow.

371
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,520
Do you really think that those Universe Chains will be able to bind me?

372
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,490
Your Highness Heir Apparent.

373
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,940
Your Highness Heir Apparent, don't be like this.

374
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,400
Why are you rushing? I haven't even undressed.

375
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,590
Your Highness Heir Apparent, please forgive me.

376
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,440
What was that?

377
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,540
He clearly was a fake Heir Apparent. Such a bully.

378
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,230
- Older Sis Fuyao!
- What is it?

379
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,980
- Xiaobai wil be a goner soon! Quickly go check him!
- What's wrong with Xiaobai?

380
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,490
- What's wrong with Xiaobai?!
- Hurry!

381
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,900
- Xiaobai!
- Xiaobai...

382
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,530
- Xiaobai, how are you? Xiaobai.
- Xiaobai...

383
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,970
Xiaobai, you haven't even lived past the winter yet.

384
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,930
- I won't even be able to taste your meat!
- What are you saying?

385
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,490
- Did we raise Xiaobai just for you to eat it?
- Xiaobai...

386
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,270
If Xiaobai knows you're like this,

387
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,900
- how sad will he be?
- What are you two doing?
- Xiaobai...

388
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,120
- Xiaobai...
- Hey! Hey!

389
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,630
- What are you two doing?
- Please check him!

390
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,910
What's wrong?

391
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,760
- Xiaobai...
- We don't know what's wrong with Xiaobai.

392
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,060
- Here.
- What?

393
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,980
That was given by Heir Apparent.

394
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,760
He said that it's a miracle drug.

395
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,640
Can that work?

396
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,260
I don't care anymore. Let's just treat a dead horse like a live one.
(T/N: try every possible remedy).

397
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,530
He clearly is a pig!

398
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,640
- Hurry and give it to him.
- Okay. Okay.

399
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,090
Xiaobai, it's time to eat your medicine. Be nice.

400
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,770
- Xiaobai, come.
- Considering that you saved Xiaobai, I won't make you pay for now.

401
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,740
Hey... Fuyao.

402
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,670
No. I want to see Xiaobai get better first.

403
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,330
Jeez, Xiaobai has Xiaoqi taking care of it. Quickly come with me.

404
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,630
- No. I...
- Be obedient... Okay?

405
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,960
- Take good care of Xiaobai.
- Okay...
- Hurry!

406
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,350
- Take good care of him.
- Come.

407
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,650
It's time to take your medicine. You'll be fine afterwards.

408
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,140
Quickly move.

409
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,030
Have you forgotten that your identity is Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez?

410
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,150
A crown prince that will unite the five regions in the future.

411
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,570
Your duty is to pacify the unrest in the vassal states.

412
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,360
- And not—
- In a leisure travel and having romantic follies?

413
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,590
Why then did you ask me to give the Immortal Dew I gave you to a servant from Mystic Black Section?

414
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,300
Do you know that I had to gather the dew of thirty-six different kinds of unique flowers

415
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,730
and took forty-nine days to make that Immortal Dew?

416
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:35,690
It's a life-saving medicine for your future use. But you are quite generous.

417
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,200
What? Of course, one must return what you steal.

418
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,270
I really am very curious to what kind of person she is.

419
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,360
I am also very curious.

420
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:58,090
I really didn't cause trouble recently.

421
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,300
You don't think that I have something going on with that Heir Apparent, do you?

422
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,360
There is really nothing.

423
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:10,030
I actually wanted to say that Mystic Black Section has not been busy recently.

424
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,410
Why don't you rest for a few days?

425
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:19,090
People told me that there is a fun market down the hill.

426
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,490
Do you want to go? If you want to go, I can give you a badge.

427
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,790
Stop, stop, stop.

428
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,610
You must be ill.

429
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,510
I'll bring you Xiaobai's medicine.

430
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,610
Cut it out.

431
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,020
You should stop acting tough.

432
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,660
I know you fool around all day,

433
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,630
but you are actually hiding many sorrows. Right?

434
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,670
What is it?

435
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,850
Actually, everyone has a few sorrows.

436
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,320
I have been there before.

437
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,330
You must listen to me.

438
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,250
Don't rely too much on the fact that Young Master treats you very well.

439
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,510
But you two are not of the same path.

440
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,980
You definitely won't be able to end together.

441
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,080
His engagement with Miss Pei Yuan

442
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,250
- is within the expectation.
- Wait.

443
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:23,490
What are you saying? Who's engaged with whom?

444
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,280
At today's banquet,

445
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,610
didn't Prime Minister say to marry off Miss Pei Yuan to Young Master?

446
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,000
You were there. You know this thing.

447
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,630
Pei Yuan and First Senior Brother?

448
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,210
Yes.

449
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,260
I'll go ask them.

450
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,580
Wait, Fuyao!

451
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,340
Fuyao!

452
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,810
First Senior Brother!

453
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,910
First Senior Brother! Where is First Senior Brother?

454
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,720
Aren't you too audacious?

455
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,910
How could you come to the Mystic Main Section without being called?

456
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,920
I'm here to find First Senior Brother.

457
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,540
What use is there in finding him?

458
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:26,410
- He and Senior Sister Pei will soon—
- Where is First Senior Brother?

459
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,710
Lower down your voice.

460
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,120
Before, people here in Mystic Main Section wouldn't dare to do anything to you,

461
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,890
that is because Young Master is protecting you.

462
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,580
Now that Young Master is getting married with Senior Sister Pei soon,

463
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,660
do you know how strong the backer behind Senior Sister Pei is?

464
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,480
Enough. Hurry and leave.

465
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,390
If you don't leave now, I'll be punished.

466
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,660
First Senior Brother!

467
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,410
I said it already that Young Master isn't here.

468
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,290
If you want to find him, go to Senior Sister Pei's place.

469
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,470
First Senior Brother! First Senior Brother!

470
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,290
Senior Brother, about the suggestion of Prime Minister,

471
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:06,540
- I am thinking—
- About this matter...

472
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,840
This matter is too soon to be discussed.

473
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,250
Senior Brother, do you still have any apprehensions?

474
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,220
Junior Sister, don't overthink.

475
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,620
It's just that I haven't won the Hunting and Fighting Game yet.

476
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,990
Neither do I hold a position in the Imperial Court.

477
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:25,450
I fear that I might just make you suffer.

478
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,400
Why must Senior Brother belittle yourself?

479
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,130
You surely can easily be the first in this measly Hunting and Fighting Game.

480
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,020
By then, we'll let Prime Minister head our wedding.

481
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,910
Our wedding will surely become a major event in Capital Kun.

482
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,170
Don't worry.

483
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,160
Uncle and Auntie dote on me a lot.

484
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,470
As long as you come back with me to Capital Kun,

485
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,760
you surely will have a bright future ahead of you.

486
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,370
What's wrong?

487
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:29,490
Oh... nothing.

488
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:31,780
It's becoming windy.

489
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,850
Why don't I take you back?

490
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,240
Okay.

491
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,710
First Senior Brother, no need to chase me anymore.

492
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,570
I'm not your First Senior Brother.

493
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,800
You... How come it's you?

494
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,520
You still hoped that it was your First Senior Brother that's chasing you. Am I right?

495
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,900
Why did you eavesdrop on me?

496
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,120
In this vast world, I just happened to be there.

497
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,750
How can that count as eavesdropping?

498
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,270
Moreover, it wasn't only me who heard it.

499
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,400
I'm very annoyed right now.

500
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,950
Don't anger me.

501
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,420
What do you want?

502
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,030
Girl, I don't care about your mood right now.

503
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:01,280
We must have a closure on what happened this morning.

504
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,730
Do you want to silence me?

505
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,630
What celebratory day is today?

506
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,860
First, I blocked First Senior Brother's future.

507
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,420
Next, I learned about your secret.

508
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,370
Do you want to kill me?

509
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,150
I'm just a slave maidservant from the Mystic Black Section,

510
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,520
yet I've become a stumbling stone for major people like you.

511
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,870
Fine.

512
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,200
Just kill me as you wish.

513
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,130
Do you really want to die that much?

514
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,620
Is how I think that important?

515
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,550
Just do it.

516
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,430
What's that thing?

517
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,580
Hurry!

518
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,460
"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

519
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,860
♫ What do you know? ♫

520
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:00,870
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

521
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,760
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

522
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,000
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

523
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,520
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

524
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,430
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

525
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,590
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

526
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,930
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

527
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:29,050
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

528
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:32,920
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

529
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,150
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

530
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:39,670
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

531
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,700
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

532
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,850
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

533
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:51,870
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

534
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:59,030
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

535
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:03,510
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

536
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,330
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

537
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:09,400
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

538
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,420
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

539
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,600
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

540
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,720
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

541
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,270
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

542
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,040
♫ Have someone's company♫

543
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,160
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

544
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,260
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫
