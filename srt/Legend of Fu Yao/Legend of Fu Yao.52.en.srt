00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,340
♫ I start to dance nimble and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,550
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:23,600
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,980
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,870
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,500
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,050
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,670
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,840
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,890
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,040
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,530
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful ♫

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,310
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,410
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:21,570
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,800
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,220
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

21
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,610
~ Episode 52 ~

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,240
This Chill Palace Hall... is an important place that generations of Heaven Fiend royalties have used.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,180
If I'm going to use blood to comfort the ancestors of our Zhan clan, you still are not qualified.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,640
Right... My blood will just dirty this place.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,510
It's not worthy to be bled here. It's not worthy to be bled here.

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,260
For me to be able to stand here today,

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,170
how many brothers have lost their lives for me?

28
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,690
And how many of the innocent have died?

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,340
If I let you leave this Chill Palace Hall unscathed,

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,220
how could I comfort our brothers that have been ruthlessly killed by you?

31
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,420
How do I placate the hearts of the citizens?

32
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,830
You can't kill me...

33
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,090
After all, we still have brotherly affection between us.

34
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,050
- Brotherly affection?
- Yes.

35
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,100
Brotherly affection?

36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,140
If you have any bit of compassion, duty, propriety, and integrity,

37
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,910
Heaven Fiend wouldn't have become how it is now.

38
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,930
This Chill Palace Hall...

39
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,020
won't have grudging souls roaming about.

40
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,370
Look. Isn't Imperial Concubine Jing alive and well?

41
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,760
I've always treated her like my own mother.

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,230
Just for that consideration, you mustn't kill me.

43
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,590
Shut up!

44
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,110
From Mt. Great Vast to Rock City, from Geya to Ice Land, which land didn't suffer your maltreatment and tyrannical rule?

45
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,360
Which city hasn't been plundered by you?

46
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,550
Today, you keep saying lies and tried to deny all these crimes you've committed?

47
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,310
All are just rumors...

48
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,930
Don't kill me...

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,530
Leave.

50
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,080
Thanks. Thanks.

51
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,380
Good little brother... Thanks.

52
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,350
Grandmaster Zhou, you finally can rest in peace.

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,610
- I'm here.
- Fifth Older Brother!

54
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,550
Have you killed Zhan Nancheng?

55
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,740
I just knew that you could do it.

56
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,070
Fifth Older Brother, let me tell you that this Secret Army is really outstanding.

57
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,370
Earlier, there were so many reinforcements that came.

58
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,800
But in just a short time, they all got killed by the Secret Army.

59
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,280
I surely will do what I've promised you.

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,790
Heaven Fiend is also your home.

61
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,040
Return to your hometown now.

62
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,390
Heaven Fiend is in a state mourning.

63
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,610
Offering to all those who have died.

64
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,610
A worship ceremony for the dead attended by everyone.

65
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,790
May all the valiant souls return to their rightful place.

66
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,060
Light the incense and take a bow.

67
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,120
Strands of souls are now yielding to Heaven.

68
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,520
Serve the wine as a reward to the dead.

69
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,150
Three wine offerings.

70
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:51,080
Innately a strong person. Nevertheless, brave and loyal.

71
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,300
With great virtue, one can take over the world.

72
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,710
Improve the lives of thousands of people.

73
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,350
Heaven and Earth were wise and reasonably set a new king.

74
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,780
Disciplining oneself with the values of incorruptibility.

75
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,370
Supporting the citizens with benevolence.

76
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,280
Sealing of the golden chest.

77
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,540
Returning the souls to the soil.

78
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,380
May all rest in peace!

79
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,660
The worship ceremony for the dead has ended.

80
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,920
The new king ascends to the throne!

81
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,410
The imperial king in Heaven, the royal deities of the earth,

82
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,620
because of your care you bestowed the order to make Prince Fierce belong to the common people.

83
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:28,040
From today on, it will be a new reigning calendar here in Heaven Fiend, named the Yongji Year.

84
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,270
This message will be spread throughout the territory and announced to the whole Five Regions.

85
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,230
Praying that the kingdom of the Ice Land will last forever, never changing.

86
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,990
May the citizens enjoy eternal auspicious blessings.

87
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,410
Praying that the kingdom of the Ice Land will last forever, never changing.

88
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,630
May the citizens enjoy eternal auspicious blessings.

89
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,810
For the soldiers that have accompanied our king in battle,

90
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,690
you have labored diligently and dashed all over the place,

91
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,660
risking your life despite the small chances, just to fulfill a grand undertaking.

92
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,210
You made proper considerations and achieved superior merits.

93
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,380
Hence, you all are being rewarded with high positions.

94
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,330
Today, I'm conferring the Capital Officer Qiu Chengdong as Supreme Officer Valiant

95
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,980
with a promotion of rank one Senior Official Glorious Plan, Right Capital General and Marquis Firmness.

96
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,860
His salary will be 2,500 dan.

97
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,370
His descendants will inherit his position for generations.

98
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,690
Conferring Capital Officer Sun Feng as Supreme Officer Valiant and Marquis Succeed Defending.

99
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,110
His salary will be 2,500 dan.

100
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,860
His descendants will inherit his position for generations.

101
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,470
The other soldiers will be rewarded based on the level of their contributions.

102
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,300
Thank you for Your Majesty's graces!

103
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,270
Today is the day that the new king ascends to the throne.

105
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,050
He clearly knows how heavy the task is upon him and is bearing a conscientious and cautious attitude to do it.

106
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,750
He plans to make reforms, establish new laws, and achieves to govern like his wise predecessors.

107
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,820
A nationwide pardon is being given out.

108
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,040
He wants to make a new start together with the citizens.

109
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,010
The Chant Frost Watchtower will be removed.

110
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,860
Its items will be returned to their rightful owners.

111
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,530
This decree will be spread throughout the world.

112
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,160
There will be notices posted for the public.

113
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,090
Everyone will hear of it.

114
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,820
This decree is given on the ninth day of the third month of the first Yongji Year in Heaven Fiend.

115
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,570
Long live Your Majesty!

116
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,780
- Rise .
- Thank you, Your Majesty!

117
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,800
Your Majesty,

118
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,000
are you demolishing the Chant Frost Watchtower?

119
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Heaven Fiend will no longer need the Chant Frost Watchtower.

120
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,780
Earlier, when I heard this awarding list, it seems that you've left out something.

121
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,950
Your Majesty, have you forgotten someone?

122
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:18,000
For this new dynasty, Fuyao took the risk and infiltrated Zhan Nancheng's inner circle alone.

123
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Within the span of a month, she obliterated Prince Eternal's influence without shedding a single drop of blood.

124
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,200
She took control of Gold of Heaven Fiend and preserved the government's most elite soldiers.

125
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,800
When you started the uprising, she coordinated with you to control the inner court.

126
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,400
She also brought some key officials over to your side.

127
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,100
I think her merits surpass that of anyone within this imperial court.

128
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,700
Crown Prince is right.

129
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,800
For the establishment of the new Yongji dynasty, Fuyao definitely is the most meritorious statesman.

130
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:56,790
If that's the case, would new king consider giving her the largest reward?

131
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,700
Fuyao had saved my life in Mt. Great Vast

132
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,200
and infiltrated in and out of the court in Rock City.

133
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,800
Saving tens of thousands of civilians.

134
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,600
She's brave and heroic. A warrior of our nation.

135
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,000
I naturally won't mistreat her.

136
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,200
But this is an internal matter for Heaven Fiend after all.

137
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,400
Crown Prince does not need to worry yourself.

138
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,800
I have no right nor intention to meddle in Heaven Fiend's internal politics.

139
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,700
And, of course, I trust Your Majesty will never forget the efforts of Fuyao.

140
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,000
But inevitably a new king must consider the bigger picture when he takes the throne and rewards officials.

141
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm just concerned you have to take the balance of power into consideration.

142
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,500
You'll find it difficult to decide on Fuyao's reward.

143
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,500
Crown Prince has thought too much. I—

144
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,100
I have a humble request.

145
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,350
Please accede to it.

146
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,500
Crown Prince has given the new dynasty much assistance.

147
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,300
Heaven Fiend is eternally grateful.

148
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,800
Please ask anything you wish.

149
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,200
Considering Fuyao's major contribution,

150
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,600
may I ask new king to confer her with the title of "Prefect?"

151
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,800
If you're concerned that the imperial court will resist or the public will criticize,

152
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:20,100
I, Zhangsu Wuji, am willing to use my position as Crown Prince of Five Regions to give you equal compensation.

153
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,100
As for my help, it's really nothing.

154
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,800
If you value it, then count it all as Fuyao's merit.

155
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,800
Reward all on her.

156
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,600
Conferring the original Generalissimo Black Tortoise of Gold of Heaven Fiend, the Commander of Captains,

157
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,600
Fuyao, as Prefect Vast, a hereditary title.

158
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,800
Mt. Great Vast and surrounding six counties are granted as her fief.

159
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Right to own military administration and oversight.

160
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
I've never heard of such an astounding reward.

161
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,000
Yeah, hopefully it doesn't come back to bite him.

162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,530
Crown Prince Wuji personally requested.

163
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,200
Who would be able to turn him down?

164
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,600
It's not that simple.

165
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,770
A title of Prefect Vast. A fief of Mt. Great Vast.

166
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,400
I'll thank you on behalf of Fuyao.

167
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,200
I will never hesitate to give Fuyao the best reward.

168
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:30,600
I just didn't think you would come out and ask for her.

169
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,500
It almost looks like I'm an ingrate who didn't want to give her any reward.

170
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,600
Who would think that?

171
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Just use your reward as a gift to her.

172
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:53,100
I wanted to ask you that you quietly stole all my land in Mt. Great Vast.

173
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,540
Is the Crown Prince being cautious of me?

174
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,000
You've all been to Mt. Great Vast.

175
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,700
That place is actually intimately connected to Firmament.

176
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,800
As the Crown Prince of the Megrez Empire,

177
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,300
of course, I don't want anyone or anything to topple the political equilibrium of Five Regions.

178
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,500
Of course, after all we've been through,

179
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,900
I trust your temperament and nature,

180
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,600
but there are many with wild ambition in the world.

181
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,900
I don't trust those people.

182
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
I can't do much now.

183
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,600
Separating Mt. Great Vast from the hand of Heaven Fiend King

184
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,400
is trying to prevent those lurking wars and chaos.

185
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Of course. Mt. Great Vast is where you and Fuyao risked your lives.

186
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,800
For her, there's great sentimental value.

187
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,900
For me also.

188
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm glad.

189
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,600
You're not my enemy.

190
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,420
I'm very glad, too.

191
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,350
Gen... Your Majesty.

192
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,470
What did you call me?

193
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,340
I like it better when you call me "General."

194
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,300
Yes, General.

195
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,400
General.

196
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,990
Why is he here?

197
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,200
Then what should I do?

198
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,860
Order the palace to be on alert.

199
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,000
Increase the defense by 2000 soldiers immediately.

200
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,400
Bar anyone without an invitation or permit.

201
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,920
Go personally.

202
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,700
Tell them not to be careless.

203
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,100
Yes.

204
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,950
Stop.

205
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
What is it, Miss?

206
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Am I pretty?

207
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,680
Yes.

208
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,600
Like a painting. You used to always dress in Qiongye style.

209
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:41,200
We were worried you wouldn't feel comfortable in the style of Heaven Fiend since the color is a little plain.

210
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,960
But it suits you so well.

211
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
You're prettier than all the Ladies in the palace.

212
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,910
Then let's go.

213
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,200
Let's take you to Chill Palace Hall.

214
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,000
No. I'll go myself.

215
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,200
But your eyes—

216
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:59,330
It's because I'm blind, so I have to go myself.

217
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,200
I don't want to depend on someone else to walk all my life.

218
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,800
Even if I have falls and get scrapes everywhere, I still want to walk on my own.

219
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,000
You can't help me,

220
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,200
and I've walked this road many times before.

221
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Don't worry.

222
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
- General.
- General.

223
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,820
We've prepared everything.

224
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,900
We'll add more soldiers to this West Splendid Palace.

225
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,400
The servants by Empress Dowager's side are also trustworthy. Don't worry.

226
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,900
Don't make a commotion. To prevent her from worrying.

227
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,550
Ye'er.

228
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,040
Mother.

229
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
Have you seen Yalan Zhu these days?

230
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,770
I haven't seen her.

231
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,600
What's up? Are you looking for her?

232
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,300
She used to always come see me before. I haven't seen her these days.

233
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,760
She likes a lively environment.

234
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,800
She probably went to see Fuyao and the others.

235
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,490
Let her go.

236
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,000
It's been hard for her these days.

237
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,200
But that child is a lot more obedient than before.

238
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,000
I like her more and more.

239
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,300
As long as you like her, that's good.

240
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Ye'er, I wanted to talk to you about something.

241
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,600
Please, go ahead, Mother.

242
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,600
Now that everything's over and Heaven Fiend is stabilized,

243
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,400
your Royal Father can finally rest in peace.

244
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,800
But I know there're a lot of things waiting for you.

245
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,400
The first thing is rewarding the key officials. Placating the public.

246
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
I know you've done that.

247
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:01,590
The second thing you should consider is your marriage.

248
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,930
You're not young anymore.

249
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,530
You can't keep being alone like this.

250
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
I haven't really thought about this.

251
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,400
There are many things to be done when a new king ascends.

252
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,600
Heaven Fiend just went through chaos and war.

253
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,600
Your every move cannot be just about yourself.

254
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,200
The nation and the civilians need such a celebration.

255
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,520
You're the King of Heaven Fiend.

256
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,500
You can't hesitate like you used to.

257
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,800
I understand.

258
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,000
I suddenly thought of someone.

259
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,940
Awhile ago, you snuck into the palace.

260
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,300
There was a girl with you.

261
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,200
Her name is Fuyao.

262
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,810
So it is her.

263
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:53,500
She's full of courage and is also loyal and faithful.

264
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,000
She's definitely a good girl.

265
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,600
Yes.

266
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,100
If I didn't have her, I would not have come out of Mt. Great Vast alive.

267
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,310
You like her.

268
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,190
I can see your feelings even if you don't say anything.

269
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,900
Yes.

270
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,200
When we were in Deep Water,

271
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,400
I even vowed to not wed anyone but her in this lifetime.

272
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,670
But now, it's different.

273
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,680
Fuyao is loyal and dedicated. There's no one else like her.

274
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,570
She is my good buddy;

275
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,250
a buddy whom I live and die together and can't betray.

276
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,110
Thankfully, the heavens are good to me.

277
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,480
It gave me another great girl.

278
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,770
Are you speaking of Yalan Zhu?

279
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:22,570
Even though she can't be considered smart and sometimes can even be quite silly,

280
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,830
but with all the journeys we took, no matter how painful and difficult they were,

281
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,880
as long as I said we're going,

282
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,690
she would stay with me, no matter how scared she was.

283
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,350
She has done too much for me.

284
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,170
I never thought, with your stubborn stony personality,

285
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,880
you'd finally be moved by her.

286
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,210
She loves me so much.

287
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,830
I will not let her down for sure.

288
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:06,420
Consort Mother, please allow me to marry Yalan Zhu.

289
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,250
Please get up, quickly.

290
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,100
Ye'er, hearing you say this, I'm so happy for you.

291
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,760
But she can't see.

292
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,000
Whether the imperial court will allow such a Queen or not,

293
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,470
and the other officials,

294
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:30,240
how will you face their questioning?

295
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,970
She became blind in order to save me.

296
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:36,750
Without her, there would be no new Yongji dynasty.

297
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:42,000
If they complain about her not having a respectable appearance to be a queen,

298
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,900
then I, Zhan Beiye, am not worthy to be this king.

299
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,480
That is how a good man from our Zhan family should be.

300
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,180
Why are you only just getting here now?

301
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,360
The rest of the guests are already here.

302
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,540
We're just waiting on you two.

303
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,810
Where's Zhuzhu? Isn't she with you?

304
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:08,830
No. I haven't seen her all day.

305
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:10,310
What?

306
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:13,400
Then I'll keep looking. You guys go in first.

307
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:16,760
What... ?

308
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,380
This is the Heaven Fiend Palace.

309
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,850
What could possibly happen?

310
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,620
Taking someone of Zhan Beiye's?

311
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,590
Who would dare provoke him like that?

312
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,760
Who would provoke who?

313
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,150
Nothing.

314
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:36,060
What are you talking about?

315
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,560
Have you seen Yalan Zhu?

316
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,730
Isn't she with you?

317
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,230
General, the Harmony Graceful and Flowery Land Gates have been broken. He's here.

318
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,780
Didn't we increase the guards?

319
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,090
How are we still not able to block him?

320
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,630
He didn't even want to fight.

321
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,610
He disappeared after a few punches.

322
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,810
Send someone to search immediately.

323
00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:58,400
Report to me as soon as there's news.

324
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
Yes, sir.

325
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,740
General, we just received this letter.

326
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,190
Who's here?

327
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,360
I know where Yalan Zhu is.

328
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,770
Please look after the palace for me.

329
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,140
I'll be right back.

330
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,510
I'll go with you.

331
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,380
You can't get involved in this.

332
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,070
Why not?

333
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,050
Who are you? Let me down.

334
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,560
If you want to kill me, come at me directly.

335
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,410
It's bad manners to attack from behind.

336
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,960
Who sent you? Are you trying to harm my Fifth Older Brother?

337
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,850
Let me tell you. Once he finds you, he'll feed you to the eagles.

338
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,100
No one will help you even if you cry.

339
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,280
You finally said something right.

340
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,520
I am doing this because of Zhan Beiye, that rascal.

341
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,350
Now you're in my hands.

342
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,630
We'll see if Zhan Beiye that brat doesn't do as I say.

343
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,670
You want to threaten my Fifth Older Brother? You wish.

344
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,240
I'll bite my tongue and commit suicide right now. So you've wasted all your time.

345
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,520
Oh no, don't do that.

346
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,970
Stop it!

347
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,240
This is so embarrassing for a girl.

348
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,070
I'm Zhan Beiye's teacher.

349
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,570
Stop it!

350
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:19,230
Teacher? Do you mean the one who took Yalan Zhu is Zhan Beiye's teacher?

351
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,040
Without a doubt.

352
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,580
Wasn't there a totem on the envelope of the letter that Zhan Beiye read?

353
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,490
The Royal Emblem of Heaven Fiend?

354
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,650
Yes.

355
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,850
But also no.

356
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,900
Those who can use this emblem must be very close to the Royal Family.

357
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,600
I think the person must be very well renown, with great martial arts.

358
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,360
You can guess he's Zhan Beiye's teacher from this?

359
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,300
Zhan Beiye asked Ji Yu to increase the guards within the palace,

360
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
but only at the gates,

361
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,680
which means he just wanted to bar someone from coming in.

362
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,200
Plus seeing Ji Yu's graze on his face,

363
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,750
it means the intruder has no intention of hurting anyone.

364
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,150
Zhan Beiye, Ji Yu and Eunuch Hua.

365
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,970
All three have a tacit understanding.

366
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:10,300
There's only one possibility.

367
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,890
They know that ace.

368
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,340
It's Zhan Beiye's teacher.

369
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,610
But his teacher is quite strange.

370
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:24,430
Not going through a front door but rather forcing himself in.

371
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,940
Why did he take Yalan Zhu?

372
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,390
Remember those ten saints of Five Regions I talked about?

373
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,650
I remember.

374
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,010
Zhangsun Pinrong's teacher is one.

375
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:38,280
He's called... Divine Physician Starlight?

376
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,820
Out of the ten saints, the Divine Physician Starlight is small fish.

377
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,950
And Zhan Beiye's teacher can be considered one of the top three.

378
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,110
You say, you're a girl who doesn't look big.

379
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,570
Why are you so heavy?

380
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm so tired.

381
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,420
Tell me. What is your relationship to my Fifth Older Brother?

382
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,360
I'm warning you. If you have any strange ideas,

383
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,330
my Fifth Older Brother is very powerful.

384
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,160
Your Fifth Older Brother is very powerful. Is that right?

385
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:30,320
Let me tell you. Your Fifth Older Brother is nothing.

386
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,200
- Let go.
- No.

387
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,750
- Let go.
- I will not.

388
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,850
We'll talk after you let go. Okay?

389
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,220
Talk.

390
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,790
Are you a dog?

391
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:56,590
You bit me.

392
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,340
We'll have to start from the death of Grandmaster Zhou.

393
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:07,970
Before Grandmaster Zhou passed, he continuously begged me.

394
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:12,560
He begged me to accept Zhan Beiye as a student and teach him martial arts.

395
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,840
I had momentary insanity and I accepted.

396
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,180
But Zhan Beiye, that boy, has done well.

397
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,630
He was born to learn martial arts.

398
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,480
And he works hard. But I...

399
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,730
I just don't like him.

400
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,230
He's an anti-social enigma.

401
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,800
He won't even fart for half a day.

402
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,690
So when I, his teacher, am bored to death,

403
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,590
he doesn't even think of any way to entertain me.

404
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,620
So he's no fun at all.

405
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:54,600
You say you're my Fifth Older Brother's teacher, right?

406
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,220
My Fifth Older Brother had told me

407
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,950
his teacher is powerful and great at martial arts and very handsome.

408
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,310
That's true.

409
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,780
Oh, it's true.

410
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,810
Then, can you let me see your handsome face?

411
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,080
I'm blind.

412
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,520
Just once?

413
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,120
Just once.

414
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,460
Let go. Let go, hurry.

415
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,530
All right, I'm sorry.

416
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,190
Teacher, I didn't mean to.

417
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,780
You know I can't see anything.

418
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,810
If it weren't because you can't see anything,

419
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,460
I would definitely pick a fight with you today.

420
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,170
Yes, of course.

421
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,220
Since you said that you're my Fifth Older Brother's teacher,

422
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,720
then why are you harming him?

423
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,250
What?

424
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,040
- I'm harming him?
- Yes.

425
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm helping him. Helping him! Do you understand?

426
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,430
This Zhan Beiye rascal is so anti-social.

427
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,080
He's about to get married.

428
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,570
If he finds another anti-social introvert, that'll be inconceivable.

429
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,510
I'm his teacher.

430
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,420
I have to screen his candidates.

431
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,690
What do you mean?

432
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,630
- You want to know what I mean?
- Yes.

433
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,460
You'll know after you wake up tomorrow.

434
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:38,670
For so many years, Lei Dong has been wandering the wilderness in the mountains and has been very reclusive.

435
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:42,290
He is unbridled by nature and never acts according to norm.

436
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,350
Although Zhan Beiye and him are teacher and student, but their personalities are dramatically different.

437
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:52,220
Then that means that this Lei Dong is quite fickle-minded.

438
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,390
This is bad then.

439
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,190
Zhan Beiye surely can't defeat him.

440
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,610
He can't use his identity as King of Heaven Fiend to suppress him, either.

441
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,710
What to do?

442
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,010
I think Lei Dong harbors no evil intentions.

443
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:14,740
His being unreasonable might be a good thing for Yalan Zhu and Zhan Beiye.

444
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,280
I hope so.

445
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:29,230
Since Yalan Zhu became blind, she totally became a different person.

446
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:38,640
Although she won't admit it, I can see that she's started to look down on herself.

447
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,860
She has followed Zhan Beiye for so many years.

448
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,140
Even life and death struggles didn't stop her.

449
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,650
But now... she has started to cowardly retreat.

450
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,830
Are you worried that Yalan Zhu is feeling she's not qualified to be with Zhan Beiye?

451
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,870
After going through so many things, Zhan Beiye is different from the one before.

452
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,210
The him now knows very clearly what he should do and what he wants.

453
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,340
I understand.

454
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,420
But does Yalan Zhu understand?

455
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:20,520
That's why I said that Lei Dong abducting Yalan Zhu might be a good opportunity to break the ice.

456
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,650
Okay already.

457
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,530
Stop thinking about it.

458
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,560
Oh, right. You said before that Lei Dong can only rank third.

459
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,280
Who then are the first two?

460
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:50,120
The second one is Shengling, but I don't know why he retired quite early on.

461
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,970
In Firmament, I once read documents on the ten saints.

462
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,860
But the records about him are quite few and he was rarely seen.

463
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:01,330
Then, who is the top saint?

464
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:11,000
With your reaction, you don't plan to say that it's you, right?

465
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,380
The top saint is my...

466
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,510
my Grand Teacher in Firmament.

467
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:33,330
I feel that being some world's number one or having supreme martial arts skills are all not important.

468
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,730
What's important is everyone being able to gather

469
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:42,180
and drink wine. That is the happiest thing.

470
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,180
But honestly,

471
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:59,460
I really hope that Yalan Zhu and Zhan Beiye can be together.

472
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,210
I also hope...

473
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,040
that all the lovers in this world...

474
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:25,000
can suffer less and be together.

475
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,830
When have you become this sentimental?

476
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:45,260
Find her. Or else, the Five Regions will once again be doomed eternally because of her.

477
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,120
What are you thinking?

478
00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:00,430
Periods of tranquility are too short.

479
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,660
Mister! Mister!

480
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:14,020
Mister!

481
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,910
Someone left a letter in your room.

482
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,000
That totem looks very familiar.

483
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,300
This is the official seal of Plough.

484
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,690
They derived it from the totem of their royal clan.

485
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:39,640
All letters coming from Plough have this on them, so it's quite hard to find out who the sender is.

486
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,960
A coded text from Plough?

487
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:56,270
Say, why is a lady like you lying on the bed all day?

488
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,600
Look at how fat you've become.

489
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,060
If we put a tail on your butt now, you'll look like a pig.

490
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:13,360
That little rascal Zhan Beiye, although he's not that adorable,

491
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:17,540
at least, he's a king. Right? Oh, wrong.

492
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,200
He is a "king."

493
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,770
As his woman,

494
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,920
you should be able to have a humble and respectful attitude, act in an elegant manner,

495
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,490
assist your husband and educate your children,

496
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,060
follow whatever your husband says,

497
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,430
and be good in morality, looks, speech, and crafts.

498
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:31,710
With your state now, you surely won't do.

499
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,570
Hence, I must teach you.

500
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,480
You? Will teach me?

501
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
That's right.

502
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,720
Let's start with embroidery.

503
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,250
Embroider me something today.

504
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:49,080
When I get some free time, I'll go look for a seamstress to teach you.

505
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:53,450
What thing is this? I'm not learning!

506
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,100
How can you not learn this?

507
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,710
In the future, if you become Beiye's wife, whenever his clothes get damaged,

508
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,480
if you don't even know how to sew or mend them,

509
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,490
won't you get laughed at?

510
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:10,220
I can't even see anything!

511
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,210
You're asking a blind person to learn embroidery?

512
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,530
You... clearly are mocking me!

513
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:16,040
So what if you can't see?

514
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,430
Who says that a blind person can't learn to embroider?

515
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:20,520
- You can slowly learn.
- I don't want to!

516
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,270
I've already arranged your daily schedule.

517
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,190
First day, learn embroidery.

518
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:28,360
Second day, learn cooking.

519
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,080
Third day, we'll learn... how to play musical instruments and memorize the "Rules of Women."

520
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,000
On the fourth day, we'll learn some proper etiquette.

521
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,460
I am not willing!

522
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,960
Your words don't count!

523
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,180
I have the final say!

524
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,660
If you are unable to embroider well today, I—

525
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,670
Don't think of... going out this door!

526
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,730
I won't go out then!

527
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,970
- Let go of me!
- Who told you to not go out?

528
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:06,660
- Go out!
- I won't learn!

529
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,320
You stinky brat! Did you kill the salt peddler?

530
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,590
You mustn't play it like that!

531
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,850
Wake up. Wake up.

532
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,740
We'll start memorizing books today.

533
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,750
I'll read one line and then you repeat it.

534
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,500
Understand?

535
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,190
Understand or not?

536
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:32,180
Louder!

537
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,060
I understand!

538
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,270
Read with me.

539
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:40,630
Sleep late and wake up early.

540
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:43,300
Don't fear working all day.

541
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,440
Sleep early and wake up late. Don't fear working all day.

542
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,540
In doing tasks, there is always easy and difficult.

543
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,790
You shouldn't keep choosing the easy ones.

544
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,190
Concentrate on looking at the color.

545
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,880
Teacher, I'm very sleepy.

546
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,770
I'll just sleep for a while.

547
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,780
What do you mean by this?

548
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,630
I see you are indeed a stinky brat brought home by that stinky rascal.

549
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,690
You two are very much alike!

550
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,250
It's because you taught us well.

551
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,470
So, you're this childish.

552
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,140
Just refusing to do things because you don't want to.

553
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,100
You even cry and sob all day.

554
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,520
You're like some bitter wife.

555
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,110
With your appearance now, you totally aren't compatible with Zhan Beiye.

556
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:28,400
Moreover, you are even blind.

557
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,900
So what if I'm blind?

558
