♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,560
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,430
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,940
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,960
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,520
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,520
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,040
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,710
♫ There is no fear from my heart

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,920
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,060
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,590
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,310
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,460
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:21,480
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,820
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,870
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,600
~ Episode 65 ~

22
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,740
It's Fei Yan.

23
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,030
We've just arrived in Firmament for more than two hours,

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,330
yet Illusion Palace has sent out so many scouts.

25
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:03,020
Fei Yan's intentions are not to be ignored.

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,450
I'll go look for my Grand Teacher first.

27
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,450
- I'll go with you.
- No.

28
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,270
Grand Teacher wants to capture you.

29
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,670
I can't let you walk into his net.

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:21,510
If I don't go with you, will your Grand Teacher let you off?

31
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,830
Wuji, don't you still know me?

32
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,880
If you give up your life in exchange for mine,

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,470
I will never agree to it.

34
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:37,350
I hope that from now on, whatever happens, we can face it together.

35
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,600
Just this once, I want you to listen to me.

36
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,890
Although my Grand Teacher is strict,

37
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,590
he's a person that's open-hearted and puts the world as priority.

38
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,490
If he can find a way to resolve this crisis,

39
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,940
he will surely not harm any innocent person.

40
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,800
What if there is no other way?

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,530
I will also come up with one.

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,750
Okay.

43
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,240
If...

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm just saying if.

45
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,330
If that day really comes,

46
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,330
I hope that you can personally kill me.

47
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,440
And after I die, you must take up the responsibility to protect Five Regions.

48
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,180
Let me tell you this.

49
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,570
By the time the Venus Star in the west rises tomorrow, I'll be back.

50
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,590
Okay.

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,430
Say it again that you'll wait for me here.

52
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,530
I'll wait for you.

53
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,390
Wait for me.

54
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,790
Yes.

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,760
Evergreen Shrine and your Illusion Palace never had any interaction for hundreds of years.

56
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,860
Palace Leader, you come here in person today.

57
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,780
Is there any important matter to instruct?

58
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,490
The female demon has entered Firmament.

59
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:28,070
Tell me. Is that an important matter?

60
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,760
In my opinion, we shouldn't delay any minute in capturing the female demon.

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,640
We should act early.

62
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,230
For so many years, Evergreen Shrine has been looking for the female demon to protect the world,

63
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,680
but we never mentioned this to Illusion Palace.

64
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,340
Today, upon her entering the territory of Firmament,

65
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,090
I don't think there's a need for you to ask about it.

66
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,350
That's indeed correct.

67
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,170
Your Illusion Palace connived with Di Feitian and brought harm to the world in the Firmament Great War that year.

68
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,220
Although you eventually stopped before it was too late and suddenly repented on your actions,

69
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,490
Firmament will never forget the sins you've committed.

70
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,060
Although what Elder said is reasonable,

71
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,430
don't forget that it was our Illusion Palace that suggested to use the Mystic Spirit Leaf to resist the evil sense back then;

72
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,540
hence, we were able to turn the tides.

73
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,530
In terms of merit, our Illusion Palace naturally had contributed.

74
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,290
You can't—

75
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,860
People walking different paths can't make plans together.

76
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,720
That is just normal.

77
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,950
But now is the moment that will determine the survival of Five Regions.

78
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:36,490
Shouldn't we let go of past grievances and prioritize the world?

79
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,560
In my knowledge, you have been secretly investigating the whereabouts of the female demon these past years.

80
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,860
Could it be you have another intention?

81
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,500
If Firmament is safe and sound, my Illusion Palace will be safe and sound.

82
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,770
That is my purpose.

83
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,600
In the past, my Illusion Palace took the wrong path and greatly tainted our reputation.

84
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,380
Of course, everything I'm doing now is to make up for the mistakes of my ancestors.

85
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,730
Since the world is in danger, my Illusion Palace should bear a bit of the responsibility to save it.

86
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,030
If that's the case, that will be great.

87
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:16,590
It's just that the matter of the female demon is very important.

88
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,720
My Evergreen Shrine has made the appropriate preparations.

89
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,630
No need for Palace Leader to worry about it anymore.

90
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,750
This Zhangsun Wuji is a member of your Evergreen Shrine.

91
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,270
And this Zhangsun Wuji even wants to disregard the lives in Five Regions just to preserve the life of the female demon.

92
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,220
Is this the appropriate arrangement of your Evergreen Shrine?

93
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,770
You kept refusing the inquiry of my Illusion Palace.

94
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,120
It can't be helped for others to feel that you're trying to harbor your student out of your love for him.

95
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,930
The female demon matter concerns all the lives in this world.

96
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:56,240
I, Heavenly Secret, will never act out of personal reasons.

97
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,770
Since that's the case,

98
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,160
why is your brilliant student of Evergreen Shrine with that female demon day and night, not separating from each other?

99
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,960
He didn't hesitate to be against the laws of Firmament and employ magic to hide their whereabouts.

100
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,920
Zhangsun Wuji has known this female demon for a long time.

101
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,050
He had a lot of chances to eliminate this source of destruction.

102
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,400
But now, not only is she alive,

103
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:19,490
she was even able to break her numerous seals with the help of your Evergreen Shrine.

104
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,510
Now, the danger has been made.

105
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,390
The disaster is upon us.

106
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,960
And you knew all about these.

107
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,280
How come we never heard Evergreen Shrine mention this?

108
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,480
My disobedient student got bewitched by the female demon.

109
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,640
I already ordered him to eliminate the source of trouble.

110
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,980
I even activated the punishment technique of Firmament.

111
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,070
Now, Wuji has personally brought the female demon to Firmament.

112
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:01,020
May elders give him one more chance and observe what he'll do next.

113
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,730
He disobeyed you beforehand, so how can he suddenly have a change of mind now?

114
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,960
Aren't you afraid that he'll try to harbor her again?

115
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,510
This person is after all the designated heir of Evergreen Shrine

116
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,530
and is favored a lot by Palace Leader.

117
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:19,410
Even if he does have any selfish intentions, I fear that onlookers can't really say anything about it.

118
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,190
A bunch of nonsense!

119
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,160
My Evergreen Shrine has always been open and upright.

120
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,860
Since our ancestral teacher Chang Qingzi established our palace until now, everything we did was for Five Regions.

121
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,480
How can I tolerate you saying such words and being unruly?

122
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,990
I think you misunderstood.

123
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,840
I didn't intend to offend you.

124
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,160
It's just that Zhangsun Wuji has been bewitched by that female demon.

125
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,080
You two have a very deep teacher-student affection for each other.

126
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,740
I was afraid that someone will take advantage of that and deceive you.

127
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,930
If you get softhearted and become lenient to this disobedient student,

128
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,310
not only is that a waste of your lifetime of cultivation,

129
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,510
you will even involve the whole Firmament and Five Regions into it.

130
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,830
By then, when the world turns into chaos,

131
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:05,840
your Evergreen Shrine will indeed have to bear a soiled reputation forever.

132
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Now is the critical time that will determine the survival of Five Regions,

133
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,190
none can go against the will of Heaven.

134
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,430
Although he is my most favored student,

135
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:28,950
if he really defends that female demon, then that's going against Evergreen Shrine and the world!

136
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,590
Of course, I will not indulge him.

137
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,190
Palace Leader, it's good if you really have such resoluteness.

138
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,290
That will be the great blessings of the Five Regions.

139
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:47,040
We elders, here in Firmament, can all be at ease too.

140
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm afraid they still do not understand your wishes, Grand Teacher.

141
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,700
Of course, they don't understand.

142
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,600
I want the female demon alive, while they want her dead.

143
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,400
These are two different paths.

144
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
To resurrect Di Feitian,

145
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
my Illusion Palace has waited and longed for her for 1000 years.

146
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:18,500
How would those rotten Confucians from the Evergreen Shrine understand what I think?

147
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,200
If we do not get cooperation from the Evergreen Shrine, then wouldn't we have returned with no gain?

148
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,600
Evergreen Shrine is just an old jade building held in high esteem.

149
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
To simply make a female demon submit,

150
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,500
I do not need to pretend to ask them for help.

151
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:42,700
It's just that Zhangsun Wuji is a hindrance.

152
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,200
Him being beside the female demon is big trouble after all.

153
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Does Grand Teacher want to borrow Evergreen Shrine's hand to eliminate him?

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Zhangsun Wuji is deeply in love with the female demon.

155
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
He has protected her this whole time.

156
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,200
Of course, he wouldn't let the female demon fall into my hands.

157
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,800
I wasted so much breath back there

158
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
just to force Heavenly Secret to promise the thing that he should be doing.

159
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Evergreen Shrine has a disobedient student,

160
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,200
so it's just right for Evergreen Shrine to punish him severely.

161
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
This way,

162
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,900
someone will help me pluck out this bothersome Zhangsun Wuji.

163
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,700
To deal with a small female demon,

164
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,340
I have plenty of plans.

165
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,400
You've gone back on your word.

166
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
You clearly said that if I helped you, you would have a real fight with me.

167
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,830
You are always pestering me.

168
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,800
Is it really only for fighting?

169
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
- You are really—
- Giving you too much leeway.

170
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,200
Have you had enough?

171
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,800
I hope that when I see you again, you won't be so stubborn.

172
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
That Fuyao is the person you are looking for!

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't appear in front of her again.

174
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,800
If you die in her hands in the future, don't blame me for not warning you!

175
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,230
Yan'er?

176
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,690
Yes.

177
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,700
Yan'er, you must remember that the most useless thing in this world are feelings.

178
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,800
Yes.

179
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,800
Evergreen Shrine's student Zhangsun Wuji seeks to meet Grand Teacher.

180
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
You've finally returned.

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Yes, I have returned.

182
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,900
Where is that female demon?

183
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,300
Fuyao is not a female demon.

184
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Up to when do you plan to keep protecting her?

185
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,300
Wuji, have you forgotten your status and your mission?

186
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,990
I dare not forget it.

187
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,800
It's just that this matter concerns a life.

188
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,300
I want to ask Grand Teacher to give Fuyao a chance to live.

189
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,100
Disobedient student!

190
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,200
It's already at this time and you still are going to defend that female demon?

191
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,400
Wuji, you have greatly disappointed me.

192
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Based on Firmament's laws, a student who disobeyed the clique's order is considered a traitor

193
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,600
and will be dealt with the extreme form of punishment.

194
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,400
Since you've forgotten your status,

195
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,900
don't blame me for being heartless.

196
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,950
I understand.

197
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,200
I'm willing to suffer the punishment of Firmament Netherworld Illusion.

198
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,300
But it's indicated in the laws of Firmament

199
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,100
that surviving the four realms, one can become intangible.

200
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,240
Once the person being punished safely survives it,

201
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,100
no matter what his status is,

202
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,000
he'll be treated as if coming from the shrine and obtain the promise of help from Evergreen Shrine.

203
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
May Grand Teacher

204
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,800
not forget it.

205
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,500
You dare to mention the laws of Firmament?

206
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,400
Okay. Okay!

207
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,600
You are indeed my good student.

208
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Let me see then if your ten years of skills

209
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,400
will be able to help you get past the Netherworld Illusion.

210
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
Grand Teacher,

211
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,900
excuse me.

212
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,600
When the Venus Star rises?

213
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,800
By the time the Venus Star in the west rises tomorrow, I'll be back.

214
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Yuan Bao.

215
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Wuji said that he'd be back when the Venus Star rises.

216
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,100
But now, there is still no news from him.

217
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,600
Can you allow me to find him?

218
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Yuan Bao,

219
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:40,400
if anything bad happens to Wuji, I won't continue living by myself.

220
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,430
I beg you. I beg you.

221
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,300
Take me to find him.

222
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,200
Yuan Bao.

223
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,600
Grand Teacher.

224
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,500
I shouldn't have treated you like this.

225
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,600
But during harsh times,

226
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,600
one can only use harsh methods.

227
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,700
Wuji, tell me.

228
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,660
Where is the female demon?

229
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,400
Grand Teacher,

230
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:52,950
our Firmament always says that we have the world in our heart.

231
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:58,800
But this world must now rely on the life of an innocent woman to be saved.

232
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,830
I'd like to ask you.

233
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,640
What's the use for me to cultivate for so many years?

234
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,400
What's the use of our Firmament?

235
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,200
I won't argue about these with you right now.

236
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Say it! Where did you hide her?

237
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,700
Grand Teacher, Fuyao isn't a female demon.

238
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,900
She's chivalrous and cares about the world.

239
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,270
Just because of one five-colored stone, she has to unjustly die?

240
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,800
This is unfair!

241
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,800
In this world, there's no complete fairness.

242
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,400
Maybe...

243
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,300
Maybe killing her isn't the only path.

244
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,400
In the ancient writings of Firmament,

245
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,600
there are a lot of ancient divine powers that have been lost.

246
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
I only want to earnestly ask Grand Teacher to agree to let me find them.

247
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Maybe I'll be able to find a way for Fuyao to survive!

248
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,000
Also, find a way for Firmament and the world to survive!

249
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,900
Do you think I never thought of those?

250
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:11,100
But this world of Five Regions can only be saved by offering her life as a sacrifice.

251
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,800
There is no other way!

252
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,240
I don't believe it.

253
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,100
I don't believe it.

254
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,320
I don't believe it!

255
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,400
I, your student, don't believe it!

256
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,200
Disobedient student.

257
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,800
You have really forgotten your status.

258
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,000
Since the moment I fell in love with her,

259
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,400
I have decided to give up everything.

260
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,700
The past honors and my pride are all not worth mentioning!

261
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,570
I made an oath a long time ago

262
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,010
that even if I have to risk my life,

263
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,700
I still will guard and protect her for a lifetime.

264
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,560
Now or in the next lifetime, if she's around,

265
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,740
I will be around.

266
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,200
Even to the point of becoming the enemy of Evergreen Shrine?

267
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,000
Grand Teacher,

268
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm going to ensure that Fuyao is safe for a lifetime.

269
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,270
My martial arts and power came from Evergreen Shrine.

270
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,800
The kindness of Teacher is as vast as a mountain and I dare not forget it.

271
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,040
But today, for Fuyao,

272
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,400
I must disobey Grand Teacher.

273
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,160
I, Wuji, know that my crime is unpardonable.

274
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,470
May Grand Teacher just take back my cultivated martial arts skills.

275
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,800
You forced me to do this!

276
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,260
This Imprisonment Technique

277
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:13,200
can break all kinds of internal and external energies.

278
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,320
My Evergreen Shrine has never used it for more than 700 years.

279
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:24,060
Wuji, I'm giving you one last chance.

280
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,770
Where is the female demon?

281
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,150
Are you saying it or not?

282
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,830
Say it!

283
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,480
Do you like me?

284
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,660
I like that bright and cheerful you.

285
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,050
I didn't want the difficulties of this world to wipe away that brightness and cheerfulness.

286
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,620
It's my fault.

287
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,160
I wasn't able to protect you.

288
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,250
I wasn't able to block away the foul wind and blood rain of this world.

289
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,090
Girl, I want to give you the world.

290
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,250
I want to give you Five Regions.

291
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:46,000
I want you to become the happiest woman in this world.

292
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,770
If you want to fly, I'll give you the sky.

293
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:55,170
If you want to run, I'll give you the grasslands.

294
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,550
Firmament?

295
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,060
Aren't we supposed to go to Evergreen Shrine?

296
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,570
Are you saying that if we go here, we'll be able to see Wuji?

297
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:35,590
- Fuyao!
- Older SIs Fuyao!
- Older Sister Fuyao!

298
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,360
Why are you all here?

299
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,060
It's really hard to find this place.

300
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,000
It's all thanks to Yuan Bao for guiding us.

301
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,750
You!

302
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,260
You all know?

303
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:13,530
With a huge matter like this happening, why didn't you tell us at all?

304
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,100
Where is Wuji now?

305
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,640
He only said that he'll meet his Grand Teacher,

306
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,150
but he didn't return at our agreed time.

307
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,670
I'm very worried about him.

308
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,600
Let's go find him together then.

309
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,260
In this Holy Land Firmament,

310
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,990
there surely is a place where we can talk.

311
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:31,180
No matter what, let's look for Wuji first.

312
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,490
Older Sister Fuyao, let's go.

313
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,740
No!

314
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,470
The Illusion Realm of Firmament has danger lurking everywhere.

315
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,140
I can't cause you all harm.

316
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,930
We are friends.

317
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,320
All are worth nothing.

318
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,230
It is exactly because we're friends, I can't let you all suffer with me.

319
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,470
If this is the destiny of mine and Wuji's,

320
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,090
I should bear it with him.

321
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,950
- Me too!
- Xiaoqi...

322
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,550
You guys—

323
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,590
How come it's you?

324
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,130
Don't. Taiyan. Taiyan.

325
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:38,110
Stop...

326
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,350
Stop!

327
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:41,130
This is a punishment set up by Grand Teacher.

328
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,670
You can't help me.

329
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,670
Not only that, you might lose your life because of it.

330
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,670
No, it's not worth it.

331
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,650
You have known that Evergreen Shrine will do everything to capture you.

332
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,120
You have known that they won't easily spare you.

333
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:59,070
Why must you still return at this time and walk into their trap?

334
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,730
They have done everything just to capture me.

335
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,890
That's good, too.

336
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:20,990
This way... This way, Fuyao... can... suffer less.

337
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:26,800
Since... Since I'm unable to change her fate,

338
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,600
if I'm able to share her burden a little, then I will do it.

339
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,990
How much are you still going to give just for her?

340
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,920
You have ignored the chance to rule this great empire.

341
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,380
Are you also going to not treasure your life?

342
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,990
Just to be with her...

343
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
must I go down to hell?

344
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,200
If it's a yes, then I'll go.

345
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,630
Even if you have great capabilities,

346
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,800
how can you win against the whole Firmament?

347
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,750
I know.

348
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,390
Of course, I know.

349
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,760
But if I want to earn even a bit of a chance here,

350
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,490
this is the only way.

351
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,590
You want to...

352
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,400
No, you can't... You can't!

353
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,820
It's too dangerous! No!

354
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,600
We've learned martial arts techniques of Firmament since we were little.

355
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,080
Hence, we're restricted by the power of Firmament.

356
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,800
I must remove this body of skills for me to find a chance to survive.

357
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,890
No, you can't!

358
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:03,720
If not because...

359
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,930
Grand Teacher... Grand Teacher made such a kind of punishment,

360
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,530
I fear that...

361
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:23,050
that... it would still be hard for me to fulfill my wish.

362
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,920
That method is very dangerous.

363
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,200
No one has successfully done it for thousands of years.

364
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,340
This is the peak of the heavens.

365
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,350
If you remove your lifetime cultivation now, that is equivalent to suicide.

366
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,690
You're gambling with your life!

367
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,500
Gambling with my life?

368
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,130
Trying to preserve Fuyao's life is going against the mandate of Heaven to begin with.

369
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,490
If I am successful, I can be with her in this life.

370
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,660
If I fail,

371
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,070
I can die with her,

372
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:12,830
break through and then create anew.

373
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,820
It'll only stop once I'm dead.

374
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:26,430
I, Zhangsun Wuji, have no regrets in this life.

375
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:46,100
Based on the situation, looks like Palace Leader indeed is very mad.

376
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,110
He even made use of the Exterminating Nails.

377
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,280
That Zhangsun Wuji was initially the sure heir of Evergreen Shrine.

378
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,290
Now, just because of a female demon, he openly disobeyed his teacher and wanted to be enemies with Firmament.

379
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,980
Even if Evergreen Shrine wants to spare him, the elders of the other palace halls won't agree to it.

380
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,870
That is the peak of the heavens.

381
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:06,510
At such a dangerous place, plus the use of the Exterminating Nails,

382
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,310
even a person with deity-like power can't escape death.

383
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,810
What's harder to face is the unbearable pain that's worse than death.

384
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,980
What place is the peak of the heavens?

385
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,610
Peak of the heavens is the peak of Mt. Emotionless.

386
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:24,770
The peak of the heavens is called the Place of Divine Roar here in Firmament.

387
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:28,560
It is an intended place for banished immortals and is filled with unbearable suffering.

388
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,090
- How do we go there?
- You...

389
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,530
You won't be able to.

390
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:34,800
There are elite Firmament guards along the way.

391
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,950
Without the approval of Grand Teacher, it's impossible that you'll arrive at the mountain's peak.

392
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,170
So talkative.

393
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,630
Are we really going up the mountain from here?

394
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:45,290
Presently, we only have that choice.

395
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,160
Stop!

396
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,630
As long as you leave the female demon behind, I can ensure that the others will not live!

397
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,010
Older Sis Fuyao, you leave first.

398
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,470
You go to the peak of Mt. Emotionless first. Leave this to us.

399
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:08,690
How can I leave you all behind? You!

400
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,520
Go first. We'll be there in a while.

401
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,400
- Quickly go.
- Believe us.

402
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,020
Thank you!

403
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,750
Wait for my return!

404
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:12,640
I found the item that you want.

405
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,970
When you trespassed into the mountain's gates alone and fought with everyone,

406
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,680
I secretly sneaked into the secret chamber of Evergreen Shrine.

407
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,010
I finally found this item.

408
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,520
Maybe, it can tell you the perfect method that can fulfill both sides that you want.

409
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,710
There's no use.

410
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:30,460
This item is the most treasured item of ancestral teacher Chang Qingzi.

411
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,230
Only the student of Evergreen Shrine in its direct line can open it.

412
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,510
Are you all right?

413
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,450
In its direct line? Evergreen Shrine's direct student...

414
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,450
Evergreen Shrine?

415
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,050
Blood...

416
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:03,170
- What?
- Use my blood...

417
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,070
Get the mirror. Get the mirror.

418
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,780
Use my blood and put some drops on the mirror.

419
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,430
It started with me.

420
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,030
It existed because of me.

421
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,300
Since it existed because of me, it will end with me.

422
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,900
What does that mean exactly?

423
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
It...

424
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,820
It started with me.

425
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,510
It existed because of me.

426
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:49,710
Never thought that the perfect plan I'm hoping for is just those few words.

427
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,460
What do they mean?

428
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,020
If there really is no other way,

429
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,320
then we'll use the stupidest method!

430
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,490
Taiyan... Don't! Don't!

431
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,250
Listen to me! You listen to me!

432
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,580
Even if... Even if you break these Exterminating Nails today,

433
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,970
you will drag other people into this.

434
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:14,980
I will not... let you do it.

435
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,540
Do you understand?

436
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,090
You care about my life, her life,

437
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,100
everyone's life!

438
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:26,220
Why can't you just think for yourself?

439
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,780
Why can't you just think for yourself?

440
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,510
I never... was a selfless person.

441
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,700
I love Fuyao.

442
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:44,410
Everything I did was for my own selfish reason,

443
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,560
but... but I caused you all to be in danger.

444
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,710
My life is hanging by a thread.

445
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,290
Come to think of it. Come to think of it.

446
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:00,970
I did all these for my selfish intentions.

447
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:06,760
Liking someone is selfish to begin with, isn't it?

448
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,160
It started with me.

449
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,470
It existed because of me.

450
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,960
Since it existed because of me, it will end with me.

451
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,260
Since it existed because of me,

452
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,620
it will end with me.

453
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,130
Are you planning to?

454
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,230
Don't! Don't!

455
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,850
If... If from the start,

456
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:33,620
this is a destined deadlock,

457
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:41,300
if the will of the heavens can't be changed,

458
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,410
then I... will die with her.

459
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,460
How is Wuji doing?

460
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,070
This is already the heavenly icy cold punishment.

461
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,910
An ordinary person will usually ask for mercy in just half a day.

462
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,400
I never thought that Senior Brother would willingly bear it.

463
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,450
Disobedient Student.

464
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,970
You all keep watch of him well.

465
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,400
If there is any situation, immediately report back.

466
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,700
I understand.

467
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:09,870
What's most important now is to immediately send people to capture the female demon.

468
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:13,800
If she really charges into Evergreen Shrine, how scandalous will that be?

469
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,540
That's right. The seal now kept stirring.

470
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:22,770
If we don't subdue the female demon soon, I fear that the situation might go out of control.

471
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,510
But Mt. Emotionless is so vast.

472
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:29,180
How will we know her whereabouts?

473
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,120
She surely is moving toward the peak of the heavens.

474
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,960
She will look for that disobedient student.

475
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,690
Since she came here by herself, don't blame me for being heartless then.

476
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,740
When the female demon appears in the mortal world,

477
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,290
she must be killed.

478
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,470
What do we do? Another batch is coming.

479
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,060
Go save Older Sis Fuyao. I'll stay here.

480
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:55,440
No! Just you alone is too dangerous!

481
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,070
I can guard this bridge.

482
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,170
If I'm unable to defeat them, I'll cut off the bridge and block their path.

483
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,440
Quickly go!

484
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,650
I'll stay with you.

485
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,230
But Older Sis Fuyao needs you three more.

486
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:10,830
Ever since, you all have been protecting me.

487
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,730
This time, let me protect you all.

488
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,230
Xiaoqi!

489
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:29,660
Stay alive!

490
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,090
Quickly go!

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

492
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:00,300
♫ What do you know? ♫

493
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:04,170
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

494
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,020
♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

495
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,300
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

496
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:14,840
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

497
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:18,800
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

498
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,970
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

499
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,260
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

500
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:32,370
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

501
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:36,270
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

502
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:39,490
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

503
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,930
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

504
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,870
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

505
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,090
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

506
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:56,030
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

507
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,690
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

508
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:06,870
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

509
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:08,680
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

510
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,660
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

511
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:15,690
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

512
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,920
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

513
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,020
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

514
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,660
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

515
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,300
♫ Have someone's company♫

516
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,340
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

517
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,590
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

518
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:40,500
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

519
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,460
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

520
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,410
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

521
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,690
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

522
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:57,260
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

523
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:03,520
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫
