00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,390
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,580
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,860
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,990
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:40,020
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,120
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,760
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,890
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,920
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,110
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:06,580
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,350
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,360
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,470
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,640
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,280
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,070
~ Episode 30 ~

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,890
- I don't remember.
- I heard...

23
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,870
that day...

24
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,730
was just like today.

25
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,110
Why was the title of crown prince bestowed upon her child?

26
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,310
Keep quiet!

27
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,580
Lian'er, my Lian'er.

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,040
Lian'er. Lian'er.

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,750
Lian'er...

30
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,200
Your death was caused by Prince Virtue.

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,130
Your death was caused by Zhangsun Jia.

32
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,620
Heaven will punish all of you.

33
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,200
Punish all of you.

34
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,610
I'm sorry, Royal Aunt.

35
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,400
I shouldn't have treated you like this.

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,570
But the secret you knew is the truth that I've wanted to know.

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,530
Hen'er.

38
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,570
I remember when you were five or six years old,

39
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,220
I taught you how to hold a sword the first time.

40
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,490
This is the sword that I used.

41
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,980
Do you still remember?

42
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:35,040
I never thought that you'd use it to kill me today.

43
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,300
At last, this sword has a new owner.

44
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,170
All these years, you've followed me to fight all over the place.

45
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,680
You have endured a great deal of hardships.

46
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,470
But in my heart,

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,700
I have treated you as my biological son.

48
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,290
If in your heart, you still think any goodness of me, your father,

49
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,610
then promise me one thing.

50
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,730
Be kind to my Yun'er.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,640
You don't have to worry.

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,360
I surely won't make things difficult for her.

53
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,650
I believe you.

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,840
All right then,

55
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,810
let's put an end to it.

56
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,100
Take a good look at him, this hypocritical face.

57
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,970
In the past, that's how our parents were fooled by him.

58
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:58,760
He is your enemy who exterminated our entire family, not your godfather!

59
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,990
Kill!

60
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,320
I'll kill you!

61
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,160
I can't do it!

62
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,030
You take a look at Deep Water.

63
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,010
Later, the throne of Deep Water is for you to take.

64
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,500
All the extreme miseries in Deep Water are for you to bear.

65
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,270
Today, you can't even kill a treacherous minister and traitor.

66
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,540
How are you going to rule Deep Water later on?

67
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,390
I don't want any rubbish Deep Water throne.

68
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,450
You are my elder brother.

69
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:52,810
The throne should belong to you to start with.

70
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,570
But I beg you, just spare him his life.

71
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,540
After all, he taught and brought me up all those years.

72
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:24,760
After all, the grace of giving birth to you is not as endearing as the grace of nurturing you.

73
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,310
And Yun'er.

74
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,220
Yun'er... Yun'er is so weak.

75
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,420
If she knows all this, she definitely won't be able to go on living.

76
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,630
You promised me.

77
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,340
You promised me that you won't hurt her.

78
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,700
That's right.

79
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,220
You promised not to hurt her.

80
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,860
You all have made the promise.

81
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,390
Just come and put an end to it!

82
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,410
Come on.

83
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,960
Yun Hen, do it!

84
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,190
Shut up!

85
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:12,860
I know, that night 78 people died in Heir Apparent's Manor.

86
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,810
I know that you've gone through lots of hardships just to stay alive.

87
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Xuanyuan is my surname.

88
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,980
There's no reason that I should plead for my enemy who exterminated my whole family.

89
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,300
But even if we want to avenge,

90
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,980
is killing the only way?

91
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:34,770
Can our father come back to life if you killed Qi Zhen today?

92
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,210
Can he?

93
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,850
He is totally defeated.

94
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,290
His lifelong obsessiveness has all been destroyed.

95
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,050
The revenge is done, right?

96
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:52,060
I... I... I will make him stay in the darkest dungeon for the rest of his life.

97
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,690
Make him repent day and night.

98
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,870
Are those not enough?

99
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,490
You're softhearted now.

100
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,070
Are you able to bear the consequences it brings later?

101
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,980
Forget it. Forget it.

102
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,020
How can I force my own younger brother to be an executioner?

103
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:36,140
It's just that you can only know the pain once you bleed.

104
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,720
Although you and I are biological brothers,

105
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,670
we're on different courses so we cannot lay plans for one another.

106
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:47,220
The throne of Deep Water is left for you to take.

107
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,700
If you don't want it, just find any random person to take it.

108
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,660
All I wanted was just the vengeance.

109
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,970
Where do you want to go?

110
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,140
I'm done with the things I wanted to do.

111
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,630
It's time to go repay my gratitude.

112
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,760
What about Yun'er then?

113
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,880
What about Yun'er?

114
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,530
Being immersed in love will eventually kill people.

115
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,530
Take good care of yourself!

116
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,730
Lian'er is no longer alive.

117
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,780
You... are not my daughter.

118
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,910
Is that true?

119
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,470
It's not that I don't think of you.

120
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,490
I really thought you already died.

121
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,680
My daughter is so beautiful.

122
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,230
Now, it's different.

123
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,160
You're back to my side.

124
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,890
You will have everything that other lady did.

125
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:45,310
Do think what ladies should do and should think.

126
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,810
I will slowly teach you all.

127
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:53,420
In the future, you surely will find your ideal husband and live forever bound by love.

128
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
I want to leave this place.

129
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,100
I want to find my Lian'er.

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,700
My poor Lian'er.

131
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,000
In the end, you still didn't spare her.

133
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,730
To you, everyone

134
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,900
is just to be taken advantage of.

135
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,970
Who exactly are you?

136
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,400
Why did you come to Deep Water?

137
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,700
Have you thought this through?

138
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,800
Once you break the first seal,

139
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,300
her fate will change as a result.

140
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,700
If I don't break the seal, will she live?

141
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm afraid it will be difficult.

142
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,900
Then this is her destiny.

143
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,440
I will definitely do what I've promised you.

144
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Will this really not harm Qi Yun's life?

145
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Since you want a method that will not harm anyone, of course, I dare not slack off.

146
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,000
Rest assured.

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,740
The hour has come.

148
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Fuyao, my helping you break this seal

149
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,900
is because I believe you'll make the right decision.

150
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,200
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

151
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,600
And I'm destined to get entangled with you for a lifetime.

152
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

153
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,300
You have suffered a lot before being able to return to yourself.

154
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,200
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

155
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,800
Hope you won't need to live under other people's identities from now on.

156
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,400
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫

157
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,600
Look at that unbridled face.

158
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,200
She surely will suffer a lot in the future.

159
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,180
Our business here is done.

160
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,500
What are you going to do now?

161
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,660
Leave this place.

162
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,600
Go down my original path.

163
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,500
Then what about her?

164
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,670
Do you believe in destiny?

165
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,960
I do.

166
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,600
If we are destined to meet again,

167
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,950
even if separated by mountains and oceans,

168
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,800
we'll meet again.

169
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,540
Then what about the Earth Absorbing Bell?

170
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,000
Right now is the best time for taking it away.

171
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,300
Take good care of yourself.

172
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,100
Let's go.

173
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,210
I'll leave Deep Water in your hands.

174
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,900
She will automatically wake up after four hours.

175
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,700
Older Sis Fuyao! Older Sis Fuyao!

176
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,800
Older Sis Fuyao!

177
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,400
Older Sis Fuyao!

178
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,800
Xiaoqi?

179
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
Older Sis Fuyao.

180
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
- Xiaoqi.
- Fu—

181
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,890
I'm fine.

182
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,200
I've finally found you.

183
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Older Sis Fuyao, how come your face changed back?

184
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,730
I don't know, either.

185
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,400
It had changed back when I woke up.

186
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,600
Right, though. This you is prettier.

187
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,900
Oh, right. Where did you go exactly last night?

188
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,800
I was so worried. I couldn't find you after the battle.

189
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,200
Thank goodness that fake king told me you were at the lake outside the city.

190
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Otherwise, Deep Water is this huge. I'd have died trying to find you.

191
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,140
Fake king?

192
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,400
Yeah, the fake Xuanyuan Min.

193
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,800
You probably don't know yet. So many things happened overnight.

194
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,900
Did you know that Yun Hen from the Prime Minister's Manor, Mr. Yun, actually became King of Deep Water?

195
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,400
Also, he even conferred Prefect Xiping's daughter, Gao Puruo, as the queen.

196
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,600
Based on what I heard, the reason that Prefect Xiping turned against Qi Zhen at the critical moment was

197
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,400
because that fake king promised their Gao family a queen position.

198
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,200
I couldn't have believed that the fake Xuanyuan Min set up such a complex plan.

199
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
At the end, it's all for giving the throne to someone else.

200
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,500
I don't know his real identity, either.

201
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,060
That's right.

202
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,800
Who is he exactly?

203
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,200
Older Sis Fuyao,

204
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,770
so what should we do now?

205
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,100
Where are we going?

206
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,450
Older Sis Fuyao?

207
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,500
Older Sis Fuyao!

208
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,100
What's wrong?

209
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,500
Right.

210
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,020
Where can we actually go?

211
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,270
Forget it.

212
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,800
As long as there is somewhere we can go,

213
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,200
why don't we just sail downward with the current and see where our feet take us?

214
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,500
Okay, I'll listen to you.

215
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,900
Where is my Five-Colored Stone?

216
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,230
You've broken the first seal,

217
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,880
but there are four more.

218
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:54,000
I will wait for you at the next stop.

219
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,270
I hope the Mystic Spirit Leaf will bring you back to my side.

220
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,450
I'll wait for you.

221
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,410
You asshole! You dare take something from me?

222
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,930
When I find you, I must put you in a pot and cook you.

223
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,070
Mother helps us to grow as the gentle wind from the south helps the bud of the jujube tree to grow.

224
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,730
Mother helps us to grow as the gentle wind from the south helps the bud of the jujube tree to grow.

225
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:37,090
We've grown up like the tree but Mother has put in great efforts.

226
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,280
We've grown up like the tree but Mother has put in great efforts.

227
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,920
With Mother's nurturing, we grow up as commoners.

228
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,380
Mother is very virtuous but we didn't become the pillar of society.

229
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,340
Go look if there is any peasant household nearby.

230
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,650
If we're lucky, we might even get something to eat.

231
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,880
You're making me feel very hungry.

232
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,310
Hey, Older Sis Fuyao, I seem to be smelling meat.

233
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,560
I think you're just dizzy from starvation.

234
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,820
It's true. My nose is very sharp.

235
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,010
Look! There's really meat!

236
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,090
Weird. How come there's a fire here, but no one is around?

237
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,050
Be careful!

238
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,640
Grandaunt, have mercy! Grandaunt, have mercy!

239
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,560
Grandaunt, have mercy!

240
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,770
You dare rob me? From where did you come from?

241
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,240
I'm not a bandit. I just want to get some money for traveling.

242
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,840
Hence, I resorted to stealing.

243
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,150
Older Sis Fuyao. Older Sis Fuyao, look at his emblem.

244
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,470
He seems to be a subordinate of Prince Zhan.

245
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,130
Zhan Beiye?

246
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,700
How is it possible that Zhan Beiye has a scummy subordinate like you?

247
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,460
- Where is he?
- He...

248
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,310
He led us to attack Deep Water.

249
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,370
After we lost, we got separated.

250
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,230
I never saw him again!

251
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,670
- Zhan Beiye attacked Deep Water?
- Yes.

252
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,590
Are you sure?

253
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,250
I was also there when you attacked the city.

254
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,790
How come I never saw him?

255
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,700
Xiaoqi, hang him until he tells the truth.

256
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,900
Don't! Don't! I'll talk.

257
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,760
I'm not a subordinate of Prince Fierce.

258
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,680
Who are you then?

259
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,790
Grandaunt, I'm a member of Gold of Heaven Fiend.

260
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,340
What's Gold of Heaven Fiend?

261
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,880
Gold of Heaven Fiend is the imperial bodyguards of the Heaven Fiend's King Zhan Nancheng.

262
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,760
Why then did you claim to be Prince Zhan's subordinate?

263
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:53,120
Could it be that Zhan Nancheng asked you guys to pretend to be Zhan Beiye's subordinate and collude with Qi Zhen?

264
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,720
The person who launched an attack on Deep Water was him,

265
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,600
but he's framing all the crimes on Zhan Beiye. Am I right?

266
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,460
Yes.

267
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,340
What does that mean?

268
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,630
In attacking Deep Water Nation,

269
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:09,080
if Qi Zhen succeeded, Zhan Nancheng would have benefited.

270
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,990
But if he lost, Zhan Beiye would be the one who is vile and sinful.

271
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,070
This scheme of you guys was really a good one.

272
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,460
What? Then doesn't that mean that Prince Zhan is in big trouble?

273
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,760
Prince Fierce will be a wanted criminal in the whole Five Regions very soon.

274
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,310
By then, even the emperor of Megrez won't be able to defend him.

275
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,200
- Move quickly!
 - Since that's the case,

276
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,140
let's go to Megrez Empire's imperial city then.

277
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,270
With this witness, I want to see if there is still justice in this world.

278
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,920
We can't move forward! We can't move forward!

279
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,170
Why?

280
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:30,210
There are black banners over there. Having black banners, that represents an epidemic.

281
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:33,100
If you contract it, you will surely die!

282
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,530
If you're afraid to die, then stay here.

283
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,000
- Xiaoqi, hold this for me.
- Yes.

284
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,370
- I'll go ask for some water.
- Okay.

285
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,560
- Watch him well.
- Okay.

286
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,800
Hey, you mustn't leave! Come back here! You!

287
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,250
Shut up!

288
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,980
Miss! Miss!

289
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,420
- Miss.
 - Mother...

290
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,470
What has happened to all of them?

291
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,050
They are refugees who contracted an epidemic illness and are in critical condition.

292
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,510
You look healthy. Are you here to help save them, too?

293
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,730
I-I am just a passerby.

294
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,350
I wanted to ask for some water.

295
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,350
Miss, you are?

296
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,580
My name is Qiaoling.

297
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,850
Then, it's right for you to ask for water here.

298
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:43,250
The water around here has been contaminated with disease.

299
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,280
Good thing, my Miss knows some immortal magic.

300
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,790
Only our water is potable.

301
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,700
Miss, come with me.

302
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,760
Miss, your Miss is?

303
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,650
It's her.

304
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,880
They all call my Miss Saintess Folian.

305
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,840
They treat her as Five Region's great savior; a great philanthropist.

306
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,940
Lady has always had a very kind heart just like Budda.

307
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,130
She can't bear to see people suffering.

308
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:10,030
She just doesn't know to care for herself.

309
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,700
Miss, we're here.

310
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,740
Give that to me.

311
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,960
Miss, there are no villages or shops around here.

312
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,940
Why did your lady choose to do treatment here?

313
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,750
It's not up to her to decide.

314
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,740
These people came to seek asylum from the Megrez Empire Imperial City.

315
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,760
No one wanted to stay home and wait for death.

316
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,360
But now, because of the fear of the epidemic spreading into the Imperial city,

317
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,970
they couldn't even enter the city gates.

318
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:40,060
Miss said that saving one is one.

319
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
Here, Miss.

320
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,870
Thanks.

321
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,340
Miss has spent a lot of money to hire some doctors.

322
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,560
With them around here, there surely will be a way to resolve this soon.

323
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,160
Older Sis Fuyao!

324
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,430
Older Sis Fuyao, that guy escaped!

325
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,420
Escaped? After him!

326
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,550
I did. But he suddenly fainted.

327
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,130
- What?
- Yes.

328
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,270
He's wounded and is exhausted from the recent travel.

329
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:11,040
The virus for this epidemic is quite strong to start with.

330
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,890
It's just that he hasn't had any symptom yet.

331
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,730
In his situation, we still must observe for a few days.

332
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:23,480
During this travel all the way from Deep Water, I never noticed anything strange.

333
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,160
Where did that epidemic come from?

334
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,000
- You came from Deep Water?
- Yes.

335
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,730
That's right then.

336
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:36,780
This epidemic originated in the far-flung outskirt of Heaven Fiend, a place adjacent to Deep Water.

337
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,000
Far-flung outskirt of Heaven Fiend?

338
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,440
I heard that a coup occurred in Deep Water and so many died.

339
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,800
It will be easier for epidemics like this to happen then.

340
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,790
It looks like this epidemic is more severe than I imagined.

341
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,140
This epidemic is weird. Traveling together, Xiaoqi and I are both fine.

342
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,660
But how come he suddenly fainted?

343
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,830
This epidemic differs from one person to another.

344
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,940
Some people will never contract it.

345
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,670
While some are unable to escape it even if they are extra careful.

346
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,790
This must be predestined, too.

347
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,410
Miss, let me help you.

348
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,260
It's better that you don't approach him, Miss.

349
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,860
Look. You are well now.

350
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,930
But this epidemic is fiercely contagious.

351
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,310
I fear that when the time comes, you might be unable to handle it.

352
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,930
Try to protect yourself a little.

353
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,620
Miss,

354
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,500
you are also a mere mortal.

355
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,350
Look at you guys taking care of so many people every day.

356
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,430
Aren't you afraid of getting sick?

357
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,200
I've made an oath in front of Buddha to do good and accumulate virtue in this lifetime.

358
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,320
The reason that I'm able to stand here today is all thanks to Buddha's blessings.

359
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,360
Hence, I dare not slack off on anything.

360
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,800
Try to endure it a little. It's a bit painful.

361
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,180
Older Sis Fuyao...

362
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,190
- How did it go?
- I've...
- You're done with your task?

363
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:28,110
That... I've distributed the money we saved to the patients.

364
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:31,570
But Older Sis Fuyao, we are now really poor.

365
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,740
We can just earn back the money.

366
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,440
We've received huge graces here.

367
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,700
We should help out as much as we can.

368
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,900
Oh, right.

369
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:46,450
I heard those people say that all these patients were traveling to Megrez Empire Imperial City to find some sort of leaves.

370
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,260
They said they are a magical medicine that especially treats this kind of epidemic virus.

371
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,880
- Also, they said that the only person that can stabilize the situation now...
- Magical medicine?

372
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,910
...is that Lord Emperor.

373
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,640
Oh, right. Also, what was that?

374
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,710
Oh, they said that the Crown Prince of Megrez is returning soon.

375
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,100
When he's back, everyone can be saved.

376
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,240
The Crown Prince of Megrez?

377
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,370
Yes. He seemed to be called Zhang... Zhangsun Wuji.

378
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:13,940
I'm so tired.

379
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,380
Zhangsun Wuji.

380
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,650
What I mean is that since Crown Prince Wuji is back,

381
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:16,830
we should let him handle all the state affairs.

382
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:22,600
Of course, that includes the 100,000 strong Imperial Army that's temporarily under Prince Assist's command.

383
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,860
These 100,000 men have been following First Royal Son for five years, right?

384
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:34,290
First Royal Son is cautious, conscientious, and attends to everything personally.

385
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,680
He has never made any mistake.

386
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:42,160
With just your words, you want him to hand over his military power.

387
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,320
I don't think that can happen so easily.

388
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,460
Crown Prince Wuji is currently the most talented individual across the globe.

389
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,730
Above, he has the divine power from Firmament protecting him.

390
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,090
Below, he has the citizens of Five Regions supporting him.

391
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,850
Returning after ten years of training, he surely will have become more excellent.

392
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:01,100
Letting him fully govern the state affairs,

393
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,010
Official Duan, is there anything that you're worried about?

394
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,400
It's exactly because Crown Prince Wuji had trained in Firmament for ten years,

395
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,930
he's not familiar with the major and minor matters in the empire and the situation of Five Regions.

396
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:22,170
Even if he is the most talented individual across the globe, we shouldn't just pass everything to him.

397
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,680
Power should be slowly given.

398
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,330
An army should be slowly trained.

399
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,140
When the citizens of the city learned that Crown Prince Wuji has returned,

400
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,820
each one is hanging lanterns and colorful streamers as decorations.

401
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:44,060
They said that the Crown Prince returning during times of trouble is surely one that should be celebrated.

402
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,190
Ten years ago, Crown Prince was already a formidable being.

403
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:50,440
Now, the citizens crowd the streets to welcome him back,

404
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,680
yet you're going to just leave him idling around.

405
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,830
First Royal Son served loyally.

406
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:07,090
In the mouth of the citizens, he also holds great prestige.

407
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:12,120
Moreover, His Highness has just defeated the rebelled South Tribe.

408
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,760
He made great military achievements and returned victorious. He is unrivaled in bravery.

409
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,300
It's fine if you don't want him rewarded.

410
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,870
But how come you still want to diminish his power?

411
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,290
I want to make a suggestion.

412
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,710
With Crown Prince Wuji returning from training, the citizens are raising their heads and looking forward to it.

413
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,340
We should follow the citizen's desire and prepare for a grand welcoming ceremony.

414
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,440
This is to placate the fears of the citizens.

415
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,260
In my opinion, the epidemic is spreading all over and we are tight on budget.

416
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,800
Why not just make everything simpler?

417
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,400
I'm sure that it can allow Crown Prince to win the citizen's heart more.

418
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,310
- You saw everything.
- I did.

419
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,790
In the competition for power, people will automatically have their stand.

420
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,950
These past years, your oldest brother, Pingrong, indeed has done a lot of things

421
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:56,230
and has won over a few hearts.

422
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:00,210
Rather than saying that these people are convinced of your oldest brother's ability,

423
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:07,170
it's better to say that they are not sure if you're still that same person from a few years ago.

424
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,270
Several years have passed.

425
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:16,290
For those hearts that you were unable to keep,

426
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:22,120
you must find them back one by one.

427
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,640
I understand.

428
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,160
Do you have any news about that Earth Absorbing Bell I told you to find?

429
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,720
Forgive me for being incompetent.

430
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,650
I wasn't able to bring the Earth Absorbing Bell back here as you requested.

431
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,310
You know that item can control the world.

432
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,370
Why did you still disappoint me?

433
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,460
The Earth Absorbing Bell is a national treasure of Heaven Fiend.

434
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,160
It's possessed by the Zhan royal family.

435
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,220
- I was thinking—
- That I'm stealing from others?

436
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,870
I dare not think that way.

437
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,870
Since it's an item that everyone is coveting,

438
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,640
it will be best if it's in Emperor Father's custody.

439
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,740
You should know the outcome of disobeying the Imperial decree.

440
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,940
I'm willing to accept the punishment.

441
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,160
Your mother has been waiting for you.

442
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,920
You may be excused.

443
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,850
Yes.

444
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:34,590
[Pure Mist Palace Hall]

445
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,970
Empress, this is the new treasure that His Majesty refined.

446
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,480
He especially had it delivered to you so you can try it.

447
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,660
Got it.

448
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,450
- Go keep it.
- Yes.

449
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,840
I heard that Crown Prince Wuji has returned.

450
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,040
See the whole city is decorated with lanterns and colorful banners.

451
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,530
The citizens are happy as if it is new year.

452
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,550
Everyone has been talking about, waiting, and looking forward to it.

453
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,360
Crown Prince is finally returning home.

454
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,110
Does His Majesty know about all these?

455
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,740
He knows.

456
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,790
He even especially ordered the palace to make preparations.

457
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,740
Okay.

458
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,980
Let's just follow the Imperial decree then.

459
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,620
Yes.

460
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,830
Amitaba.

461
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,290
Although I don't know your relationship with him,

462
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:58,660
I can tell you're most upset by his death.

463
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,200
I'm upset not because he died.

464
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,900
Then why?

465
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,320
He is my very important witness.

466
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,370
To tell you the truth,

467
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:15,770
a good friend of mine is falsely accused.

468
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:18,920
I needed to take this man to the Megrez Imperial City to see the Emperor

469
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,750
so that he can clear the charges for my friend. Who knows—

470
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,370
Forget it.

471
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:31,570
I'll go to the Megrez Imperial City and have an audience with the emperor first.

472
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,530
Are you saying that you want to go to Megrez Imperial City

473
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,860
and even want to enter the palace to have an audience with the emperor?

474
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,890
Is there anything wrong about that?

00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:14,270
♫ If there were no three poisons, if there were no worries, ♫

479
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,440
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

480
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,130
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

481
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,970
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

482
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,120
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

483
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:31,460
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

484
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:38,540
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

485
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,410
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness ♫

486
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,680
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

487
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,190
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

488
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,230
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

489
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,310
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

490
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:01,790
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

491
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,770
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

492
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:13,040
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

493
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,840
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

494
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,820
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

495
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:21,890
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

496
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,150
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

497
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:31,160
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

498
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,770
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

499
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,440
♫ Have someone's company♫

500
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,540
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

501
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,810
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

502
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,600
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

503
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,530
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫
