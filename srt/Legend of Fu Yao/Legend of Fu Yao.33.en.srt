00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,300
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,200
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,800
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,200
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,200
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,400
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[The Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,500
~ Episode 33 ~

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,600
Fei Yan never helps people without a condition.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
For her to teach you such medical skills, she must have taken away more.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What did you give her?

25
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,580
Forty years of my life span.

26
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,800
Don't calculate anymore. You won't be able to calculate it anyway.

27
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,900
This matter has nothing to do with you and you won't be able to help, either.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Are you living... just to seek revenge?

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,000
When you helped me defeat Qi Zhen, 1/3 of it was to pacify Deep Water.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,500
1/3 of it was to prove that you deserved to be the Crown Prince.

31
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,700
And another 1/3 was because of our friendship.

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Now that the matter has come to this, you don't need to help me anymore.

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,600
For the remaining, just let me resolve them by myself.

34
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,700
Qi Zhen's life... my whole clan's revenge... must be solved using my method.

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,400
You're wrong.

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,370
I helped you...

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,970
half of the reason was because I'm the Crown Prince of Megrez.

38
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,210
The other half...

39
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,170
was all because of you.

40
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,100
It's around 2:45 a.m.

41
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:30,000
In a few hours, the marriage between you and Princess Folian will be finalized.

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
These past years, you did think of her, whether openly or secretly.

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,420
Now that there is finally a result,

44
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,100
this Plough Nation holds the wealth of the world.

45
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,800
The gold and silver production in Five Regions depends entirely on them.

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,600
If you marry Folian, it's like marrying a mountain of gold.

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,300
Even you are mocking me.

48
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,800
What you mean is marrying Folian is my best choice?

49
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,240
Is she the person you're looking for?

50
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,500
The first time I met Folian was in the royal palace of Plough.

51
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,000
That time, she was so skinny like a cat.

52
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,900
But those eyes of hers were so crystal clear,

53
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,000
as if they could accommodate everything in this world.

54
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Beautiful ones. Ugly ones.

55
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Good ones. Bad ones.

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
All of these...

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,300
can fit inside them.

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,400
But there are things that should be clarified from start to end.

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,900
They can't be done sloppily.

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,100
You are able to obtain whatever you want, regardless of the method.

61
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,600
I never saw you fail.

62
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,800
After you two marry, this Crown Prince position will finally be rooted.

63
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,600
You would have won again.

64
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,170
What about Fuyao?

65
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,800
What should that girl do?

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,400
You kept pushing her to the fiery pit throughout this journey,

67
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
and then risked your life to save her all the time.

68
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Now, the one you're marrying is the princess of Plough Nation.

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,200
If Fuyao learns this, is that helping her or harming her?

70
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Of course, I won't harm her!

71
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,810
It's just that—

72
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,900
You're finally willing to see me.

73
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Wuji is back.

74
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,200
This world will soon be my son's and mine.

75
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,800
You should understand what I mean.

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,500
Even if Wuji ascends to the throne,

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,100
I fear that this world still can't accommodate us.

78
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,700
Is it true that nothing can be changed?

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,230
It is exactly because Wuji is back,

80
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,600
the more I can't see you.

81
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,800
I can't let him see or hear that we're together.

82
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,200
Zhangsun Jia?

83
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,400
The Wuji now has a more sinister gaze than Zhangsun Jiong.

84
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,600
I'm doing this for you.

85
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,300
Yi'er, you mustn't let your son look down on you.

86
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,700
I never thought of competing with Zhangsun Jiong.

87
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
Everything is fated.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We initially were in love first, but he—

89
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,000
Destiny makes fools of people.

90
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,900
We couldn't do anything about it for we are just measly mortals.

91
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,400
Quickly leave.

92
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,240
Who told you to be nosy?

93
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Who told you to wander around?

94
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,200
Now, you've seen something that you shouldn't have seen.

95
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,520
Empress Yuan and Prince Virtue.

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,300
Mother-in-law and uncle-in-law.

97
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,600
This is too—

98
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you people from Plough usually dress like this?

99
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,500
Wearing such happy colors, I must be going to my wedding.

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
Is this true gold?

101
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,800
Of course.

102
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,800
Our Plough holds no pride of anything but lots and lots of gold.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Counting all the gold in Five Regions couldn't even compare to us by a place value.

104
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,000
Dressing up like this is what my Miss should be looking like.

105
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't be afraid. Once you enter later, just explain the matter clearly and everything will be all right.

106
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm just thinking that after finishing this matter, I still must return this dress to Folian.

107
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,800
With so much gold, can I not return it anymore?

108
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm joking.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,700
Let me tell you, you are not allowed to leave again next time without saying anything.

110
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,800
Do you hear me?

111
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,000
I want you to marry the second princess of Plough, Folian.

112
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,600
The Crown Princess must be Princess Folian.

113
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,900
How long are you planning to keep dilly-dallying?

114
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,000
You look better with black hair.

115
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,700
At least, my efforts in helping you didn't go in vain.

116
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,170
I'm giving this back to you.

117
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,900
No need for thanks.

118
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,800
Today is a very important day.

119
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,870
If I continue to delay it and you miss out on getting engaged,

120
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm unable to bear the consequences.

121
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,050
Mister! Mis—

122
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,000
Doctor. Mister, we can't wait anymore.

123
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,710
His Majesty and Empress are both looking for you.

124
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,600
Quickly go back.

125
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,640
Wuji, actually—

126
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,570
What?

127
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,370
Seeing that Folian and I will be having our engagement ceremony today, are you against it?

128
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,400
If you don't want it, I won't go then.

129
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Using words to choke me, is that it?

130
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,660
Okay. I won't say nonsense anymore.

131
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,200
There are things that you will know sooner or later.

132
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,420
I'm going now.

133
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,250
When you discover that Folian is Fuyao,

134
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,000
that will be interesting.

135
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,610
Because His Majesty cares about the citizens in Five Regions,

136
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,900
he has gone into seclusion to meditate for blessings for so many days without resting.

137
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,220
Prince Assist helps manage governmental affairs in the imperial court.

138
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,310
I presided over the governance of the court.

139
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,930
We all know that today is the engagement ceremony of Crown Prince Wuji and Princess Folian.

140
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,100
What's more important is that the Five Regions is facing danger.

141
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:02,790
Currently, we must unite the strengths of the different nations so we can survive this difficulty together.

142
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,770
The mythical power given by Firmament Shrine has been placed and is waiting inside the cauldron.

143
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,030
Let's not waste anymore time.

144
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,300
May the different nations submit to me the territorial maps that you've brought.

145
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,400
The Megrez map is in my hand.

146
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,170
I'll go first.

147
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,170
Megrez is offering the Megrez map to protect the citizens of Five Regions.

148
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,350
The king of Heaven Fiend is offering Heaven Fiend map.

149
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,000
May the citizens of Five Regions remain healthy and secured.

150
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,890
The king of Deep Water is offering Deep Water map.

151
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,840
Pray that the citizens of the four nations remain in peace.

152
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,550
Firmament, Megrez, Deep Water, and Heaven Fiend,

153
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,090
the powers of these four nations have appeared.

154
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,240
We're now just waiting for the Plough's princess to come here

155
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,130
and submit Plough map.

156
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,160
I heard that this Plough map is quite special.

157
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,950
Does it differ with ours?

158
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,390
Yes. It is indeed that way.

159
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,690
This Plough map was created by the cooling and solidifying a thousand years of lava from Young Phoenix Lake.

160
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,850
The five elements of Heaven and Earth: gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.

161
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,390
Other than representing blazing fire,

162
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,710
the Plough map has the magical power to aggregate the five elemental powers.

163
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,390
Then it means that the Plough map is the critical factor in aggregating the magical powers of the Five Regions.

164
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:54,180
That's right. Only through the aggregating powers of the Plough map to

165
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,880
aggregate the magical powers of the different nations,

166
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,660
can we all then mutually survive.

167
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,310
What about the Queen Heir of Plough?

168
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,270
With such an important event,

169
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,780
how come we still aren't seeing her?

170
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,180
The Queen Heir of Plough is here!

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,270
Greetings, Your Highness Prince Virtue.

172
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:22,200
Princess, I'm sure Princess doesn't know everyone yet.

173
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,520
This is Lady Virtue of Deep Water.

174
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,450
This is Prince Eternal of Heaven Fiend.

175
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,440
I've long heard of the great name of the Saintess of Five Regions who saves the world from sufferings and has a benevolent heart.

176
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,530
Seeing you today, you indeed have an extraordinary bearing and beauty.

177
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,860
I've long heard of the great name of Prince Eternal.

178
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:52,480
I've long heard that the Zhan brothers have mutual respect and deep affection for each other.

179
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,940
It's really inviting envy.

180
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,170
Since Princess Folian is here,

181
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,900
may I ask you to quickly return the Plough map to its rightful place,

182
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,580
so that we can maintain the stability of the imperial city and the peace of the world.

183
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,250
I have two things to do for coming here.

184
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,370
One is to submit the Plough map.

185
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,790
It's just that this matter is very important.

186
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,770
I want to personally hand the precious map to Lord Emperor.

187
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,620
What's the other reason?

188
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,020
The Heaven Fiend King connived with Qi Zhen of Deep Water.

189
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,470
He sent an army to force a throne abdication to King Xuanyuan.

190
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,350
He even framed the crime to Prince Fierce, Zhan Beiye.

191
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,830
The other thing is seeking justice for Prince Fierce, Zhan Beiye.

192
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,210
Prince Fierce dispatching his army beyond our territory without permission has broken the laws of our royal court.

193
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,580
Folian! Who instructed you?

194
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,100
How could you accuse the Heaven Fiend King like that?

195
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,020
Zhan Nancheng wanted to obtain Mt. Great Vast.

196
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,100
Hence, he colluded with Qi Zhen in toppling the Xuanyuan royal son together.

197
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,610
Too bad, Qi Zhen left defeated.

198
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:07,890
Zhan Nancheng's plan ended in vain,

199
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,390
yet he didn't forget to blame the fault on Zhan Beiye.

200
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:18,420
Prince Eternal, were all my words true?

201
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,170
You... A bunch of lies!

202
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,580
Your Highness, I don't know where Princess Folian heard these evil rumors. This—

203
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,700
Hey, today is the moment that the Five Regions should unite.

204
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,210
This concerns the welfare of millions of citizens of this world.

205
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,970
Let's temporarily not discuss the different nation's state and personal affairs, cooperation and fights.

206
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,770
Not discuss? What's the use of the Megrez Imperial Ciry then?

207
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,540
Your words are disrespectful.

208
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,730
The Five Regions World has been divided into the Megrez Imperial City and the other vassal nations to begin with.

209
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,570
Wasn't the reason that the Megrez Imperial City is above all the other nations

210
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,090
to mediate fights and give the citizens

211
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,750
a peaceful and secured state?

212
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,070
If the royal family taking up arms and deliberately inciting a war is just personal matters,

213
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,800
what then counts as a major thing?

214
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,670
What then counts as a world matter that the Megrez Imperial City should intervene?

215
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,860
Lord Emperor once made a decree that the citizens take priority,

216
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,060
the nation takes priority.

217
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,530
The world now just considers the rich and noble as its citizens,

218
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,180
the most friendless and despicable as its ruler.

219
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,690
If we just ignore the collusion between the Heaven Fiend King and a treacherous minister,

220
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,580
he using it to frame his royal brother,

221
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,200
isn't that ignoring the possibility of a war starting in the Five Regions anytime from now?

222
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,170
That is giving free rein on that muddled king that trampled on human lives and brings great suffering to the citizens!

223
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,260
Does the Megrez Imperial City not meddle on such matters, either?

224
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,970
You are indeed the Saintess of Five Regions. Very concerned about the world.

225
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,230
Your chest is full of the citizens of my Five Regions.

226
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,050
Princess Folian is indeed eloquent.

227
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,120
I just have one thing I don't understand.

228
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,020
You and Prince Fierce don't have any interaction.

229
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,660
How come you suddenly became his lobbyist?

230
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,080
Is Princess Folian giving up the Crown Princess position of Megrez

231
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,730
and instead desires to be the Consort of our Prince Fierce?

232
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,790
Your Highness Prince Eternal,

233
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,270
marital alliance between nations must be decided by the Megrez Imperial City.

234
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,400
The wedding of Crown Prince Wuji shouldn't be joked about.

235
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,890
For the things that I've said,

236
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,150
it's not for Prince Fierce nor to target anyone.

237
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,840
I only know that grievances should be told.

238
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,990
May the Megrez Imperial City give me justice.

239
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,570
- This matter—
- Let's end this matter here.

240
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,970
This... This is a a silk from the spiritual tree.

241
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:26,200
There is only one person in this world that was given such special treatment to enjoy clothing made from this.

242
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,010
But tonight,

243
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:34,700
I gave sleeping wear made from the silk of the spiritual tree to Folian.

244
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,670
Mediating the different nations is indeed a major matter to ensure peace.

245
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:50,500
But right now, the merging of the powers of the Five Regions concerns life and death.

246
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,230
Folian, no matter for whom you want to seek justice for,

247
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,100
bring out the Plough map first to aggregate the power of the Five Regions

248
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,320
and then we'll continue to talk about them.

249
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,460
I want to personally submit this Plough map to Lord Emperor.

250
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,260
Oh?

251
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,310
Your Highness, you have an important guest.

252
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm not seeing anyone.

253
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,310
Do you not see me, either?

254
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,980
These are all citizens that are the blood channels of the Five Regions.

255
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,390
Is there any difference between the emperor or the empress?

256
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,270
Princess Folian, you kept making up excuses and concealing things.

257
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,680
Could it be that the Plough map is not with you?

258
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,130
I will submit the Plough map now.

259
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:41,090
This Plough Map has the effect of aggregating the magical powers of the Five Regions.

260
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:46,960
Logically speaking, these five mythical powers should have been merged into one.

261
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,700
But how come they are this divided?

262
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,780
Could it be this Plough Map is fake?

263
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:58,230
Or that...

264
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,780
your identity as Princess Folian is also fake?

265
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,130
Empress, I have something to report!

266
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,070
The Queen Heir of Plough, Folian, is here!

267
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:52,540
I, Folian the Queen Heir of Plough, bring the Plough Map to be offered to the Imperial city.

268
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,120
I wish that the seas and rivers be calm.

269
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,620
The weather be good and the harvest abundant.

270
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,250
Older Sister!

271
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,680
Older Sister, you've recovered from your illness?

272
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,510
When did you enter the city? Why didn't you tell me?

273
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,560
You are?

274
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,610
Looking at how you're clothed, you must be from our Plough, too.

275
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,140
Don't you recognize me?

276
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,910
I have never seen you, so how could I recognize you?

277
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,290
That's strange.

278
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:37,670
There are two Queen Heirs of Plough that suddenly appeared.

279
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,890
Princess Folian is indeed well-known,

280
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,540
but for someone to disguise as her,

281
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,240
this is really unexpected.

282
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,900
- She's fake!
- You—

283
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,420
My princess set up medical tents outside the city to save the refugees.

284
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,820
Because of this benevolent heart, she got delayed in entering the city.

285
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,730
She rushed to come here in time for the grand ceremony.

286
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:03,600
How come there's suddenly a fake one here?

287
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,970
Really?

288
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,790
That's right.

289
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,450
I am indeed not some Princess Folian.

290
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,460
A few days ago, outside the city, I saw this Princess Folian.

291
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,200
She was treating the refugees of that epidemic.

292
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,400
She did look like a saintess.

293
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,030
But afterwards, she fell ill and claimed to have contracted the epidemic.

294
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,240
When she was lying on her bed,

295
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,050
she insisted to give me the Purple Phoenix badge and the Plough map and

296
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,220
asked me to give them to the emperor of Megrez.

297
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,100
Seeing that she was ill and bed-ridden,

298
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,490
I then agreed to her request.

299
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,940
Miss, you must have gotten it wrong.

300
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,660
- I never contracted the epidemic.
- Your—

301
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,910
It's impossible for me to contract the epidemic.

302
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:08,230
Everyone knows that our Plough royal family has a secret Phoenix Soluble Elixir passed from generations.

303
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,590
All royal descendants will take it in upon birth.

304
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,020
With an elixir like that, you won't get poisoned or sick.

305
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,040
I am the Queen Heir of Plough.

306
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,310
How can then I get infected by such an illness?

307
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:25,950
Indeed. I've long heard that this elixir of the Plough royal family has magical effects.

308
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:32,070
If she's really the Queen Heir of Plough, she won't get harmed by just a measly epidemic.

309
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,670
You come over here!

310
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,250
Yesterday, when I entered Cool Mist Palace, you're the one who escorted me there.

311
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,940
Isn't that right?

312
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,690
You have to testify for me.

313
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,420
She's just a lowly maidservant.

314
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,140
The person you're disguised as is me.

315
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,760
- Why must you make it difficult for her?
- You—

316
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,400
Yesterday, it was Prince Assist who fetched me to go into the palace.

317
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,350
I met with Empress Yuan in Cool Mist Palace.

318
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,590
Empress Yuan even asked me to stay for the night.

319
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:09,030
For all of these, which is fake?

320
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,110
May Empress Yuan and Prince Assist be my witnesses.

321
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:18,530
Yesterday, I was sick with flu and didn't go out of my house the whole day.

322
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:22,800
Don't even talk about fetching anyone to enter the palace.

323
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,530
When were you in the Cool Miss Palace yesterday?

324
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,660
I've got it now.

325
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,120
You were afraid that I saw you last night.

326
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,390
- That's why, right now, you—
- Men!
- Yes!

327
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:54,040
Arrest this fake woman.

328
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,380
- Kill her as an apology to Princess Folian.
- Yes!

329
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,520
His Majesty has a decree!

330
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,410
His Majesty has a decree.

331
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,870
Summon the Queen Heir of Plough for an audience.

332
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,480
The person that His Majesty is calling for is this one.

333
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,090
Your Majesty.

334
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,160
Rise.

335
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:01,290
If it was just some ordinary person kneeling here in my palace hall,

336
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,650
regardless if they had grievances or not,

337
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,060
they would be at his wits end.

338
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,280
I was only asked by someone to help solve the urgent problem of the Five Regions.

339
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,710
About strongly arguing for Prince Fierce, I am in the right and I have evidence.

340
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,980
May I ask why I must be in fear?

341
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,220
Why would I lose control?

342
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,910
No wonder you two were able to cause such great disturbance in Deep Water.

343
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,640
- Deep Water?
- Yes.

344
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,170
You must have the ability beyond that of Folian.

345
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,130
That's why, he fell in love with you.

346
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:41,210
But Miss, you don't have any Plough royal blood in your body.

347
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,650
How can you be placed at par with the Crown Prince of Megrez?

348
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,440
Crown Prince?

349
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,320
In front of you, he might be called Xuanyuan Min.

350
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,620
Maybe, it's Yuan Zhaoxu.

351
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,530
Or maybe, there's some other names.

352
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:13,930
But here in Megrez, he's the Crown Prince, the future imperial ruler.

353
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:19,190
He only has one name, Zhangsun Wuji.

354
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,530
Zhangsun Wuji?

355
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,650
Whether I'm a trickster or not, we can't be sure.

356
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,650
But you... surely are a fake.

357
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,790
If you want to live, shut your mouth then.

358
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,780
Who on earth are you? Liar!

359
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,000
You'll know when I take off my mask one day.

360
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,540
I didn't tell you this, but I am the Crown Prince of Megrez.

361
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,110
You are the Crown Prince? You—

362
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,900
His aide.

363
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,930
I'm Yuan Zhaoxu.

364
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,860
What I did in Deep Water before was an order from the Crown Prince.

365
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
- But he—
- You must want to know

366
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,330
why he lied to you.

367
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:11,050
Or to put it another way, why he was unwilling to appear in front of you with his real identity.

368
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,680
Is that right?

369
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,160
His Highness Crown Prince is here!

370
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,040
Empress Mother.

371
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,870
Ji'er, you're here.

372
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,590
Crown Prince Wuji, long time no see.

373
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,890
Princess.

374
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:52,040
I am Xuanji Folian.

375
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,740
- Crown Prince—
- The Plough map concerns the life and death of Five Regions.

376
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,540
For Princess Folian to personally come to submit the map

377
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,970
and help resolve the urgent problem of the withering Winged Tree,

378
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,100
I thank you on behalf of the Megrez Imperial City.

379
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,380
This travel of mine isn't just for Five Regions.

380
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,150
It's more for...

381
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,390
for Your Highness Crown Prince.

382
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,530
I also have waited for you for a long time.

383
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,770
He has been spoiled since he was little.

384
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,110
Don't know how many romantic entanglements he has already sent out.

385
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,990
As they say, a young lad doesn't know problems.

386
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:56,230
Hence, he led a loose life.

387
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:02,920
But he surely hurt your heart by doing that.

388
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,640
You are indeed different from other ladies.

389
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,430
He indeed had true feelings for you.

390
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,690
But you must understand

391
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,480
that as a crown prince,

392
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,320
every step he takes is beyond his control.

393
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,280
The marital alliance of a crown prince

394
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,060
concerns the empire and state, concerns the citizens.

395
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:36,500
Hence, he chose Folian.

396
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,750
This choice was made at Plough when he was 16.

397
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,800
Since all the members of the royal family are here today,

398
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,530
why don't we make good use of this good day

399
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:51,870
and make a decree about the marital alliance between Plough and Megrez then promulgate it to the world?

400
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,090
Wuji, you're late.

401
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,940
You have missed one good scene.

402
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,340
Just earlier, there was actually someone who falsely claimed to be the Saintess Folian,

403
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,190
doing tricks to mislead everyone.

404
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,050
Saintess Xuanji Folian is known throughout the world.

405
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,430
It can't be helped for some unappreciative people to try to imitate her.

406
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:13,010
For mischief doers like that, just handle them casually.

407
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,670
You have chosen Folian.

408
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,700
Regarding if he really likes Folian in his heart

409
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,860
or how much he likes Folian,

410
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,930
is it that important?

411
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,150
Based on the education he got when he was little,

412
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:46,630
the marital alliance of a crown prince must put the state and interests first.

413
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:50,760
Between interests and love, he will choose interests,

414
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,900
and this choice is something that he can do without hesitation.

415
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,980
Crown Prince Wuji...

416
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,730
and Princess Folian...

417
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,030
are a pair made in heaven to begin with.

418
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:16,800
And for the crime of you pretending to be Folian

419
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,340
to attach yourself to the Crown Prince,

420
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,620
what punishment should you be given?

421
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,790
I've never thought...

422
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,820
of pretending to be someone...

423
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,960
to attach myself to anyone.

424
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,640
Even if I'm wearing this dress and standing here today,

425
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,280
it's not for some Megrez Crown Prince.

426
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,240
For these past days,

427
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,460
you wore levels and levels of masks...

428
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,990
and lied to me for such a long time.

429
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,570
So much blood has been shed.

430
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,890
Also those pains,

431
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,580
are they all fake?

432
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,700
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

433
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,810
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

434
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,600
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

435
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,670
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

436
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,750
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

437
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,910
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

438
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:21,930
I was just so stupid...

439
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,620
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

440
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,180
♫ Have someone's company ♫

441
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,750
...to trust a person that shouldn't be trusted.

442
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,090
Your mistake was meeting a person that you shouldn't have met

443
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,980
and rendering hope towards him.

444
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:58,620
Why are you telling me these?

445
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:03,390
For the so-called state and empire. For the so-called glory and insult, life and death.

446
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,860
That includes you and me.

447
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,220
Just like how the different materials are gathered inside this stove.

448
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,980
Under fierce fire, using one's effort and time to create a little elixir.

449
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,830
What is it?

450
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,420
Result.

451
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,880
What we all are waiting for...

452
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,180
is just one result.

453
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,560
It's time for Empress to take her medicine.

454
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,100
Yes.

455
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,780
From the looks of it now,

456
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,850
the weakening of the Winged Tree has been cured.

457
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,580
Could there be other kinds of changes?

458
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,310
The power of good and evil has always been mutually waxing and waning.

459
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,910
Now that there are abnormalities on all nations,

460
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:06,330
this kind of evil power must not be your average kind.

461
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,000
I fear that we need all nations to unite to fight it.

462
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,870
Without me saying anything, I'm sure that you all have guessed

463
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:16,910
that this matter has something to do with the item that was sealed after the Firmament Great War.

464
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,920
If this item isn't eliminated, the Winged Tree will never be at peace.

465
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,340
Empress, the immortal elixir for today has been made.

466
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,250
I am not feeling very well today.

467
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:39,430
Just put it down first.

468
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,060
Empress has a weak health.

469
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,310
His Majesty said that you must take this on time.

470
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,250
May Empress not make things difficult for me.

"Window" by Greeny Wu

472
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:09,360
♫ Only because of you, I let the fated life wave goodbye ♫

473
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,620
♫ Also only because of you, it lets me get saved ♫

474
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,740
♫ Wind attracts the other storm to lose control ♫

475
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,840
♫ It mistakenly causes another miss to find no one ♫

476
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:30,000
♫ Roam around the world ♫

477
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,170
♫ Love and hate tease me ♫

478
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:45,030
♫ The hunger of a speeding pulse ♫

479
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,180
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

480
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:55,300
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

481
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,420
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

482
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:07,130
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫

483
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,880
♫ Only because of you, I let the fated life wave goodbye ♫

484
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,070
♫ Also only because of you, it lets me get saved ♫

485
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:33,170
♫ Roam around the world ♫

486
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,300
♫ Love and hate tease me ♫

487
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:48,220
♫ The hunger of a speeding pulse ♫

488
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,360
♫ My shadow drifts along this world ♫

489
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:58,560
♫ Dust vanishes gradually into the skies ♫

490
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,630
♫ My heart changes back and forth that no one understands ♫

491
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:11,010
♫ I'm waiting for you to shine through my window ♫
