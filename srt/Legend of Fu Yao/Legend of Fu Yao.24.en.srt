00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,200
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,400
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,700
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,060
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,400
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,200
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,830
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,700
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:20,000
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,600
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

~ Episode 24 ~

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
Your Majesty, it has to be her who poisoned the wine.

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,200
It has to be her. I'm sure.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,410
Younger Sister, you must have mistaken.

25
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,200
Why would I want to drug you? This—

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,800
Just now, I already asked the maidservant who was serving today.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
A'Xiu said, just before I started performing,

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,980
her personal maidservant went to find a earring or something.

29
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,500
She even used a golden leaf to bribe her.

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,800
She must have poisoned the wine when she wasn't paying attention!

31
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Your Majesty, I am wronged.

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,200
I-I really don't know anything.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Huan'er, tell them what Lady Virtuous has said is true or not.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,700
Tell His Majesty everything you saw today.

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,200
Answer to Your Majesty.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,400
It was true that I lost my Miss' earrings.

37
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
It was also true that I begged Older Sister A'Xiu to go look for earrings with me.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,500
But, Your Majesty, I really didn't poison the wine.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,200
But...

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,500
- But...
- It's all right if you speak it.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,950
Answering to Your Majesty.

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,600
While Older Sister A'Xiu and I were looking for the earrings outside,

43
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,400
we happened to see Lady Fair rush over.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,700
Also, I saw her seem to put something into the wine.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,830
Are you saying I did it?

46
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,400
Do you understand

47
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,400
slandering an imperial consort is a capital offense?

48
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,300
I wouldn't dare.

49
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,540
Don't say anymore, Huan'er!

50
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,930
Your Majesty!

51
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,600
This is all my fault.

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Your Majesty, just punish me alone then.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,770
Miss, you didn't do anything wrong.

54
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,200
I saw with my own eyes.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, Lady Fair still has a wine stain on her clothes.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I don't dare lie.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm willing to be struck by lightning and die if I lie.

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,100
Your Majesty!

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,340
Your Majesty,

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,400
just now,

61
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I did spill the wine bottle and touched it.

62
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,600
There are some wine stains on my dress.

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,300
But this kind of despicable thing to drug someone,

64
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,200
I would never do it.

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,860
Your Majesty, it must be that the two of them joined hands to drug me.

66
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,000
Those two joined hands to do it together.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,100
Lady Virtuous is so interesting.

68
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,200
If it's the two of them working together to drug you, then you'll surely be the queen.

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,400
You... talk rot.

70
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
I'll say if Lady Fair and Lady Precious are under suspicion,

71
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
you, Lady Virtuous, are not above suspicion, either.

72
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,600
Why would I drug myself?

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,400
I already mentioned the reason just now.

74
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,000
Your Majesty, she is talking rot.

75
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,400
What Lady Virtue says does make sense.

76
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,830
Therefore, this case of drugging someone has become

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,600
a mystery case without clues. Right?

78
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,200
How about we discuss it another day?

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
No way!

80
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,100
Your Majesty,

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,400
if you want to find the truth, I have a method.

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,800
We can use the Lustrous Mirror.

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,200
- The Lustrous Mirror?
- Yes.

84
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,900
Your Majesty, the Lustrous Mirror can reflect the past of anything.

85
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,300
It can be twelve seasons, twelve years.

86
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,200
Also, it can be the last twenty-four hours or even 12 incense time.

87
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,000
It just depends on what object is used for a time reference.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
The book did not specify the procedures needed

89
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
if we were to look back at events from 2 hours ago

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,500
using the Lustrous Mirror.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,200
Cicadas.

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Your Majesty, cicadas.

93
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,700
In order to use the Lustrous Mirrors, I specifically asked many people to research some old books.

94
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,500
The ancient book stated that cicadas only have a life span of 12 hours.

95
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,600
If we put it in front of the Lustrous Mirrors,

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,300
then who had seen unlawful things will be exposed completely.

97
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
But even so...

98
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,430
where would we find this cicada now?

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,200
This is the first time I've heard of this weird insect.

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,600
Your Majesty, I have some.

101
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Your Majesty, I have cicadas.

102
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Official Chen,

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,000
what-what a coincidence.

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Your Majesty, I enjoy keeping insects.

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,000
The sound of the cicadas really is so pleasant and moving,

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,700
so every day I have the servants go deep into the forest to catch them.

107
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,800
I carry them with me every day.

108
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,600
I hereby request Your Majesty, without delay, to use these cicadas to reveal and capture the culprit!

109
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,100
Check it. Hurry.

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,100
Your Majesty, I am willing to try it first to prove my innocence.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,600
Go.

112
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Your Majesty, Ru'er didn't poison herself.

113
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
We have seen it very clearly in these Lustrous Mirrors.

114
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,500
Prince, you're overthinking it.

115
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,300
I've said before that Lady Virtuous will not do such a thing.

116
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Okay. Okay. I have tried it.

117
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,300
Does Lady Precious or Lady Fair want to be the next?

118
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
Your Majesty, I think rather than have Lady Precious try it,

119
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,700
it is most suitable to have her servant, Huan'er try it next.

120
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,900
Your Majesty, this—

121
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,600
Wouldn't it make more sense for Lady Fair to do it next if we were to go by ranks?

122
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,100
It's not too late to have Huan'er go after Lady Fair has proven her innocence.

123
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,820
Although this Face Changing Technique has the power to confuse one's wisdom so they no longer recognize your true face,

124
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,500
you must avoid mirrors

125
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,500
because the reflection of a mirror always reveals one's true appearance.

126
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,490
Does Lady Fair have a guilty conscience?

127
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,170
Oh!

128
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,630
Yuan Bao! Yuan Bao!

129
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,540
Yuan Bao! Someone.

130
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,480
Someone help me catch him!

131
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,320
Hurry up!

132
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,530
- Here! Here!
- Over there.

133
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,120
The Lustrous Mirrors! Not my Lustrous Mirrors!

134
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,550
- Don't... Don't... Don't trample on him!
- Your Majesty,

135
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,850
please keep calm.

136
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,080
- Yuan Ban! Someone come here!
- Your Majesty, please keep calm down.

137
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,310
What do you mean keep calm?

138
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,360
Outrageous!

139
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,830
Don’t do this! Here!

140
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,810
Lustrous Mirrors! My Lustrous Mirrors!

141
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,700
Hurry up!

142
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,820
How could this happen?

143
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,010
- Arrest her!
- Yes.

144
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,180
Your Majesty, why are you arresting me?

145
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,580
If you didn't disturb my beloved pet, would the Lustrous Mirrors have broken?

146
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,640
Even if the poisoning incident wasn't your doing today,

147
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,560
you still can't rid yourself from the blame of breaking the palace’s treasure.

148
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,950
Guards! Arrest Yuwen Zi!

149
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,310
Imprison her to Dense Beam Palace Hall!

150
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,610
No one shall be allowed to release her without my permission.

151
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,490
Your Majesty, I am innocent!

152
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,200
Take her away. Take her away!

153
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,570
I won't let you do this.

154
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,430
Your Majesty, today's task of choosing the Queen—

155
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,220
Choosing the Queen?

156
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,180
Such a thing happened today, and you still want me to choose the Queen?

157
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,520
Then tell me, who should I choose to be the Queen?

158
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,530
Your Majesty has a keen intelligence and excellent judgment.

159
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,530
Choosing the Queen of Deep Water is a serious matter.

160
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,470
It's not good to act hastily.

161
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,630
We'll be going to Forever Water to worship ancestors tomorrow.

162
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,110
Your Majesty also can use the time to weigh out his options.

163
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,540
After returning from worshiping ancestors, it will not be too late to make the decision then.

164
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,120
Prime Minister has spoken reasonably.

165
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,660
All dismissed!

166
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,660
Respectfully see Your Majesty off.

167
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,930
Do you know what sin it is for not listening to orders and making a move without permission?

168
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,120
Please punish me, Mister.

169
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,680
Originally, I actually wanted to severely punish you.

170
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,670
But once I saw Fuyao, my anger couldn't rise anymore.

171
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,770
You'll owe me a punishment for now.

172
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,090
Let me tell you. Worshiping ancestors in Forever Water will need three days.

173
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,380
Help me take good care of her in these few days.

174
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,690
You will be blamed if something happens to her again.

175
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,000
So, do you mean that you punished her to stay in Dense Beam Palace Hall in order to protect her?

176
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,300
It’s also to make Qi Zhen to send her to my side as early as possible.

177
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,310
Just for a lowly slave, don't you even want your life anymore?

178
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,870
It's such a waste for your dedication and infatuation towards her.

179
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:19,390
It's a pity that she's long been sleeping in His Majesty's palace.

180
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,770
She’s already Deep Water King’s woman.

181
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,450
Do you want to silence me?

182
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,450
Don’t force me.

183
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,720
It’s not even hot today.

184
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,690
Why are you sweating so much?

185
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,990
Don’t be crazy.

186
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,160
Crazy?

187
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,040
You’re the one who’s crazy.

188
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,860
It’s always been you.

189
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,450
It's Yan Jingchen.

190
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,460
What evil spell did you... cast on me?

191
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,080
How could I possibly cast an evil spell on my husband?

192
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,670
I just wanted to help you wipe your sweat.

193
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:48,930
Coincidentally, this handkerchief has been dipped in Bewildering Herb.

194
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,490
Have you always been guarding against me?

195
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,950
The one I’m guarding against... is that slut.

196
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,750
You—

197
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,990
How could I possibly harm you?

198
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:23,140
I know you don’t like Pei Yuan, especially after her face was ruined.

199
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,550
She was immature originally but she’s evil now.

200
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,960
I know you will suffer from marrying this kind of girl.

201
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,130
But you have to endure this.

202
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,570
You have to endure until the time is right.

203
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,360
The relationship between people is just for mutual usage.

204
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,220
You married her because of her mother’s family’s power.

205
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,960
Once your position in the capital is stable,

206
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,060
with Pei Yuan’s personality, she will only cause troubles in the future. She will never be able to help you.

207
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,860
By then, this Spirit Breaker Powder will help you.

208
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,430
- Father wants me to—
- Just remember one thing,

209
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,760
you have to be careful of everything.

210
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,670
Once you use this item, you must find a scapegoat.

211
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,880
If people don’t suspect you,

212
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,650
her death will bring you everyone’s pity,

213
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:19,280
and this pity will give you more opportunities.

214
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,800
How could I possibly harm you?

215
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,280
I really didn’t put the drugs in.

216
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,500
You don’t have to hold me like this.

217
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,920
I can walk on my own.

218
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,170
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

219
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,290
It hurts. Don’t drag me.

220
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,120
Slow down, please.

221
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,470
The king has an oral decree for Lady Fair.

222
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,130
Please leave.

223
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,680
That scared me.

224
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,180
Miss, you understand Mister’s intention. Right?

225
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,630
If your Mister had released the stupid rat a second later,

226
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,910
I would have been in big trouble.

227
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,190
Help me to thank your Mister.

228
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,050
Lady, you excel in wisdom.

229
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,720
Oh, right. Mister wants to go to Forever Water to worship for these few days.

230
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,200
So, he will not be in the palace.

231
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,360
You may have to suffer for a few days.

232
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,850
But why Dense Beam Palace Hall?

233
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Mister said, as long as you keep this purse on you,

234
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,420
Dense Beam Palace Hall will be the safest place in the palace.

235
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:35,200
[Dense Beam Palace Hall]

236
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,460
Lady Fair, Dense Beam Palace Hall is a part of the Limbo Palace.

237
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,500
If we step any further, I'm afraid we'll violate the rules.

238
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,970
You... just go in by yourself.

239
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,030
Pei Yuan!

240
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,800
What are you doing?

241
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Hurry up and release me.

242
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,200
What's the rush?

243
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:47,450
A’Lie, bring the thing here.

244
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,920
Spirit Breaker Powder, does that sound familiar to you, Husband?

245
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,670
This was a powerful poison given to you personally by the Clique Leader himself

246
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,390
so you could poison me when you had the chance.

247
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,950
So you've always known?

248
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,310
But I never used it on you after all.

249
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,650
That is why you've had the chance to live until now.

250
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,120
I had originally thought that

251
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,000
your non-action meant that you still had me in your heart.

252
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,610
It looks like I've thought wrong.

253
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,920
As long as this lowly slave doesn’t die,

254
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,950
it will never be possible for you to love me with all your heart.

255
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,510
I don't know what nonsense you are talking about.

256
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,000
Look who I have here.

257
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,020
Fuyao! Fuyao!

258
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,160
You! What did you do to her?

259
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,620
Your calling really makes one heartbroken.

260
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,510
What’s the matter?

261
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,090
Doctor Zong from the manor said I got an epidemic disease from the Hunting Field.

262
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,780
Once we get in contact, the disease will be passed to you.

263
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,550
I’m afraid that Prime Minister...

264
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:56,680
and my face is ugly with a birthmark on my face.

265
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,910
I’m afraid that it will shock you.

266
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,980
How can a person have two faces?

267
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,440
It’s not even the usual Face Changing Technique.

268
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,510
That face looks familiar.

269
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,930
Or did I see it wrong?

270
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,120
Wei Chuan!

271
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,780
Here.

272
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,680
Old Master.

273
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,020
Is there anyone left in Yuwen Zi's family in Changning Manor?

274
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,680
Older Master, after Yuwen Zi entered the palace, we have followed your instructions

275
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,360
to kill everyone in Changning Manor secretly.

276
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,650
How could there be any more family now?

277
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,980
That's true.

278
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,520
Back then, I feared that once Yuwen Zi obtained authority,

279
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:53,000
Changning Manor brings up unnecessary ramifications and causes me problems.

280
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,290
Now, it's just perfect. The dead cannot testify.

281
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,790
- Wei Chuang.
- Yes?

282
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,870
I need you to personally take care of something.

283
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,400
Yes.

284
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,580
Stop! It's all my fault.

285
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,300
Is your heart aching for her?

286
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,480
Then she deserves even more to die!

287
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,860
This is all my fault.

288
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,040
Don't kill her!

289
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,190
Stop!

290
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:34,220
I was wondering why I couldn't sleep tight.

291
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,230
It turns out there are a bunch of people who I don't want to see.

292
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,100
Don't fight it.

293
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,070
I already had you drink Scatterbrain Powder.

294
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,410
No matter how skilled you are in martial arts, you don't have any strength left.

295
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:51,480
Senior Sister, don't you want to duel with me in a fair match?

296
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,210
A fair match?

297
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,410
A person like you does not deserve to talk about fairness.

298
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,990
Do you remember this sword?

299
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,660
You used this sword to ruin my life.

300
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,190
You ruined my husband and me!

301
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,730
Pei Yuan! Pei Yuan, listen to me!

302
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,540
Quit speaking for this slut, or I'll kill her now.

303
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,840
Then why don't you just end me now and quickly be done with it?

304
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,030
Quickly be done with it?

305
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,640
I wanted to have revenge even in my dreams.

306
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,140
Do you think I will let you die a quick death?

307
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:49,100
I want you to suffer as much as I do.

308
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:54,340
No, I want you to suffer more than I do.

309
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:00,510
Even to this day, do you still not know who did this to your face?

310
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Forget it.

311
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,760
I was careless today.

312
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,630
What does Senior Sister want to do to me?

313
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,000
Do you also want to screw with my face?

314
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:19,650
A while ago, that was exactly what I was thinking,

315
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,370
but I have changed my mind.

316
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,090
Let's play something more exciting.

317
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:31,310
Only one of you will be allowed to live today.

318
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:36,700
Do you want to drink this Spirit Breaker Powder, or

319
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,550
do you want this slut to drink it?

320
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,480
Pei Yuan, why are you doing this?

321
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,600
Surely it doesn't mean that you want to die for her, does it?

322
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,200
I...

323
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,780
Pei Yuan, I was wrong.

324
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,030
I know I was wrong.

325
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,720
Before-Before, I didn't understand.

326
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,400
But now I'm clear.

327
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,760
In this world, only you treat me wholeheartedly.

328
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,180
I... Let us live our days well.

329
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,210
I will not disappoint you from now on. Pei Yuan...

330
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:24,930
Sure, then you kill her right now.

331
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:49,600
All right, I'll kill her.

332
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,160
I will kill...

333
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,420
I will kill her.

334
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,550
I'll be watching here.

335
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,810
Don't you dare play any tricks.

336
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,250
I'm sorry.

337
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,890
I'm sorry.

338
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,240
I didn't know why things turn out like this.

339
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,550
Fuyao, you hurry up and run. Hurry up and run!

340
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,470
Do you think she can get out of this house?

341
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,180
Fine.

342
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,200
Since someone has to die,

343
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,520
I'll die.

344
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,480
No!

345
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,510
First Senior Brother!

346
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,060
Can you spare Fuyao's life with my death?

347
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,530
First Senior Brother.

348
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,190
First Senior Brother!

349
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,740
Fuyao, hurry up and run now! Run quickly.

350
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:01,350
I beg you, Yuan'er. Please, please just let it go. Okay?

351
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,190
Let go of this grudge.

352
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,590
Yuan'er.

353
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,760
You would rather die than to hurt her.

354
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,140
Why are you so stupid?

355
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:30,030
Do you know the consequences of your action?

356
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,920
Why is it so hard for you to just love me?

357
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,010
Let it go, Pei Yuan.

358
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:42,000
Senior Brother.

359
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,880
I can't let it go.

360
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,200
I can't let it go!

361
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,220
I am going to kill you.

362
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,640
A'Lie...

363
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,020
Your face was ruined by me.

364
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,640
Why?

365
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,830
Why?

366
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:49,520
Because you've never thought of me as a human being.

367
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,300
I grew up with you since childhood and took care of you wholeheartedly.

368
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,220
But how about you?

369
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:02,790
You treat me worse than a dog.

370
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:08,660
You deserve all of this.

371
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:21,000
And all of you, do you think I am helping you?

372
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:27,040
I hate... I hate every one of you.

373
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,780
I want all of you die! All die.

374
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,300
No! Fuyao!

375
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,690
Pei Yuan!

376
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,970
First Senior Brother.

377
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,990
I hate you.

378
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,190
First Senior Brother.

379
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,000
Fuyao,

380
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,450
do you know?

381
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:38,230
The-The toxicity of this Intoxicative Begonia is very special.

382
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:44,920
It can make people’s hearts freeze to death.

383
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,840
Today, I’m

384
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,040
dying beside you.

385
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:01,340
My heart will be frozen then.

386
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:09,550
In the future, I’ll will only remember-remember you.

387
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,020
Fuyao,

388
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:22,880
to be able to hear you call me First Senior Brother once more is really great.

389
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,180
My whole life, I've just been making mistakes.

390
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:35,020
There is one thing I didn't do wrong,

391
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,020
which was loving you.

392
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,820
Forever loving you.

393
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,590
If...

394
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,870
If we’re...

395
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,570
able to return to Mt. Mystic Soul again,

396
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,400
how great would that be.

397
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:12,300
♫ What do you know? ♫

398
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,310
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

399

♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360

428
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,930
First Senior Brother! First Senior Brother.

429
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,650
[Prime Minister's Manor]

430
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,160
Yun’er.

431
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,760
Yun’er.

432
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,820
Wait a minute. Look!

433
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,830
Are you asking to be hit?

434
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,060
Your martial arts have improved a lot in three years.

435
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:10,230
But you still lack experience.

436
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,130
Just now, when you gave the move of Incoming Crane Clearing,

437
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,530
I quickly blocked you with a backhand flip.

438
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:16,070
You should use Take Moon Remove Flower Move then.

439
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,030
This way, left hand to move my hand and right hand to sock a punch.

440
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,190
No matter who it is, that person has no strength to fight back.

441
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,260
And then, wouldn't you be the winner?

442
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,570
Don’t cry.

443
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,770
I know why you’re angry.

444
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,970
You’re angry that I didn’t let you run away that day.

445
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:35,040
You’re angry that I brought you back, right?

446
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,540
I did those for your own good.

447
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,490
For my own good?

448
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,770
If you’re doing it for my own good, you shouldn’t have tied me up and brought me back.

449
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:48,990
I ran away. I ran away because l'm tired of living this predictably mundane life.

450
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,510
Staying in this Prime Minister’s Manor,

451
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,150
I need to do everything the way my father has planned.

452
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:57,860
It's all up to what he wants and likes.

453
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,490
It's not fair.

454
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:02,060
If I hadn't gone out and seen the world myself,

455
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,130
then it wouldn't be so bad since I didn't know the new things in the outside world.

456
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:12,650
But now, I really admire and envy the sons and daughters of a commoner.

457
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,820
They can live their lives as they want.

458
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,910
They can live every day the way they want.

459
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:21,360
That's because your personality has become too wild.

460
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:24,330
- Godfather.
- You don’t know your father’s heart.

461
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,930
Godfather, actually—

462
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,650
No more crying. Okay?

463
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,830
Yun’er, you have been weak and sick since young.

464
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:44,210
You wouldn't have been able to survive if no one had looked after you.

465
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,720
Father sent you to school to learn some skills.

466
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:50,880
Unexpectedly, this sending away has now brought upon myself resentment from you.

467
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,400
Your temperament not only has gone wild,

468
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,520
you even light the fires and cook the food in the kitchen as lowly servants.

469
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,220
Calling them lowly servants? Then why don't you not eat!

470
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,620
The kitchen is full of grease and ash.

471
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:05,120
How is it an appropriate place for a delicate wealthy lady from a noble family like you to be in? Where is your decorum?

472
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,630
I just have no decorum.

473
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,230
I just like to stay there.

474
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,830
Not only will I stay by the stove, I will also invite all those lowly servants whom you mentioned to come and eat my food.

475
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,140
However many come, however many I will serve!

476
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,260
Are you talking back to your father now?

477
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,780
Why have you become like this?

478
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,830
Do you believe that I’ll—

479
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,220
Hit me! Hit me!

480
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,220
You only know how to scold me and discipline me.

481
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,250
You won't let me do anything!

482
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,080
I live just to be a dog to you!

483
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,470
Since it's like this, I would rather I had died when I was young!

484
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,630
Do you see that living like this is even worse than being a dead person?

485
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,550
Yun'er! Yun'er, where are you going? Yun'er!

486
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,950
- Yun'er!
- Yun'er

487
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,930
- Go and call Mr. Zong!
- Yes.

488
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,670
Yun’er. Yun’er.

489
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,560
Mr. Zong, please.

490
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,410
Medical Sage Zong, I only have one daughter.

491
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,150
Save her please.

492
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,730
I'll do my best.

493
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,720
Since childhood, Miss has been living with a serious illness.

494
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,490
This isn't the first time she is at death's door.

495
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,950
Am I right?

496
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,810
Her being able to survive to today is definitely not just by human strength.

497
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,620
There is definitely a mythic artifact protecting her, right?

498
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,310
Regardless of how strong the mythic artifact is, it's still something outward.

499
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,870
Her life can be preserved but the cause of disease is hard to be cured.

500
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,080
This is a relapse of an old illness.

501
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,440
I'm afraid that it may even be more severe.

502
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,580
Sir, please do your best.

503
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,150
I'll be eternally grateful.

504
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,070
You're too polite, Prime Minister.

505
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,910
It'll be best to have no disturbances during treatment.

506
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,990
Please wait outside.

507
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,960
Of course.

508
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,510
Sir, Yun'er is a good girl.

509
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,150
Please take the utmost care to treat her.

510
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,720
Leave.

511

"Hard-to-Get Love" by Lala Hsu

512
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,620
♫ What do you know? ♫

513
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,670
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

514
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,480
♫ If there were no three poisons, if there were no worries ♫

515
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,710
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

516
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,310
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

517
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,240
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

518
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,330
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

519
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:51,690
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

520
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:58,830
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

521
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:02,690
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness  ♫

522
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,870
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

523
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,430
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

524
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:13,350
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

525
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,540
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

526
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:22,330
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

527
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,020
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

528
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,280
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

529
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,060
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

530
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:39,050
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

531
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:42,160
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime ♫

532
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,400
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

533
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,380
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

534
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,060
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

535
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,690
♫ Have someone's company♫

536
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:59,810
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

537
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:05,060
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

538
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,860
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for  ♫

539
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,860
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

540

♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

541

♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫
