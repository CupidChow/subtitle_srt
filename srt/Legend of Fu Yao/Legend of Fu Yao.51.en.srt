00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:12,340
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,470
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:22,650
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,980
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,060
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:40,250
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,520
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,640
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,710
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,250
~ Episode 51 ~

22
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,530
I've given my everything to Palace Leader Fei Yan

23
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,260
just to have her to give me this power to use at this moment.

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,370
If you want to kill someone, kill me first.

25
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,580
Don't rush. I'll do it by seniority.

26
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,260
Yun'er...!

27
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,140
Yun'er... Let me see...

28
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:52,160
Father, we were the ones who did wrong.

29
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,010
Just use my life to pay for it.

30
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,450
How could this be... ?

31
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,800
Where's the Dragon Scale Armor that I gave you?

32
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,760
Nothing in this world can hurt you.

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,630
This isn't... This isn't true! Right? Yun'er...

34
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,540
- It will be all right.
- Father, when will all the grudges end?

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,480
Stop already.

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,870
Yun'er, you're such a silly child.

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,100
I'm doing all this just for you.

38
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,850
I staked everything and endured humiliation to beg Palace Leader Fei Yan

39
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,260
so that before I die,

40
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,390
I can kill all our enemies

41
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,730
and let you live a peaceful and comfortable life from now on.

42
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,530
I did all this just for you!

43
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,190
Do you know that, child?

44
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,770
Don't be afraid.

45
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,930
Father,

46
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,320
I don't need you to do these.

47
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,080
I really love you.

48
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,550
If my death can resolve the grudges between all of you,

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,260
then I... will be able to rest in peace.

50
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,130
Yun...Yun'er!

51
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,650
Yun'er...

52
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,070
Don't be afraid.

53
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,620
You will be home soon.

54
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't be afraid.

55
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,350
If not because of you two, she would not die.

56
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm going to make you two pay today.

57
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,730
Yun'er...

58
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,220
Yun'er, why were you that silly?

59
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,210
Yun'er gave you the Dragon Scale Armor?

60
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,640
Why?

61
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,420
I'm not worthy for you to do this.

62
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,390
After persisting for so many years,

63
00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:04,360
I have nothing in the end.

64
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,460
Fine then.

65
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,780
Godfather...

66
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,460
All right.

67
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,330
Giddyup!

68
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,340
Your Majesty.

69
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,460
What did Crown Prince Wuji say?

70
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,410
Replying to Your Majesty.

71
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,920
I told Crown Prince Wuji about this matter.

72
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,550
Crown Prince Wuji said that he doesn't want to lend us any army

73
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,760
because he still bears a grudge against you for standing with Prince Assist

74
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,380
- and stealing me from him.
- No.

75
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,190
I got fooled by that Zhangsun Pingrong before.

76
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,270
It's not my fault.

77
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,660
I know.

78
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,650
For Your Majesty, this 100,000 army will greatly affect the outcome of this battle.

79
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,230
No matter what, we must borrow it. Hence...

80
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,090
Hence... I decided on my own

81
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:02,020
and agreed with Crown Prince Wuji's request.

82
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,600
What does he want?

83
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,690
Crown Prince Wuji just wanted some prestige.

84
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:20,140
Although Crown Prince Wuji is extremely intelligent, he has liked doing grandiose things since he was little.

85
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,470
He said that if he's able to help us pacify this uprising,

86
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,760
can we put all the merit on him?

87
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,780
This way, he'll be able to claim this achievement in front of Lord Emperor.

88
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,400
And I was wondering what could he be asking?

89
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,330
Isn't that all just empty fame? That's easy.

90
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,910
But...

91
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,220
But Lord Emperor isn't that easy to fool.

92
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,730
Hence,

93
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,890
what Crown Prince Wuji means is that after this matter is over,

94
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:58,430
is it possible for him to temporarily command all the army inside the city, regardless of what camp they are

95
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:00,990
so he can brag about it?

96
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,520
Handing so much military power to him...

97
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,290
What if he suddenly develops some motive?

98
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,600
Your Majesty, don't worry.

99
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,320
I've prepared a backup move.

100
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,510
In this battle, all the commanding seals and tallies will be kept by me.

101
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:22,360
By then, no matter how Crown Prince Wuji brags about his awe-inspiring authority, it's just all talk.

102
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,070
All the commanding tallies are with me, which means they are with you.

103
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,320
This is then a foolproof plan.

104
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,180
Your Majesty, I heard that all the rare treasures in this world are kept in Chant Frost Watchtower.

105
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,260
If Prince Fierce really charged into here at this time and converted all those to military provisions,

106
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,200
what should we do then?

107
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,060
Your Majesty!

108
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,090
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

109
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,900
Your Majesty, they have reached Peace Pavilion.

110
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,320
They are just less than 50 li in the west from us.

111
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,160
Prince Fierce's force was so invincible and the citizens easily submitted to him.

112
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,520
May Your Majesty quickly decide.

113
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,820
Okay. Okay.

114
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,790
Immediately go see Crown Prince Wuji and tell him that as long as he helps me preserve Heaven Fiend and my throne,

115
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,740
I will agree to any conditions of his!

116
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,300
Yes.

117
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,950
Older Brother, are you really unable to save her?

118
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,110
You are the Medical Sage... !

119
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,750
Older Brother, I beg you.

120
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:47,570
What Qi Zhen stabbed in her body is the lethal bone dissolving poison.

121
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,830
I'm unable to save her.

122
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,970
I'm unable to save her.

123
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:07,120
Maybe, the sinner... isn't just Qi Zhen.

124
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:14,560
Just to seek revenge... I schemed and moved methodically.

125
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,700
I never considered your feelings at all.

126
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,640
I forced you to kill your godfather.

127
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,130
I clearly knew that Yun'er was sincere towards me.

128
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,750
I clearly knew that if I give up on my revenge,

129
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,560
all this would never happen.

130
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,640
It's me.

131
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,140
It's me.

132
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,960
It's me who brought her harm.

133
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,030
It's me who pushed her to desperate straits, step-by-step.

134
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,250
I'm the sinner.

135
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,940
It's my fault for realizing it too late.

136
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,750
Sorry.

137
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,850
Sorry.

138
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,540
Sorry.

139
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,680
I was still late.

140
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,060
Zong Yue.

141
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,170
This is the last Herding Spirit Fruit.

142
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:53,570
If this doesn't work either, I then can't do anything anymore even if I wanted to help.

143
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,270
Hurry!

144
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,510
She's alive. She is still alive.

145
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,870
Palace Leader Fei Yan's poison isn't that easy to cure.

146
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,740
She's just holding on to her last breath.

147
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,310
If we want her to survive, I'm going to take her to look for another way.

I'm going to take her to search for a way to survive.

151
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,250
It might be for a month, a year, or a lifetime.

152
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,710
As long as there is a glimmer of hope, I won't give up.

153
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,570
As for you, after going through all this,

154
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,640
I think you now know how to be a king.

155
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,960
You should have learned how to choose and give up,

156
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,800
how to discern people's intentions.

157
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,290
You have to walk down your path by yourself.

158
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:56,070
I can only help you until here.

159
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,460
Take care.

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,980

Don't come near me!

165
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,800
Older Brother Yue, who told you to bully me?

166
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,380
Don't come near.

167
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,170
Older Brother Yue, you're so mean.

168
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,320
In the future, I will finish all the best food in Capital Kun.

169
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,150
I won't leave you any.

I seemed to have seen you somewhere else.

172

You seem like an old friend... an old friend that I haven't seen for a long time.

173
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,090
I just knew that I was right.

174
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,860
Older Brother Yue, you are Older Brother Yue. Right?

175
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,950
It's not important who I am.

176
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:00,260
What's important is that your father...

177
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,880
is my enemy.

178

♫ My heart isn't an isolated island ♫

179

My father committed a mistake.

180
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,340
Rather than bearing a grudge against him, why don't you just let me make up for his mistakes?

181
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,350
I can't bear to let you live in revenge every day.

♫ Is the remedy for heart ♫

184
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,330
Crown Prince Wuji is unrivaled in courage and might.

185
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,750
I feel very fortunate that you agreed to lead your army to pacify this uprising.

186
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,610
Heaven Fiend thanks you for providing us help.

187
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,150
We had an agreement beforehand.

188
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,960
I'll dispatch my army to help you defeat Zhan Beiye,

189
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,080
but you must not go back on what you've promised me.

190
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,630
Okay!

191
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,590
Spread my order. Mobilize 20,000 men from Gold of Heaven Fiend

192
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,310
to try to delay and restrict the enemy's army.

193
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,240
Yes.

194
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,580
What was agreed was

195
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,030
Crown Prince Wuji will mobilize the Mutual Aid Army so we can fight the rebel army together.

196
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,300
How come the one fighting will be the soldiers of our Heaven Fiend?

197
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,030
I'm the one in-charge now.

198
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,640
Do you have an objection?

199
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,230
How about I just return you the military command and I'll take my men away?

200
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,530
I'm sure Older Bro Zhan must have a way to win this.

201
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,430
I have no need to make any additional and unnecessary move.

202
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,820
No such thing...

203
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,270
For Crown Prince to agree to help me repel the rebel army is already giving me great honor.

204
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,150
Even if all these 20,000 Gold of Heaven Fiend will eventually get sacrificed,

205
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,700
that is an honor given to them by Crown Prince.

206
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,550
Your Majesty, Rock City has three layers of city walls and is invulnerable to attacks.

207
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:15,080
The people guarding the city are the Mutual Aid Army, while the ones who're going to risk their lives are our men.

208
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,160
Doesn't Your Majesty feel that it's too unfair?

209
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,830
Crown Prince has his plans.

210
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,530
It's still Older Bro Zhan that's more understanding.

211
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,870
Crown Prince, I fear that this place will be chaotic soon.

212
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,630
Why don't we talk inside the palace?

213
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,870
- Older Bro Zhan, please.
- Please.

214
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,440
Reporting!

215
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,820
The rebel army is just less than 10 li from Rock City.

216
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:11,340
10 li? Won't they be attacking here soon?

217
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,860
Reporting!

218
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,330
The rebel army has broken through the first city defense.

219
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:17,810
- Crown Prince.
 - This?

220
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,120
Reporting!

221
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,750
The rebel army has reached High Valiant Gate and will soon enter the inner city.

222
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,750
Your Highness Crown Prince, once they pass the High Valiant Gate, Zhan Beiye will be attacking the inner city soon.

223
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,420
You have to intervene!

224
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,030
I'll immediately lead the army to fight him.

225
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:36,190
Okay...

226
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,600
Okay.

227
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,720
[Rock City]

228
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,670
Rumors say that the army that Prince Fierce is leading

229
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,600
is a Secret Army that he recovered from the inner part of Geya Desert.

230
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,970
In battle, no one can defeat them.

231
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,900
Also, they are able to travel day and night without resting, traveling for thousands of miles.

232
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,370
Our army surely can't rival that of Prince Fierce's army.

233
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,650
Will we be able to guard this city gate or not?

234
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,720
Prepare to fight!

235
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,550
I, Zhan Beiye, led my army back to attack Rock City not for wealth, glory, or prestige.

236
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,430
I just don't want the last will of the past emperor to be falsified by evil people.

237
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,990
I don't want the citizens of Heaven Fiend to endure the tyrannical ruling of a muddled king anymore.

238
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,220
I don't want us brothers of the same nation to fight among ourselves, leading to a bloodbath.

239
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:08,090
You all are my, Zhan Beiye's, brothers.

240
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,160
Prince Fierce is an unrivaled hero.

241
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,430
If there is a next life, I will surely follow you!

242
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,190
But today, we were decreed to firmly guard Rock City.

243
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,330
Since we're living from our wages, we must stay loyal to our king!

244
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:33,260
In High Valiant Gate, there are no soldiers that will surrender!

245
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,170
Prince Fierce, you can do as you want!

246
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:47,550
I admire you all for being loyal to your master.

247
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,800
Once you die, I will surely give you all a grand burial.

248
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,670
My Heaven Fiend brothers...

249
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,680
forgive me.

250
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:03,840
Shoot the arrows!

251
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,850
Attack!

252
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,450
Mister.

253
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,160
Prince Fierce has broken past the High Valiant Gate and is moving towards Respect Forever Gate.

254
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,710
Are you done handling the task inside the palace?

255
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,320
Mister, don't worry.

256
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,620
Imperial Concubine Jing has been rescued and is now safe.

257
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,600
Prince Fierce was able to sweep across the whole Ice Land.

258
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,760
Those guards inside the palace, of course, are of no competition.

259
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,220
It might not be that easy.

260
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,590
In this last battle, we might need to use bloody flesh to win it.

261
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,610
What should we do?

262
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,270
- Just wait here.
- Yes.

263
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,280
Heaven Fiend's Rock City has ancient seals guarding it.

264
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,460
We can't enter this gate.

265
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,550
Older Fifth Brother!

266
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,390
What do we do now?

267
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,810
For Zhan family's affair, it needs us Zhans to take care of ourselves.

268
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,110
We've fought and got you here.

269
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,600
As for what will happen inside Rock City, we couldn't help you with it.

270
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,620
Please fulfill your promise right now, right here.

271
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,360
No!

272
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,700
General, they're like this because of their ancestors' betrayal.

273
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,770
You mustn't trust them.

274
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,780
We made an agreement and should follow through with integrity.

275
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:03,460
I'll lead the fight into the city, you support us from the outside.

276
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,460
I will definitely fulfill my promise once the mission is accomplished.

277
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,820
What if after you enter the city, you deliberately threaten and use us?

278
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,950
I will stay.

279
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,070
No!

280
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,140
I believe in your promise.

281
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,950
I also believe you'll eliminate Zhan Nancheng.

282
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,430
Leave now and return soon.

283
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,440
I will be waiting for you right here.

284
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,650
All right, I shall return.

285
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,400
All right.

286
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,360
I will stay outside of the city with you.

287
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,390
Zhan Baiye will not abandon me.

288
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,240
Sure, you stay!

289
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,010
I've waited for you for quite a long time,

290
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,240
Prince Zhan.

291
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,510
- This Secret Army...
- ...can't enter Rock City.

292
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:41,780
I know; hence, I've waited for you here.

293
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,750
Or else, just with those few numbers of Dark Storm Cavalry, how can you capture Zhan Nancheng?

294
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,480
Attack!

295
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,940
Attack!

296
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,580
Leave this place to me. Just quickly go.

297
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,100
Try your best to limit the casualties.

298
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,560
Guard the palace gates!

299
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,570
What did you say about the reinforcement army of Crown Prince?

300
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,040
The people of Crown Prince are still trapped outside the palace.

301
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,460
I'm thinking, shouldn't we open the palace gates and let Crown Prince's men come in?

302
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,410
This... you mustn't...

303
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,610
No, that's too risky.

304
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,010
Go and gather everyone to the palace gates and prioritize stopping Zhan Beiye first.

305
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,500
Tell them that whoever is able to kill Prince Fierce, I'll give him his title.

306
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,150
Close the doors!

307
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:37,550
Block them!

308
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,870
Relaying the royal decree! Open the gates!

309
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,430
Face the enemies head on!

310
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,100
Move aside!

311
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,990
An attendant dared to order us around?

312
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,830
Get lost!

313
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,510
[Order]

314
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,850
Where is my Generalissimo Black Tortoise?

315
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:26,580
Where did he go?

316
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,350
Generalissimo Black Tortoise is here!

317
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,230
It's Generalissimo Black Tortoise...

318
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,060
Generalissimo Black Tortoise...

319
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,080
Your Majesty, I arrived late.

320
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,550
Save me quickly. Save me quickly!

321
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:40,120
Your Majesty, I have come to save you.

322
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,020
Zhan Beiye has acquired from who knows where a secret army of fierce fighters.

323
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,250
We can't fight them.

324
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,390
Listen, they've almost charged in!

325
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,620
Hurry up and escort me out.

326
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,720
Reporting!

327
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,880
Your Majesty, we opened the gate as ordered to fight.

328
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,290
But we are simply too weak against them.

329
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,620
I beg Your Majesty to send reinforcements.

330
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,020
Who told you to open the gate?

331
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,980
Generalissimo Black Tortoise gave the order.

332
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,790
Bullshit! Generalissimo Black Tortoise is right by my side!

333
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,570
How could he have made such an order?!

334
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,530
Your Majesty, don't blame them.

335
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:19,840
Did you hear him saying that you allowed Zhan Beiye to charge in?

336
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,950
Doesn't he deserve to be killed?

337
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,020
He is telling the truth.

338
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,930
I did order the gate to be opened.

339
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,020
What?

340
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,160
That can't be possible.

341
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,100
Generalissimo Black Tortoise, I order you to kill Zhan Beiye immediately.

342
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,460
As long as Zhan Beiye is killed, I'll give you whatever reward you want.

343
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,520
Hurry up, Generalissimo!

344
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,970
That's right, Generalissimo. Generalissimo, only you can save us.

345
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:54,230
Generalissimo!

346
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,450
You?

347
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,670
Are you betraying me?

348
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:04,890
You are wrong, Zhan Nancheng.

349
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,970
I have never pledged allegiance to you.

350
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,650
Generalissimo, what do you mean?

351
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:14,140
But you are my Generalissimo Black Tortoise.

352
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,160
I am not your Generalissimo.

353
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,350
Even more, I'm not some secret guard of Upper Yang Palace.

354
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,620
You... Who are you really?

355
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,730
Who am I?

356
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,450
Oh, you can just ask your brother Zhan Beiheng.

357
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,170
But he is no longer around.

358
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,690
It turns out that everything Younger Brother Heng said was correct.

359
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,450
I know what you are then.

360
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:59,340
Fake Folian, Fu... Fuyao!

361
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,170

Arrest her!

Arrest her!

367
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,880
Everyone, Prince Fierce's army is outside right now and about to attack the city.

368
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,830
That's right. He's going to be here soon. Our lives...

369
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,380
Do you still want to

370
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:52,190
sacrifice your lives for this good-for-nothing tyrant?

371
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,670
Now is the time to turn right and earn your reward.

372
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,920
If you continue to be stubborn and resist, you'll just be giving up your life for nothing.

373
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:05,000
That's right... We'll just die in vain.

374
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,230
Prince Fierce is kind and is respected by all the people.

375
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,430
Or else, he wouldn't have made such great progress in such a short time.

376
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,820
Now that this side is hopeless,

377
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,620
I suggest everyone makes a wise decision quickly.

378
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,280
She's reasonable.

379
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,040
Everyone can think it through now.

380
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,650
If you follow Prince Fierce now, you will secure a prosperous future.

381
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:35,040
Or do you want your family

382
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,590
left in turmoil, without support to lean on?

383
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,210
Think wisely, everyone!

384
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,320
I have a family. I mustn't drag them into this.

385
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,450
You?

386
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,060
You... You are a shameless traitor!

387
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,300
What kind of person is Zhan Nancheng?

388
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,320
Haven't you seen clearly by now?

389
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,410
To pledge loyalty to someone like him,

390
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,700
even the King of the Underworld will banish you to the deepest hell.

391
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,350
Please think carefully yourself.

392
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:27,730
Whether you decide to stay or leave, neither Prince Fierce nor I will force you.

393
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,980
This...

394
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,650
Official, what else are you hesitating about?

395
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,180
You still have a wife and children.

396
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,580
- Don't you want to?
- True.

- What are you still waiting for?
- That's right.

398
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,390
- Come over here.
- We still want to live.

399
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,740
- That's right.
- Correct.

Official Wu. Official Wang. You all?

00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,850
Go kill her. Okay?

You, go kill her. I'll reward you gold!

403

Go home.

410

Mister, if you really want to support Prince Fierce,

411
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,580
you could have just let Imperial City make a decree.

412
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:12,260
This way, that Zhan Nancheng has no choice but to give up his throne.

413
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:15,880
Why must you go through all this trouble?

414
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,200
I'm not supporting Zhan Beiye.

415
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,820
I was just caring for the citizens of Heaven Fiend.

416
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,870
Prince Fierce is indeed unrivaled in bravery and might.

417
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:30,110
But to be a true king, you must let go of this uesless kindness.
