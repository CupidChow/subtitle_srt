♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,540
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:23,690
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,980
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,940
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,550
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,090
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,710
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ True love won't run short ♫

♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

~ Episode 41 ~

22
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:07,080
Do you know how sad I was when you left and didn't bring me with you?

23
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,380
That was the Geya Desert.

24
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,330
There are so many strange birds and beasts in there.

25
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,570
What if they had bitten and hurt you?

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,440
I even heard from Ji Yu that you encountered the poisonous bees.

27
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,630
Those can dissolve your bones with just one sting.

28
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,410
Where then can I look for you afterwards?

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,260
Good thing, my Fifth Older Brother is great.

30
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,150
No great danger can harm you.

31
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,430
But I'm not allowing you to do it again, you hear me?

32
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,480
Zhan Beiye, listen well.

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,780
If you dare think of dumping me again,

34
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,200
it won't be that easy.

35
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,990
I know that your heart only wants her.

36
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,640
I won't blame you for trying to save her.

37
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,370
But you're not allowed to die, got it?

38
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:41,420
If you don't come back, I won't be happy anymore.

39
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,510
Zhan Beiye,

40
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,870
can you hear my words?

41
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,190
I will always stay by your side.

42
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,380
Fuyao...

43
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,090

Zhan Beiye. Zhan—

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,490
To live or to die,

47
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:32,150
I want your answer.

48
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,050
Who are you?

49
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,750
Presently, that's not important.

50
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,750
What's important is your vitality will soon disappear and your life will soon be gone.

51
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:01,440
By then, not only will you die, the person who came with you here will also die.

52
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,880
I can't die.

53
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,490
In this world, who isn't afraid of death?

54
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,960
Who can really go against it?

55
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,560
But... you're very lucky,

56
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,450
because only I can save you.

57
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:27,120
It's just that you must pay a price.

58
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,430
What do you want?

59
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,300
Loyalty.

60
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,340
Loyalty...

61
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,060
Loyalty!

62
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,730

- Loyalty?
- Loyalty.

64
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,170
I want to become your belief, everything that you believe in.

65
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,560
I want you to give me all of your loyalty toward your friends, siblings, and everyone.

66
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,830
Impossible.

67
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,370
I can't give my loyalty up!

68
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,160
No one will refuse me.

69
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,650
I can let you live and be happy.

70
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,540
Don't hesitate.

71
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,290
Submit to me.

72
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,270
You all can live then.

73
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,350
While death is very painful.

74
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,460
You only have one choice.

75
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,020
No.

76
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,370
I can't. I...

77
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,800
I... would rather die than give my loyalty up

78
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,870
and betray my heart.

79
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,960
Is it worth it to lose your life for those people who didn't trust and betray you?

80
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,030
Think about the citizens of Yao City.

81
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,550
For them, you've long forgotten about life or death.

82
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,490
How then did they repay you?

83
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,890
Only ruthlessness and curses.

84
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,550
Are you really going to pity them?

85
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,810
You're right.

86
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:03,240
My kindness indeed was let down.

87
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,930
My loyalty also got tested.

88
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,220
But other than that, I still have so many sincere friends.

89
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,830
Behind me... there is still my greatest love.

90
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,440
I will surely protect all of them.

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,830
If you're going to let me give my loyalty up just to survive,

92
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,140
I'd rather get locked up in here forever.

93
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,800
I'd rather die!

94
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,120
I didn't expect you to be this courageous.

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,280
Although you refused to be my slave, I won't let you die.

Then how about Older Sis Fuyao?

100
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,470
Older Sis Fuyao is awake, too!

101
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,790
Urgent news from South Border.

102
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,620
Prince Assist has been searching for Crown Prince Wuji in Geya Desert for so many days.

103
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,080
Although he did his best, he was still late.

104
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,560
Yesterday, the corpse of Crown Prince was found.

105
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,180
Crown Princre Wuji died in the sea of sand.

106
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,930
His corpse is supposed to be brought back to the Imperial city immediately,

107
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,410
but since Crown Prince has died of a strange petrifying disease of the Geya Desert,

108
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,500
there is a lot at stake if we move him.

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,090
I fear that we won't be able to bring back his corpse.

110
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,180
How precious and noble is the Crown Prince of the Five Regions?

111
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,480
Now, he wasn't able to fully live his life span

112
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,120
and has died without fulfilling his dreams.

113
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,960
That is already a very painful matter.

114
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,360
How could we let Crown Prince get buried away from his hometown?

115
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,240
For a national martyr, I am also deeply saddened and pained.

116
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,810
But this strange petrifying disease is very fierce and can easily spread.

117
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,190
Even a man of outstanding intelligence and talent like Crown Prince Wuji wasn't able to resist it.

118
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,380
Don't talk about ordinary people anymore.

119
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,220
If we take the risk and bring back Crown Prince's corpse,

120
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,970
and the strange illness wreaks havoc along the long journey,

121
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,760
I fear that it will incite fear among the citizens!

122
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,480
With Crown Prince dying, the world is in mourning.

123
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,720
I dare not hastily make any decision about your suggestions.

124
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,680
Whether it is to do the funeral and burial of Crown Prince at the place he died

125
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,730
or bring his corpse back here to his hometown,

126
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,640
may Lord Emperor make the decision.

127
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,150
Tell Prince Assist that the dead take priority.

128
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:39,230
Immediately bury him so he can rest in peace.

Why don't you... go back to Yao City first?

I know you feel upset.

135
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,730
For them, you almost lost your life at that time,

136
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,550
but didn't expect that you'd get this result in return.

Hey, I heard that the citizens of Yao City are actively searching for you.

138

I'm sure that they've already understood the painstaking efforts you've done for them.

How long will you keep avoiding, Fuyao?

Sometimes when you give someone else a chance,

you're also giving yourself a chance.

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,170
Official Fu, we are sorry.

164
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,330
We swear to follow you forever.

165
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,920
We swear to follow you forever.

166
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,380
We swear to follow you forever.

167
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,710
We swear to follow you forever.

168
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:16,610
We swear to follow you forever.

169
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,020
Sometimes, giving oneself a chance is also giving others a chance.

170
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,440
From now on, this Yao City will truly be yours.

171
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:32,220
♫ Even if I don't know how to pull out the sword of time ♫

172
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,350
- You're back!
- Tie Cheng, are your wounds all healed?

173
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,150
No problem. I'm just fine.

174
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,000
This... official seal is still here.

175
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,120
Just keep this official seal well.

176
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,360
This?

177
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,890
I also just picked up this official position out of a moment of whim.

178
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,200
I can't stay here forever anyway.

179
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,700
Now that the Black Tribe Gang has been eliminated,

180
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,300
I'm handing the citizens of Yao City to you to guard well.

181
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:16,040
Then, are you leaving now?

182
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,290
I'm going to find Wuji.

183
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,610
You take good care of yourself.

184
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,080
Megrez's governing Five Regions is the foundation of the world stabilization.

185
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,620
Now that Crown Prince Wuji is dead,

186
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,610
the position of the crown prince is left empty.

187
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,410
If this continues and the heart of the citizens is in disarray,

188
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,510
I fear it will cause chaos.

189
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,720
I second that.

190
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,050
We cannot leave the crown prince position vacant.

191
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,540
There must be an heir to the Imperial power.

192
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,430
I suggest that we set a new crown prince as soon as possible.

193
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,500
I second that.

194
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,050
A report from Prince Assist from the far away South Border, greeting His Majesty good health.

195
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,060
His Highness Prince Assist is filial, respectful, loyal, faithful, intelligent and capable.

196
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,310
He is also the eldest royal son.

197
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,140
Whether in reason or in sentiments, he is the unrivaled choice for the crown prince.

198
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,220
The Crown Prince has just passed away.

199
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,510
It's too soon to discuss a successor today.

200
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,680
His Majesty has said that there isn't a private matter when it comes to the Imperial family.

201
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,940
The matter of Prince Assist is the matter of the Five Regions.

202
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,940
It should be reflected on and shared with everyone.

203
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,390
He especially instructed me to read this for everyone to hear.

204
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,560
"Since I heard about Wuji's demise yesterday,

205
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,440
I was in extreme grief.

206
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,930
My tears were overflowing, but I don't have the power to reverse what has been done.

207
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,020
I only wish that I can be allowed to temporarily stay here in Geya, a bitterly cold place,

208
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,060
to handle the burial of my brother

209
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,390
and express the mourning of an older brother.

210
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:05,340
I will try my best to maintain the dignity of the Crown Prince.

211
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,310
Wuji died harboring a grudge and is a great loss for the Five Regions.

212
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,020
We should all be grieving and lamenting.

213
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,570
Director of the Secretariat Wei Qiyang instead kept advising me

214
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,230
to use this chance to obtain the crown prince position.

215
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,850
This person was deliberately instigating conflict and his actions were of evil intentions.

216
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,810
I got so enraged and immediately punished him on site.

217
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,380
But Director of the Secretariat Wei holds office in the imperial court

218
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,190
and respectfully earns imperial graces.

219
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,480
I was reckless and acted out of a moment of impulsiveness.

220
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,190
I ask for Emperor Father to strictly punish me for the crime of taking matters into my own hands."

221
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,980
The matter of choosing the crown prince will temporarily be put aside. From now on,

222
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,730
it will be decided by Lord Emperor.

223
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,230
Your Majesty Empress, wake up please.

224
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,800
- Your Majesty Empress, what's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

225
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,750
- Your Majesty Empress, wake up please.
- Your Majesty Empress!

226
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,980
- Wake up.
- Wake up.

227
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,560
What's wrong with you?

228
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,110
- Call the Imperial physician in.
- Yes.

229
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,930
What happened?

230
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:22,210
Empress heard that His Highness Crown Prince has died.

231
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,170
Out of great yearning for her son, she wanted to beg His Majesty

232
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,780
to allow her to see His Highness Crown Prince for the last time.

233
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,190
Who would have known that on our way to the meditation room, she would suddenly faint.

234
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,410
Royal Sister-in-law.

235
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,750
Royal Sister-in-law.

236
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,790
Do you feel better?

237
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,930
Wuji.

238
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,770
I want to see Wuji.

239
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,560
Hurry and assist Empress up.

240
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,230
Your Majesty.

241
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,640
Take me to see Wuji, okay?

242
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,850
I beg you.

243
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,670
The journey to South Border is far and your body is weak.

244
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,460
If anything bad happens to you, Wuji will not rest in peace, either.

245
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,370
My son is gone.

246
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:40,830
I am unable to send him off on his last journey.

247
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm unwilling to accept it.

248
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,070
Empress. Prince.

249
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,030
Empress, the medicine that His Majesty prepared for you is done.

250
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,760
I'll deliver it to your chambers now.

251
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,530
Don't deliver it anymore!

252
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,820
I'm not eating it!

253
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,520
His Majesty instructed that I assist you in taking it.

254
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,850
Throw it! Throw it all away!

255
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,070
I dare not!

256
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,320
Prince, please advice Empress.

257
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,530
This medicine was painstakingly prepared by His Majesty.

258
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,850
It can't be thrown away.

259
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,690
What does it say?

260
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,300
[The Crown Prince died in the Geya Desert, and has been placed in the coffin for burial.]

261
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:49,490
The Crown Prince died in the Geya Desert, and has been placed in the coffin for burial.

262
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,020
What?

263
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,730
Crown Prince Wuji is dead?

264
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,980
Do you believe Wuji is dead?

265
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,020
The Crown Prince is born under an auspicious sign, and he is blessed by Your Majesty.

266
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,260
He should be...

267
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,150
should be able to overcome any turmoil.

268
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,830
I don't want to believe it, either.

269
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,590
But what if he really is dead?

270
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,030
Who should succeed the crown prince position?

271
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,800
This... I dare not make casual suggestions.

272
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,160
In the Imperial court, only two people are qualified for it,

273
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,260
Prince Assist and Prince Virtue.

274
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,410
Prince Assist's wild ambitions are so obvious, but Prince Virtue?

275
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,150
He acts as if he doesn't have the heart to manage the court.

276
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,050
But what kind of intentions are hiding behind that facade?

277
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,700
Who is able to know?

278
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Actually...

279
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,500
I may as well let them fight it out.

280
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,020
At the same time, I can also clearly see

281
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:28,000
which ministers are serving whom.

282
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,010
Although Prince Assist has some power,

283
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,370
compared to Prince Virtue, he's still a bit soft.

284
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,120
If Prince Virtue really develops disloyalty,

285
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,750
then how could Prince Assist handle him?

286
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,850
When have I said that I will use Prince Assist to deal with Prince Virtue?

287
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,710
If I want Prince Virtue to die,

288
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,950
the person who must do it can only be Wuji.

289
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,430
Oh, right. Prince Assist is about to bury Wuji.

290
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,240
You immediately go to South Border

291
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,520
and take a good look at who really is that dead person.

292
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,030
Hurry!

293
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,410
Is Crown Prince's death true or not?

294
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,050
The messenger pigeon was left by Wuji.

295
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,050
The note was also written by his Secret Guard.

296
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,510
I actually hope that you can tell me that all of these are just a joke.

297
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:47,750
- That he is just fooling us.
- I'm just worried that Fuyao—

298
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,170
Wuji's death is too fishy.

299
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,530
Before we know the full truth,

300
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,660
don't make any reckless move, especially to Fuyao.

301
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,040
We all clearly know about her feelings for Wuji.

302
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,060
Hence, she would easily be entrapped.

303
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,360
We need to keep watch over her.

304
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,380
I already asked Xiaoqi to secretly light the sedating incense you gave me.

305
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,580
This time, it should have—

306
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,850
Older Sis Fuyao has ran away! What do we do?

307
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,350
I'll go chase her!

308
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,700
Take good care of Yao City.

309
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,130
- I'm going, too!
- I—
- Stop!

310
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:22,260
You all will just add trouble.

311
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,790
Fifth Older Brother, be careful.

312
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:34,680
You and Older Sister Fuyao must return safely.

313
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,110
I'll just ask once, who are you?

314
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,330
Who is your contact? Why do you come to South Border?

315
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,590
We are the supply troop of the Pingrong Army.

316
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:45,100
We are here to deliver supplies to Prince Assist.

317
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,310
Just three li east of here is the main camp of Prince Assist.

318
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,460
Go back with me.

319
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,140
I know you feel the injustice.

320
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,080
You can go avenge Wuji, but not now.

321
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,050
I want to see him if he is alive. If he is dead, I still must see the corpse.

322
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:06,110
I can't believe he is dead just because you told me.

323
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,000
I'll go find him.

324
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:18,080
[The coffin of Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez Empire]

325
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,310
[The coffin of Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez Empire]

326
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,450
When people in the Imperial city heard that Crown Prince Wuji had encountered a mishap,

327
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,970
each one was refusing to believe it.

328
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,750
With Crown Prince's outstanding intelligence and talent, how could he?

329
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,930
Lord Emperor's heart aches for Crown Prince dying in a foreign place.

330
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,980
For a white-haired person to send off a black-haired son,

331
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,250
he must be in severe grief.

332
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:19,880
He especially sent me here to send Crown Prince off to his last journey.

333
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,540
Ever since I heard of Wuji's death,

334
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,660
I haven't even been able to eat a single grain of rice or drink a single drop of water.

335
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:31,120
He is after all my brother. We are related by blood.

336
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,910
Your Highness, please contain your grief.

337
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,750
I never expected that Crown Prince would die in Geya Desert.

338
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,250
It's kind of strange if you think about it, too.

339
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,260
Everyone knows that desert is forbidden.

340
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,890
Why did the Crown Prince venture into there?

341
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:48,700
Isn't that strange!

342
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,030
Ten days ago, I received a report

343
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:56,100
that they found Crown Prince's belongings along the border of the desert.

344
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,420
When I looked at it,

345
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:01,600
there was indeed a royal clan seal on it.

346
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,630
I then deduced that Wuji had entered the Geya Desert.

347
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:12,890
Several days after that, I sent a total of five troops to search for him,

348
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:16,050
but there were no news of him.

349
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,550
Then, how did you find his corpse?

350
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:23,990
It was quite a coincidence.

351
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,410
It snowed all of a sudden on the day of our search.

352
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,810
The searchers went to a different direction in the desert

353
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,820
but found Wuji's corpse because of that.

354
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,930
It's such a pity.

355
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,530
At such a young age,

356
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:43,090
he got killed by the petrifying disease from this desert.

357
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:51,870
After Crown Prince died, the thoughts of people in the Imperial court also got flexible.

358
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:55,720
Official Duan and the others suggested that you inherit the crown prince title,

359
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,410
so as to placate the hearts of the citizens.

360
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,660
I know that I am deficient in intelligence and academic study.

361
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,740
And I have never had the ambition.

362
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,300
I have only wished for Emperor Father to stay healthy,

363
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,820
so that I can stay beside him to serve him well.

364
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,730
Your Highness, everything is prepared.

365
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,710
Do you really want to burn everything up?

366
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,720
Crown Prince Wuji's rare disease could be contagious.

367
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,270
Your Highness, we can't delay any longer.

368
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:41,290
So be it. Let's hurry to send Crown Prince to Heaven.

369
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,410
[The coffin of Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez Empire]

370
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,130
Your Highness Prince Assist, before I left,

371
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:22,900
Lord Emperor specifically told me to bid the Crown Prince farewell for the last time.

372
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,240
But the coffin is closed and so far away,

373
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,390
I can't even glimpse Crown Prince's face.

374
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,180
I fear that I can't even fulfill His Majesty's command.

375
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,310
It's not that I am intentionally stopping you.

376
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:39,560
It's just that this weird petrifying disease is very dangerous.

377
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:43,190
It's easy for you to get afflicted if you go near to it.

378
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,300
Once you really contract this disease,

379
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,680
your body will slowly harden, be petrified and die.

380
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,700
Hence, I have no choice but to burn him here.

381
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,720
I have to pay my respect because the entrusted royal order on me.

382
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,940
Hope Your Highness can understand it.

383
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,640
Okay.

384
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,730
Then we'll burn the coffin while it's open.

385
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,190
If Eunuch Han wants to pay your respect, then just do it after the fire has been lit.

386
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,000
That will be best then.

387
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,960
Open the coffin.

388
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,920
Open the coffin!

389
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,730
Fuyao...

390
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,450
Fuyao.

391
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:13,090
It is indeed Crown Prince Wuji.

392
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,120
My pitiful younger brother.

393
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,920

Wuji...

397
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,850
- Don't be like this.
- Wuji...

398
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,110
- Calm down, Fuyao.
- Wuji—

399
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,980
Bad spirits! They got inflicted with the petrifying disease!

400
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,900
Quickly leave!

401
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:42,820
[The coffin of Crown Prince Wuji of Megrez Empire]

402
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:54,700
Wuji...

403
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,780
- Fuyao.
- Wuji.

404
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,040
- Calm down a little, Fuyao.
- Wuji.

405
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,460
I'm going to seek vengeance for Wuji.

406
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,030
- Calm down a little first. Fuyao!
- I'm going to kill Zhangsun Pingrong!

407
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,170
I'm going to kill Zhangsun Pirngrong!

408
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,860
- Didn't you see how many there were?
- I'm going to kill him!

409
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,710
How many guards does Zhangsun Pingrong have?

410
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,550
If you charge there now, are you trying to seek revenge or seek death?

411
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,260
He is Wuji! It's impossible for him to die!

412
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,390
- How is it possible for him to die?
- Fuyao.

413
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,330
He saved me so many times. How is it possible for him to die? Wuji!

414
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,760
Calm down a little, Fuyao.

415
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,540
Wuji!

416
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,390
No way. He wouldn't just die this way.

417
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,250
He wouldn't just die like this.

418
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,060
Enough...

419
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:43,390
When I was little, the people who doted on me the most were Mother and maternal Grandfather.

420
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:48,290
When maternal Grandfather left, Mother hugged me and stayed with me the whole night.

421
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:52,330
I never saw her cry until the morning.

422
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,220
I asked her, "Aren't you sad?" She said,

423
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,030
"If a person dies and will really leave something behind,

424
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:06,350
then that probably is just a bit of longing,

425
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,510
a bit of memories, and a lot of pain."

426
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:17,250
But they don't like to see all that.

427
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,000
The more they don't want people to be in pain.

428
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,190
Living isn't easy. The person has already left.

429
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,480
Why then must we use the tears of the living to bind them?"

430
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,580
As long as you're alive, you won't let him die in vain. Am I right?

431
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,810
Correct.

432
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,060
I mustn't fall.

433
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,760
I must take revenge for Wuji.

434
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,960
Okay. If you want to seek vengeance, I will accompany you.

435
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,980
Dragonfly and solanum nigrum, each two qian.

436
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,490
Houseleek, six qian.

437
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,360
All these are the ingredients for the medicine that His Majesty makes for Empress.

438
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,170
Everyone, better be careful.

439
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,600
Pursley, three qian.

440
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,930
Sugarcane and turmeric rhizome, each six qian.

441
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,460
One of my wives is sick.

442
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,000
My in-law has asked a great doctor to treat her.

443
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,560
Since Imperial Physician Deng happens to be here today,

444
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,140
hope you can take the trouble and see what improvement can still be made on this prescription.

445
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:01,390
Prince, how long has Madam been taking this medicine?

446
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:03,070
Several days.

447
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,940
Why? Is something wrong?

448
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,540
Hope Prince can tell Madam to stop taking this medicine

449
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,170
or else her life might be in danger.

450
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,840
May Imperial Physician Deng explain it.

451
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,540
Prince, take a look, please.

452
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,110
This medicinal formula might look complicated and meticulously studied.

453
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,120
But in reality, it's harming you invisibily.

454
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,260
Other than the strong medicines like spargonium and zedoary,

455
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,450
it is secretly hiding nineteen contradicting and eighteen frightening forbidden medical combinations.

456
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,380
The contradicting combination is more harmful than the mutual inhibition.

457
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,560
Taking it for a short period,

458
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,910
one will only develop uterine bleeding with excessive internal heat causing cold limbs.

459
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,430
But if one takes it for a long time,

460
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,280
you will surely have excessive asthenia, thirst, hunger, clonic seizures and then die.

461
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,520
Also, it can't be helped for your appearance to get disfigured and be in severe pain.

462
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,500
This is a killing method that aims to make the heart die prematurely, having control of the person's fate.

463
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,200
Either the person who did this was of mediocre skills and was just being presumptuous,

464
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,340
or he is deliberately causing harm and has evil intentions.

465
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Wuji is gone.

466
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,970
This deep palace has become more bitter cold.

467
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,540
Why must you still enter this troubled place?

468
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,140
Why didn't you tell me?

469
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,680
These past years, the medicines he asked you to take openly and secretly all have poisons.

470
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,660
Why didn't you tell me?

471
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,110
You know it all.

472
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,770
How long are you still planning to hide this from me?

473
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:12,650
Telling you? What can you do if I tell you?

474
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,140
Back then,

475
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:18,430
Zhangsun Jiong forcefully married me into the palace.

476
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,820
You were unable to stop it.

477
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,270
Now, he wants to torture me.

478
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,180
What can you do?

479
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,450
You clearly know... You clearly know that I—

480
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,110
I...

481
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,070
I don't want to drag you into this.

482
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,110
What this medicine poisons is me,

483
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,780
but the person he wants to harm is you.

484
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,720
He so wanted for you to know the truth.

485
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,310
So wanted to anger you, so that he can grab hold of your weakness,

486
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:58,530
eliminate you in a justifiable manner.

487
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,740
I endured it for so many years.

488
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:07,010
I was just looking forward to Wuji ascending the throne as soon as possible.

489
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,050
But—

490
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,910
Crown Prince has died at such a young age.

491
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:16,000
It is something that we didn't foresee.

492
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,020
The dead are gone.

493
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,160
The living need to become stronger.

494
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,930
The road ahead is full of danger.

495
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,630
You mustn't collapse after a setback.

496
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,030
The situation now has changed.

497
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,010
Before, Zhangsun Jiong still considered that you were Ji'er's biological mother,

498
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,700
so he didn't dare to make rash moves.

499
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,000
We still had room to maneuver.

500
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,560
But now that Ji'er is gone,

501
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,980
I'm sure that he can't wait to eliminate us.

502
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:58,740
Since he is bent on forcing me to rebel, fine.

503
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:02,500
Let me tell you today then,

504
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,840
Yi'er,

505
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,160
I will take back this empire for you.

506
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,760
Wait for me to go back and arrange everything.

507
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,180
Within three days, I will come back to fetch you.

508
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,920
You?

509
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Wait for me.

510
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,190
How come there is no one here at all?

511
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,910
We've been waiting for a long time.

512
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,350
Without a sound, you were able to get past all the guards.

513
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:10,040
You two have good martial arts skills.

514
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,290
Gold of Heaven Fiend.

515
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:17,210
So you have connived with Zhan Nancheng already.

516
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,000
Where is Zhangsun Pingrong?

517
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,030
Do you really think that His Highness Prince Assist

518
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,150
will just sit here and wait for you two to kill him?

519
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,470
You already knew that we were coming.

520
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:30,150
Yesterday, you two mixed within the soldiers and sent off Crown Prince on his last journey.

521
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,190
Do you really think that Prince Assist didn't notice it?

522
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,560
He just considered that Miss and Crown Prince have a special relationship,

523
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,810
so he didn't order your arrest and have you buried with him.

524
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,430
His Highness has great foresight and knew that you two would surely come to assassinate him.

525
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:45,930
He set up a trap like this.

526
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:48,870
Sorry to disappoint you two.

527
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,890
Where on earth is Zhangsun Pingrong?

528
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,120
It's fine to just tell you about it.

529
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,850
The fifteenth of next month is the birthday of the king of Heaven Fiend.

530
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,120
Prince Assist is now the person governing the state affairs of Megrez.

531
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,440
How could he not go?

532
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,070
He is in Rock City!

533
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:15,460
Guys, if you want to escape, I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

534
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,790
But too bad,

535
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:21,980
a distinguished prince of Heaven Fiend gave up on glory and splendor

536
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:25,530
and instead chose to be with a wanted female criminal of Five Regions.

537
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,490
But His Highness has said

538
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:32,810
to let Heaven Fiend arrest their own prince.

539
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,060
We'll just keep watch here and mustn't harm Prince Fierce.

540
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,400
