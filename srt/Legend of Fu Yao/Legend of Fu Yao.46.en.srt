♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,610
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:23,860
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,900
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,940
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,930
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,530
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,150
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,760
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11

♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

♫ True love won't run short ♫

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,120
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,610
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,360
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16

♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,450
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,500
~ Episode 46 ~

22
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,500
I think,

23
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,340
my parents might have their predicaments, too.

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,900
Otherwise, why would they not want someone as pretty as me?

25
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,850
But their identity is no longer important to me.

26
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,570
I don't think about it anymore.

27
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,470
It was Uncle Zhou who raised me single-handedly.

28
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,320
So to me he is my family.

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,900
Take this.

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,060
- I was wrong. It was my fault
- Uncle Zhou!

31
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,290
I was wrong.

32
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,820
I am begging you, Clique Leader Yan.

33
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,420
When you were born, you already had Five Seals on you.

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,940
But, unfortunately, you mastered Breaking the Ninth Cloud.

35
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,600
Once Breaking the Ninth Cloud fused with the seals within you,

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,570
it conformed to your inner vital channels.

37
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,980
These Five Seals were then activated

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,300
and this also destined your fate in the future.

39
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,910
Hey.

40
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,390
Yes?

41
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,410
What are you thinking?

42
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,790
I was wondering why you weren't drinking.

43
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,550
Let's drink.

44
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,320
Give me your hand.

45
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,880
I give this to you.

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,380
What are you doing?

47
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,750
Listen well. The Mystic Spirit Leaf has been with me since before I can remember.

48
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,090
It's made me who I am.

49
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,990
So it's very important.

50
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,680
Why are you giving me such an important thing?

51
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,080
Because you are even more important than this.

52
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,520
All right. I'll keep it for you.

53
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,350
It's different this time.

54
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,360
This contains something very important to me

55
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,590
as well as some memories I dare not face.

56
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,670
Whether it's good or bad,

57
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:52,340
it's all the truth.

58
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:59,560
My present, past and future are all in here.

59
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,830
Now I give it all to you.

60
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,900
How is she doing? Any better?

61
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,950
She... still doesn't want to see me?

62
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,550
You saved my life.

63
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,160
I, Zhan Beiye, have nothing to repay you with.

64
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,730
From now on my life is yours.

65
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,290
In life or death, I'll do anything; no hesitations.

66
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,440
I don't know what else I should say.

67
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,550
Thank you.

68
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,360
Get inside!

69
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,210
What day is it today?

70
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,410
Today is—

71
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,020
It's my birthday today.

72
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,410
How would you remember?

73
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,330
This time last year,

74
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,990
I just got to Deep Water.

75
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,480
There was a wedding happening close to my inn.

76
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,080
The fireworks were so festive.

77
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:13,000
I sat on the roof with a jug of wine and toasted myself with every burst of the fireworks.

78
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,440
Every burst, I toasted myself.

79
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,490
It was very lively.

80
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:28,930
I was in Qiongye the year before last year.

81
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,310
I was just caught by my dad.

82
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,970
They tried to console me,

83
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:38,710
so I told them I want as many people as possible for the grandest of parties.

84
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,330
During the commotion, I escaped again.

85
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,120
I was in such a hurry, I even lost my luggage.

86
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,580
I was so hungry later on that night.

87
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,700
I used a gold hairpin to trade for half a piece of bread.

88
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,860
I was eating that bread in my hand slowly

89
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,340
while facing the lights and fireworks of the capital city.

90
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:06,890
I thought of the roasted pork, the royal banquets

91
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,790
are not that different from this taste.

92
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,510
Breathing in that flavor,

93
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,710
it's almost as if I ate it myself.

94
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,310
I was in Heaven Fiend two years ago.

95
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,680
There was a group of sand bandits who wanted to mug me.

96
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,540
But instead, I killed them all.

97
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,820
Then I thought I can't die in Geya.

98
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,640
It's such an embarrassing way to die.

99
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,020
People won't even recognize me.

100
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,910
So I drank the blood of the sand bandits.

101
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,790
Stop it.

102
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,570
I'll take you out for your birthday.

103
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,040
I didn't say all this for your sympathy.

104
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,820
I also don't care for your remorse.

105
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,690
All I wanted to say was affection is always bitter.

106
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,720
The more persistent, the more bitter.

107
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,790
But I've never been afraid.

108
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:16,320
As long as it's my choice, that bitterness can be sweet.

109
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,390
The scariest thing is being afraid and doing nothing.

110
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,220
Zhan Beiye,

111
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,690
I never hesitated nor regretted saving you.

112
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,690
But...

113
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,070
But you said you wanted to thank me.

114
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,390
My heart is in so much pain.

115
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,690
All these years, I've followed you.

116
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,690
When did I ever want your gratitude?

117
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,090
You've done too much for me.

118
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,570
From now on, whatever you can't see,

119
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,820
I'll look at for you.

120
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,120
As long as I'm here,

121
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,660
I won't let any harm come to you.

122
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,860
I don't want your pity.

123
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,150
I care less about your sympathy.

124
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,570
I'm not asking for what you called promises.

125
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,390
I want your true heart. Can you give that to me?

126
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,730
It's okay.

127
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,730
I can wait.

128
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,590
I know you like Fuyao.

129
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,340
If I were a boy, I'd like her, too.

130
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:24,860
But I always believed... I always believed the one you'd love would be me in the end.

"If one can't protect himself, how can he protect others?"

I actually am a person without any wild ambitions.

I thought that lowering myself can earn me a smooth and steady life.

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,790
But from the looks of it now,

165
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:46,630
if you are born in the royal family, there is no such thing as smooth and steady.

166
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,930
It's fine if it was just me.

167
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,960
But now, so many people have been affected because of me.

168
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,870
I can't just sit and wait for death anymore.

169
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,390
Prince Zhan,

170
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,640
if a person will just grin and bear all the maltreatment, you're just going to make the enemy become more savage.

171
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,520
♫ We hold one another back ♫

172
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,420
Drink.

173
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,670
♫ Hold back ♫

174
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,920
After coming back from the brink of death,

175
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,700
there's no more reason to allow others to keep trampling on me.

176
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,290
It's just that my Consort Mother is still in the palace.

177
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,250
I don't know when is the best timing to make my move.

178
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,310
I'll help you.

179
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,930
Me, too!

180
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,420
It's this place.

181
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,400
Customers, take care. Customers, please come in.

182
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,140
Come with me.

183
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,700
Customers, take care.

184
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,690
Eunuch Hua!

185
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,320
Little prince...

186
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,670
Little prince...

187
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,450
Little prince, you're still alive.

188
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,890
I'm still alive.

189
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,810
You're still alive.

190
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,810
I'm still alive.

191
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,530
I'm still alive.

192
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,840
I'm still alive.

193
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,270
I've caused you to suffer.

194
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,990
No...

195
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,390
Is Consort Mother doing well?

196
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,960
Don't worry. She's one of us.

197
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,980
Good. Good. She's doing very well.

198
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,960
Although Imperial Concubine is being closely monitored by them in West Splendid Palace,

199
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,930
she's still enjoying good food and clothing and isn't suffering at all.

200
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,570
Imperial Concubine Jing told me to relay a message to you.

201
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,170
Hometown in the eastern road.

202
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,930
Break one's promise.

203
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,440
Eunuch Hua, "Looking east to my hometown, the travel far and long.

204
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,560
My warm tears have soaked my sleeves but are still not stopping.

205
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,710
Meeting with you on a horse, without any pen or paper.

206
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,390
Please tell my family that I'm safe and sound."

207
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,450
It's a message to say that she's fine.

208
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right.

209
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,810
When I was little, I got locked up in this palace.

210
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,450
Consort Mother was worried that something bad might happen to me,

211
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,440
so she created a secret message with me.

212
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,500
With those words, I'm now at ease.

213
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,960
Yes...

214
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,850
I have something to ask you a favor with.

215
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,830
Please give the instructions.

216
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,510
I want to enter the palace.

217
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,960
I want Consort Mother to personally see me.

218
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,860
I want to let her know that I'm still alive.

219
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,950
Before I meet with Zhan Nancheng, I must make her feel at ease.

220
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,040
Yes...

221
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,560
Little prince, it's just that...

222
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,760
since Imperial Concubine Jing got locked up in West Splendid Palace,

223
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,380
she's getting strictly watched by 300 guards every day.

224
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,380
There are 100 people shifting every eight hours.

225
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,680
I fear that we won't find any chance to take.

226
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,800
If you rashly go there,

227
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,270
Imperial Concubine Jing will surely get worried.

228
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,200
Eunuch Hua, if I remember it correctly,

229
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,110
it will be Zhan Nancheng's birthday five days from now.

230
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,350
I'm representing the king of Deep Water to greet Your Majesty.

231
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,870
Incomparable birthday blessings, a prosperous age and flourishing nation.

232
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:07,630
I'm representing the queen of Plough in greeting Your Majesty to rise as high as the eternal moon and sun,

233
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,960
and may this be passed on for generations.

234
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,490
Your Highness Crown Prince.

235
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,690
I was too exhausted in entering Sky Gate Ruin a few days ago.

236
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,120
I wasn't able to personally visit Your Majesty.

237
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,260
I was disrespectful.

238
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,410
Crown Prince has to take care of numerous state affairs every day.

239
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,190
With my trifle status, how can I still trouble you for such things?

240
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,070
The first half of your words are indeed true.

241
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,340
Emperor Father already made a decree for me to bear the important duty of governing the empire.

242
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,270
From now on, I have to handle the affairs of the Five Regions.

243
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,870
With so many minor and major matters, I indeed must exert a lot of effort.

244
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:23,440
There is indeed such a thing. The decree from the Imperial City has just been delivered to the different nations.

245
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:29,740
Then it means that you're now the person governing the whole Five Regions?

246
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,490
I'm earnestly representing the Imperial City to greet the king of Heaven Fiend, Zhan Nancheng,

247
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:38,670
that Heaven may bless you for eternity and may your life be as long as Heaven.

248
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,660
Thank you, Your Highness Crown Prince.

249
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,240
Please.

250
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,960
Slow down! Be careful to not spill it!

251
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,400
Move... Move stably...

252
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,500
Correct. These are more disciplined.

253
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,560
Slow down.

254
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,690
You two, go serve in the West Splendid Palace!

255
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,330
- Yes.
- Yes.

256
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,160
Keep up...

257
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,330
This troublesome?

258
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,110
Wouldn't it be better if we just put on a disguise?

259
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,250
There are multiple anti-magic talismans here in the palace.

260
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,380
Zhuzhu's magic won't work.

261
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,560
Good thing we've met up with Eunuch Hua in No Drunk No Return restaurant.

262
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,160
All these are spies that maternal grandfather has set up for me when he was still alive.

263
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,330
He wasn't there to wait for you just recently?

264
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,050
Eunuch Hua was really pitiful.

265
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,600
He is old and actually doesn't like to drink,

266
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,650
but just because of my maternal grandfather's instructions,

267
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,620
he has been drinking himself drunk in No Drunk No Return restaurant for 20 years.

268
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,250
Spending 20 years to develop a habit,

269
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,110
just to prepare for a possible need 20 years after?

270
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,940
This Grand Master Zhou is really a mystical being.

271
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,920
This way...

272
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,750
Which palace are you two from?

273
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,790
Turn around.

274
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,330
You!

275
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,220
You should have died long ago.

276
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,500
Be careful.

277
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:03,520
[West Splendid Palace]

278
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,330
This is the only blind spot.

279
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,490
They won't find us.

280
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,670
But there are a lot more guards in the palace than before.

281
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,450
We can only wait for an opportunity to get in.

282
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,080
♪ Deserted long wilderness

283
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,890
♪ Torrential rivers and oceans

284
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,650
♪ My son has left

285
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,120
- Imperial Concubine Jing, can you stop singing?
- ♪ I don't know where he went

286
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,290
Isn't it annoying?

287
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,650
You dare bite me?

288
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:55,780
- Tie her up!
- Yes!

289
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,040
That woman needs a good lesson.

290
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,730
Singing all day long.

291
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,840
It's so annoying.

292
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,420
After they know of Gu Lingfeng's death, the palace will be on higher alert.

293
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:20,900
We'll go in after dark in our disguises.

294
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:27,130
Your face is so recognisable no matter what disguise you use.

295
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,500
I'm different.

296
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,860
No one will take a second look at a palace maid.

297
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,480
I have an idea.

298
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,440
- Please.
- Please.

299
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,110
King of Heaven Fiend.

300
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,920
I've heard there are many treasures in Heaven Fiend.

301
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,640
The King himself has the largest collection.

302
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,760
Do I have the honor of seeing them today?

303
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,030
Are you talking about my Chant Frost Watchtower, Crown Prince?

304
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,870
Exactly.

305
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,420
You should be the most familiar with the Chant Frost Watchtower, right?

306
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,450
Report!

307
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,720
Your Majesty. Gu-General Gu Lingfeng—

308
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,790
Speak.

309
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,450
Assassins have infiltrated the palace.

310
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,710
General Gu Lingfeng has been murdered.

311
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,090
Royal Older Brother, don't worry.

312
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,440
I'll lead people to do a search now.

313
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,870
We'll definitely catch the assassin.

314
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,590
Wait.

315
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,020
I suddenly thought of something.

316
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:18,610
When Suzong of Deep Water was still king, a similar thing happened.

317
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:23,410
That day, I think it was also Suzong's birthday.

318
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,960
His Uncle wanted the throne.

319
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,360
He attacked on the night of the celebration then.

320
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,440
I heard that there were also assassins that day.

321
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,380
Then there was this incident that the Royal Uncle killed his nephew.

322
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,090
Think about it. It seems very similar to today's events.

323
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,550
Younger Brother Heng, sit.

324
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,880
Catching assassins is too dangerous.

325
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,080
Let the guards do it.

326
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,740
You can stay with me and celebrate my birthday.

327
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,150
Go now.

328
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,210
To the Prince Eternal.

329
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,450
Carry out my orders.

330
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,650
There will be an emergency change of guards at Forever Peace, Broad Safety and Forever Safe gates.

331
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,760
[West Splendid Palace]

332
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,380
It's time for the Imperial Concubine's dinner.

333
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,030
Go in.

334
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,870
Imperial Concubine Jing.

335
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,000
Are you okay, Imperial Concubine Jing?

336
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,450
Are you okay, Imperial Concubine Jing?

337
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,880
Zhan Beiye asked me to come.

338
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,750
Zhan Beiye.

339
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:10,720
- Little Ye?
- Yes. Little Ye.

340
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,850
- Where is he?
- He's waiting for us outside.

341
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,920
Waiting for me?

342
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,340
He's waiting for us outside. He can't come in.

343
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,070
I'll tell the guards at the door, you need to go to the toilet.

344
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,740
Zhan Beiye will wait for us there.

345
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,920
Follow me at that time. Don't say anything.

346
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,420
I won't say anything. I won't say anything.

347
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,530
I won't speak. Someone wants to kill him.

348
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,080
Yes.

349
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,980
This?

350
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,130
Leave.

351
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,910
Lingfeng! Lingfeng! Lingfeng!

352
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,870
This is—

353
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,680
What do you think, Your Highness Crown Prince?

354
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,920
Something's strange.

355
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,770
What do you mean?

356
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,880
There's something which I'm not sure whether I should say or not.

357
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,350
Please, say it, Crown Prince.

358
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,080
The injury which killed him, is here.

359
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,660
From the appearance of the wound, it was injured by your Cold Edge Guard Sword of Heaven Fiend.

360
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,330
Which means, this is done by someone from Heaven Fiend.

361
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:43,860
Your Majesty, be careful.

362
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:50,320
Your Highness Crown Prince, isn't your judgement too hasty?

363
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,530
Prince Eternal, don't panic.

364
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,820
I'm just saying things as I see them.

365
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,810
- I didn't say you had anything to do with this.
- You!

366
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:02,250
Besides, your Royal Older Brother won't suspect you.

367
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,730
Let's go.

368
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,720
Wait.

369
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,080
There are reports of assassins in the palace.

370
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,560
We have to do this for your safety.

371
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,770
Please excuse us, Imperial Concubine.

372
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:18,220
Little Ye.

373
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,960
Consort Mother.

374
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,130
Little Ye.

375
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,040
You've lost weight.

376
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,740
Royal Older Brother, I have no thoughts of disloyalty.

377
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,500
Gu Lingfeng's death definitely has nothing to do with me.

378
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,180
If it really is as His Highness Crown Prince says,

379
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,950
that this was done by someone from Heaven Fiend,

380
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,060
I think he must be back.

381
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,530
Zhan Beiye?

382
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,930
To West Splendid Palace.

383
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,780
Consort Mother.

384
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:15,740
Causing you to end up in this state... I'm sorry.

385
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,920
It's no problem.

386
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,460
It's been difficult for you, my son.

387
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,560
His Majesty has arrived.

388
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,720
They're here to capture you.

389
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,190
Hurry up and leave. Go!

390
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,790
I will take you with me today, so you'll be free from now on.

391
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,020
No, don't do that.

392
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,970
I cannot let you risk yourself.

393
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:48,570
I don't want to be free this way.

394
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:52,160
I feel content just to see you.

395
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,280
Take it. It's very important.

396
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,540
There's something inside.

397
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,840
Take it.

398
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,480
Leave!

399
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,850
I also feel sad that we were unable to rescue Imperial Concubine Jing.

400
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,570
In the future, if you need anything, I will surely do my best to help you.

401
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,490
Thank you.

402
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:06,790
My Consort Mother left me a poem.

403
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:13,400
"This exact moment is like the peach tree in the backyard, the petals that once covered the flower's pit have now fallen off.

404
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:18,600
I only hope that my son can establish his career again, to become the king of Rock City."

405
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,130
All the words were the instructions left by my mother.

406
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,460
I am simply too weak.

407
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,810
I caused Consort Mother to live in fear.

408
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,500
I've caused her to be trapped in Rock City.

409
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:40,280
I am not worthy to be her son.

410
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:50,450
In this journey, I was able to survive because my brothers sacrificed their lives for me.

411
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:58,170
I owe my Consort Mother and my soldier brothers too much.

412
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,050
I'm going to kill my way back to Rock City.

413
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,280
I have completed the task ordered by Royal Older Brother.

414
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,350
You did well.

415
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:13,360
The weather will get warmer in a few days.

416
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:19,430
It's not really a good sign for Heaven Fiend.

417
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,530
I always feel that everything in Heaven Fien seems different this year.

418
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,700
What do you mean?

419
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,230
It's like a huge net fell from the sky and grew from the ground.

420
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:39,170
Slowly, it's encircling the whole Heaven Fiend

421
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,270
and it's becoming tighter.

422
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,410
Don't you feel something bad is about to happen?

423
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,830
Royal Older Brother should not worry so.

424
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,020
I'm already investigating one by one any official, scholar, or merchant who's bearing any disloyalty to you.

425
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,830
I will not spare anyone that should be arrested or executed.

426
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,810
There aren't any inauspicious astronomical signs; hence, the gods must be blessing us.

427
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,320
Gu Lingfeng actually died inside the palace.

428
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,260
You can't even find any clues about the perpetrator.

429
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,080
It's my negligence.

430
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,880
It's not that simple.

431
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,830
Crown Prince Wuji turns out to be alive.

432
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,900
It just so happened that Zhangsun Pinrong leaves without notice at the same time.

433
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,700
It can't be a coincidence.

434
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,990
More importantly, I also sense that Zhan Beiye is still alive.

435
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,230
The snow has finally stopped.

436
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,430
It's time to take back my possessions.

437
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,590
You finally are able understand.

438
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,200
The last will regarding the heir to the throne of the past emperor.

439
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,950
"A heavy burden to entrust, a cautious heart, I'm now passing my throne to my seventh son,

440
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:47,100
Prince Fierce Zhan Beiye."

441
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,280
If not because Consort Mother deliberately hid this,

442
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,890
maybe there wouldn't be a Zhan Nancheng now.

443
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,600
The person who read the last will before was the older brother of Queen Astute Peace,

444
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,250
which is Zhan Nancheng's uncle.

445
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:11,280
Who can really tell the truth behind this since so many years have passed?

446
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,130
Zhan Nancheng's decree to ascend to the throne is fake?

447
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,020
That's all right.

448
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:22,130
What belongs to you will be yours sooner or later.

449
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,790
Even if it's late, so what?

450
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:25,590
We'll just get it back for you.

451
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:33,600
Before, no matter how bad and how many times Zhan Nancheng wanted to harm me,

452
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,690
I was able to endure it.

453
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,760
He is the king. I'm his subject.

454
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,610
If he really wants me dead,

455
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,790
I have no choice but to obey.

456
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,500
I'm not going to endanger the nation for my loved ones.

457
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,630
The nation is the priority.

458
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,770
I initially thought that if I bear all the hardship, Heaven Fiend can be peaceful in exchange.

459
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,130
That would be great, too.

460
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,800
But now, King Father's last will has resurfaced.

461
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,020
How could I disappoint him?

462
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:24,220
With the past emperor's decree upon us, I, Ji Yu, am willing to risk my life to serve you!

463
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:33,520
Uprising is easy, but the ones who will suffer are the citizens of Heaven Fiend.

464
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,780
There are three dangers in Heaven Fiend.

465
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,450
One danger is being immoral but getting highly favored.

466
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,060
Second danger is having poor talent but in a high position.

467
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,350
Third danger is having no great achievements but receive a huge salary.

468
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,130
It looks like Zhan Nancheng has fulfilled all three.

469
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,130
I shouldn't be meddling with your Heaven Fiend's royal internal affairs.

470
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,230
But at this moment, I have to say this.

471
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:55,360
If you really care about Heaven Fiend,

472
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,450
you should limit having these hesitations and worries.

473
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,630
But General now only has 3,000 Dark Storm Cavalry.

474
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,860
No matter how valiant we are,

475
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,500
how could we resist the army of millions of Zhan Nancheng?

476
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,730
You've underestimated Prince Zhan.

477
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:15,890
Dark Storm Cavalry was initially established to restrain the Heaven Fiend royal clan.

478
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:21,590
Hence, the only person that can defeat Zhan Nancheng now can only be me.

479
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,160
When the Five Regions was originally at the peak of great strength,

480
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,830
the royal clan that established Heaven Fiend used magic that ordinary people couldn't.

481
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,490
Firmament was worried that the Royal Zhan Clan would get too powerful and bring trouble to the Five Regions.

482
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,750
Hence, they created the Dark Storm Cavalry.

483
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:39,220
They were then conferred with Firmament powers to be used to impede the royal power of Heaven Fiend.

484
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,700
Blue Dragon above!

485
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,560
The person who's able to obtain the Blue Dragon Wildness Sword can command the Dark Storm Cavalry of Five Regions.

486
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,660
We all will serve you until death!

487
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,640
The Dark Storm Cavalry isn't just 3,000 elite soldiers.

488
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,800
They have the Firmament mystical power to open the barrier in the palace.

489
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,210
They are also the only choice in eliminating a treacherous member of the Zhan royal clan.

490
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:06,350
Are you saying that only the Dark Storm Cavalry can break the curses and barriers inside the royal palace?

491
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:10,520
Yes. It's just that the current Dark Storm Cavalry is too few.

492
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,520
3,000 against 300,000 is indeed a recipe for failure.

493
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,890
You must borrow some soldiers.

494
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,060
But in this vast Five Regions, from whom will he borrow them?

495
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,720
Aren't you the crown prince?

496
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,700
Can't Megrez help in this matter?

497
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,090
Although Megrez Imperial City reigns over the Five Regions,

498
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,630
it doesn't have the right to interfere with the internal affairs of each nation.

499
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:41,870
It's easy for me to lend you an army,

500
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:46,900
but they will just get blocked outside the gates if we're unable to get the military tally of Heaven Fiend.

501
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,700
Where can we an borrow some soldiers within Heaven Fiend then?

00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,740
♫ What do you know? ♫

504
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,780
♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

505
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,630
♫ If there were no three poisons, if there were no worries, ♫

506
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,830
♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

507
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,490
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫

508
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:38,360
♫ And even discard my soul for affection ♫

509
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,520
♫ The one, who asks me to love him, loves me ♫

510
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,810
♫ I only want him to love me ♫

511
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:51,970
♫ What do you use to exchange for this hard-to-get love? ♫

512
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,820
♫ If there's no sickness or weakness, if there's never oldness  ♫

513
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,060
♫ How can it make a spark to chase after stars alone? ♫

514
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,540
♫ Slim down for him, stay for my heart ♫

515
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,500
♫ And even chase away all luck for dreams ♫

516
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:09,700
♫ It wants me to be so pretty that I seize his soul ♫

517
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:15,430
♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

518
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,190
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

519
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:26,440
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

520
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,150
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

521
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:32,230
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

522
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,300
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

523
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:40,550
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

524
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,530
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

525
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:47,180
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

526
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,900
♫ Have someone's company♫

527
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,930
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

528
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,200
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

529
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,030
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for  ♫

530
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,000
♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

531

♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,310
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

533

♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫
