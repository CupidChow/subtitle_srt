~ Episode 11 ~

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,380
Look. In front of us are two jars.

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,020
Each of us will throw three stones in them.

24
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,530
Whoever's jar has the most stones at the end wins.

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,250
- Oh, my!
- You!

26
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,830
Oh, my god!

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,630
How come it shattered?

28
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,020
I didn't accidentally break it, did I?

29
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,180
You are too despicable!

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,280
But what was our bet just then?

31
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,130
Whoever has more pebbles in the jug wins.

32
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,480
My jug has one, two, three pebbles.

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,570
Therefore, I won.

34
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,390
Are you going to hit me?

35
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,330
Then you-you just hit me here.

36
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,010
Gentle, okay?

37
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,220
That was great. Thank you.

38
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,710
I was scared to death.

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,820
Go.

00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,990
Let's go.

41
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,750
Older Sis, look.

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,700
Look.

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,620
This looks very pretty.

44
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,360
I like this one.

45
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,500
Deep Water claims itself a land that abounds in rivers and lakes.

46
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,610
Actually, it's just a city in the middle of water.

47
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,230
A wall of water encircles Capital Kun.

48
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,350
The people inside can't get out, while the people outside can't get in.

49
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,490
They even have to live under the fear of the Dragon King.
(Dragon King is the deity in charge of the water body.)

50
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,860
They are afraid of being drowned.

51
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,730
Then, if that's the case, why did they still build the capital of Deep Water here?

52
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,520
With more water, crops grow better.

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,460
Deep Water controls all the waterways of the Five Regions.

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,560
Such an important location, who would reject it?

55
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,230
That is true.

56
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,560
Although, this Capital Kun sure is a lot more bustling than Quan City.

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,920
Not just that, people here are especially enthusiastic, too.

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,580
I've heard that once a person arrives at Deep Water, they will forget their own hometown

59
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,030
and want to settle down here immediately.

All right, let's go.

63
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,700
Are you two misses here for the first time?

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,510
- How do you know?
- To be honest,

65
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,240
we, Wuba City Gathers, are scattered all around Deep Water.

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,670
All the locals know of us!

67
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,440
You misses are so curious. You must come from elsewhere.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,140
Then, I want to see what you guys are selling.

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,720
Our store doesn't sell anything!

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,960
Then what are you proud of?

71
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,090
Even though this store doesn't sell anything, there's nothing we can't do!

If Miss has any requests, don't be afraid to tell me.

Do you have any men?

75
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:31,010
Look! Residence leasing, message and goods delivery, buying and selling carriages and horses;

76
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,620

we'll post a notice in the whole Capital Kun. We can find anything!

It's truly an amazing place!

79
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,160
Ever since I was twelve years old, I began to wander freely.

80
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,540
Up till now, I've traveled through all Five Regions!

81
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,330
This whole time I've just been Fifth Older Brother's little tail.

82
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,670
Wherever he goes, I'll follow!

83
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,170
The nickname, Little Tail, is quite cute.

84
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,560
Yes. I think so, too!

85
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,830
Then, how about I just call you "Little Tail" from now on?

86
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,590
Okay!

87
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,300
I see you've been following Zhan Beiye this whole time.

88

Do you two have an engagement?

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,550
How could it be that great?

90
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,420
It's just my one-sided love.

91
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,930
Then, you've followed him to so many places.

92
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,790
He keeps refusing to marry you, and do you just keep following?

93
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,300
Yes.

94
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,280
From the first time I saw Fifth Older Brother,

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,160
I'm firm that he's the man whom I want to marry.

96
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
I'll only stop once he agrees to marry me!

97
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,860
If he is really unwilling,

98
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,430
then I'll continue to follow him, chase him, protect him like I am now!

99
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,970
I'll be satisfied with just that!

100
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,780
Are you wronged?

Nope.

102
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,920
To be able to meet someone I truly love in this lifetime,

103
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,720
and to have tried my best for this love,

104
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,850
then even if nothing comes out of it, I won't have any regrets.

105
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,250
At least it's better than telling to my children when I grow old:

106
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,490
"Your dad was just someone I randomly found.

107
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,080
The one I truly liked was someone I was afraid to chase and afraid to love.

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,230
In the end, I missed him."

109
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,080
I definitely don't want that!

110
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,510
It's a pity, though.

111
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,570
I've chased Fifth Older Brother for so many years,

112
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,850
yet he still runs away every time he sees me.

113
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,090
Tell me. If he's always like this,

114
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,540
how can he know how good I am and how lovable I am.

115
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,420
You've chased him for so many years.

116
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,720
He still keeps hiding from you. This means,

117
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,310
you are very important in his heart.

118
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,420
Really?

119
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,850
- I'll help you out.
- Okay. Okay.

120
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:38,510
But, how come I feel like you have no good intentions?

121
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,260
No.

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,990
Even if I have no good intentions, it's only towards Zhan Beiye.

123
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,030
As for you, I'll let you follow him with a completely justifiable reason. Will you do it?

124
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,850
Of course! I'll do it.

However, if you dare to harm my Fifth Older Brother,

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,430
don't blame me for falling out with you without mercy!

He has asked Your Highness to keep everything confidential.

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,670
Where are you going?

163
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,120
Actually, what General means is that before he finds the Earth Absorbing Bell, Miss will live at this residence temporarily.

164
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,790
General will then definitely treat you well

165
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,250
and also allow you to freely come and go inside Capital Kun.

166
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,410
He won't treat you like a thief.

167
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:44,350
However—

168
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,620
However, the General has also said

169
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,090
that the freedom he is giving you is also a form of trust.

170
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,440
If you still wish to sneakily leave again, once the General catches you,

171
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,400
there can only be severe punishment.

172
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,800
Not possible.

173
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,680
Tell me. If I really do escape,

174
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,630
will your general really be able to catch me?

175
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,870
Miss, why go through so much trouble?

176
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,290
You're just anxious to find Xiaoqi, aren't you?

177
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,630
You are powerless by yourself alone. Neither do you have any relatives here.

178
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,730
You actually have no way to start.

179
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,220
It would be better to just stay here temporarily.

180
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,530
General is a prince of Heaven Fiend after all.

181
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,790
If there are any clues, he will go after them,

182
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,700
which is thousands of times better than you going.

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,170
What Official Qi says makes sense.

184
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,000
Then the task of looking for Xiaoqi, I will leave to you.

185
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,600
What is this?

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,200
This is made out of the venison of Heaven Fiend with wild wasabi.

187
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
If you are out of Heaven Fiend, you won't be able to eat it.

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,100
This is the local product of Heaven Fiend, right?

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,350
Of course.

190
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:38,500
I specifically had someone deliver it over from Heaven Fiend.

191
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,000
They all say that the people of Heaven Fiend like to travel all around.

192
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,800
But Fifth Older Brother only loves his ice land,

193
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,500
his hunting horses, and dishes from his northern clan.

194
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,300
I have been thinking. He has been living in a foreign land.

195
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,200
If he can have a taste of food from his homeland,

196
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
he would definitely be happy.

197
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,000
From what you are saying, that means Zhan Beiye's mouth is in luck.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,700
That's for sure.

199
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Here, try some.

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,000
Try some.

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,500
I will feed you. This one is good.

202
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,700
Have a taste!

203
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,570
How is it?

204
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,300
Is it good?

205
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,700
The Prince is back!

206
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,800
Fifth Older Brother is back!

207
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Hurry and let him try this delicious dish, too!

208
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
- Okay!
- Hurry and go!

209
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Fifth Older Brother!

210
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,250
Fifth Older Brother! I've made you venison with wild wasabi.

211
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,400
This is your favorite food.

212
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,200
I specially had someone deliver it from Heaven Fiend!

213
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,800
Ya Lanzhu!

214
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,400
Look at yourself now to see if you're still like a woman.

215
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,740
Being like this every day!

216
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,400
Look at how you are right now!

217
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,200
I just wanted you to try my cooking. Why can't I do that?

218
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,400
- Have some!
- No!

219
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,600
- Try some!
- I won't eat it!

220
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,400
- Try some!
- I won't eat it!

221
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,400
- Try some!
- I won't eat it!

222
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,050
It's fine if you just don't eat it.

223
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,800
Why do you have to vent out on my dish!

224
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,600
I won't let you go! Pay it back!

225
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,010
Pay me back my venison!

226
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,400
Don't you dare leave!

227
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,000
- Let go of me!
- There are so many people watching! Don't you feel embarrassed?

228
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,700
A miss like you pursuing after a man like this, you are really the first!

229
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,400
Let go! Yes, I am the first!

230
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,000
My father told me. When you are pursuing after a man, you must pursue the first!

231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,460
The ones afterwards will all be of poor quality and repulsive!

232
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,000
I just won't let you go!

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I won't let you go! Don't go!

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- Let go! Let go!
- Fifth Older Brother!

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
- Let go! Let go!
- Fifth Older Brother!

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,600
- I'm telling you to let go!
- Zhan Beiye. General Zhan.
- I just want you to be my man.

237
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,800
I just like you, Fifth Older Brother.

238
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,200
Just agree to be with her.

239
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,600
I think there won't be any other woman in the world who would treat you as well as she does.

240
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I want to marry you, Fifth Older Brother.

241
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,800
I like you!

242
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,000
Fifth Older Brother, I just like you!

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,200
- Ya Lanzhu.
- I just like you.

244
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,000
Did your father tell you that women have to be their man's first?

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
Yes. Yes.

246
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,100
That's good, then. I have to tell you.

247
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,800
The position of number one in my heart

248
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:21,380
has been filled by someone.

249
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
- Who is it?
- Don't ask.

250
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,000
- Who is it?
- It's her!

251
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,600
General usually isn't this hot-tempered.

252
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,300
Is it because the meeting with Qi Zhen today didn't go smoothly?

253
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,000
Prince Zhan, I didn't hear clearly what exactly happened.

254
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,640
On the way coming here, the Earth Absorbing Bell was stolen.

255
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,800
I have heard long ago that Prince Zhan's meritorious military service has been very illustrious.

256
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,400
How could just a normal thief get close to you?

257
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,000
Did it really get stolen or is it that the Heaven Fiend Nation

258
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,900
didn't have the intention to trade with me to begin with?

259
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,440
What I, Zhan Beiye, hate most is lying!

260
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,000
If I say that it was stolen, it was stolen!

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,190
Is this an honorable thing to mention?

262
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,600
If Prime Minister doesn't believe me,

263
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,300
you can go ask the king.

264
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,600
All the responsibility will be taken by me, Zhan Beiye, alone.

265
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
Prince Zhan, don't be angry.

266
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
I am just anxious.

267
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,100
The Earth Absorbing Bell is the national treasure of Heaven Fiend after all.

268
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,750
It was lost in the area of Deep Water.

269
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,800
Deep Water can't absolve itself from responsibilities, either.

270
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,700
What can we do now?

271
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:14,000
I was the one who lost it, so I will find it!

272
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,800
Since Prince Zhan is saying this, I can't only patiently wait for your good news.

273
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,900
It's just that if it doesn't get found, then the responsibilities?

274
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,560
I will be responsible.

275
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,900
That's good, then.

276
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,800
So it seems that even though Qi Zhen wants our Earth Absorbing Bell,

277
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
he is not actually in a rush to have it.

278
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,900
This is giving General some time to search.

279
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,300
There’s a catch in this.

280
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,300
Why?

281
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,400
Qi Zhen's reaction isn't right.

282
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,140
He should be anxious about having the Earth Absorbing Bell.

283
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,300
However, when I told him today that it was stolen,

284
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,930
though he was surprised,

285
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,400
it seemed more like he faked it.

286
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,800
It is as if he already knew about it.

287
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,400
Can it be?

288
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,400
I am afraid that my suspicions are correct.

289
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,600
What General is saying is that the day when the bell was stolen—

290
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,600
Zhan Beiye, what do you mean by this?

291
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,580
Miss Fuyao, let it go.

292
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
You can kill someone with your random words, do you know that?

293
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,000
Ya Lanzhu was kind enough to make you a table full of food.

294
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,200
Yet you didn't have any, and you even dropped it.

295
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,000
And in front of that many people.

296
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,500
So your reputation is important. Are others' unimportant?

297
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,700
I am talking to you!

298
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,380
It's fine if you are throwing a tantrum, but can you not drag other people down with you?

299
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
I was having a good relationship with Ya Lanzhu.

300
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,100
What you did was make me inhumane and disloyal.

301
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,400
- Ji Yu!
- Here!

302
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
This thing is too noisy!

303
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,700
Shoo her away!

304
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,540
Who are you calling a thing?

305
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,700
You are the thing.

306
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,490
That's not right.

307
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:59,400
You aren't a thing at all.

308
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,210
Calm down. Calm down.

309
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,100
Everyone calm down.

310
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,800
Do you think that I am afraid of you just because you are the general?

311
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
If you want to fight with me, sure.

312
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
I haven't moved my muscles in so long.

313
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,300
Bring it on.

314
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,100
- Let go of me!
- Fifth Older Brother!

315
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,500
I will show you the consequences of getting involved in other people's business.

316
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,100
You!

317
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,490
Stop struggling.

318
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,200
You are the woman whom I have my heart set on!

319
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,800
What did you say?

320
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,200
- Let go!
- Fuyao!

321
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,600
How can you steal my man!

322
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,200
You! Let go of me!

323
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,500
It's him who is harassing me!

324
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,400
That's not okay, either!

325
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,210
You guys! You guys!

326
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,110
Wait!

327
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
What's wrong?

328
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,500
General, it can't be that you really like this miss. Right?

329
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,540
Did I go blind or have I gone insane?

330
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,500
Neither.

331
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,200
What's wrong? Did you really get angry?

332
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,300
Can't you tell that he is intentionally provoking you?

333
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,990
I know that I don't act like a girl.

334
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,500
That's why he doesn't like me.

335
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
You—

336
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:01,500
You are the cutest miss that I have ever met.

337
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,100
How can there be someone who doesn't like you?

338
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,140
Really?

339
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes. Of course, it's true.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,500
But everyone says that I don't act like a girl. That's why he doesn't like me.

341
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,170
This-This Zhan Beiye.

342
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,200
I should really fight him some day.

343
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,900
Make him kneel down and admit that you are in his heart.

344
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,500
How dare you beat Fifth Older Brother?

345
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,190
No! You can't beat Fifth Older Brother!

346
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,800
I-I am helping you take revenge on him.

347
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
Even then, you can't!

348
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,300
So stubborn.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,880
That's right, I am stubborn.

350
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,300
But even though I am so stubborn about him,

351
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,200
he never even hugged me.

352
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,640
Come here.

353
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,400
- Come here.
- No!

354
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,000
- What are you doing?
- Smell it.

355
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,800
- Smell what?
- Smell it.

356
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,610
Do you smell the stinky sweat scent from Zhan Beiye?

357
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
I smell it!

358
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,600
It is quite stinky.

359
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,000
I am giving his stinky hug to you.

360
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,300
Okay!

361
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,300
- Is it stinky?
- It is stinky.

362
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,600
- Is it stinky?
- It is stinky.

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,100
Not angry anymore?

364
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,250
I'm just mad about myself.

365
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,300
If I could be like you,

366
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,460
who dares to fight him and argues with him,

367
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,510
then maybe he... maybe he would actually look at me for once.

368
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,830
But-But every time I meet him,

369
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,660
I just-I just-I just-

370
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,820
I just get nervous. I just want to be nice to him.

371
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,740
I just really want him to be happy.

372
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,220
This way I'll really... want to make him...

373
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,300
extremely happy, that's all.

374
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,170
Yet the more I do this, the more I'm not like myself!

375
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:27,190
Sometimes... I blame myself for letting myself down.

376
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,430
Look at this Zhan Beiye.

377
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,470
If he understood even half of your good,

378
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,810
it would truly be his luck!

379
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,920
Hopefully one day, he can understand.

380
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,910
Silly, there will most definitely be a day.

381
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,260
Wait a minute.

382
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,470
What are you guys going to do?

383
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,130
Don’t both of you know? Today is Double Third Festival.

384
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,930
Double Third Festival?

385
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,320
It’s the biggest praying festival in Deep Water.

386
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,380
If you beg God of Mercury tonight,

387
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,180
your next year will definitely be smooth and your wish will come through.

388
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,430
- Wish will come through... wish...
- Wish...

389
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,150
So it'll come true even if I wish for a marriage, right?

390
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,390
Of course.

391
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,920
There is an immortal being worshiped at Forever Water at the east side of the city.

392
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,250
If you go there, light up a water lantern and tie a red thread tonight,

393
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,970
if you pray and kowtow sincerely,

394
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,200
you can wish for any affectionate partner or lover.

395
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,420
God of Mercury will bless lovers.

396
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:34,460
Is there really such an amazing immortal?

397
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,680
Qing Feng, what date is today?

398
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,990
Why is it so bustling out there?

399
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,030
Mister, according to people in this mansion, today’s Double Third Festival.

400
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,820
Double Third Festival?

401
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,250
Yes.

402
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,310
Father!

403
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,840
Mother!

404
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,370
Come.

405
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,310
So pretty!

406
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,510
So pretty!

407
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,200
I like it.

408
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,970
Mr. Zong.

409
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,950
Why is Prime Minister here?

410
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,730
It has been a few days since Mister came to my manor.

411
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,450
I haven't come to visit you.

412
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,690
I have been a poor host.

413
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:51,110
Prime Minister, thank you.

414
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,190
Today is Double Third Festival.

415
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,720
Double Third Festival is the biggest festival in Capital Kun.

416
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,070
If Mister has some time, why don’t you go out for a walk and relax yourself?

417
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,930
Since Prime Minister mentioned it,

418
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,110
I, Mr. Zong, will definitely do what you said.

419
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,010
It's just that Prime Minister takes time to see me,

420
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,530
and don't tell me it’s just for this.

421
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,930
Indeed, Mister is out of the ordinary.

422
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,980
To be honest, the King’s health is getting worse.

423
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,950
Does Mister have any way to make the King’s condition better,

424
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,830
or...

425
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,860
to look better?

426
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,930
I heard the King is critically ill.

427
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:40,460
If you want him to be cured,

428
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,700
I, Mr. Zong, don’t dare to make promises as well.

429
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,000
But if you only want the King’s condition to be better,

430
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,250
or a momentary recovery of consciousness just before death,

431
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,560
just let me have a look at the King once. I'll know if it's possible.

432
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,640
That’s great.

433
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,380
Let’s do this then.

434
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,510
I’ll choose a day to bring Mister to the palace to have an audience with His Majesty.

435
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,970
All right.

436
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,980
Mister, stay here.

437
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,760
Prime Minster, safe journey.

438
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,520
Older Sis Fuyao, look! There’s a red lantern in the sky.

439
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,960
Whose is that?

440
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,810
Who lighted up such a weird lantern?

441
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,370
He even chose this color.

442
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,950
Yes. Two or three times bigger than others’.

443
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,790
It's so lively that it looks just like a big winter melon.

444
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,910
It looks even weirder than a mountain monster.

445
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,720
I really don’t know what the person who lighted this lantern wished for.

446
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,780
Who knows?

447
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,520
Let’s go.

448
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,510
[Official Post]

449
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,440
General!

450
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,110
Lin Yi?

451
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,960
General, Deep Water's Double Third Festival is counted as one of the big festivals of the Five Regions.

452
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,170
General, why didn’t you go out and have some fun?

453
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,260
I don’t like to have fun.

454
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,180
Is this Zhuqing Wine?

455
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,040
Do you still remember, General?

456
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,200
When I got my son that year,

457
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,440
what we drank was this wine.

458
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:16,720
Right. Thinking about it, five years have passed. Right?

459
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,260
General, since today is Deep Water's Double Third Festival,

460
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,890
I will give General a toast again today.

461
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,430
Good.

462
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,110
General, this is for you.

463
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,510
You've followed me for ten years,

464
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,720
experienced life and death.

465
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,560
This glass of wine is for you.

466
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,820
Drink it. Why are you not drinking it?

467
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,820
Are you afraid that this wine is poisoned?

468
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,690
I asked you to choose an eye-catching one.

469
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:08,540
I didn’t ask you to choose such an ugly one.

470
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,660
No. I just think this lantern color is quite eye-catching.

471
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,230
Mr. Zong will definitely see it.

472
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,450
For its ugliness, I think it’s still okay.

473
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:19,460
I should let Zong Yue treat your eyes.

474
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Have you checked on the place?

475
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,810
I've ordered people to guard it secretly. No one will discover it.

476
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,690
Mister, you don’t have to be worried.

477
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,130
Older Sis Fuyao, look at that.

478
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,100
So many lanterns.

479
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,710
Older Sis Fuyao, look! There’s even a sugar blower.

480
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,050
Hey, both of you, look at this! Pretty Mum Lanterns.

481
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,100
The most popular one is this one.

482
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,560
Look at the handwork and craftsmanship on this. The paper lantern surely is no match to it.

483
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,080
Don't you like it?

484
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,640
- Hortensia Lantern can bring you a good marriage.
- Amazing product in Deep Water. All misses' favorite.

485
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,230
Don’t miss it if you pass by.

486
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,050
Older Sis Fuyao, I’ll go and look for awhile. Wait for me.

487
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,440
I’m telling you. You have to put this on two times a day, during the morning and night.

488
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,590
All right.

489
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:26,000
- Miss.
- What is this?

490
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,900
This is the Facial Toner of Imperial Mud Shop. Good to beautify your skin.

491
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,260
These are the only stocks left. There will be no more if you don’t buy it.

492
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,550
How is it?

493
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,540
I see everyone’s selling Wishing Lanterns, only your shop is selling different things.

494
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,370
The water quality in Deep Water Nation is really good.

495
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,590
All these imperial silts are in top quality,

496
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:47,660
plus a secret recipe of mine.

497
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,090
It's difficult for this Facial Toner to not top the Five Regions.

498
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,810
Miss, have you ever wondered why ladies in our Deep Water

499
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,340
- are the prettiest in the Five Regions?
- Why?

500
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,890
I’m telling you, the secrets are all inside this.

501
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,630
Look.

502
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,980
Help me pack two bottles then. Deliver them to my Official Post.

503
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,780
All right. I’ll definitely deliver them to you.

504
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:22,780
Mister, what are you looking at?

505
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,660
Let’s go.

506
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,740
Older Sister Fuyao.

507
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,870
What’s the matter? Where have you gone? So happy.

508
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:34,830
I’m telling you. I got a treasure which can subdue my Fifth Older Brother.

509
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,060
What kind of treasure? Let me have a look.

510
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,690
I’m not telling you.

511
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,940
Let’s go. Let’s have a look in front.

512
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,660
Let's go.

513
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,920
What’s the matter, Older Sis Fuyao?

514
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,710
Nothing.

515
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,620
Godfather.

516
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,350
How was it?

517
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:13,670
Our inside man in Zhan Beiye's manor should have poisoned himself now.

518
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,340
Even if we can’t kill him with the poison, we had set up a trap as well.

519
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,830
It’s difficult for him to escape from death today.

520
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,600
General, when did you realize?

521
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,620
Do you mean your betrayal or the poison you put in the wine?

522
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,390
It turns out that you already discovered it.

523
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:43,810
It’s just that General didn’t want to believe that you would betray and assassinate your master.

524
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:47,530
When the Earth Absorbing Bell was stolen in Deep Water,

525
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:50,760
General knew there was a spy.

526
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,480
If you aren't a person who is very close to and fully trusted by General,

527
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,420
how would General get tricked by you?

528
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,130
Did you think that General really thinks Fuyao is the thief?

529
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,170
Taking her into custody is only a cover-up.

530
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,310
Why did you betray me?

531
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,010
What do you think, General?

532
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,810
You clearly know that Zhan Nancheng slaughters his comrades. Why do you disregard this?

533
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:21,210
You clearly know Prince Eternal helps the evildoers. Why don't you ask?

534
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:25,780
You clearly know giving Heaven Fiend to this kind of king will make citizens suffer.

535
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,100
Why didn’t you rebel against him?

536
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,950
Is this the reason you wanted to kill me?

537
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:47,760
General, you're no longer the Prince Fierce of those days

538
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,980
who dares to go to great lengths and fight against all the justice.

539
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:58,380
If you still had a little bit of the enthusiasm like in the past on you,

540
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:04,330
I wouldn’t have betrayed General then.

541
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:07,100
You rebel against General and you still have a reason for it!

542
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,950
Things have turned out to be this way.

543
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:11,690
I’ll be responsible for what I did.

544
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,990
I’ll let you punish me at your will.

545
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:23,340
I just want to know the truth now.

546
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,040
Who ordered you?

547
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,220
Where is the Earth Absorbing Bell?

548
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,780
Oh yeah, Zhuzhu.

549
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:40,390
I heard that Zhan Beiye is the third eldest in Heaven Fiend’s royal family.

550
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,730
Why do you call him Fifth Older Brother?

551
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,360
You don’t know.

552
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,350
My Fifth Older Brother has two elder brothers.

553
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,980
The one with a peculiar temper is called Zhan Nancheng.

554
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,770
He just ascended the throne of Heaven Fiend a few years ago.

555
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,500
The one following him obediently is called Zhan Beiheng.

556
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,190
He is the second one.

557
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,310
That’s why my Fifth Older Brother is the third eldest.

558
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,510
But, I’m telling you, the Zhan’s family had two more princes initially.

559
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,410
They are my Fifth Older Brother's half elder brothers by a different mother.

560
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:05,830
I didn’t hear about this, though.

561
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,080
They wanted to fight against Zhan Nancheng for the throne.

562
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,610
They were all killed.

563
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:15,070
Do you mean Prince of Heaven Fiend killed his younger brothers?

564
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,920
Yes. How is this strange?

565
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,270
The situation of an imperial brothers' quarrel and destructive to both sides strife is the most common plot since ancient time.

566
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:24,230
I tell you. Luckily my Fifth Older Brother’s mother’s family is powerful.

567
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:26,730
That’s why Zhan Nancheng didn’t kill him easily.

568
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,770
But even if the situation is like that, my Fifth Older Brother still gives in again and again.

569
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,920
He has handed in the military power and his territory.

570
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,410
People say he’s Prince Fierce of Heaven Fiend that’s just an empty shell.

571
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:38,600
Why is Zhan Beiye doing this?

572
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,870
It’s all because of his mother, Imperial Concubine Jing.

573
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:43,190
My Fifth Older Brother is a well known submissive and obedient son.

574
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,310
Imperial Concubine Jing is in Zhan Nancheng’s hand now.

575
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:49,680
So if Zhan Nancheng asks my Fifth Older Brother to do something, my Fifth Older Brother has to do it.

576
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,260
Eight years ago, you and I put down a rebellion in Shuobei.

577
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,420
During that time, General was not even eighteen years old,

578
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:14,000
but was able to lead a great army to save the critical situation.

579
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,090
I only know that I got shot in my right leg at that time.

580
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:24,060
You were the one who took care of my injury.

581
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:38,230
Two years ago, Zhan Beiheng ordered people to burn my manor secretly when I was out on the battlefield.

582
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:45,200
You were the one who put aside the life of your family and rushed there to save three lives in my manor.

583
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,130
General, you still remember all these.

584
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,010
You helped me.

585
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,890
I, Zhan Beiye, am not a person who doesn't know to return the favor.

586
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,670
I’ll let you go today.

587
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:11,600
But I have to know why even you would betray me?

588
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,260
It has been more than ten years. You were loyal to me.

589
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:26,470
I really don’t know what would make you betray me.

590
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,800
Did Zhan Nancheng threaten you using your family?

591
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:40,030
Was he the one who wants to kill your family?

592
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:43,220
He was the one asking you to steal the Earth Absorbing Bell

593
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,580
so that he could execute me justifiably. Right?

594
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,490
Just as what General suspects.

595
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,750
It’s just that...

596
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,990
Just that... Just that—

597
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:16,610
Lin Yi! Lin Yi! Lin Yi!

598
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,990
Why did you do this?

599
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,900
Betraying General,

600
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,760
my death is not to be regretted.

601
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,020
But if I can’t kill General,

602
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,190
my family can’t live.

603
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,080
- Lin Yi!
- I would like to ask for your forgiveness, General.

604
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:49,060
General, Zhan Nancheng didn't just want to frame you.

605
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:52,800
He-He...

606
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:06,900
Deep Nation is pitted with peril.

607
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,370
General. General, take—

608
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,800
Lin Yi!

609
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:20,030
- Lin Yi!
- Lin Yi!

610
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:23,160
Lin Yi!

611
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,950
Spread out that

612
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:40,720
Lin Yi didn’t finish his task and was killed by me.

613
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,970
- General.
- Only this way

614
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,310
can we make sure his family in Heaven Fiend Nation is safe.
