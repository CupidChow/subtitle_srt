00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:12,320
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,420
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:23,440
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,910
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,000
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,070
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,460
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,030
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,730
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,760
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,900
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,980
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,690
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,420
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,460
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:21,670
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

[Legend of Fuyao]

21
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,320
~ Episode 32 ~

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,970
Your Highness Crown Prince.

23
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,280
When he was twelve years old, there was an uprising in the south border.

24
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,040
Just to obtain the power to rule the grassland, a war broke out between the North and South Tribes.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,980
This brought disaster to the surrounding citizens.

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,420
Crown Prince went there alone.

27
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,530
Everyone thought that Crown Prince would surely die in that journey and would never return.

28
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,040
But unexpectedly, in just three days,

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,290
the kings of North and South Tribes actually became sworn brothers when they initially had a blood debt between them.

30
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,290
Why is that so?

31
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,970
When Crown Prince was 14 years old,

32
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,540
Prince of Riverside incited a rebellion.

33
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,840
He planned to kill Crown Prince Wuji first before forcing the emperor to abdicate his throne.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,540
That night, Prince of Riverside set up a banquet and Crown Prince went in casual clothing.

35
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,570
After three rounds of drinking, Prince of Riverside tried to assassinate him when he was offering him a toast.

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,560
When they placed their wine cups down,

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,530
the one who fell onto the ground and died was Prince of Riverside.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,500
There was poison in the wine, so Crown Prince surely wouldn't drink it.

39
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,280
In the end, the poison got all spit into Prince of Riverside's face.

40
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,380
Put him in a state where he had no face to meet his Zhangsun ancestors.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,810
From the start to the end, the Crown Prince was never tainted with any blood.

42
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,700
This Crown Prince Wuji is extremely cruel and merciless.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,410
Aren't you curious how he did all of it by himself?

44
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,110
Could it be because of Yuan Zhaoxu?

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,140
My son, you're finally back.

46
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,080
Empress Mother, Emperor Father has important matters to attend to.

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,260
It concerns the empire's future, so he won't be able to come.

48
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,370
It's enough that you came.

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,840
Earlier, did you see your Royal Uncle?

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,420
I didn't.

51
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,860
It's been so long since we've seen each other, yet your glabella is still the same.

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,680
When you wrinkle your brows, your brows look as if they are flying towards your temples.

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,700
But this unresolved problem of yours is getting worse.

54
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,990
I haven't served you for so long.

55
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,960
I am unfilial.

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,910
You all leave first.

57
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,390
You've reached the age of marriage.

58
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,940
Having children before ascending to the throne

59
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,070
can calm the people's hearts more.

60
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,480
Now, there is a lot of unrest in the court.

61
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,910
Prince Assist is worrisome.

62
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,440
He has great military power in his hand.

63
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,840
You won't have an easy time as a Crown Prince now, unlike before.

64
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,550
If there is really someone that will rebel,

65
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,280
will you be able to handle it?

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,570
Empress Mother need not get overly vexed with court matters.

67
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,480
What I'm worried about isn't myself.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
It's you.

69
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,750
Of course, I understand Empress Mother's intentions.

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,740
Just focus on taking care of your health.

71
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,290
Leave the court affairs to me.

72
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:44,300
I want you to marry the second princess of Plough, Folian.

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,800
Only by establishing a marital alliance with Plough,

74
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,230
can you maintain a stable hold on your Crown Prince position.

75
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,400
I heard that she's also in the Imperial City.

76
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,190
You two have reached the age to get married.

77
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,350
In my opinion, this matter shouldn't be dragged out anymore.

78
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,060
I...

79
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,980
still need some time.

80
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,550
If you have another lady that you like,

81
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,000
it's no problem to have several wives in the palace.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,350
Just one thing,

83
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,740
the Crown Princess must be Princess Folian.

84
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,350
- Come. Have one.
- Your Highness.

85
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,160
Your Highness.

86
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,990
- Your Highness, you have good alcohol tolerance.
- Come.

87
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,700
- Your Highness, eat one more.
- You also have a share.

88
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,630
Eat some.

89
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,180
Your Highness, here.

90
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,810
Your Highness.

91
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,530
Your Highness!

92
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,570
Your Highness Prince Assist!

93
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,880
Quickly say it.

94
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,220
I have important matters to report.

95
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,730
I've investigated it clearly.

96
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,860
That person who went out with Crown Prince that day is indeed Princess Folian.

97
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,300
That guy actually beat me in making a move.

98
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,420
Your Highness, don't get anxious.

99
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,800
Although Princess Folian and Crown Prince are engaged to be married,

100
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,030
these are all verbal claims.

101
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,250
The one she's marrying is the Megrez Imperial Throne.

102
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,260
It's still not final who will be sitting on that Imperial throne.

103
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,590
Since the Crown Prince has actively made his move,

104
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:48,870
I think that Your Highness shouldn't wait anymore.

105
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,080
If that was some other person in the Imperial City that day,

106
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,060
I would have killed her whole clan.

107
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,100
But I never thought that the heavens would send me Folian.

108
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,180
Since that's the case,

109
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,650
then I'll surely take this Folian.

110
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,230
You liar!

111
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,070
You finally came to find me.

112
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,330
If not because I can't beat you, I would have attacked you a long time ago.

113
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,450
Fine then.

114
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,120
I surely won't fight back this time.

115
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,050
There's no work for you today.

116
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,040
Don't be a bother here.

117
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:10,210
I'm just sunbathing here.

118
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,570
Does that bother you, too?

119
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,610
For these past days, you have kept hiding in your room.

120
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,680
Don't think that I don't know.

121
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,200
I like to.

122
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,930
You're avoiding him.

123
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,910
I don't understand what you're saying.

124
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,870
Did you two do some shameful thing?

125
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,720
What?! I didn't!

126
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,860
You— What nonsense are you saying?

127
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,350
Really none?

128
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,660
None.

129
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,210
If there's none, why are you blushing?

130
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,190
How am I blushing?

131
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,650
I'm blushing because my health is good.

132
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,290
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

133
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,400
This guy has left for so many years.

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,610
Aren't I the one who is handling the internal affairs of the royal clan ever since?

135
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,740
Why are these people in the streets joining in on the fun?

136
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,960
They don't even know what Wuji looks like, yet they are giving him this much prestige.

137
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,950
That's right.

138
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,150
All the attention in the palace has been taken away by the Crown Prince for all these years.

139
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,290
His Majesty also thinks highly of him.

140
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:23,770
But for the past years, what has he learned in Firmament?

141
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,200
Who knows?

142
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,270
Isn't it all because my mother came from a poor family?

143
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:34,800
She couldn't compare to the number one beauty in the Five Regions, Empress Yuan.

144
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,300
But to make me accept my fate,

145
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,790
that will never happen.

146
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,960
What Your Highness means is—

147
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,990
Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it's better to strive for some satisfaction.

148
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,080
How come I get to bump into you everywhere?

149
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,710
I should be the one saying that.

150
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,360
Why did you come here to Mt. Green Bead?

151
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,090
Could it be you're here to taste the fine scale fish from the Green Bead Spring?

152
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,850
What fine scale fish?

153
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,740
Now is the time when the meat quality of the fine scale fishes in Green Bead String is at its best.

154
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,270
- You're fortunate.
- You—

155
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,750
You get the chance to taste it. I'll roast you fish to eat later.

156
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,580
I don't eat fish.

157
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,140
Hey, slow down.

158
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,100
Is the taste okay?

159
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,640
It's okay.

160
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,490
Since the taste is acceptable, how do you plan to repay me?

161
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,740
- Do you still want to be repaid?
- Yes.

162
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay.

163
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,460
This fishbone then.

164
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:51,130
Oh, my. Look at how clean this fish bone was gnawed on, not one bit of meat was left.

165
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,530
So full of murderous spirit.

166
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,350
What good teeth.

167
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,980
I'll treat this as our love token.

168
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,740
It's out.

169
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,650
Let's go.

170
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,500
This way.

171
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,870
What is this place?

172
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,640
This is Herding Spirit Summit,

173
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,390
the place where the Zhangsun royal clan worship their ancestors.

174
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,940
Aren't all worship places just similar? What's there to look at?

175
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,730
Quiet. Look over there. That area.

176
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,940
It likes you.

177
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,080
This is Herding Spirit King, God of Farming of Five Regions.

178
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,070
This is the most venerated god of the Zhangsun royal clan.

179
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,360
But even if you're a member of the royal clan, it's rare to be able to see it.

180
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,720
What will happen if you see it?

181
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,480
There's a very romantic meaning to it.

182
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,680
- Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.

183
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,710
It hints that you two will go through a journey

184
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:02,770
that represents a pure, brave, and unselfish love.

185
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,110
You made that up, didn't you?

186
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:11,340
No matter how great my ability is, I can't order the Herding Spirit King around. Right?

187
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,550
Since I came down the mountain, I indeed have encountered a lot of danger.

188
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,910
I also saw all kinds of human attitudes.

189
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,450
There are extremely good and bad ones.

190
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:29,160
It's just that I don't know where this pure love and that other person is.

191
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,100
Do you still not know until now?

192
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,500
Correct. Of course.

193
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,360
Since I met you in Mt. Mystic Soul,

194
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,090
we've accompanied each other along the way.

195
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,040
In Deep Water, you even became my queen.

196
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,590
You count as my wife already.

197
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,630
I—

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,290
Who is your wife?

199
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,700
You were actually a fake king. I'm not a real queen, either.

200
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,020
Tell me then,

201
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:05,620
is it the will of the heavens to let me bump into you here again?

202
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,160
What will of the heavens? I couldn't understand any of it.

203
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,570
I fear that the secret of the Megrez Imperial City can't be hidden any longer.

204
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,500
Have all the envoys from the different nations of Five Regions arrived?

205
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,400
Replying to Your Majesty, they are all here.

206
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,230
[Map of Five Regions]

207
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,780
Informing Empress, it has spread in the whole city that Xuanji Folian has entered the city.

208
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,950
But until today, she still hasn't taken the initiative to make an appearance.

209
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,150
I also never heard any news about her.

210
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:33,420
That's strange.

211
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,270
The envoy from Deep Water entered the palace upon arriving.

212
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,960
This Saintess of the Five Regions has entered the city, but doesn't enter the palace.

213
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:50,260
Even if there are charitable matters that she must handle, how come there isn't any news about them at all?

214
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,210
Could it be that Plough has some other plans?

215
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:06,250
But I also heard that First Royal Son already went to personally welcome this Princess Folian.

216
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,460
Why didn't you say so earlier?

217
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,850
This Prince Assist indeed couldn't contain himself anymore.

218
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,850
Mister, the envoys from Heaven Fiend and Deep Water have arrived.

219
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,680
The ones who came are Prince Eternal of Heaven Fiend and Lady Virtue of Deep Water.

220
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,930
You want to ask why I'm not showing myself. Am I right?

221
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,310
But I just can't understand

222
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,930
why His Majesty called for them at this time.

223
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,570
I keep feeling that something is off.

224
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,040
That's right. Just some customary engagement ceremony.

225
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,550
What's there to give a big fuss about?

226
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,200
You shouldn't put it that way.

227
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,390
Your matter is never a minor matter.

228
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:00,340
At this time, even if you don't like it,

229
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,030
not making an appearance seems to be inappropriate.

230
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:05,400
Someone is more willing to do that than me.

231
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,820
Why bother competing with him?

232
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,690
It's just that this Princess Folian has entered the city for quite some time.

233
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,320
The whole imperial court is discussing why Mister isn't going out to welcome her.

234
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,110
Folian and I got involved in this charcoal fire upon birth, complicatedly burning.

235
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,280
We can only follow other people's whims.

236
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,750
Regardless of if we are willing or not, we can only accept.

237
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:36,380
Actually, what the citizens are gossiping about is not only the glory of two matched families.

238
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,030
Right now, everyone is looking forward to this wedding.

239
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,300
How come at this time, you are instead avoiding it?

240
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,000
Are you worrying about me or Folian?

241
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,790
I... Of course, I...

242
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,950
It's just that I feel that Prince Assist has always been coveting this marriage.

243
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,970
What advantage can he get from it?

244
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:05,360
Advantage?

245
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,250
Could it be that all the choices I made in my life are all just for the advantage that they see?

246
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,780
This marriage is mine, but no one ever asked me what my plans are.

247
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,800
Empress Mother is forcing me to marry a golden phoenix.

248
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,390
Behind, there is still Zhangsun Pingrong eagerly looking.

249
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,070
In their eyes, there's only that gold buried under Plough.

250
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,680
Tell me, am I avoiding Folian or their intentions?

251
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,400
Hey, where are you going?

252
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,640
Have you forgotten what day today is?

253
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:42,940
Could it be Mr. Zong?

254
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,440
Does Empress mean to just welcome Princess Folian to stay here in the palace?

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,920
Or do you want me to wait for that Zhangsun Pingrong to succeed before discussing this?

256
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,940
I said the wrong words.

257
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,360
Empress has placed a lot of effort just to fulfill this wedding.

258
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,730
Crown Prince surely can understand your intentions.

259
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,170
Of course, he understands.

260
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,020
You are?

261
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,390
Saintess Folian.

262
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,050
May I ask why you're here?

263
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:36,620
How can someone of noble status like you live in this shabby place?

264
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,170
I really can't bear to see it.

265
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,360
My Megrez didn't serve you well.

266
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,310
Hope you won't mind.

267
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,210
How did you know that I was living here?

268
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,800
I am the Lodging Guards Captain of Megrez.

269
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,710
For major and minor matters, here in the Imperial City,

270
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,200
even if it's just about a mouse hiding in which house, I will know them all.

271
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,830
The more if it's about you, the highly admired Saintess Folian of the Five Regions.

272
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,420
Since that's the case, Your Highness must have a lot of official matters to take care of and is a busy man.

273
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,020
Then, I won't disturb you anymore.

274
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,410
I won't entertain you anymore. I'll take my leave.

275
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,960
Forgive me for being frank.

276
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,020
I came today to welcome you into the palace.

277
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,210
No, Mr. Zong said that you can't casually leave.

278
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,160
Princess, I have no evil intentions.

279
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,330
I'm fetching you to enter the palace just to pacify the discussions in the court and the common people.

280
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,470
Second, so that you can prepare for tomorrow's grand ceremony in advance.

281
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,130
Grand ceremony?

282
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,970
As an envoy of Plough, you will be attending tomorrow's grand ceremony.

283
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,320
Have you forgotten?

284
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,980
Of course, I didn't forget.

285
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,070
I'll go with you now.

286
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,480
Princess!

287
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,100
Qiaoling?

288
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,320
Empress Yuan has given an order.

289
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,260
Your Highness, someone is blocking our path.

290
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,770
How dare you.

291
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,350
Who dares to block my path?

292
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,330
I was ordered to take Princess Folian back to the palace for a chat.

293
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,200
Thank you Your Highness Prince Assist for escorting her.

294
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,150
I will abide.

295
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,990
Princess, please.

296
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,710
The palace only invited the Princess.

297
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,960
I fear that this lady can't come with us.

298
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,410
Prince, tell us.

299
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,360
What's going on?

300
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,090
The Imperial City requested us to rush here with the top urgent Imperial edict.

301
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,500
It couldn't be as simple as attending the Crown Prince's engagement, right?

302
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,970
The top urgent Imperial edict can only be used during calamities, wars,

303
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,030
or when a nation at the brink of destruction.

304
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,850
Of course, it's not that simple.

305
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,530
Has an unforeseen event happened?

306
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,540
The Five Regions is one body to begin with.

307
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,050
The good fortune or disaster of Megrez has always been mutually connected with yours.

308
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,500
I heard that recently

309
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,860
there had been anomalies happening in each nation.

310
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,850
Those words are true.

311
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,170
It's been raining continuously in Deep Water and the river wall has collapsed.

312
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,000
This... hasn't happened for hundreds of years.

313
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,020
What about Heaven Fiend?

314
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,340
Everything is normal in Rock City.

315
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,290
But we received reports that in Geya Desert,

316
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,770
those things... seem to be gathering and preparing for something.

317
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:09,750
There were even people who said that they've seen poison bees.

318
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,030
When the Five Regions were divided and established,

319
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,530
yin and yang was in good order and the poison bees also completely disappeared.

320
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,270
But recently, the grounds in Geya kept shaking.

321
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,420
It seems as if something is moving about.

322
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,810
The poison bees are the guards of the Underground Tomb.

323
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,380
Anyone who sees it will surely die.

324
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,980
If there are thousands of poison bees coming out altogether,

325
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,260
either they are out to kill or act as guide for dead people.

326
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,240
There is also news coming from Plough.

327
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,180
They said that the volcano suddenly erupted and magma came out everywhere.

328
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,810
A lot of gold in their treasury got melted.

329
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:48,390
Prince, the different nations who are experiencing urgent situations

330
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,860
have come here after receiving your urgent call.

331
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:55,150
How come this Xuanji Folian has still not appeared?

332
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,050
Greetings, Empress Kindness.

333
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,730
The first purpose of Princess Folian is to have political discussion.

334
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,240
The second purpose is the marital alliance.

335
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,010
The ceremony tomorrow has a lot of complicated requirements.

336
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,010
Of course, she needs to personally prepare them.

337
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,860
She will also know about whatever we get to discuss here.

338
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,390
In front of us are several anomalies.

339
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,150
What do you two think about it?

340
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,870
After the Firmament Great War during the ancient time, the Five Regions got divided and ruled as such.

341
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:49,360
Megrez was in charge of supervising the different nations.

342
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,050
For thousands of years, although there were power struggles,

343
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:59,230
overall the world was in a state of balance, peace, and well being.

344
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,290
But we all know that

345
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:05,230
in this world, there isn't any forever peace.

346
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,550
That sealed power has always been readying to make trouble.

347
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:11,530
Prince Virtue,

348
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,870
there are some words that mustn't be said.

349
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:18,710
Prince said earlier that the fortune of Megrez is mutually connected with the different nations.

350
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,810
Now that there are anomalies all over,

351
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,570
how is Megrez then?

352
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,480
Megrez was able to become the heart of the Five Regions.

353
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,700
That's all thanks to the Winged Tree for holding everything together.

354
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,800
But now, the Winged Tree is showing signs of withering.

355
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:38,970
Megrez will soon face a great catastrophe.

356
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,620
Could it be that Lord Emperor, he... ?

357
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,060
His Majesty is doing very well.

358
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,240
But his cultivation has nothing to do with the disaster Megrez is facing.

359
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,530
We are in desperate times and will need desperate methods.

360
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,700
You are a very smart lady.

361
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,560
I was just thinking that even in this Megrez Imperial City,

362
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,210
it's not that common to see people with an outstanding aura like you.

363
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:19,210
Although I haven't seen you before, I sense some familiarity in your eyes.

364
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,980
Perhaps, only the mother of the Five Regions can give out such cordial feeling.

365
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,810
Hence, I hastily guessed that you are Empress Kindness.

366
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,830
I only heard that Saintess Folian

367
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:36,570
is saving and caring about the citizens of this world.

368
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,340
Never thought that you are this clever and eloquent,

369
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,330
this beautiful and adorable.

370
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,300
I heard that you were saving refugees outside the city.

371
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,940
You do everything personally.

372
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,790
Is that true?

373
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:58,240
Yes. The virus of an epidemic is devastating the citizens.

374
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,060
They are poor people to begin with.

375
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,070
After contracting such a bad illness, there surely won't be any clinic that will accept them.

376
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,880
Hence, since I saw it, I offered some help.

377
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,110
These past years, you've been setting up kitchens,

378
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,540
medical clinics, and private schools everywhere.

379
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,910
But you don't accept any payment from those that come.

380
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:21,230
It's fine if they were all poor citizens.

381
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,640
But a lot of them are not.

382
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,330
Even if your Plough is very rich, you'll also reach a state of extreme poverty eventually.

383
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,510
Why then did you do such things?

384
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,380
May I ask Empress if you also will especially divide the standards of poverty

385
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,950
and use money in terms of social class?

386
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,660
Of course, I won't.

387
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,740
Both of you, please look.

388
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,800
Without the Winged Tree, Megrez will not be Megrez anymore.

389
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,430
The sky and land of the Five Regions will also collapse.

390
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,610
What should we do then?

391
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,140
Is there any way to resolve this?

392
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,530
Although you two haven't gotten married,

393
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:35,270
the whole world knows that you, Folian, are Wuji's woman.

394
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,360
There are some words that I am going to say now.

395
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,210
Marrying you to Wuji and letting you become the Crown Princess of Megrez

396
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:49,190
is equivalent to marrying the reputation of Megrez.

397
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,560
From now on,

398
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,870
everything isn't just your individual act,

399
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,830
but an act bearing the royal family's reputation.

400
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:05,290
In your eyes, you can only have one man, your husband Wuji.

401
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,760
There mustn't be anymore instances of sharing a room together with a man with just the two of you.

402
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,230
Even if it's to save the poor and troubled or study herbs.

403
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,500
You all leave first.

404
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,170
Yes.

405
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,380
The four nations of the Five Regions plus Firmament Shrine

406
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,230
make up the fiver powers, gold, wood, water, fire, and earth.

407
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,900
Presently, we can only gather the different power of each nation, pieced together by that Royal World Heart,

408
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,960
so as to temporarily dissolve this crisis.

409
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,590
So, that's the case.

410
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,730
No wonder it was mentioned in the urgent Imperial edict that we bring our nation's territorial map.

411
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,930
Indeed.

412
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,020
At this moment, Lord Emperor has obtained the power of Firmament.

413
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,780
Megrez, Deep Water, and Heaven Fiend will also be submitting our respective territorial maps.

414
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,560
What's most important now is the Plough lava rock that Princess Folian will be submitting.

415
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,080
Stay here and guard.

416
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,290
Mister, just let me go in first.

417
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,230
If Mr. Zong is really inside, you can just come in by then.

418
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:32,330
- You won't be able to handle it.
- I—

419
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,170
What?

420
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,430
You're not willing to hear these?

421
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,150
I am just grieving for the women in this world.

422
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,840
All men are allowed to have numerous wives and concubines.

423
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,630
They see it as prestige.

424
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,320
But for a woman, just a slight interaction with the opposite gender,

425
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,260
then it's being slutty and shameful.

426
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,210
Both were born after ten months and raised with the same grains, why must there be such a huge difference?

427
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,840
Megrez has supreme fame.

428
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,750
Plough has limitless wealth.

429
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,030
After this marital alliance, the bloodlines of the two nations will be connected.

430
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,210
Wealth and fame will both be present.

431
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,920
Empress, could it be that in your eyes Wuji's marriage is just a deal?

432
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,940
Have you never considered

433
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:41,980
that the person who lives with Crown Prince Wuji for the rest of his life, might not be the person that he wanted?

434
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,100
Are you doubting this marital alliance

435
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,350
or putting too much importance on your reputation as the Saintess of the Five Regions?

436
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,130
There are numerous women in this world who wanted to marry Wuji.

437
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,500
Since he is the crown prince,

438
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,240
of course, we must be careful in choosing his consort.

439
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,990
That year, it was unexpected that you two would meet in Plough.

440
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,710
If not because you persistently wrote letters every five days

441
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,390
and gave gifts every ten days to show how you missed Wuji,

442
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:23,640
so what if you're the Saintess of Five Regions?

443
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,190
Even if you're a member of the Plough royal family, in terms of succession,

444
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,980
it might not have been you who would be married off to Megrez. Am I right?

445
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,710
Empress, you're right to lecture me.

446
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,990
I will remember it.

447
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,330
From now on, in this Megrez Royal Palace,

448
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:50,180
there won't be any more Saintess of Five Regions.

449
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:55,300
You will only be Wuji's Crown Princess.

450
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,340
Why must you do this?

451
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,160
Oh, no!

452
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,550
Prince Eternal and Lady Virtue have gone to rest.

453
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:54,610
It has been some time since Princess Folian and Empress have been talking inside Cool Mist Palace Hall.

454
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,610
Today, it was Prince Assist who went to fetch Princess Folian.

455
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:01,330
Midway, Empress forcefully took her away.

456
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,690
This gossip has already spread throughout the palace.

457
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,800
Her son is getting married.

458
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,620
Of course, she must personally intervene.

459
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:17,360
Moreover, how much money and how many positions are at stake in the marital alliance with Plough?

460
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,040
Of course, it can't be done carelessly.

461
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:24,570
Going back to it, Empress Kindness is already steadily sitting on and has the world at her feet.

462
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,340
Yet, she still firmly holds on to the Imperial power and worries about her son's future.

463
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,320
She's really taxing her mind too much.

464
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,010
What she thinks highly of has never been any imperial power, wealth, or splendor.

465
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,550
It's just that only if you're standing above everyone

466
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,310
can you not get ordered around by that Imperial power.

467
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,910
Today, if Empress didn't intercept to take Folian away,

468
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:58,260
the person that Folian will be marrying tomorrow might have changed.

469
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,340
That's right.

470
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,590
They all say that Prince Assist has always hoped to create family ties with Plough,

471
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,220
so as to strengthen his power.

472
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:10,200
Watching how Prince Assist's power kept increasing,

473
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,250
it's Crown Prince instead who has no hold in the Imperial court.

474
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,970
The officials have long been divided into two groups.

475
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,700
Prince, on what side are you standing this time?

476
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,600
You surely are able to notice the intentions of Prince Assist.

477
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,670
Whatever Wuji wants, he wants,

478
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,290
and that includes you.

479
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,090
In the future, if it's not for some important reason,

480
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,350
it's better that you two don't see each other.

481
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,670
You... have been monitoring me?

482
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:59,090
How prestigious is the Megrez royal family?

483
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,680
It's able to offer to the altar or break into pieces.

484
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:08,790
Since you're going to be Wuji's Crown Princess,

485
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:14,800
going to be above everyone else, you must of course pay a price.

486
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:24,040
From now on, your every word and every move cannot have any mishap.

487
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:30,070
Remember that there will forever be someone secretly monitoring you,

488
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,390
day and night.

489
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,150
It's now late.

490
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,650
Just stay in my palace for tonight.

491
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:45,020
How can I dare trouble you?

492
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,550
Your status is special.

493
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:53,970
There are a lot of people plotting about you.

494
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,880
It won't be bad for you to stay here.

495
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,750
Awake?

496
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,820
Your method of martial arts cultivation is too sinister.

497
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,800
If you continue, it's already uncontrollable by just mere mortal strength.

498
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,470
Aren't you afraid of eventually being unable to wake up permanently?

499
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,820
With you being so loud, how can I sleep?

500
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,640
There are always a lot of paths to take for everything, except this.

501
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,140
Once you start, you're unable to look back.

502
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,490
Looks like from now on, you must stick to me.

503
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,630
You don't need to do this.

504
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,690
I'm able to handle it by myself.

505
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,970
Fei Yan has been here?

506
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,240
Your Highness, an important guest has visited.

507
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,720
I'm not seeing anyone.

508
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,360
Are you not seeing me, either?

509
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,990
Looks like Folian and Crown Prince Wuji are really in love.

510
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,590
But they had to get separated when they only started to be together.

511
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,200
And that separation was several years.

512
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,760
If that is some other person, they wouldn't be able to persist.

513
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,670
Indeed. For these past ten years, Mistress thought and yearned for him every day.

514
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,810
Good thing, Crown Prince also thought about her in his heart and didn't betray this love.

515
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:16,400
People say that there are thousands of trials in love.

516
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,830
And in the end, you'll be able to find a way to connect.

517
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,220
Fei Yan?

518
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,940
Are you saying Fei Yan?

519
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,090
Firmament High Immortal Fei Yan.

520
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,580
Although she commonly employs some black magic,

521
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:38,480
she's not an evil person.

522
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,510
Why would she teach you such a sinister method?

523
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,730
If it wasn't sinister, I might not have survived.

524
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,490
When the Heir Apparent's Manor got massacred back then and

525
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:52,600
I climbed out of a pile of corpses,

526
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,160
I was only half alive.

527
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,080
It was Fei Yan who saved me and took me in.

528
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,180
She taught me martial arts and medical skills.

529
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,550
Fei Yan never helps people without a condition.

530
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,940
For her to teach you such medical skills, she must have taken away more.

531
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,100
What did you give her?

532
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,100
Forty years of my life span.

533
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,920
Don't calculate anymore. You won't be able to calculate it anyway.

534
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,950
This matter has nothing to do with you and you won't be able to help, either.

535
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,180
Are you living...

536
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,530
just to seek revenge?

537
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,950

♫ What do you know? ♫

♫ What are good about the three realms? ♫

♫ If there're no three poisons, if there're no worries ♫

♫ How can it make me reluctant to leave? ♫

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,110
♫ Worry for love, beg for hate ♫
