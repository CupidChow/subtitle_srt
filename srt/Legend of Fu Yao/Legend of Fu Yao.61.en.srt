00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,300
♫ I start to dance nimbly and gracefully ♫

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,400
♫ For what my beautiful face is frowned? ♫

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,900
♫ Without him, I'll drift with the current ♫

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,830
♫ Why is the tune of the zither a farewell song? ♫

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ Without me, he'll be lonely in this universe ♫

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,000
♫ My heart silently waits at the cliff of Firmament ♫

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,420
♫ The heaven, the earth, the sun and the moon are all in my bosom ♫

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,000
♫ How can I own the top freedom in this world? ♫

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
♫ There is no fear from my heart ♫

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,600
♫ Deep love won't hide ♫

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,800
♫ True love won't run short ♫

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,000
♫ Dreams give hopes through all the ages ♫

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,600
♫ Why go through storms and stress to be bright and beautiful? ♫

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,300
♫ There is no struggle from my heart ♫

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,300
♫ Swaying along with the wind ♫

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:21,500
♫ I can do anything freely ♫

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,700
♫ I enter my dreams easily and unrestrainedly ♫

19
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,400
♫ What a beautiful dance ♫

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,900
~ Episode 61 ~

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,000
Your Highness, where are we going now?

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,300
Go back.

24
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,820
What?

25
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,600
Go back to the Imperial City.

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,400
If we rush back to the Imperial City now, then that's walking right into the trap.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,600
Could it be that Your Highness still has some other plans?

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,300
Plan?

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,300
This is my last plan.

30
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,100
I've long secretly taken notes of the configuration of Zhangsun Jia's army.

31
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,340
If he isn't reliable,

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,200
this then will be my last life-saving straw.

33
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,900
Your Highness is wise.

34
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,100
If a person doesn't know to leave himself grounds for retreat,

35
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,700
then that's forcing oneself to walk a doomed path!

36
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,700
When we return to the Imperial City,

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,300
Your Highness can tell His Majesty that just for the empire,

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,700
you bore the humiliation and sided with the enemy so that you could investigate their military situation.

39
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,200
Your Highness is, after all, His Majesty's own flesh and blood.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,900
His Majesty will be lenient.

41
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes!

42
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,400
No matter how my Emperor Father will punish me,

43
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,600
as long as I'm alive, that's way better than anything!

44
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,810
Right?

45
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,240
Xu Lai,

46
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,990
do you know what I have done wrong?

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,600
My mistake is getting born in this imperial family, be this unfavored son,

48
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,300
and being unable to resign to my fate!

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,600
Your Highness, don't blame me.

50
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
You can only blame the unfairness of this world.

51
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,000
I've followed you for such a long time and just wanted to have a good future.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,800
You have now lost your power.

53
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,600
I have to find myself a way to survive, right?

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,430
Prince Virtue said that we wouldn't be able to depend on you sooner or later.

55
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,600
If you escape, I must kill you.

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,200
For a person like me, I never had any principles.

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,800
I only care about who's stand I'm taking and not who's right or wrong.

58
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,900
You were the one who taught me all this.

59
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,270
Young Lord, it's already about 1:00 a.m.

60
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,170
You should rest.

61
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,770
Tell me.

62
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,390
If these chess pieces had thoughts,

63
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,440
what would they be thinking?

64
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:24,180
The world is like a game of chess.

65
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:32,600
Although we're not chess pieces, we'll hold ourselves back involuntarily because we are unwilling to be manipulated.

66
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,800
After a long time, we'll forget the principle that even if we keep calculating our wins and losses,

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,800
we won't be able to escape this small area.

68
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,500
Who really is this person that you're talking about?

69
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,000
Who do you think?

70
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,600
It can't be the person that I'm thinking...

71
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,200
But in doing this,

72
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,960
what is his purpose exactly?

73
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,160
It's for? Who is he targeting?

74
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
Is it Prince Virtue?

75
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Or you?

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,800
Could... Could it be Wuji?

77
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
You are quite clever.

78
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,130
This?

79
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I don't understand.

80
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,100
Of course, you wouldn't understand.

81
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,800
All of these can only be explained by the past.

82
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,280
That year, I was just 16,

83
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:03,600
but in my heart, I was already deeply in love with a certain person.

84
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,760
We wanted to be together for a lifetime.

85
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,000
When he was preparing to go to my house and ask for my hand in marriage,

86
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,800
the newly crowned Lord Emperor announced that he wanted to marry me.

87
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,200
I didn't want to get married.

88
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
I wanted to escape.

89
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,560
But behind us, there were a lot of loved ones.

90
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,010
In the end, I hesitated.

91
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,420
He gave up.

92
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,190
But only when I married into the palace did I know

93
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,350
that the emperor who married me didn't really care about me.

94
00:07:54,860 --> 00:08:01,330
Everything he did was just to separate us.

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,700
If it's not doing it for Wuji,

96
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,600
for him to be able to become the emperor one day,

97
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:19,100
I would have long given up on all these things and just went away with him.

98
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,400
As long as one can be with the person she loves,

99
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:34,200
those gossiping mouths and a chaotic world wouldn't really mean a thing.

100
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to leave?

101
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,980
Want to live paradise-like days with him?

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,600
Your ideas are possible, too.

103
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,900
But Empress,

104
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,800
you always like to mix reality with imagination.

105
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,400
In this world, how can there be so much romanticism and sweetness?

106
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Informing Prince.

107
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,200
Was your injury grave?

108
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I was incompetent.

109
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
Did you get any information?

110
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,400
Empress indeed got abducted by His Majesty.

111
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,000
Is it that our plan got leaked in advance?

112
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes.

113
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,150
I risked my life to return and inform you.

114
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,800
I fear that the other palace spies are already—

115
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,600
Do you know where she's being locked up right now?

116
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,900
His Majesty did this matter in a very covert manner.

117
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,800
I wasn't able to find it out in the palace.

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,700
Leave and get your wounds treated.

119
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,420
I wasn't able to fulfill your order.

120
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,400
I deserve to die! May Prince punish me.

121
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,000
It's fine.

122
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,050
This wasn't your fault, either.

123
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,890
Go now.

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Prince, the reinforcements that Crown Prince mobilized have arrived through the southern mountain pass.

125
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,400
Roughly estimating it, there are more than 300,000 of them.

126
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Also, they seemed to be trying to surround us.

127
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,700
Our plan—

128
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Spread my order, we'll go to battle tomorrow.

129
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,800
When they see the smoke signal, let General Ma set out to war.

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,600
What about our arrangements in the palace?

131
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I still have to carefully think about it.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,600
Leave now.

133
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

134
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Leave now.

135
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,240
I'll send men to escort you.

136
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,220
Nothing bad will happen to you.

137
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,430
In the past, it's me who was unfaithful to you.

138
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:35,400
If there are sins, mistakes, or retributions, they should all be paid by me.

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,760
It's me who didn't take good care of you two.

140
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,970
In the future, I fear that I won't have any chance to make up for it anymore.

141
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,110
The only thing I can do now is to let you go,

142
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,100
let you live well.

143
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:05,580
Why don't you ask for the reason that I took Lian'er and left without a word back then?

144
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,650
Where have I been hiding all these years?

145
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,190
How did I live my days?

146
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,630
I was disloyal to you at that time.

147
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,140
You should hate me.

148
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,940
I didn't search for you two then, not because I was heartless,

149
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
but because staying farther away from me

150
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,410
might allow you two to live better.

151
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Live better?

152
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,680
You totally don't know what happened that time.

153
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,100
What really do you want to do?

154
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,940
Try guessing where Wuji's army is now.

155
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,460
No...

156
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,220
Wuji is the Crown Prince of Megrez!

157
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,130
He's your son! You!

158
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,450
You shouldn't treat him like this!

159
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,060
You're going to harm Wuji?

160
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,260
Isn't it enough that you take Zhangsun Jia's and my lives?

161
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,000
Why must you still involve Wuji in this?

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,490
What mistake has he done?

163
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,400
Wuji respected you so much!

164
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,500
You actually want to use him to seek revenge?

165
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,490
You all think that I'm using others,

166
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,230
but have you ever realized that the whole Megrez is also using me?

167
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,200
The Lord Emperor may look like he has power over the whole world, but that's not actually the case.

168
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,480
He's being restricted by the Five Regions, being exhausted by millions of citizens.

169
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,680
You all have seen that.

170
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,340
We still have time today.

171
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,790
In here, I'll tell you two a story.

172
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,930
Maybe after today,

173
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:10,770
no one will know about the origin of this matter anymore.

174
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,980
Once, there was a pair of brothers born from the same mother and grew up together.

175
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,780
It can be said that they had deep affection for each other.

176
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,830
The little brother was intelligent and quick-witted, easily earning the doting of people.

177
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:35,870
Everyone would love him a bit more.

178
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:41,510
And this older brother was young but lacked vigor and drive, was not eloquent.

179
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:50,550
His father treated this character of his as being mediocre and dull.

180
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,550
He wasn't good at explaining,

181
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,360
so he just focused on studying hard

182
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
from early in the morning to late at night;

183
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,660
hoping that one day,

184
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,290
he could unburden his parents of some responsibilities.

185
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,450
You have guessed it, right?

186
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,510
The younger brother is Zhangsun Jia.

187
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,620
And that older brother who their father assumed to be dull is me.

188
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,490
Afterwards,

189
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:32,230
my Emperor Father never hid his favoritism of Zhangsun Jia.

190
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,930
Everyone in the whole empire knew it.

191
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,450
After conferring me as the Crown Prince,

192
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:45,920
the voices of people wanting to remove me and make Zhangsun Jia as the Crown Prince never stopped,

193
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,210
but my Emperor Father never did so.

194
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,080
Fuyao, do you know why?

195
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,750
Maybe... because your Emperor Father still cared about you.

196
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,470
That's also what I initially thought.

197
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,350
The emperor position of our Megrez is really an ominous one.

198
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,010
For the past three or four emperors, not one was able to live beyond forty years old.

199
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,240
With His Majesty suddenly collapsing from sickness now, it must be an unlucky sign.

200
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,440
To tell you the truth, based on His Majesty's appearance earlier, he probably will just last for three to five days.

201
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,910
Even if they are able to come up with a method to save him, I fear that it's already too late.

202
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,990
But we must preserve our life.

203
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,290
Of course.

204
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,980
I heard that someone just died in the palace today.

205
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,460
What's that about?

206
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,020
Someone wanted to suggest making Second Prince as the crown prince.

207
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,770
This angered His Majesty so much that he ordered his execution right there and then.

208
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,320
But hasn't His Majesty always favored Second Prince?

209
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,200
Since he loves him so dearly, how can he bear to let him suffer that evil curse of the royal throne?

210
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,240
That's right, too.

211
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,970
Before, I heard His Majesty told Her Ladyship that this Second Prince is his favorite.

212
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,620
He surely won't let him unfairly die just for the Five Regions.

213
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,790
So, they were talking about this?

214
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,740
Yes. Think about it.

215
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,750
If he becomes the emperor, he'll only be able to live up to thirty plus years.

216
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:09,100
But isn't this being too unfair to Crown Prince?

217
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,650
But afterwards, I learned that Emperor Father clearly knew

218
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,950
that the emperor throne of Megrez is a deadlock that no one can break.

219
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:28,060
And I was just a chess piece in his hand that he pushed into that throne.

220
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:33,180
In the end, I am a sacrificial offering to the throne of Megrez Empire!

221
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,570
A sacrificial offering!

222
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:39,760
Since you knew it yourself, why didn't you make a choice?

223
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,120
You still couldn't let go of that supreme power.

224
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,280
Of course, I've thought about it.

225
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,660
I realized that even if I won't get a good death while on this throne,

226
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,120
but other than the life of myself,

227
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,450
I will be able to control the life and death of everyone!

228
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,060
Yours, hers, the life and death of all of you!

229
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,620
Your Majesty,

230
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:05,450
but after all, you are still on that throne for so many years.

231
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,120
It's enough to prove that those short life rumors were false.

232
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,060
Those rumors are not false.

233
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:16,950
This deadlock was broken by using several decades of my time to suffer pain for a lifetime as an exchange.

234
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,430
But so what?

235
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,650
The descendants of Zhangsun can now forever be rid of this curse.

236
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,060
In my Megrez imperial throne,

237
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,680
the heir can now live for a very long time,

238
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,270
so all this pain is nothing.

239
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,470
Your Majesty, since that's the case, why then must you—

240
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,560
Because someone betrayed me!

241
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,790
Not only a betrayal, she caused an emperor to suffer humiliation!

242
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,740
So... you've known it all along?

243
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:18,570
Empress... I want you to tell it to me personally.

244
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,640
Whose son is Wuji?

245
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,300
It's...

246
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,900
Wuji is...

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,390
Wuji is—

248
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,090
For all these years,

249
00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:00,230
have you always thought that it was because I discovered your affair with Empress,

250
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,520
I took Lian'er and left in a rage?

251
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,130
I indeed believed so.

252
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,040
Yes.

253
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:21,010
The peach flower blossomed so beautifully that year.

254
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,150
I brought Lian'er to the palace to admire the flowers.

255
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:30,620
If not because we accidentally saw you and Empress secretly meeting,

256
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,360
we wouldn't have left in a rush.

257
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,940
Even more, we wouldn't have lost our way inside the palace

258
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,000
and heard things that we shouldn't have heard.

259
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,060
Mother, where are we going?

260
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,140
Mother?

261
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,610
- I'll take you home.
- Your Majesty!

262
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,730
These past years, Pingrong and I never did anything wrong.

263
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,470
How come the one who was appointed to be a crown prince today is her son?

264
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,960
The royal throne of Megrez has always been for the most talented and not who is the eldest.

265
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,820
Wuji has been outstanding since he was little.

266
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,560
And now, he has been chosen as a student of the Evergreen Shrine in Firmament.

267
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,000
Making Wuji the crown prince is what the public desires.

268
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,540
But Pingrong, Pingrong is your biological son.

269
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,250
Your Majesty, you clearly know

270
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,920
that Wuji... Wuji is just an illegitimate child!

271
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,650
Shut up!

272
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,200
Mother...

273
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:46,750
That day, I learned about the greatest secret of the imperial palace.

274
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,490
I was so afraid.

275
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,040
I...

276
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:01,530
I was afraid...

277
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,370
I took Lian'er and tried to escape for our lives and

278
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,820
escape back home.

279
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,170
The only thing I could think of was you.

280
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:14,800
I didn't care what you'd done.

281
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,000
As long as you could preserve Lian'er's life, I could overlook everything else.

282
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,390
But where were you?

283
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,840
You were in the warm embrace of that woman, while Lian'er and I were being chased to be killed!

284
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,060
Go look around. They are just nearby.

285
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,150
Don't make a sound.

286
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:29,600
Afterwards, Palace Leader Fei Yan rescued me out of the fire.

287
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,970
She never saves people out of pity.

288
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:37,570
One has to pay a price.

289
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,190
What price?

290
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,900
She took away a part of my lifespan.

291
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,310
Muddled my consciousness.

292
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:50,970
I became a crazy woman. But Lian'er...

293
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,410
My Lian'er...

294
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,830
I couldn't find my daughter.

295
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,770
I will never...

296
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,460
will never find her again.

297
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,950
When Lian'er and I needed you the most, where were you?

298
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,880
Our pain and suffering allowed you and that woman to successfully be together.

299
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,820
Yes, the person who wanted to kill me is your Royal Older Brother Zhangsun Jiong.

300
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,000
But the one who truly killed me is you!

301
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,300
I know.

302
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,030
I know that any explanation is useless anymore.

303
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,200
I won't inappropriately ask for your forgiveness.

304
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,910
But for the situations in the past, sometimes, I was left with no choice.

305
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,230
Of course you had a choice!

306
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:08,600
If from the start, you didn't have an affair with the Empress, all of these things wouldn't have happened!

307
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,930
It was you.

308
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,600
It was you who killed Lian'er.

309
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,610
It was you who created all of this mess!

310
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,910
I hate you! I hate you!

311
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:31,520
Hence, you allowed Zhangsun Jiong to use you to kill me?

312
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,170
Kill you?

313
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,000
Your life is worthless.

314
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,680
Zhangsun Jiong just wanted me to tell you a truth.

315
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,540
If I'm able to do it, he will tell me where Lian'er is.

316
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,720
No matter if what he said is true or not, I'm willing to give it a try.

317
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,950
I finally can go see my daughter.

318
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,040
What truth?

319
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,890
Zhangsun Wuji is your and Yuan Qingyi's biological son.

320
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,010
Is he crazy?

321
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,290
Wuji is the most outstanding among the descendants of the Zhangsun clan,

322
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,670
but he is that person's bloodline.

323
00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,590
As a ruler, I think highly of his talent, love him,

324
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,210
but as a man, I hate him.

325
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,420
He is after all not my son.

326
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,350
Every time he calls me Emperor Father,

327
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,880
my hatred towards him increases.

328
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,470
But Wuji is innocent!

329
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,530
No one is innocent!

330
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,320
As the descendant of the Zhangsun clan, even more he should understand

331
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,560
the principle of survival of the fittest.

332
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:37,500
A sin stained with blood can only be washed cleanly using more blood.

333
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,120
No one can escape it! No one—

334
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,000
Enough!

335
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:51,620
Other than forcing Zhangsun Jia to death,

336
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,180
what else do you want to do exactly?

337
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,100
Empress,

338
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,440
I have a medicine here that when a person takes it in, her consciousness will shatter and her liver and gallbladder will rupture.

339
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,130
- He will slowly die in pain.
- No...

340
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:15,680
No! You mustn't treat Wuji this way!

341
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,430
How should I treat the child that you and my younger brother gave birth to?

342
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,350
Don't... Your Majesty...

343
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:31,100
Of course, I won't let him die now.

344
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,590
He is the royal heir that I've chosen.

345
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,860
He must ascend to the throne of Megrez.

346
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,030
I want him to know that even with the supreme kind of honor and glory, one can't break the deadlock.

347
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,180
You and Empress had been having a secret affair for so many years.

348
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,200
Have you never thought that her son might be yours?

349
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,180
Impossible...

350
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,830
Impossible! Impossible! Totally impossible!

351
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,940
Zhangsun Jiong is really so patient.

352
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,060
He favored Crown Prince for so many years. Wasn't it to wait for this day,

353
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,160
wait for you to incite an uprising,

354
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,530
you and your biological son meeting with swords and spears, hurting each other?

355
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:32,900
Let that woman who betrayed him suffer this heart wrenching pain!

356
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:44,780
He? He used twenty years?

357
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,830
Are you are saying that he used twenty years to set up a trap?

358
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,600
When you become the supreme ruler, you severed your affection for all your six relations. (close family ties)

359
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:04,960
He... hated you so much.

360
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:35,430
[Virtue]

361
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,330
What do you plan to do now?

362
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,770
What else?

363
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,130
Fight.

364
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:16,070
You clearly know that he is your biological son.

365
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:19,490
You clearly know that this is Zhangsun Jiong's trap.

366
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,650
You still want to fight.

367
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,230
I have no choice.

368
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,300
Hence, just to continue living,

369
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,820
just for power and prestige, you're not even sparing your own son?

370
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,900
Right now, I am a traitor of Megrez in the Five Regions.

371
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,700
Anyone has the right to punish me.

372
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:09,300
If Wuji kills me, he'll be able to win the hearts of the people, the world.

373
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,700
Only if I die in the battlefield,

374
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,000
can Wuji's crown prince position be preserved,

375
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,200
can I give Zhangsun Jiong...

376
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,300
the last fatal blow.

377
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,800
I never had the wild ambition of usurping the throne.

378
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,800
All of these things today were a product of Royal Older Brother's pressuring.

379
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,600
Since I now know that Wuji is my son,

380
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,000
how can I treat him as my enemy?

381
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,700
For this path to the throne,

382
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,150
Wuji...

383
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:58,200
he must step on my corpse to climb up to it.

384
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,800
This imperial throne has always been stained by the blood of one's kin.

385
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,500
Wuji will not be an exception!

386
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,300
Is this...

387
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:22,700
the revenge of Zhangsun Jiong?

388
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:32,400
I'm going to make him endure pain and injury that's beyond the ordinary.

389
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,800
Oh, right.

390
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,600
You two are the most important people in this world for Wuji.

391
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,800
If one of you personally poisoned the other one,

392
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,300
how would Wuji deal with that?

393
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,900
Don't...

394
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,880
Your Majesty,

395
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,200
ever since, Wuji has treated you like his real father.

396
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,000
He respected, loved, and even cared for you.

397
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
From Deep Water to now, he has been cautious and careful.

398
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He dared to not be lax at any moment.

399
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,800
It was because he was afraid to disappoint you.

400
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:44,050
Because in his heart,

401
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,200
you are his most respected person.

402
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,400
Now... Now maybe because he wasn't of your bloodline,

403
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,600
can you really bear to treat him like this?

404
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,900
Wuji...

405
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,540
is a good child.

406
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,300
He never disappointed me.

407
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,600
But today,

408
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:25,700
just treat today as the last class I'm giving him about the principles of being a ruler.

409
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,300
Even if everyone will abandon him,

410
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:38,940
he still must continue moving forward alone with a heart that's as strong as iron.

411
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:54,780
After one incense time,

412
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,100
this place will be filled with poisonous mist.

413
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,200
I don't care if either one of you poison the other and leave this place,

414
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,170
or if you two both die in here.

415
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,700
I don't care. You two decide on your own.

416
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,440
My Wuji,

417
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:27,950
you will finally be able to experience the taste of extreme agony just like I do.

418
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:34,200
Your Majesty, don't! Don't...

419
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,400
Your Majesty.

420
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,350
Your Highness Crown Prince, Prince Virtue's rebel army has been surrounded.

421
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,200
He has no chance of winning.

422
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,900
Why are you still hesitating?

423
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,300
Prince.

424
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,290
Informing Prince, the time has come.

425
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:30,160
Crown Prince's army indeed entered our trap.

426
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm just waiting for your command.

427
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,700
Upon lighting the smoke signal, General Ma can then set out with his army.

428
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,370
Prince, chances come and go in an instant.

429
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,180
Please immediately give the order.

430
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,250
Forget it.

431
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,600
I'll personally face him.

432
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Prince.

433
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,570
Spread my order.

434
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,200
Tell Ma Wende to withdraw.

435
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,500
Prince, you must not!

436
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,200
If General Ma withdraws, we will surely lose this battle!

437
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,300
I have made my decision. Don't try to urge me anymore.

438
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,400
I'll bear the result of this battle...

439
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,800
by myself.

440
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,500
- Prince!
- Spread my command!

441
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,800
Yes.

442
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,900
Wait.

443
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,000
In the past, whenever you set out for war,

444
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,800
it had always been me who put on your armor and sword.

445
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,500
Today,

446
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:51,560
can you let me put it on you one more time?

447
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:11,300
Before, whenever you left, I would recite these words three times in my heart,

448
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:19,400
"Come back safely. Come back safely. Come back safely."

449
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,010
Every time, you would come back safely.

450
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,200
Being a married couple,

451
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,800
no matter what, it's a fate we've cultivated for thousands of years.

452
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:03,600
Too bad... we're both old now.

453
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,500
I wronged you.

454
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:20,060
From now on, our ties are severed.

455
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,400
You have your choice.

456
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,390
Life or death, rich or poor; all are destined.

457
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:26,600
You don't need to worry about anyone anymore.

458
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,700
Your Princess Virtue is already dead.

459
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:51,200
A'Rong,

460
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,300
I believe that our Lian'er is still alive.

461
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,240
You must find her.

462
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,070
No matter what, you must find her.

463
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,000
You two...

464
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,400
must live well.

♫ And continue dazzling in his heart ♫

481
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,400
♫ There is a saying that what a person asks for the lifetime ♫

482
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,700
♫ Is no more than staying together with one's lover by any means ♫

483
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,500
♫ If one can't obtain what one asks for ♫

♫ One is filled with anxiety and with knitted brows ♫

485
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,600
♫ There is a saying that if a person asks for the next lifetime  ♫

486
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:37,800
♫ One should only ask to know everything about warfare ♫

487
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,800
♫ Dreams beg heart to grant me love ♫

488
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,400
♫ And have someone's company for the rest of my life ♫

489
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,200
♫ Have someone's company ♫
